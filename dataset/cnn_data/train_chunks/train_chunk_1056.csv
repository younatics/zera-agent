"Neighbors and a bestselling children's author came to a 13-year-old boy's aid after the money he was raising to buy a dog was stolen from his lemonade stand. After months of begging his mother for a puppy, Spencer Bergman, from Loudoun County, Virginia, was told he could have a dog if he raised $500 to buy one himself. Enlisting the help of his 12-year-old friend, Spencer Tarbet, the two set up a lemonade stand. But as they were shutting up shop for the day, a shirtless man in his early 20s robbed them of their profits. Spencer Bergman, 13, was challenged by his mother to raise $500 to go towards buying a puppy, but money he had worked for on his lemonade stand was stolen from him . Neighbors and children's author Jeff Kinney rallied together to raise the cash Spencer needed, but in the end he was given a dog, called Coconut, by a friend . When Spencer Bergman called out after the thief, the man shouted back that he would beat them up if they told anyone. 'My heart stopped,' he told the Washington Post. 'We were bursting into tears.' As news of the robbery spread, the boys' neighbors and friends clubbed together to help the boys recoup their money. But their generosity was so great that Spencer was well on his way to reaching his target. He said: 'People would hand in a $20 and they would let us keep the change.' A local music shop owner even bought the boys a book - Diary of a Wimpy Kid - tucking $15 and a note inside, which said: 'Please don't lose faith in people.' The boys' story reached the author of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney, who Skyped Spencer and his friend, giving them a total of $150. The boys' story reached the bestselling book's author, Jeff Kinney, who Skyped the pair and sent them $150. Mr Kinney, whose book was turned into a film in 2010, said: 'My heart really went out to these kids. 'My junior high years were really tough — to leave the safe cocoon of elementary school and go into what felt like the Wild West. Everyone wants to respond by showing these kids the better side of humanity.' And just as Spencer was about to reach his $500 target, one of his neighbors decided to give him their dog, a Westie called Coconut. The money raised will now go towards helping Coconut get settled in to his new home, as well as a dog Halloween costume, the 13-year-old said.","Spencer Bergman, 13, was trying to raise $500 so he could buy a dog .

"A former gang member blew kisses to his friends and family members and declared 'I'm at peace' before he was  put to death Tuesday evening for the fatal shootings of three rivals 14 years ago in San Antonio. Miguel Paredes, 32, was convicted along with two other men in the September 2000 slayings of three people with ties to the Mexican Mafia. The victims' bodies were rolled up in a carpet, driven about 50 miles southwest, dumped and set on fire. A farmer investigating a grass fire found the remains. Miguel Paredes, 32, is seen here in a jail house interview earlier this month. The former gang member was executed Wednesday night for the murder of three people . As Paredes entered the execution chamber, he blew kisses to his supporters. 'To the victim's family, I want you to know that I hope you let go of all the hate because of my actions,' he said. 'The lion came here as a lamb.' Paredes was pronounced dead at 6.54pm CDT, 22 minutes after being injected with a lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital. The execution was delayed slightly to ensure the IV lines were functioning properly, said Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. The procedure calls for two working lines. Normally needles are placed in the crease of an inmate's arms near the elbows, but in Paredes' case, prison officials inserted IV lines into his hands. As the drugs began taking effect, he took several deep breaths while praying. He started to snore and eventually stopped. The execution was carried out after the US Supreme Court turned down a last-day appeal from attorneys who contended Paredes was mentally impaired and his previous lawyers were deficient for not investigating his mental history. His was the 10th lethal injection this year in Texas, the nation's most active death-penalty state (file photo) His was the 10th lethal injection this year in Texas, the nation's most active death-penalty state. One other Texas inmate is set to die in December and at least nine are scheduled for execution in early 2015, including four in January. Prosecutors said Paredes was the most aggressive shooter when Nelly Bravo and Shawn Michael Cain, both 23, and Adrian Torres, 27, showed up to collect drug money at the home of John Anthony Saenz, a leader in Paredes' gang. Defense attorneys argued that Paredes, who turned 18 six weeks before the slayings, grew up in a neighborhood where the only way to survive was to join a gang. No friends or relatives of the victims attended Paredes' execution. Cain's family said in a statement afterward that Cain was 'no longer with us for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.' 'Our family has waited 14 years for justice to finally be served,' the statement said. Paperwork carrying Saenz's name was found in the debris with the victims' bodies and helped police solve the case. Saenz, 32, claimed self-defense and avoided the death penalty when jurors sentenced him to life. The third man convicted in the killings, Greg Alvarado, 35, pleaded guilty and also is serving life in prison.","Miguel Paredes, 32, was convicted along with two other men in the September 2000 slayings of three people with ties to the Mexican Mafia .

"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has suspended the much-despised Gezi Park re-development. Turkish activists leading a sit-in were . considering the promise by Erdogan to let the courts and a . potential referendum decide the fate of the project - a plan that has sparked Turkey's biggest . protests in decades. Since May 31 when the protests began, five people have died and thousands have been injured. At an end? The protests over the Gezi Park development have been bloody, and now Prime Minister Erdogan has said he will abide with a court decision or referendum on the project . Sadness: A protestor cuts herself with a razor blade symbolizing victims of Gezi Park riots . The pledge was made during last-ditch negotiations . after Erdogan had issued what he called a 'final warning' to protesters. The two-week standoff has damaged . Erdogan's international reputation and led to repeated interventions by . riot police. After initially inflaming tensions by dubbing the . protesters 'terrorists,' the prime minister has moderated his stance in . closed-door talks in the last few days. Turkey's prime minister on Friday urged a small delegation of protesters to persuade hundreds of others occupying an Istanbul park to withdraw. Wait for the courts: Erdogan's stance appears to have softened after he initially gave the protestors their 'final chance' to leave the site . Erdogan told party members Friday that the protesters in the park had 'stayed long enough.' 'Go and speak to them ... Don't let us be forced into reverting to different measures,' Erdogan said he had told the protesters' representatives. Earlier in the day, Erdogan's ruling party announced that the government would suspend its plan to cut down trees in Gezi Park and install a replica Ottoman barracks until the courts could rule on its legality. And even if the courts sided with the government, a city referendum would be held to determine the plan's fate, officials said. It remained far from clear, however, whether the overtures would work. Erdogan has pledged to end the two-week protest but has also urged his supporters to rally in Ankara and Istanbul this weekend. Those demonstrations could raise tension between his conservative, Islamic base and the people occupying the park who are mostly - but not all - liberal- and secular-minded. As night fell today, a festive mood pervaded the park, and the crowd of thousands swelled. Many sang songs or snapped photos of makeshift barricades erected by protesters. The Taksim Solidarity group, two of whose members were in the meeting with Erdogan, has emerged as the most high-profile from the occupation that began last month. But it does not speak for all of the hundreds camping in the park, many of whom claim no affiliation to any group. Bilge Seckin, a member of the umbrella group, said discussions in the park about Erdogan's initiative were continuing, but she sensed 'the general feeling is that the people's requests were not addressed' during the talks with the prime minister. 'For instance on the police violence, there were requests that senior officials responsible be removed from duty,' she said, referring to the protesters demands. 'They (authorities) are saying that police officers are being investigated - which is not very satisfactory.' It was not clear when, or if, the protest groups would make a formal response to Erdogan's initiative. Never give up: Protestors sit at the Gezi Park site - five have been killed in the dispute so far . Time to move: Prime Minister Erdogan continues to appeal to the protesters to evacuate an Istanbul park . Many protesters were still seething at how a peaceful protest has been sometimes overtaken as riot police clashed with groups of stone- and firebomb-throwing youths. Such scenes prompted the European Parliament to condemn the heavy-handed response by Turkish police. A May 31 police raid to clear out the park ignited demonstrations that morphed into broader protests against what many see as the prime minister's increasingly authoritarian style of government. Erdogan's opponents have grown increasingly suspicious about what they call a gradual erosion of freedoms and secular Turkish values under his Islamic-rooted party's government. It has passed new restrictions on alcohol and attempted but dropped a plan to limit women's access to abortion. Mobilizing the courts and a referendum, however, could shield the prime minister from accusations of an authoritarian response. 'Until the courts give their final verdicts, no action will be taken regarding Gezi Park,' said Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, after the meeting. 'Even if the court ... is in favor of our government's decisions, our government will hold a referendum to see what our people think - what they want and don't want.' Still fighting: A demonstrator wearing a Guy Fawkes mask sits in front of a giant picture of the founder of modern Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and a Turkish flag at the entrance of Gezi Park . Opposition: An anti-government protester gestures in Istanbul's Taksim square over Erdogan and his Gezi Park plans . Tayfun Kahraman, one of the Taksim Solidarity members who attended the meeting, said he believed Erdogan had offered 'positive words,' and that fellow activists would consider them in a 'positive manner.' But he said those in Gezi Park would 'make their own assessments.' 'We are Gezi Park and we decide. No one has the luxury to decide on our behalf,' he said. Suspicion within the park about Erdogan's tactics and motives remains widespread. ""The prime minister calls the people he pleases to the meetings and says some stuff,"" said demonstrator Murat Tan. 'We don't care about them much. Today, we saved the trees here but our main goal is to save the people.' Analysts say the protests don't present a threat to Erdogan's tenure, but do threaten his legacy. Some say Erdogan would like to leave a mark on history, similar to that of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding father of modern Turkey. Erdogan himself sat in front of a portrait of Ataturk during the overnight talks at his residence in Ankara.","Prime Minister Recep Erdogan will let the courts and a referendum decide .

"These are the amazing images of a small otter trying to sleep while resting on the edge of the pacific ocean. The small mammal was simply 'too cute not to photograph' according to Sharon Landis, 68, from Washington state. Mrs Landis, who retired 13 years ago, took a few days off to photograph some wildlife near the coast of Washington in the Pacific north west. Sometimes life as a sea otter is too stressful and it is necessary to take time out from constant fishing and worrying about where the next meal is coming from . 'Dear Lord, please watch over me and keep me safe while I sleep on the edge of the deep wide ocean': Sea otters routinely sleep on their backs in the sea . Otterly Gorgeous: The sea otter spends most of its time in the ocean rarely coming ashore enjoying a wide range of sea delicacies from crabs to squid . Mrs Landis said: 'Otters spend their entire lives in the water. 'They spend most of their day resting, searching for food, or grooming their fur to keep it waterproof. 'I suspect we caught this one mostly resting. 'My favourite photo is where she's looking at the camera because it just looks like she's looking at me like ""what's up"". 'The sea otters are pretty social, so we generally see several together, this one just caught my eye. 'I encounter lots of wildlife up close and personal, this little one was especially adorable. They are just so cute. 'Otters are about 4-5ft long and can weigh from 50-100 pounds, with the males being larger. 'These were on the smaller side and female.' When Mrs Landis is not taking pictures of the wildlife that surrounds her house, she travels in her motorhome or jeep. She often sees otters whilst travelling north western America and recently returned from a trip to Alaska - where she saw even more of them. She said: 'We have also encountered these cute little guys along the coast in California and on our trip to Alaska this year. 'We have travelled all over the western US and I have thousands of photos of all kinds of wildlife.' Wh-otter looking at: Sea otters are the only otters to give birth in the water, nurse their young on their chests before teaching them how to swim and hunt . The sea otter is an aquatic member of the weasel family and is most common in the Pacific Ocean in the north American region as well as some parts of Asia . Animal experts have observed sea otters tangling themselves in forests of seaweed or kelp in order to prevent themselves getting washed away in a storm . Sea otters can grow up to four foot in length and weigh up to 65lbs in weight and have an average lifespan in the wild of around 23 years . Sea otters have specially adapted webbed feet and have water repellent fur which made them hugely valuable to hunters and trappers in the early 20th century . Sea otters can often be observed using their paws to crack the shells of crabs or mussels against rocks in order to get into the soft and tasty flesh inside . Sea otters always clean themselves after feeding in order to keep their coats clean as the fur traps a layer of air which keeps the animal warm in cold water .","The small female sea otter was observed in the pacific north west on the shoreline in Washington State .

"It was an embarrassing arrest that threatened to bring down George W. Bush's presidential campaign in 2000. The revelation that he had been caught drunk driving in 1976 was reported just days before Americans went to the ballot box - but it didn't stop him winning two terms in the White House. Now Australian tennis legend John Newcombe, who was with the the former president on the night he was pulled over, has revealed what really happened, and how the politician was a bit of a 'party boy' back then. The former Wimbledon champion described how Bush, then 30, took him to a local pub near their enormous family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was staying as a guest of  'close friend' and tennis fan George H. W. Bush, who was then director of the CIA. Scroll down for video . Claims: Former tennis player John Newcombe (left) says 'party boy' George Bush was trying to keep up with him at a pub near the politician's holiday home in Kennebunkport, Maine, on the night he was arrested for DUI . The sportsman, who was inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame on Friday evening, had not met the younger Bush, but as they were similar ages they decided to go out with Bush's younger sister and his father's press sectary Peter Roussol. During the evening Bush tried to 'keep pace' with Newcombe, then 32, while drinking 'reasonably-sized' mugs of beer and played a 'silent game' with him. Newcombe told Melborne radio station SEN: 'After about four of these, I picked the glass up in my teeth without my hands and skulled it straight down and I said, ""What are you made of, George?"" And so he had to do that.' As they staggered back to the car, Newcombe's wife Angie offered to drive but Bush insisted he was fine. 'We had about three miles to drive down this road along the sea and after about a mile he got pulled over,' Newcombe said.

"A photograph of China's new first lady which briefly appeared on Chinese cyberspace this week has revealed a darker side to Peng Liyuan. The picture shows Peng as a young woman in Beijing's Tiananmen . Square serenading martial-law soldiers following the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989. It comes as the 50-year-old wife of China's new leader, Xi Jinping, grabbed positive global headlines for her stylish appearance. Embarrassing: Screen shot shows a picture of Peng Liyuan - singing to troops following bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 - which briefly appeared on Chinese Internet this week . Militaristic: The 50-year-old wife of leader Xi Jinping is a major general in the People's Liberation Army . Hit: Peng remains a popular figure in China, despite the picture of her emerging on the internet . The image was swiftly scrubbed from China's Internet before it could generate discussion online, but not before being seen and shared by outside observers. It revived a memory the country's leadership prefers to suppress and shows one of the challenges of presenting Peng on the world stage as the softer side of China. The picture showed Peng in a green military . uniform, her windswept hair tied back in a ponytail as she sings to . helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows. It followed the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which shocked the world when Chinese troops with guns and tanks attacked students who had occupied the square for weeks. Softer side: Peng has grabbed global headlines following her appearance alongside her husband on recent trips to Russia and Africa . The picture contrasts with her appearances this week in trendy suits and . coiffed hair, waving to her . enthusiastic hosts while touring Russia and Africa with her husband. The photo has circulated mainly on . Twitter, which is blocked in China. The few posts on popular domestic . microblogs did not evade censors for long. Many young Chinese are unaware that . on June 3 and 4, 1989, military troops crushed weeks-long pro-democracy . demonstrations in Beijing with force, killing hundreds, possibly . thousands, of people. Those who do know about the assault . tend to be understanding of Peng's obligations as a member of a . performance troupe in the all-powerful People's Liberation Army. At the . time, her husband Xi was party chief of an eastern city. Peng, a major general in the People's Liberation Army and popular folk singer, has been in the military . since age 18 and has fronted TV music videos featuring dancing lines of . men with combat fatigues and weapons. She also starred in a song-and-dance . number in 2007 that has perky women in Tibetan garb sashaying behind her . while she sings an ode to the army that invaded Tibet in 1959. 'Who is . going to liberate us? It's the dear PLA!' go some of the lyrics. The . video has provoked severe criticism from Tibetan rights groups. Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at City University of Hong Kong, said: 'The photo probably has a negative . impact more so internationally than domestically.' Pro-democracy: A Chinese man blocks a line of tanks after Chinese forces crushed a pro democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square in 1989 . He said more . scrutiny of Peng is likely and such images could raise questions about . Xi's interest in reforms. Mr Cheng added: 'It has been several months now that . Xi Jinping has assumed the top leadership role and certainly, we have . found no indicator that he is interested in this stage to push serious . political reform.' Kelley Currie, a China human rights expert . for the pro-democracy Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia, was unsurprised by the image. She said: 'I think that we have a lot of people . hoping that because Xi Jinping walks around without a tie on and his . wife is a singer who travels with him on trips that maybe we're dealing . with a new kind of leader, but I think these images remind people that . this is the same party. 'It's using some new tools and new techniques, for the same purposes: to preserve its own power.' The lifespan of Peng's Tiananmen . image in the finicky world of the Chinese Internet has so far been . short, and she remains a beloved household name with huge domestic . popularity. The image is a snapshot of the back . cover of a 1989 issue of a publicly available military magazine, the PLA . Pictorial, according to Sun Li, a Chinese reporter who said he had . taken a photo of it on his cell phone several years ago when it was . inadvertently posted on his microblog. Popular singer: Peng Liyuan performs in 2009 at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing . Sun said he quickly deleted it . and had no idea how it resurfaced on the Internet years later. Microblog users can easily save . images and recirculate them even after the original posts have been . deleted. The picture spread further after it was tweeted by the . U.S.-based China Digital Times, which tracks Chinese online media. Chinese military . historian Warren Sun, of Monash University, Australia, said he had little doubt . about the authenticity of the image. He cited a 1992 academic report as stating that after the crackdown Peng performed a song titled 'The Most . Beloved People' in a salute to martial law troops. Under the spotlight: More scrutiny of Peng is likely as she takes on the new role of China's first lady .","Picture shows Peng Liyuan following Tiananmen Square Massacre .

"New York is the city that never sleeps, but it appears Brooklyn is the borough with the most night owls - not Manhattan. That’s according to a study of sleeping patterns across the U.S., which reveals what time different counties go to bed. By monitoring the patterns of more than a million people, detailed maps showing how long people sleep for have been created. The visualizations were created by Principal Data Scientist Dr Brian Wilt from San Francisco for Jawbone. While the average night's rest was below the recommended seven hours in every major U.S. city, New York reigns supreme when it comes to those burning the midnight oil. By borough, Brooklyn stays up the latest with those in Kings County going to bed around 12:07am every 'night'. Brooklyn is followed by Manhattan (11:55pm), Queens (11:52pm), the Bronx (11:47pm) and Staten Island (11:46pm). Scroll down for video . Meanwhile counties who went to bed the earliest include the islands of Kauai and Maui in Hawaii and Greenlee County in Arizona. The results were based on data from over one million wearers of Jawbone’s Up fitness tracker. Counties where there was not enough data were blended with nearby counties. The map also reveals how at the borders of different time zones sleep patterns are shaped by daylight. On the western extremes of time zones people go to bed later, presumably as they have more light until the sun sets. Eastern extremes of time zones, meanwhile, see people go to bed earlier for the opposite reason. Time makes a difference: The map revealed that those on the extreme western borders of time zones tend to go to bed earlier than those on the far eastern borders since daylight plays a role in circadian cycles . ‘Unbeknownst to us, our body’s circadian rhythms tune to sunlight hours, silently influencing you to go to bed when the sun goes down irrespective of the exact time,’ Jawbone reports. A separate map reveals how many hours of sleep different counties of the U.S. are getting. It shows that not many are getting eight hours a night, with many hovering around the seven-hour mark. Residents of New York got an average of 6.82 hours of sleep a night. People in Sawyer County, Wisonsin meanwhile managed to get 7.52 hours of sleep on average. They found that, in general, most city-dwellers didn't get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, while most suburban and rural counties were. Jawbone says they are planning to perform similar of sleep patterns in finer detail around the world. Up all night: Residents in Brooklyn, New York stay up later than most anyone else in the U.S., average a 12:07am bedtime every night.

"Parts of two huge steel bolts, the size of human arms, have broken off London's new Cheesegrater building forcing the skyscraper to be cordoned off while an investigation is carried out. Pieces of the one metre bolts became dislodged on the fifth and 19th floors of the 47-storey landmark structure - with one falling hundreds of feet to the ground. Developers British Land confirmed in a stock exchange announcement that two bolts have broken at 122 Leadenhall Street in the City of London but insist 'the building is fine'. Safety scare: Two bolts, thought to be around one metre in length, have have fallen from the Leadenhall building this week, nicknamed the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape . A spokesman for the real estate group said there is 'no risk to the structural integrity of the building' but admitted they have called an urgent investigation as 'public safety is our priority'. She added: 'No one was injured in either incident. An examination is being undertaken of the remaining bolts. 'An area has been cordoned off around the base of the building while this process is ongoing. The Building Control Department has been notified.' It is believed that one bolt broke off from the 19th floor earlier in the week but stayed within the building's structure without hitting the ground . It is believed that one bolt broke on the 19th floor earlier in the week but the portion that fell stayed within the building's structure without hitting the ground. Plans for the Leadenhall building were first proposed in 2001. The steel structure was completed this year and has earned the name the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape - designed to preserve the view of St. Paul's Cathedral. Owner/ Developer: British Land . Address: 122 Leadenhall Street, City of London . Nickname: The Cheesegrater . Construction period: 2001 - 2014 . Estimated cost: £286million . Floors: 48 . Height to tip: 224m . Occupied height: 203m . UK ranking: 4th tallest building in UK . Global ranking: 493rd tallest building in world . Office rental: £85 per sq ft to rent 41st floor . Floorspace: 908,730 sq ft . The second bolt piece plummeted from the fifth floor on Tuesday. Fortunately, it landed in an area already cordoned off for construction, but the entire pavement surrounding the skyscraper has now been sectioned off while safety checks are carried out. The building, nicknamed the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape, is due to open its offices next year and British Land insist the incident will not cause any delay. The company has announced that contractor Laing O'Rourke and structural engineers Arup are starting a full investigation and the rest of the building's bolts are being examined. Floorspace in the skyscraper, which was finally completed last month, is the most expensive in the City - with FM Global, the American insurance company, recently agreeing to pay £85 per sq ft to rent the 41st floor. Aon, the multinational insurer, signed a contract to be the main tenant of the tower in 2011. The Cheesegrater was designed by Lord Rogers of Riverside, who redeveloped Lloyd's of London, but construction had to be halted during the recession when the value of commercial properties fell. The building's sloping shape was calculated to allow a view of St Paul's from Fleet Street. The City of London Corporation, the area's local authority, declined to comment on the incident - claiming it was an issue for the developers.","Pieces of bolts fell from fifth and 19th floors of 47-storey landmark structure .

"Police are unable to ‘completely eliminate’ the possibility that Boris Berezovsky was murdered, it emerged yesterday. Officers said they found the exiled Russian oligarch lying on a bathroom floor with a ‘ligature’ around his neck and similar material tied to a shower rail above him. But although there was no evidence of a struggle they said the possibility someone else was involved in his death remained. The discovery of the body of the 67-year-old billionaire at a £20million Berkshire mansion has sparked an explosion of speculation around his death. Scroll down for video .

At the opening of an inquest, Detective Inspector Mark Bissell said specialist officers were still checking the large Ascot property for clues. He said the involvement of a third party ‘cannot be completely eliminated as tests remain outstanding’. Mr Berezovsky was referred to as Platon Elemin at the hearing in Windsor. He changed his name by deed poll after fleeing to Britain in 2000 and becoming a vocal critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Bissell added that Mr Berezovsky was last seen alive at approximately 9.05pm the night before by the same employee, believed to be a bodyguard. The scene of the death is currently under police control and the results of any tests carried out will take several weeks, Mr Bissell said.

"Car insurance fraud is common, but a suspected scammer in South Korea has taken things to a whole new level. Video has been posted online of a man throwing himself at a moving car and whacking his head against the windscreen - hard enough to shatter the glass - in an apparent bid to claim compensation from the driver. The video, taken on the 19th of September, begins with footage from a dashboard-mounted camera of a motorist making his way out of a car park, in what appears to be a run-of-the mill day.

A turn for the weird: The footage shows the pedestrian starting to sprint directly toward the car, setting off panic inside the car . When he reaches the car, he leaps onto the hood in a superhero-esque dive and bashes his head into the windscreen. The glass smashes and the man collapses onto the road. It appears the opportunist was attempting to get some sort of payout for his efforts, earning him the label of an ‘insurance scammer’ in the video description. The bizarre act was caught on a video camera mounted on the dashboard of the car. Insurance fraud is a growing problem in South Korea. According to a recent study from the Insurance Research Centre, an average of 156 people are caught in car insurance fraud schemes in South Korea every day, with the amount of money involved totalling KRW1.18 trillion (AU$1.8 billion) over the last five years. The use of dash cams is catching on around the world. Earlier this year, a dash cam captured a cyclist being mowed down on a motorway in Brisbane. In Russia,  dash cams vastly popular devices, so much so that having one installed directly lowers car insurance costs. In February, a multitude of dash cam clips of a meteor falling from the sky in Russia went viral, a testament to the popularity of the devices.

"When Billy Joel managed to persuade supermodel Christie Brinkley to come back to his New York apartment for the first time, he tried to act cool. Secretly, the teenager inside him was screaming 'Yes', but when he got to the building which overlooked Central Park, he was confronted with a problem part of him wished his friends could have seen. For as he opened the door, a 19-year-old Elle Macpherson was already stood there, waiting for him. A new biography by Fred Schruers reveals that Brinkley left the pair that night, but she ended up marrying The Piano Man in 1985, and would inspire his album 'An Innocent Man'. Scroll down for video . Billy Joel met supermodel Christie Brinkley (left) during a trip to St. Barts in 1983 following the split from his first wife Elizabeth Weber. However Elle Macpherson was also vying for his attention at the time . The first night Joel managed to bring Brinkley back to his New York apartment, a 19-year-old Elle Macpherson (pictured left in 1985 and right in 1990) was already waiting for him . The events that unfolded have been released as part of the serialization of a new biography by Fred Schruers. According to Page Six, it involves 100 hours of interviews before Joel decided against persuing the project. In 'Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography,' the singer lays bare his history of suicide attempts, his tumultuous marriages — including one to supermodel  Brinkley — and how he's now trying to keep his life together. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee travelled to the Caribbean island of St. Barts after he split with his first wife Elizabeth Weber in 1982. It was there, while playing in a piano bar, that he met Elle Macpherson, then just 19, and Christie Brinkley, 28. The pair were standing alongside him with the then undiscovered Whitney Houston. All of them at the time were trying to woo Joel for his attention. Inspiration: Weber inspired three singles, but Christie Brinkley, who Joel married in 1985 inspired all of An Innocent Man . Brinkley, who starred in Joel's music video for Uptown Girl, told Schurers that Whitney was telling him 'I can sing', while Macpherson 'draped herself on the piano like Michelle Pfeiffer [in The Fabulous Baker Boys].' When they returned to New York, Brinkley and Macpherson competed. Joel said that he 'felt like a teenager again' as he dated the pair at the same time. The first time Brinkley went home with Joel, the child inside him from Hicksville, Long Island was screaming 'Yes', but when he saw Mcpherson inside, the other side of said: 'Even as part of me thought, ""Oh, God, no,"" another part of me was going, ""If my friends could see me now."" ' Brinkley who didn't seem phased by the situation left, but she was the one Joel loved. They married in 1985, and they conceived their daughter, Alexa Ray, on their wedding night. Tops: Billy Joel, who has sold more than 150 million records worldwide, found his love life and career dogged by drinking and depression . Rough waters: Joel said in the book that he fell in love when he first met Elizabeth Weber, who cheated on her husband Jon Small, with Joel, before leaving both . Joel met his first wife, Elizabeth Weber, in 1970 and was smitten from the start. 'She wasn’t like a lot of the other girls I knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes,' he recounted. 'She was intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind, but could also be seductive.' Joel began a relationship with her, in spite of the fact that Weber was married to Jon Small, the drummer of Joel's short-lived duo Attila, with whom she had a young son named Sean. When Small uncovered the infidelity, Weber split, leaving both him and Joel. While her husband was left alone, it was Joel who took her disappearance the hardest. One day, Joel took a fatal dose of the anesthetic Nembutal and phoned Small to apologize. 'The next thing I remember, I woke up in the hospital and learned that they had pumped my stomach,' he told Schruers. It was Small who saved Joel's life, rushing to Joel's mother's Long Island home, finding Joel lying on the floor and getting him medical attention. Another suicide attempt ended with Joel checking into a mental health center, where he found himself surrounded by others who were not as lucky. Third time: Joel reportedly picked up Katie Lee in a hotel lobby when she was a college student, before the two married in 2004 . 'The people I was locked up with were never going to be able to overcome their problems, whereas mine were all self-made. I can fix this, I thought.' Weber returned, to Joel this time, not Small, and began to manage the songwriter's career, which began to take off even as he medicated his depression with a steady stream of alcohol. Though friends found Weber controlling and brusque, Joel was enchanted, writing singles such as 'She's Got A Way' and 'She’s Always a Woman' for her. Joel describes the relationship now as a transaction. He says when he debuted 'Just the Way You Are' for her on her birthday, she asked him deadpan 'Do I get the publishing, too?' The relationship entangled Weber's brother Frank in the finances as well, and years after she and Joel finally divorced, the songwriter found Frank had siphoned $30million out of his fortune. Striking: Joel said he took Lee to a performance of his own musical during one of their first dates, though she didn't know who the fading songwriting star was then . 'I hooked up with the Borgias!' said Joel. 'What a family to pick.' Shortly after things ended with Weber in 1982, Joel was vacationing and met his second wife during an unreal encounter on the Caribbean island of Saint Bart's. Brinkley was asked to star in the music video for Uptown Girl, leading to the pair growing closer together. In 1985, Brinkley and Joel married and he dedicated the album an 'An Innocent Man' to her, though the declaration proved to be questionable in later years of their relationship. Touring constantly to make up for his past financial struggles, Joel became worn down by a life on the road and strained the marriage. One night in 1993, after a concert at Nassau Coliseum, rather than go home to Brinkley, Joel booked a hotel. A band member told Brinkley that Joel was unfaithful that night, a claim Joel denies but one that led to his eventual split with her. 'Christie likes to joke that the end of the marriage spelled the end of my songwriting career,' Joel said, but it became a reality, as the next two decades saw him write and record very little. Instead, he drank and spiraled into depression. He had three car accidents between 2002 and 2004, which he once blamed on 911 and denied the involvement of alcohol. His romantic partner at the time was Katie Lee, who was in college when he flirted with her in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel. According to an interview in the New York Times, one of their first nights out was to Joel's own Broadway musical, Movin' Out. The two married in 2004, when Lee was 23 and Joel was 55, moving into a $4million penthouse in Tribeca together. While the relationship didn't spur Joel to new songwriting endeavors as it had with his past two wives, but it did eventually unravel just the same. Joel was in and out of rehab, but at Lee's insistence went back on tour, often playing shows with Elton John. Lee herself became a fixture in the art scene. One day Joel saw a photo of her dancing with another man at a gallery showing at Art Basel Miami, though she rebuffs any accusations of an affair. Joel could not handle his jealousy, and Lee seemed uninterested in couples counseling that he suggested. 'I realized, it’s not going to happen,' Joel said, and told her 'We’re over. Just don’t send me messages, don’t leave me cute little phone calls, don’t tease me, don’t f--- with me, just end it.' 'I’m an old man now, a vulnerable man. Don’t do that to an old guy.’ The pair divorced in 2009. It now seems the man once described by music critic Robert Christgau as a 'force of nature and bad taste' has cut back on his time in the spotlight. Though he released an album of classical compositions in 2001 and in spite of still touring arenas, Joel hasn't released studio music for a solid two decades. His drinking and depression have still not been resolved, at least according to the man himself, who in spite of numerous trips to rehab says he still has the occasional drink. He's somewhat humbled from his days of dating supermodels, and is living with a girlfriend, 33 and a former hedge fund manager, but he says he remains a romantic. 'You can have all the money in the world, you can have mansions, you can have properties, you can have yachts, you can have limousines, you can have motorcycles,' he told Schruers. If you don't have love, 'it doesn’t mean a goddamn thing.'","New biography reveals how supermodels were vying for Joel's affections .

"Teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on Facebook are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders . Teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on Facebook are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders, doctors have warned. It is not the overall time spent on the social network that is the problem, but the amount of time spent looking at pictures, they said. This includes looking at other people’s albums as well as posting selfies. The more they look at photos on Facebook, the more likely they are to think of themselves as too fat or as having the wrong body shape. That in turn leads to body image problems which can result in anorexia and other eating disorders, said researchers from the American University, Washington. They analysed the Facebook use of 103 adolescent girls along with their answers to a psychological questionnaire specifically designed to test their body image satisfaction. Little connection was found between the overall amount of time spent on the social media site and how they viewed their shape and size. But there was a correlation between spending a large proportion of that time looking photographs and body image problems. These include 'internalising' where young girls begin to see a very thin physique, rather than an athletic one for instance, as being the ideal shape for them. This leaves them dissatisfied with their own size and shape, even if they are healthy and fit, researchers wrote in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking. Researchers Evelyn Meier and James Gray reported: ‘It is not the total time spent on Facebook or the internet, but the amount of Facebook time allocated to photo activity that is associated with greater thin ideal internalisation, self-objectification, weight dissatisfaction, and drive for thinness.’ It is not the overall amount of time spent on the social network that is the problem, but the amount of time spent looking at pictures on the site . The problem is that, for many teenagers, Facebook has replaced traditional face to face conversations, said the researchers.

"David Cameron must shoulder some of the blame for Mark Reckless's defection, after falling out with him over the issue of Europe . During the run-up to last week’s Ukip conference, Nigel Farage was spotted going into an elegant Georgian townhouse close to a former site of the Bedlam hospital, one of the first British mental institutions, where the gentry used to amuse themselves by laughing at the inmates. Mark Reckless, a bespectacled 6ft 3in economist and barrister who became a Tory MP at the last election, arrived around the same time. It was in the privacy of the £2 million house that they plotted their own modern-day public spectacle: the humiliation of David Cameron on the eve of the Tory Party conference. The house is owned by Malcolm Pearson, who has a 12,000-acre estate in the west of Scotland, who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher shortly before she was bundled unceremoniously from office. As Lord Pearson of Rannoch he was always on the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party. It was his membership of the Lords EU select committee, from 1992 to 1996, which led him to become a leading exponent of the case for the UK to leave the EU. In 2004, in despair at the Tory stance on Europe, he recommended people voted Ukip in the European elections, and was swiftly punished by having the Tory whip removed. He joined Ukip three years later. He made good use of his time on the Ukip side, becoming firm friends with Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, and the first Tory MP in the current Parliament to defect to Ukip. Carswell is a close friend of Reckless. They often met for drinks at Pearson’s home as they toyed with the idea of joining Ukip. But while Carswell, an MP since 2005, is a popular figure on the Tory benches, the same is not true of Reckless, who is regarded as cold and aloof. Carswell is one of his few confidantes at Westminster. With the Clacton by-election looming on October 9, dozens of Tory MPs have discovered pressing alternative engagements when asked to go to the Essex seaside town to campaign against Carswell. But there is real anger among Tory MPs about Reckless, not least because he was lying about his intentions only hours before his bombshell announcement. So why did Reckless decide to jump? The truth is David Cameron has much to answer for. His sometimes casual attitude to party management has repeatedly alienated some MPs. If any of them criticise him privately or publicly, they can find themselves sent to the political equivalent of Siberia. In the run-up to last week's Ukip conference, Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless were spotted going into a £2million townhouse in London together . In the summer of 2013, Cameron led an away-day of Tory MPs in his Chipping Norton constituency in Oxfordshire. It was designed to foster team spirit and develop election-winning policies. Unfortunately, by the end of the gathering, the Prime Minister’s already fractious relationship with Mark Reckless had disintegrated. In a speech during that event, the PM stressed the importance of unity. Sarah Wollaston, the former GP who became MP for Totnes at the last election, interrupted to say her constituents admired her independent-minded stances on several issues. After the session ended, Cameron sought out Wollaston and said: ‘Well, Sarah, you have to understand that when you rebel you never change anything. You just make us look divided.’ Reckless, who was sitting next to Wollaston, intervened, reminding the PM the only reason Cameron cut Britain’s EU grant was because of a revolt in 2012 by Tory MPs. The PM snapped back, saying: ‘I would have cut that anyhow.’ A disagreement ensued, and Reckless’s draining ‘faith’ in the PM evaporated. In June this year, Reckless – who studied PPE at Oxford and was privately educated at Marlborough College – was the first MP to be called to speak at a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee of MPs which was addressed by Cameron. He challenged the Prime Minister over his promised renegotiation of powers from the EU ahead of a referendum in 2017 if the Tories win the General Election. Cameron is said to have been dismissive of Reckless, who concluded that the promised renegotiation was a PR stunt. The Ukip timebomb which had started ticking away the previous year was by then on a very short fuse. The first approach from Ukip to Reckless – a former economist who married Scottish solicitor Catriona Brown at Westminster Cathedral in 2011 – came from Stuart Wheeler, the spread-betting magnate who gave £5 million to the Tories in 2001 when they were committed to keeping the pound. Lord Pearson was a former Tory MP, but defected to Ukip in 2007. He also led the party for a short time . Wheeler was thrown out of the Tories in 2009 when he gave £100,000 to Ukip, which he subsequently joined. He entertained Reckless twice at Serafino – an Italian restaurant a short walk from Wheeler’s home. It was after the Wheeler lunches that Reckless got to know Farage much better. But the decisive factor in the defection of Reckless was Lord Pearson. The founder of a London-based insurance brokers, which he sold for millions in the 1990s, Pearson owns a moor, a deer forest, and a £4 million 12,000-acre country estate in Rannoch in the Highlands. He has a share portfolio worth a reputed £2.5 million. With his cut-glass accent, a legacy of his Eton education, Pearson, 72, looks and sounds like an archetypal Tory grandee. He became the leader of Ukip after Farage stood down to fight a parliamentary seat at the 2010 election. One of his first acts was to withdraw candidates in elections against four prominent Tory Eurosceptic MPs. He forced the policy through in the teeth of bitter opposition from within Ukip’s ranks. The candidates were Philip Davies, who was defending Shipley, which he won last time with a 10,000 majority, and Philip Hollobone in Kettering, which he held with a 9,000 majority. And the other two candidates? Step forward Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. Pearson also flooded their constituencies with 50,000 Ukip leaflets, urging votes to support the Tory candidates. All four enjoyed greater swings in their favour than in other constituencies. Given that two of the four Tories he backed at the last election have since defected, Pearson admits: ‘I always thought it was the right thing to do.’ And what about the other two, Davies and Hollobone? ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he says. Which is exactly what he said about Carswell and Reckless. How the Tories must regret the offer from Farage and Pearson to stand down every one of their candidates at the last general election if Mr Cameron would make an unequivocal declaration in favour of an EU referendum. Pearson made the offer in June 2009 to Lord Strathclyde, the then Tory leader in the House of Lords, who conveyed it to Cameron. The Tory leader rejected it out of hand. Given the events of the weekend, no wonder Tory MPs and strategists are terrified another Ukip defector is about to lob a political hand grenade into the Conservative conference hall.","Farage met Reckless before Ukip conference in house of Malcolm Pearson .

"The man with the mouth is just days away from a blockbuster night in the ring but has again been forced to explain himself over comments surrounding homosexuality. Boxer Anthony Mundine is shaping up for the fight of the year when he takes on undefeated Belarusian Sergey Rabchenko in Melbourne. He took some time out to speak with Weekend Sunrise presenter Andrew O'Keefe, inviting him into his home for a intimate one on one chat before his up coming bout. Scroll down for video . 'The Man' Anthony Mundine (pictured) explained himself in an interview with weekend Sunrise presenter Andrew O'Keefe over comments surrounding homosexuality . Anthony Mundine (pictured) is just days away with a blockbuster fight with undefeated Belarussian Sergey Rabchenko in Melbourne . While the controversial sportsman gushed about his similarities with all time legend boxer Muhummad Ali, saying they had the 'same characteristics', he was also quizzed about some remarks he made last year, claiming homosexuality and aboriginal culture do not mix. Following an episode of the ABC series 'Red Fern' Mundine made comments on his facebook page that the content was grossly inappropriate, which sparked some angry responses. He criticised the show for including a homosexual character that was representing Aboriginal culture, saying god made 'ADAM & EVE' not 'Adam & Steve'. Mr O'Keefe asked, ' do you still stand by your comments?' Mundine replied, '100 per cent. I told you I speak the truth, I got nothing against homosexuality, if you're gay, be gay, that's you're choice, that's your right in this day and age.' 'But don't exploit it on prime time when there's kids watching and having sons come towards you and going 'dad is that all right, for a man to kiss a man?' Anthony Mundine invited Weekend Sunrise presenter Andrew O'Keefe (pictured) into his home for an interview and told him, 'I got nothing against homosexuality, if you're gay, be gay, but don't exploit it on prime time when there's kids watching.' On homosexuality, Mundine (pictured) says it was not alright in his belief and culture because it is forbidden in aboriginal law . Mundine is focused on his up coming fight, to take on Sergey Rabchenko (pictured) Wednesday night, for the WBC silver light middleweight title . Re-iterating he has nothing against gay people, Mundine said it was not alright in his belief and culture because it is forbidden in aboriginal law. Asked whether aboriginal culture could evolve like a lot of other cultures and practises have now in Australia, Mundine replied no. 'Aboriginal law, it's an old culture, there is no changing this,' he told Mr O'Keefe. A spokesman for Mundine told Daily Mail Australia the boxer stands on what he says. 'He has a lot of homosexual friends, he's not against gay people but in his beliefs he doesn't support homosexuality,' he said. 'The media keep pushing it and he stands on what he says.' 'He deemed the episode was grossly inappropriate for the time frame and this issue just keeps coming up, going on and on and on.' But all his team are focused on are his up coming fight, to take on Rabchenko Wednesday night, for the WBC silver light middleweight title. Which if he wins will launch him into a bout with Floyd Mayweather or Mexican Saul Alvarez. 'I'm guna beat this 26 year old, 27 year old, whatever this young pup is and I'm going to prove that I am once again going to be here for another two to three years,' he told the Weekend Sunrise presenter.","Anthony Mundine explains over controversial homosexuality comments made last year .

"It may seem the perfect Halloween prank, but astronomers say they have spotted a mysterious 'eye' on Saturn. The giant eye appears to be looking directly at the Hubble space telescope, which captured the image. However, Nasa says that in fact the image shows a shadow over a storm. Lokking right back at you: On April 21, 2014, when Hubble was being used to monitor changes in Jupiter's immense Great Red Spot (GRS) storm, a shadow caused this 'eye' to appear. During the exposures, the shadow of the Jovian moon Ganymede swept across the center of the GRS.This gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000-mile-diameter 'eye.' A bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago. Now, astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of Saturn in the process. The giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on Earth they say - explaining why it never appears to move.

A bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago. Now, astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of Saturn in the process. The giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on Earth they say - explaining why it never appears to move. The unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding Saturn's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago. This bizarre six-sided storm churning Saturn’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago. The hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across - more than twice the diameter of Earth. Nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the Solar System. The Planetary Sciences Group has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and, establish its rotation period, and that of Saturn - the only planet in the Solar System whose rotation time remains unknown. Researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all, so concluded both are part of an extensive wave, deeply rooted in Saturn's atmosphere. The latest images gave the giant planet the uncanny appearance of having a pupil in the center of a 10,000-mile-diameter 'eye.' 'For a moment, Jupiter 'stared' back at Hubble like a one-eyed giant Cyclops,' Nasa said. The UPV/EHU researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a 'Rossby wave' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth. On our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings, associated with it, the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps. On Saturn, a hydrogen gas planet, ten times the size of the Earth, cold in its upper clouds, without a solid surface, and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean, 'the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet’s hidden atmosphere,' said Agustín Sánchez-Lavega, Head of the Planetary Sciences research group.","Giant eye appears to be looking directly at the Hubble space telescope, which captured the image .

"The growing number of MPs who fear Miliband is leading them to defeat have missed their chance to remove him . If Ukip pulls off an unlikely victory in tomorrow’s by-election in the Labour stronghold of Heywood & Middleton the clamour for Ed Miliband to be replaced as party leader will be deafening. Former ministers and senior backbenchers will take to the airwaves to demand the departure of Miliband, who is trailing David Cameron badly in the polls. But they will be whistling in the wind and Miliband knows it. Unlike the Tories, who ruthlessly dispatch leaders, as Margaret Thatcher found to her cost, the Labour Party is sentimental about failing leaders. Think Neil Kinnock and Michael Foot. The party’s rules state challengers must come forward before conference and be supported by 20 per cent of the Parliamentary Labour Party. So the growing number of Labour MPs who fear Miliband is leading them to defeat missed their moment. Conference was nearly two weeks ago. There is a bitter irony in their failure to wield the knife. They were hoping Miliband would deliver another game-changing conference speech. Last year, his promise to cap energy prices caught the Tories unaware and Labour surged in the polls. The policy, like so many of Miliband’s promises, soon unravelled. This time, he confounded expectations yet again, but for the wrong reasons. His Manchester speech was a catastrophe. His inexplicable omission of any mention of the deficit and immigration will haunt him until polling day. The small team around Miliband, which is weak and accident prone, was excluded from the crucial final drafting of the speech – arguably the most important of his leadership. Bizarrely, Miliband shut himself away for a week beforehand with Marc Stears, an Oxford academic, who is his closest friend. By turning his back on his few remaining loyal supporters at Westminster, Miliband cemented his growing political isolation. Over the past week, Labour donors and virtually all the party’s London mayoral hopefuls have joined the criticism of Miliband by denouncing his flagship mansion tax proposal. Margaret Hodge, the influential Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, who also disowned the policy, repeatedly refused to say she was confident Labour would win the next election when she spoke at a fringe event at the conference. As the noises off grow, there has been a conspicuous silence from Miliband’s so-called supporters, who clearly realise the game is up. Panic is gripping Miliband’s office. Preparations for the Rochester and Strood by-election, caused by the defection to Ukip of the Tory MP Mark Reckless, are in chaos. Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) is facing growing rumblings of discontent from within his own party, while Lord Mandelson (right) is training the party's next generation of rising stars . A well-sourced report by Mark Ferguson, editor of the grass-roots blog LabourList, said: ‘Senior Labour figures have sought to dampen expectations that Labour could win the seat. Don’t expect Labour to be throwing resources at the coming by-election.’ Lord Prescott, former deputy leader and Miliband loyalist, added to the ill ease when he wrote in the Sunday Mirror that Labour had given up on outright victory: ‘Ed Miliband might as well have said, “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition”.’ The crisis deepened with reports yesterday suggesting Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary, is being urged to stand as leader. And ominously for Miliband, the arch-Blairite Lord Mandelson is devoting his still considerable energies to grooming the next generation of rising stars. His preferred choice is Chuka Umunna, 35, the party’s business spokesman. Having got it wrong last time Labour MPs know they can’t afford another mistake. Some still cling to the forlorn hope that Miliband will do the right thing and resign. But Ed is ruthless, as his brother discovered, and he is staying put – to the huge relief of David Cameron.","Challengers to Miliband's party rule have missed their chance to remove him .

Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said the sentence given to Larna Watmough - who pleaded guilty to seriously assaulting a person over 60 last month - as 'manifestly inadequate'. Watmough and her 17-year-old co-accused Layni Cameron stirred national outrage in February when footage of the attack on Paul Buttigieg, 77, on a bus in the Gold Coast suburb of Kirra in Queensland went viral.

'You attacked a defenceless old man with impaired vision... you certainly must be proud of yourself,' he said. 'Your response to his comment can only be described as appalling. Mr Bleijie said Watmough's two-month suspended sentence for attacking Paul Buttigieg, 77, was 'manifestly inadequate' 'Your actions were deplorable. To say they were deplorable is an understatement.'

Onlookers yelled for the women to stop and 'leave the poor man alone', before another male passenger eventually stepped in and forced the offenders off the bus. The women had earlier been shown to yell obscenities at several passengers on the bus. The attack on Paul Buttigieg, 77, happened on a bus in the Gold Coast suburb of Kirra in Queensland . A video of Watmough and her co-accused of the Gold Coast bus attack went viral in February . Larna Watmough, who pleaded guilty for her part in the vicious assault on the 77-year-old man last month, was given a two-month prison sentence which was wholly suspended for 18 months at Southport Magistrates Court. Watmough presented a handwritten note to the court apologising to the man for the incident. The two-page letter told of her regret about the shocking attack which also saw her receive a 12-month probation for the public nuisance charge and ordered to pay $500 in compensation.

"Life lessons: Author Elizabeth Kesses wasn't confident growing up . The pressure of trying to achieve an unrealistic 'ideal body' is one that has long plagued girls through their teenage years and beyond. It's something author Elizabeth Kesses is familiar with having struggled with her own appearance and self confidence growing up in Athens and London. After graduating from Oxford and establishing a successful career in advertising, it's only now at the age of 40 she is finally feels more secure in her own skin. As a result, she has overhauled her life by moving to France and becoming a writer. She has written three self-esteem books for young girls called The Ugly Little Girl Trilogy and is supporting Body Confidence Week, which culminated in the Body Confident Awards at the House of Commons last night. Here, she reveals the six things she wishes she had known when she was a young girl struggling to make her way in the world... 1. If others say you're ugly, a loser, a swot... it's only because they are somehow threatened by you . I went to a bitchy girls school and I realise now when I talk to some of the girls in my year that they actually remembered me as the clever one who got to date the nice boys. But at the time, I believed any bad words that were said about me. Somehow their vision of me was more important than my own. I know now that everyone brings their stuff, their jealousies and insecurities - so take everything with a huge pinch of salt. 2. If you please others the whole time you'll never end up pleasing yourself . As a teenager, I chose to go to Oxford University in part for my parents. I loved it there but I felt constantly under pressure in such an academic environment. I then chose advertising as a career as I needed a proper job with money and status, so that others thought I was 'doing well'. Pressure to look good: Elizabeth advises young girls to focus more on their personality than their appearance . I married my boss because he was older, established and my friends/family would think he was a good catch. Deep down none of these decisions were right for me. I had no idea what I wanted, so I chose what everyone else wanted for me. In the end you'll rebel. I did at the age of 35. I'm now doing what I believe in - I write, I moved to France to be with my French husband and I chose not to have kids. None of these are particularly popular choices but they are who I am and that's more important. 3. Laughter lights up a room, not fake eyelashes and hair extensions . I used to obsess about being fat, ugly, short, frizzy-haired, and I thought everyone was horrified when I walked in a room. I couldn't flick through a teen mag without feeling inadequate. The pressure for girls today is even greater with websites dedicated to 'thinspiration', the obsession with image on social media and the relentless pursuit of perfection in the fashion world. Now I know that most people aren't looking at that one spot or unkempt eyebrow or thighs that touch. Most normal nice people don't care - they worry about what's on the inside. Feelings of inadequacy: Teens should talk to someone if they feel down . 4. If there is something you really want to do... then just do it . Never give up, if it's your true passion, your gift will happen. I loved ballet, I had the chance to do it professionally but reason prevailed and I focused on my academic studies. I'm sure it wasn't my vocation but denying myself the chance to explore it has left a pain, a form of nostalgia. Every time I go to see the Nutcracker at Christmas I get a twinge in my heart. I also loved writing as a little girl but the path to doing that seemed complicated and uncertain - yet now I'm a published author. 5. If someone's bullying you or if you're feeling down... talk to someone . I used to bottle up a lot of my feelings, pretending all was OK and I carried on smiling so I didn't disappoint or worry anyone. Having been through therapy I appreciate the well worn phrase 'a problem shared is a problem halved'. Issue needs to be taken seriously: More should be done to help young people with low confidence . 6. Low self-esteem IS a serious issue . From the age of ten to about fifteen I went through a gawky stage. Like most other teens, I believed I was so much uglier, so much geekier than everyone else. It made feel very alone and miserable. I suffered from lack of self esteem in my late teens becoming anorexic and I still struggle with bouts of low confidence. It's time for the nation to take seriously the issue of low self-esteem as it is one of the biggest threats to a woman's well-being. It is time confidence-building and self-belief were formally incorporated as part of the school curriculum, that media changed the beauty conversation and that girls are given every chance in the world to be happy. I'm glad this is now being addressed with the launch of Body Confidence Week. Education in schools and colleges Winner: The Self Esteem Team . The Self Esteem Team has worked with about 40,000 teenagers, both boys and girls, as well as parents and teachers delivering tailored body confidence lessons focused on self-esteem and good mental health.

"Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill is confident No 2 Roy Keane will benefit from his joint role as Aston Villa's assistant manager. O'Neill has revealed he spoke to Villa manager Paul Lambert about the demands the position would make on Keane's time before sanctioning the move, which will see the former Manchester United captain combine the two jobs. 'My view is if it doesn't impinge on the job here with Ireland, then in actual fact it will end up being good for him,' O'Neill said. Dual role: Roy Keane is working under Paul Lambert at Villa and Martin O'Neill at international level . 'I know that if we couldn't have made it work, he wouldn't have taken the job in the first place. 'If his commitments to us - both on the commercial side and certainly from my viewpoint in terms of the time working with players - is not impinged at all, then I'm happy for it to go ahead, genuinely happy.

'Villa have agreed to give him all that time with us and therefore I don't really have a problem with it. I spoke with Paul to see how he felt it was going to work,' he told the Irish Independent. 'He said that he gives the players, the senior players who are not involved at international level, a lot of time off anyway during that time [international breaks] and even if they did come back for a day or two, they could cope with that.'

"One of David Cameron’s only ally in his battle over handing out Brussels top jobs has announced he wants to abandon liberal democracy. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was the only other EU leader to back Mr Cameron in trying to block Jean-Claude Junker from becoming European Commission President. But he has stunned opposition groups in Hungary after declaring he wants to ‘build an illiberal new state’ like Russia, China and Turkey. David Cameron was only joined by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (left) in his battle against handing out EU jobs in a vote last month . Mr Cameron went into battle with the rest of the EU last month over the decision to hand the top Brussels job to Mr Juncker. He warned the move would mark a ‘sad moment’ which the EU would ‘live to regret’. After insisting on pushing the decision to a vote in Brussels, Mr Cameron was left isolated – with the exception of Mr Orban. But this could be an alliance Mr Cameron will seek to play down. In a speech retreat of ethnic Hungarian leaders in Baile Tusnad, Romania, Mr Orban said claimed the 2008 global financial crash was proof ‘liberal democratic states can’t remain globally competitive’, Bloomberg reported. He added: ‘I don’t think that our European Union membership precludes us from building an illiberal new state based on national foundations. He pointed to Singapore, China and Russia as ‘successful’ role models, adding: ‘We want to build a workfare society ... which is willing to bear the odium to declare that it is not liberal in character.’ Since his election in 2010, Mr Orban has courted controversy by centralising executive power, weakening democratic checks and balances and increasing the role of the state. He added: ‘The Hungarian nation is not a mere pile of individuals but a community which needs to be organized, strengthened and built.’ After losing the vote and warning the EU could come to regret it, Mr Cameron was pictured doing an awkward high-five with Mr Juncker . Mr Orban claimed that his attempts to reform Hungary were being held back by conflicts with the EU and by 'paid political activists' in civic groups financed from abroad. Paul Ivan, an analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, said: ‘Orban’s comments are very controversial and closer to what we’re used to hearing from President Putin of Russia than from a leader of a European democracy. ‘It’s also an extremely bad moment to cite Russia and Turkey as examples, with Russia becoming much more imperialistic and nationalistic and with serious attacks on the freedom of speech in Turkey.’ And Viktor Szigetvari, co-chairman of the E14-PM opposition alliance, warned of the 'constantly deteriorating quality of Hungarian democracy’. 'Serious and active means are needed to put an end to the demolition of Hungarian democracy,' Mr Szigetvari said.","Hungarian PM names Russia, China and Turkey as 'successful' nations .

"An Alaska couple knocked on the door of their son's long-time girlfriend Thursday, intending to inform her that he'd been killed in a car accident. Karen and Jay Priest instead were stunned when the son, 29-year-old Justin Priest, answered the door. They had mistakenly been told by Juneau police that he'd been killed in the crash. Karen Priest said her husband started sobbing, and she was in shock. Alive: Justin Priest holds his 9-week-old yellow lab Lily in Anchorage on Thursday after police ,istakenly told his parents he'd died in a car crash . Apologized: Juneau police chief BRyce Johnson has apologized for the anguish the mistake caused and are reviewing audio tapes and other records to find out what went wrong . 'There are no words,'she said on Friday, still wrung out from what she called an emotional roller coaster. 'We just kept staring at him.' Justin Priest said he'd gotten up to let out his 9-week-old puppy Lily and was near the door at 5:30 a.m. when his parents and brother knocked. They started screaming when he opened the door. The Priests live outside of Palmer. At 3 a.m. Thursday, they were awakened by their barking dogs and a knock on the door. Through a window, Jay saw a man with the drill sergeant hat of an Alaska State Trooper. 'He knew right away, the dread. It's not good when a trooper knocks on your door at three o'clock in the morning,' Karen Priest said. The trooper informed them that Justin, a private fisheries biologist in Anchorage, had died in Juneau. The trooper gave them a Juneau police phone number. When the couple called there, an officer said Justin's car had crashed into a tree at high speed. Blessed: Karen Priest feels lucky that her son is alive and also offered condolences to the family whose son really died in the car crash . Happy Couple: Julia and Justin Priest have been dating for five years and when Justin's parents went to visit Julia's house to tell her the bad news it was Justin who answered the door . That didn't sound like Justin, Karen said. The officer said they investigation was ongoing, which to her implied alcohol use, and that didn't sound right either, she said. They started calling out-of-state relatives. The Priests dressed and drove 45 miles to Anchorage to tell another son, Cody. Awakened at 4:30 a.m., Cody collapsed when he heard the news, Karen said. The parents and Cody drove to find Justin's long-time girlfriend, Julia, so she could hear the news in person. Jay knocked on the door. 'It opens and right here is Justin. I don't even see it but Jay is sobbing. It doesn't compute to me. Then I see him,' she said. 'You want it to be true, but you go, 'Am I hallucinating?' Justin didn't know what was going on."" 'I didn't know why they were yelling and screaming,' Justin Priest said. 'I was mostly asleep. They were yelling, 'Praise Jesus! It's a miracle!' 'I was shocked and astonished and had to keep grabbing him and hugging him,' Jay told Alaska Dispatch News.The saddest day became the happiest. 'I never cried so much in all my life.' It took a few minutes to sort out what happened. Justin initially thought his parents were the victims of a scam. After 'lots of hugging, lots of tears,' he called Juneau police to tell them they had identified the wrong Justin Priest. Juneau police have apologized for the anguish the mistake caused and are reviewing audio tapes and other records to find out what went wrong. It turned out that the real accident victim had the same name, but he was a different age with a different birthdate and middle name . 'I'm almost speechless for words,'Chief Bryce Johnson said. 'This shouldn't happen.'Police wanted troopers to contact the Priest family to find out if the crash victim was their son. The request was unclearly transmitted or misinterpreted, Johnson said, and the officer took the assignment as a death notification. 'We have to take responsibility for that,' Johnson said.'It was our case.'","Karen and Jay Priest instead were stunned when the son, 29-year-old Justin Priest, answered the door after being told he died in a car crash .

"Aston Villa have confirmed the signing of former Fulham wide man Kieran Richardson.

Richardson has won eight senior England caps, scoring two goals, with his last appearance for his country coming in 2006.

Owner Randy Lerner has made it clear to Lambert there will be little funds for new signings in this transfer window. And the acquisition of the former England midfielder is seen as an astute piece of business due to his versatility that allows him to play left-back, midfield and in an attacking role. Fulham are still dealing with the financial ramifications of their relegation from the Premier League and will let the former Black Cat midfielder leave for a modest fee. The news of Richardson’s likely switch to Villa Park will come as a blow to West Brom where he is still fondly remembered after playing an integral role in helping retaining their Premier League status in 2005.

"Paul Clement, the English coach that helped Real Madrid win La Decima,  has admitted he wants to become a manager.

"Aston Villa are close to signing Swansea City midfielder Ki Sung-yueng for a fee approaching £6million. Paul Lambert is determined to strengthen his squad and the purchase of the South Korea international would be the club’s first significant outlay of the summer.

"Amazon’s new Kindle Fire tablet device that started shipping this week is reportedly selling for almost three dollars less than it costs to manufacture. The online retailer is initially selling the tablet at a loss that it hopes to cover through sales of books and films for the device, research suggests.

Amazon's Kindle Fire: The online retailer is initially selling the tablet at a loss that it hopes to cover through sales of books and films for the device .

But he added that as a retail company, Amazon was willing to live with a smaller margin than most electronics companies would. ‘We want the hardware device to be profitable and the content to be profitable,' he said. 'We really don't want to subsidise one with the other.' Impressive: The Kindle Fire costs $201.70 to make, research firm IHS said, but it has attracted a warm industry reception for being priced at only $199 . IHS's estimate includes the cost of components and assembly, but not the costs of development, marketing or packaging. ‘We want the hardware device to be profitable and the content to be profitable. We really don't want to subsidise one with the other' Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos . The most expensive part of the Kindle Fire is the seven-inch colour touch screen, which costs $87. Amazon kept the cost of the tablet low compared to Apple’ s iPad and similar tablets by making it smaller. The screen is half the size of that for the iPad, the amount of memory is low and it does not have a camera or microphone. But the difference in manufacturing cost is much smaller than retail price. Margins: Jeff Bezos said Amazon's goal was to make a small profit from the hardware but it is happy with a smaller margin than most other electronic firms . IHS estimates the cost of the basic iPad 2 model at just under $300, while Apple sells it for $499. The Kindle Fire measures 7.5"" x 4.7"" x 0.45"", weighs 14.6 oz, has 8GB storage and holds a battery life of eight hours. Amazon’s basic Kindle is used for eBooks but the Kindle Fire will combine this with the ability to play music, films and games and surf the internet. Users will be able to access more than 18 million films, television shows, songs, apps, games, books and magazines via the Amazon website.","Amazon's answer to iPads started shipping this week .

"Sheryl Sandberg is now the lead character in a graphic novel. The Facebook COO was hailed as an inspiration when she published Lean In, her call to arms for women to realize their full potential. And her words were so inspiring, it seems, that they warranted an entire fantasy series titled Female Force: Sheryl Sandberg. Scroll down for video . Star: Sheryl Sandberg is the title character in a 32-page comic about her life from birth to reaching Facebook . Female force: It borrows heavily from the Facebook COO's book Lean In, calling on women to push themselves . The 32-page biography, available on iTunes for $3.99, serves as a short account of her life as an author and businesswoman, documenting 'her family, her education, the formation of her belief system, and her personal and professional successes make up her story'. It is the latest in the Female Force series produced by Bluewater Productions, following artistic depictions of a number of successful women including Michelle Obama, Mother Teresa and Hillary Clinton. Mark Zuckerberg is yet to star in a comic. Sandberg reportedly did not know about the biography until recently, according to Re/Code. It opens in Harvard in 1987, where she graduated in 1991 top in her class for economics. The reader is taken through her career and personal life, including the pivotal moment when Mark Zuckerberg offered her a job. 'If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat, just get on,' the two-dimensional Sandberg explains, 'I leaned in further'. The moment she landed her job: This is the scene depicting Mark Zuckerberg's job offer to Sandberg . Intelligence: The writer describes the heroine of the graphic novel as having 'intelligence' as a super power . Writer Michael L. Frizell and artist Angel Bernuy borrowed heavily from Sandberg's book Lean In, and quote speeches she has made. A fiery scene between Sandberg and Zuckerberg uses words from a speech she made on 60 Minutes last year: . 'Women hurt themselves by leaning back. They say, 'I'm busy,' or, 'I want to have a child one day. I couldn't possibly take on any more. 'I've never heard a man say that.' Notable scenes include Sandberg's speech warning that women have a tendency to 'lean back' and men don't . Frizell told CNET: 'The comic will appeal to those interested in the lives of real people. 'Sandberg doesn't need a cape and tights to make a difference. Her superpower is intelligence backed by innovation. She's a leader.' Darren G. Davis, president of Bluewater Productions said: 'Our goal is to show the behind-the scenes machinations - many of them ignored by the mainstream media - that resulted in Sheryl Sandberg becoming a leading voice in empowering successful businesswomen.'","Female Force: Sheryl Sandberg is 32-page biography of the 45-year-old .

"It's the eerie backdrop of one of Australia's most fabled sites. Hanging Rock outside of Melbourne was made famous from Peter Weir's film Picnic At Hanging Rock where the disappearance of several school girls and their teacher shrouded the area in mystery. Now the 1900s-based story has helped inspire architect Kerstin Thompson's award-winning House at Hanging Rock in the Mace­don Ranges. It was the eerie backdrop of Peter Weir's film Picnic At Hanging Rock, but now it's helped inspire architect Kerstin Thompson's award-winning House at Hanging Rock in central Victoria .

"The third American aid worker who contracted Ebola in Africa was released Thursday from a Nebraska hospital. An elated Dr. Rick Sacra said at a news conference that he was cleared of the Ebola virus by the federal Centers from Disease Control and left the isolation unit at the Nebraska Medical Center on Thursday morning. 'I feel great, except that I am extremely weak,' Sacra said. Scroll down for video . Nightmare over: Former Ebola patient Dr. Richard Sacra participates in a news conference at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska on Thursday . Round of applause: The 51-year-old Massachusetts native says it's likely he'll return to Liberia at some point in the future to work again . The 51-year-old doctor from Worcester, Massachusetts, may return to Africa someday to help, but he said he expects a long recovery ahead based on what his friend and fellow Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly said. 'I never felt like I was not going to make it. The care was so excellent, so speedy and so prompt,' said Sacra, who contracted Ebola while delivering babies at a hospital in Liberia with the North Carolina-based charity SIM and arrived in Omaha on September 5. He is also a faculty member at the University Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. The World Health Organization says the Ebola virus is believed to have killed more than 2,900 people in West Africa. Governments are scrambling to contain the disease outbreak, and the United States has promised to send 3,000 soldiers to the region to help. Together again: Dr Sacra's wife of 29 years Debbie, and their three sons, also attended the Thursday press conference . Hands up: Dr Sacra contracted the disease while working for a missionary group in Liberia . 'Though my crisis has reached a successful end here, unfortunately the Ebola crisis continues to spin out of control in West Africa,' Sacra said. Sacra has worked in Liberia for much of his career, living there between 1995 and 2010. He said he considers it his second home and the 'odds I'll end up back (in Liberia) are pretty high.' Debbie Sacra spent most of the news conference watching her husband of 29 years instead of the room full of reporters and hospital workers. Their three sons also attended. The two shared their first hug in nearly two months Thursday morning. 'I think this is the longest we’ve been apart in 29 years of marriage,' she said. Two other American aid workers who contracted Ebola — including Brantly — were treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, and were released after recovering. A fourth American with Ebola is still being treated in Atlanta. Home: Sacra helped delivered babies in Liberia, where he lived permanently from 1995 to 2010 . Recovering: This Saturday, September 20, 2014 photo provided show Dr Sacra speaking to his wife Debbie on a video call  as he watches the Nebraska NCAA college football game against Miami . Passing the time: Sacra's wife is seen reading to him from the Bible during his stay in the Nebraska hospital . Dr. Phil Smith has said Sacra received an experimental Tekmira Pharmaceuticals drug called TKM-Ebola for a week after he arrived in Omaha. Sacra also received two blood transfusions from Brantly. These blood transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the Ebola virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease. Sacra also received supportive care including IV fluids and aggressive electrolyte management, and his own immune system fought the virus. Doctors have said that the combination of treatments Sacra received makes it difficult to know what helped him fight off Ebola.","Dr Frank Sacra was released from the Nebraska Medical Center on Thursday after clearing two separate blood tests for Ebola .

"'Absolutely amazed': The Duchess of Argyll with the Victorian tiara which was sold by Glasgow Airport after she lost it there six years ago . The Duchess of Argyll has voiced her 'disbelief' after learning that £100,000 of jewellery she lost at Glasgow Airport six years ago had been sold on by bosses there for a fraction of its value. The 68-year-old misplaced four items, including a Victorian diamond tiara, in a bag when she returned from London to Inveraray Castle. But when they were found by the British Airports Authority (BAA), they did not inform the police and simply sold them to a diamond merchant for just £5,000. The proceeds were given to charity as was standard procedure for property unclaimed within three months. In the meantime, the Duchess had reported the incident to the police and the Art Loss Register (ALR), which listed it on its database of stolen antiques, but it didn't unearth any leads. It was only earlier this year when she finally realised what had happened after spotting one of the pieces - a Cartier brooch in a catalogue of Scottish auction Lyon & Turnbull (L&T). The find was investigated by ALR's lawyer, Christopher Marinello, who discovered that the jewellery had actually resurfaced just months after it was lost and was sold for less than £5,000. Mr Marinello said: 'Apparently, the airport found the jewels or they were turned in to 'lost and found' by someone... The question remains: what did they do to help find the owner? 'They didn't call the police even though the airport police had a record of the theft. 'They didn't call ALR. The only thing they did was sell them.' Trying to make amends: The operators of Glasgow Airport has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her, although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing . He established the brooch was consigned to L&T by someone who bought it in good faith from the diamond merchant. The Duchess said: 'I'm absolutely amazed. I thought that after six years I'd lost them forever. 'The tiara was a Victorian family one and the necklace was given to me for my 21st birthday. So everything was very special.' The BAA has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her, although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing. The Airport Authority says they no longer have records relating to the incident, but a spokesman said they would rethink their procedures as a result of the case. Gavin Strang, L&T director, said he was 'delighted' that the jewellery was being returned to its 'rightful owner'.","Duchess, 68, lost items, including Victorian tiara, six years ago .

"A former star pupil at one of the country’s leading state grammars faced a backlash yesterday after claiming the school is rife with racism, sexism and homophobia. Matt Broomfield, who is now studying English at Oxford, claimed pupils at Adams’ Grammar in Newport, Shropshire, made monkey noises at him when he dated a black girl. In an extraordinary online post, he also said a culture of ‘superiority’ was drilled into pupils and that girls were treated as having ‘secondary value’ and were regularly ‘groped, bullied and harassed’. As well as bringing him academic success, he said the school ‘taught him to hate’. But his scathing remarks prompted a backlash among pupils and alumni who challenged his view of the 358-year-old school, which is all-boys until the sixth-form and allows some pupils to board for £10,230 a year. Supporters of the school included old boy and Blue Peter presenter Radzi Chinyanganya who said he ‘only had positive things to say’ about his time there. Comments posted online described the claims as ‘exaggerated’ or accused Mr Broomfield, who achieved the school’s highest GCSE results with 11 A*s in 2010, of blaming the school for the ‘pathetic opinions he held as a teenager’. The school itself has refuted the claims and said it was ‘saddened’ by the article, written for online student newspaper the Tab. I dated a black girl when I was 17. When my school friends found out, some of them laughed openly in my face… They made monkey noises . When one of the three black guys in my year walked into a room, people would sometimes hide their possessions as a joke, because ‘all ******s are thieves’ If [a friend who has since come out as gay] had gone public with this information at school, he would have been laughed at and ostracised. At Adams’, they were a source of derision and disgust . Girls were generally treated as objects, to be called ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ and ‘stupid’. They were of secondary value . Adams’ drilled into us that the strong were always superior to the weak . The post appears to have divided opinion, with some ex-pupils backing elements of Mr Broomfield’s assertions about the school’s culture. Former pupil Mr Chinyanganya said: ‘I was at the school for seven years and it was the best seven years of my life – and I only have positive things to say about the school.’ However, Billy McClure, also a former pupil, said he took the article ‘as a personal attack on me, my friends and the best seven years of my life.' He said he could ‘wholeheartedly say I never once saw an act of homophobia or racism.' But he added: ‘First off, the school does have a problem with lad culture. Looking back, my participation doesn’t fill me with much pride. At times I was more concerned with binge drinking, showing off and objectifying women than I was about my grades. ‘I’m also ashamed to admit that we were undeniably sexist. This isn’t just an Adams or a grammar school problem but a nationwide issue. A lot of our teachers were women and they certainly didn’t approve of chauvinistic behaviour.’ In response to the article the school, which has more than 860 pupils, said in a statement: ‘We disagree wholeheartedly with the view that Adams’ supports racism, sexism and homophobia. ‘In fact, precisely the opposite is the case: we make every effort to educate our pupils to be tolerant and respectful of diversity, and to counter prejudices that are, sadly, still all too common in the world outside school.’","Matt Broomfield gained 11 A*s at Adams' Grammar in Newport, Shropshire .

"Residents in one of Britain’s most exclusive seaside retreats have declared war on wealthy city dwellers who buy second homes in their town. St Ives in Cornwall has been dubbed Kensington-on-Sea because so many rich Londoners flock there every summer. Now locals have called for all future new-build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only. Picturesque: St Ives (pictured) in Cornwall has been dubbed Kensington-on-Sea because so many rich Londoners flock there every summer . They would also like half of new-builds to be affordable housing, rather than luxury beachside properties designed as investments. The proposal is contained in a draft version of the St Ives neighbourhood development plan, which could be voted into local planning regulations next year. Locals claim they cannot buy homes in their own community because outsiders have swamped the market and sent prices rocketing. As many as one in four homes in St Ives are believed to be used as holiday homes. The Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, North Wales and Norfolk have encountered similar problems. Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives, supported the plans, although it was unclear if or how they could be implemented. He said there were so few permanent residents in some villages that schools had been forced to close, while village halls and shops struggled to stay afloat. He added: ‘Without a doubt, high numbers of second homes do have a detrimental impact on the opportunities for local families to buy. My last survey of estate agents in St Ives showed six times as many houses were sold to second home buyers as they were to first-time buyers.’ Locals in St Ives (pictured) have called for all future new-build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only . Mr George has long campaigned for a law which would require people to seek permission from the council to use a home as a second residence ‘in the same way as if they wanted to turn a building into a shop or a factory’. According to Nationwide, the average home in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly is £215,000, compared with the UK average of £189,000. In St Ives, it rises to in excess of £300,000, £100,000 above the national average. The St Ives proposals could inspire other towns to follow suit. Sir Andrew Motion, head of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, has previously called for ‘townies’ buying second homes in the countryside to face harsher taxes. Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Trying to impose state bans on who can own property is totally inappropriate. Trying to control private ownership via the planning system will ultimately require intrusive state inspectors to monitor the usage of every home.’ Meanwhile, the number of young people owning their own home will almost halve in the next five years, a report has found. Estate agents Savills found the number of under- 35s who own a house will plummet from 1.2million to 690,000 by the end of 2019.","St Ives dubbed Kensington-on-Sea because of summer influx of Londoners .

"A jeweller has been left empty-handed after he unknowingly accepted £4.7million in Monopoly money from two conmen in a sale of four 'rare' rings and a necklace. The Greek man is said to have been conned by the men, who claimed to be French, after they contacted him to buy the antique pieces of jewellery. In a bid to avoid paying tax on the sale of the jewellery, it is alleged the seller planned to meet the pair in Paris, France, to carry out the exchange. The Greek seller is said to have been conned by the buyers, who claimed to be French, after they handed him a suitcase containing £4.7million in Monopoly money in exchange for four 'rare' rings and a necklace in Paris . The 'French' buyers arrived at the meet point on Rue des Mathurins with a suitcase filled with £4.7million in fake cash, Le Parisien reported. The Greek seller is then reported to have taken one of the wads of cash – totalling nearly £400 – to a currency exchange store to confirm its authenticity. After supposedly being happy the money was legitimate, he then returned to the two buyers and concluded the sale.

"The idea of free-falling off a 100m cliff would be a petrifying thought for most of us. But not for French tourist and avid climber Vladimir Lennert, who was excited at the prospect of swinging off the famous Hanging Rock in Blue Mountains National Park, 50 km west of Sydney. The 21-year-old was joined by three other friends two weeks ago as they jumped 10m and swung off the famous cliff while overlooking the scenic valley views. When Mr Lennert spoke to Daily Mail Australia about his experience, he seemed unfazed. 'We were just looking for something to do on our rest day so we decided to do this just for fun,' he said.

Filippo Rivetti, who happened to be at the right place at the right time, said he felt anxious while photographing the daredevils. 'They asked me if I wanted to jump with them but I said maybe next time because I'm not an expert climber,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was actually at Hanging Rock for another job and it was just a coincidence that I saw the guys.' Mr Lennert has been travelling for 8 months and says Australia is 'an awesome country for rock climbing'. He had been staying in the Blue Mountains for about a month before he was told about Hanging Rock nearby. 'I didn't know about this place but someone told me it was popular so I thought I better check it out,' he said. He acknowledged that it was probably one of the highest cliff he's ever jumped off. A documentary, titled The Edge, was also filmed at the overhanging golden block of sandstone.

"As one Spaniard was announcing his arrival in Manchester on Monday, another was reflecting on a spectacular start to his career here just a few hundred yards across the fields of Carrington. Alvaro Negredo cost Manchester City significantly less than the £37million their neighbours have paid for Juan Mata, but it is hard to think of anyone who has had a greater impact on the Barclays  Premier League this season than the man they call The Beast. Negredo, 28, has been a vital cog in City’s goal machine, contributing 23 goals in 33 games to a team now dreaming of the Quadruple. It has earned him cult status with his new supporters and spread fear among opponents. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Negredo scoring a spectacular scissor-kick strike in training . The Beast: But Manchester City's Alvaro Negredo claims he is a big softie at heart . Off to a flyer: Alvaro Negredo has had a remarkable first season in the Premier League with Manchester City . However, sitting in an office at the club’s training ground, talking  eloquently through an interpreter about his achievements this  season, his upbringing in the tough Vallecas neighbourhood of Madrid, his devotion to his two-year-old daughter Aitana and, of course, that nickname, there is nothing wild about Negredo. It soon becomes clear the image of the brooding Spaniard with dark beard and tattoos is misleading. ‘I’m just the opposite of a beast,’ he says. ‘I’m totally different. I’m very affectionate as a person and I like to spend time chilling out with my family. ‘If anything, my daughter has maybe taken this image of the beast to heart because she’s the wild one! It came about when I was at Almeria. It was more of dressing-room thing really. None of the fans knew me as that, but it became more public when I got here. ‘At first, I was called The Shark because I had a bit of a Mohican haircut and I used to celebrate goals by clasping my hands above my head.’ These days, each goal is followed by a kiss of the inside of his right wrist and then the left bicep.Negredo’s wrist is tattooed with the letters CRJ, the initials of his elder brothers Cesar and Ruben and parents, Jose Maria and Juana. Those of his wife Clara and their daughter appear on his bicep. The striker also has Aitana’s little footprint tattooed on the left foot that has despatched so many goals this season. It’s clear that family means a great deal to Negredo. The sacrifices his father made working long hours as a taxi driver in Madrid to provide for his three boys have not been  forgotten. Preferring to play football with his older brothers and their friends, Alvaro grew up idolising Gabriel Batistuta and Brazil’s Ronaldo. It was there, on the streets of Vallecas, that he learned to take the hard knocks. Sealed with a kiss: Negredo's celebration has become a familiar sight in England this season . Fans favourtie: Negredo was spotted in Cheshire town Alderley Edge on Monday afternoon . Gentle giant: Negredo takes time to chat to a supporter while filling up his Audi Q7 . Bully boy: Negredo is famed for his bullish style and lethal finishing in front of goal . ‘My brother Cesar was a centre back. I used to really wind him up because I’d be trying all kinds of tricks on him, nutmegs and things like that, and he’d just kick me,’ says Negredo. ‘He’d knock me to the ground and not even offer a hand to help me up. ‘I speak to them every day. They are footballers themselves and are still making a living from football (Cesar at CD Covadonga and Ruben at CF Reus Deportiu). They’ve not had the fortune to get as far as I have but they’re really pleased for me. ‘We think that, secretly, the reason our dad worked so much is because it was bedlam at home with me and my brothers arguing so much. He’s still a taxi driver.  I’ve tried to tell him to give it up but it’s impossible to prise him out of his taxi . ‘I know that my parents gave up a lot and throughout my life I’ve been marked by my childhood experiences. I’ve not forgotten where I came from.’ It says much about Negredo’s talent that on the two occasions Real Madrid let him leave, they inserted a buy-back clause into the deal. On the second occasion, stuck behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Raul, Karim Benzema, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Gonzalo Higuain and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, coach Manuel Pellegrini not surprisingly advised him to accept a move to Sevilla. Negredo admired his honesty. Gratfeul: Negredo admires current manager Manuel Pellegrini for advising him to leave for Sevilla . Summer deals: Negredo, Stevan Jovetic (centre) and Jesus Navas (right) joined before the start of the season . Out in the cold: Negredo was low in the pecking order during his time at Real Madrid .

I . used to really wind him up because I’d be trying all kinds of tricks on . him, nutmegs and things like that, and he’d just kick me' ‘He didn’t make me go through the entire pre-season in the hope that I might be featuring,’ he recalls. ‘He doesn’t hide from talking to you face to face and that’s what a dressing room wants from a manager. He’s one of the reasons I’m here at City. It was never tough for me meeting up again.’ David Moyes made an unsuccessful £9million bid to sign Negredo for Everton last January. West  Ham scouts also monitored his progress and there was talk of  interest from Hull. But when Pellegrini and City came knocking with the offer of a four-year deal worth £75,000 a week last summer, Negredo knew the time was right to join former Sevilla team-mate Jesus Navas and the rest of City’s Spanish-speaking contingent. A deal worth £16.4m plus £4.2m in add-ons was agreed, and it quickly became clear from Negredo’s debut on the club’s tour of Hong Kong that Pellegrini had found a typical English No 9 in Spain. ‘Feed The Beast and he will score,’ has since become a popular twist on an old favourite at City. Once again, however, the image does him a disservice. Negredo can operate as a traditional target man but he can offer so much more than an aerial threat in terms of his  creativity, vision and movement. Dream: Negredo is targeting a World Cup selection with Spain next summer . Invention: Negredo deftly lifts the ball over the onrushing Jussi Jaaskelainen during the Capital One Cup clash . Happy man: The Beast enjoys playing with Sergio Aguero (centre) or Edin Dzeko . 'I think there is more to come. As an individual and a team we’re not going to settle for what we’ve achieved so far.' It’s no surprise that he looks equally comfortable playing alongside Sergio Aguero or the bigger Edin Dzeko. ‘A lot of people maybe make the mistake of thinking I’m just a big strapping centre forward who is going to be barging into defenders and creating trouble physically,’ he says. ‘Yes, there is that side to me, but I think I have an extra plus where I do try to show that little bit of invention. I try to surprise people with a touch or something spectacular in a finish.’ It has helped Pellegrini’s rampant team rack up an astonishing 107 goals this season as they challenge on four fronts. Barcelona and Chelsea might pose substantial obstacles in two of those competitions, but City are through to the Capital One Cup final against Sunderland and lie menacingly in second place in the Premier League table. Can they win all four? ‘It’s possible simply because we’re still involved in all four competitions,’ Negredo says. ‘To be totally honest it would be tough to imagine both myself and the team would be scoring quite as many goals as we have. But I think there is more to come. As an individual and a team we’re not going to settle for what we’ve achieved so far.’ Goal glut: Negredo blasts the ball past Simon Eastwood during the FA Cup replay with Blackburn .

Having missed out in 2010 before picking up a Euro 2012 winner’s medal, Negredo is determined to make it to Brazil. He says: ‘Soldado and Fernando Torres come to mind as rivals in this country, as well as Michu who has been out injured, but there are lots of players in Spain fighting for it as well. It’s going to be a battle.’ And as everyone knows by now, The Beast loves a battle.","Man City's powerful striker eager to pick up silverware in debut season .

"It may cover a staggering 656,650 square miles (1.7 million square km), but the Greenland Ice Sheet's vast expanse is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought. Researchers have developed a  model revealing that despite the sheet's size and stability, the surface beneath it makes it more sensitive to movement. This movement causes different parts of the ice to move at different speeds, causing ice to shear - a phenomenon known as ice flow. This ultimately releases more ice into the ocean, adding to the rising sea levels. Researchers have developed a climatic model which reveals that, despite the Greeland Ice Sheet's (pictured) size and stability, the weak sediment on the surface beneath it makes the sheet more sensitive to movement, caused by rising global temperatures. This increases the amount of ice released into the oceans . The model was designed by researchers at Cambridge University. As well as assessing the impact increasing meltwater has on ocean levels each year, the model also took into account the role that the soft, spongy ground beneath the ice sheet plays in its changing dynamics. The Greenland Ice Sheet - the second-largest in the world, covering an area roughly eight times the size of the United Kingdom - contains enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 23ft (7 metres) if it were to be lost altogether. Using a 3D ice sheet model, together with an observational record of surface melting, researchers from Cambridge University were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below. Not only is the ice sheet sensitive to a changing climate, but extreme meteorological events, such as heavy rainfall and heatwaves, can also have a large effect on the rate of ice loss. The soft sediment beneath the sheet gets weaker as it tries to soak up more water, making it less resistant, so that the ice above moves faster. As a result, the researchers state that the Greenland Ice Sheet is not nearly as stable as first thought. Currently, due to surface melting alone, it is losing ice at a net annual rate of 200 gigatonnes, equating to 0.02 inches (0.6mm) of sea level rise. By comparison, sea levels globally are rising at 0.18 inches (3mm) annually. A similarly large, but ultimately more uncertain source of sea level rise, has been blamed on the movement of this ice sheet. These shifts additionally cause ice to be discharged into the ocean, and these movements are caused by rising temperatures. Study leader Dr Marion Bougamont, of Cambridge’s Scott Polar Research Institute, said: ‘When these large ice sheets melt, whether that’s due to seasonal change or a warming climate, they don’t melt like an ice cube. ‘Instead, there are two sources of net ice loss: melting on the surface and increased flow of the ice itself, and there is a connection between these two mechanisms which we don’t fully understand and isn’t taken into account by standard ice sheet models.’ Other models of the Greenland Ice Sheet have typically assumed the ice slides over hard and impermeable bedrock. The model was designed by researchers at Cambridge University. As well as assessing the impact increasing meltwater has on ocean levels each year, the model also took into account the role that the soft, spongy ground beneath the ice sheet (pictured above left and below right)  plays in its changing dynamics . Using a 3D ice sheet model, together with an observational record of surface melting, researchers were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below . This latest study incorporates new evidence from ground-based surveys, which revealed soft and porous sediments at the bed of the ice sheet - similar to the soft and muddy bottom of a lake. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, specifically identifies the intake and temporary storage of water by weak sediment beneath the ice sheet as a crucial process in governing ice flow. Using a 3D ice sheet model, together with an observational record of surface melting produced by colleagues at Aberystwyth University, Dr Bougamont and Dr Poul Christoffersen were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below. Last week, canyons, lakes and mountains were revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar regions.Surveys of the Antarctic and Arctic revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘mega canyon’ in Greenland (illustrated) - bigger even than the Grand Canyon in the US . Dr Christoffersen said: ‘Not only is the ice sheet sensitive to a changing climate, but extreme meteorological events, such as heavy rainfall and heatwaves, can also have a large effect on the rate of ice loss. Global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world, scientists have claimed. They discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures, and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex. Researchers led by Baek-Min Kim from Korea Polar Research Institute found that as oceans heat up and melt the Arctic ice, warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere. The polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the US last winter, they continued. ‘The soft sediment gets weaker as it tries to soak up more water, making it less resistant, so that the ice above moves faster. The Greenland Ice Sheet is not nearly as stable as we think.’ Last week, canyons, lakes and mountains were revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar regions. Surveys of the Antarctic and Arctic revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘mega canyon’ in Greenland - bigger even than the Grand Canyon in the US. And data from surveys of the regions has revealed the extent to which Arctic sea ice is gradually decreasing and how long it might take to disappear. The unseen land under the ice was detailed in the new edition of the Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World. While previous maps of the polar regions showed them as mostly near-blank whiteness, the latest data has allowed the appearance of the land under the ice to be revealed. And the maps show the dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice in recent decades as the region is affected by rising global temperatures .","The model was created by researchers at Cambridge University .

"Buried among nearly 10,000 pages of documents made public Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library is an email that shows a future Supreme Court Justice dropping an F-bomb in official correspondence with her boss. Elena Kagan, then assistant White House counsel, emailed an apology to her boss in May 1996 for chatting up a CNN host about an on-air debate that would be embarrassing to the president – while her colleague was actively trying to get the broadcast segment cancelled. 'I realize now that I may have really f**ked up,' she wrote to White House counsel Jack Quinn, adding: 'God, do I feel like an idiot.' Kagan, who would get a spot on the nation's highest court from President Barack Obama in 2010, served in the Clinton administration when its sex-related legal brush fires were their hottest. Kagan, shown at left helping Clinton prepare for a State of the Union address, apologized in 1996 for torpedoing an attempt to cancel an embarrassing TV debate about Paula Jones' sex-harassment allegations . 'I may have really f**cked up': Elena Kagan, a future U.S. Supreme Court justice, demonstrated her human side with a casual F-bomb in a White House office email . Sixteen years later: President Barack Obama congratulated Kagan in 2010 after her confirmation as the fourth female Supreme Court justice . One of those episodes, which White House insiders called 'bimbo eruptions,' involved Paula Jones, an Arkansas woman who accused Clinton of luring her to a suite at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock while he was the state's governor. During their short encounter, she claimed, Clinton had touched her inappropriately, tried to kiss her, dropped his trousers and asked her for oral sex. Clinton denied ever having met Jones and a federal judge dropped criminal charges, calling the alleged behavior 'boorish.' But a civil lawsuit dredged up the matter a second time. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a siting president wasn't allowed to duck it, but a federal judge threw out the case. Jones vowed to appeal; Clinton ultimately paid an $850,000 settlement in 1998 to make the suit go away, just as Jones' lawyers surfaced a witness to testify on her behalf. The Jones scandal inspired t-shirts, magazine features, song parodies – including take-offs on Grammy winner Billy Paul's 'Me And Mrs Jones' – and endless televised talking-head debates. As the lawsuit wore on, CNN's 'Crossfire' wanted in on the action, asking former Clinton White House Counsel Abner Mikva to appear in a debate against then-Republican Colorado Senator Hank Brown. 'Bimbo eruptions': As early as 1992, before he was president, Clinton sat with his wife Hillary for media interviews to dispel the idea that he was a serial sexual harasser . Settled for $850,000: Paula Jones, an Arkansas secretary, sued then-Governor Bill Clinton for sex harassment after she claimed he lured her to a hotel room and asked for oral sex . Kagan and her boss Quinn had been talking with Crossfire host Bill Press about Mikva's segment, not understanding that Clinton Special Counsel Jane Sherburne was working back-channels with a CNN producer to have the entire thing called off. Citing what she called a 'right-hand-left-hand' problem, Sherburne told Kagan she was unable to scotch the debate. And the future justice acknowledged in her note to Quinn that when Sherburne had called her that morning with strategic questions about where the interview plan stood, she missed cues about what the special counsel was up to. 'I am really really sorry about not telling you about this,' Kagan wrote. 'Frankly, it just didn't occur to me as at all important until this recent right-hand-left-hand conversation. God, do I feel like an idiot.'","Kagan was assistant White House counsel in the Clinton administration .

"Charlene Tyler (pictured) said she felt 'violated' after a photo of her legs was used in the sting operation . A Sunday newspaper accused of turning two unsuspecting women into 'honey traps' to ensnare sex-shame MP Brooks Newmark was attacked by a Cabinet minister yesterday. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the Sunday Mirror should not have used 'selfie' photos from the internet of a Swedish model and a Lincolnshire mother of two without their consent. The photos were used as part of a 'sting' operation which resulted in married Mr Newmark quitting the Government after being caught sending an X-rated photo of himself. Mrs Morgan said: 'It is not right that photos are taken without consent from anybody. 'The paper will have to think about their conduct.' London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'I have a very high regard for Brooks and a great deal of sympathy and I am sure he will be coming back very soon.' But Home Secretary Theresa May had little sympathy, saying: 'Brooks shouldn't have done it in the first place.' Amid a growing row over the Sunday Mirror's story, police and the new press regulator are being asked to investigate. There has been no further word from father-of-five Mr Newmark since he declared himself a 'complete fool' for posting explicit photos of himself to a woman he thought was an attractive blonde Conservative supporter – but who was really a male undercover reporter. The 56-year-old MP resigned as Minister for Civil Society at the weekend after realising that 'Sophie' was in fact a fake Twitter account set up as a honey trap. He sent 'Sophie' an X-rated photo of himself after apparently requesting 'she' send photos to him – one of which showed the legs of mother-of-two Charlene Tyler, 26, from Lincolnshire, and the other the face of Swedish model Malin Sahlen, 22. Yesterday Miss Tyler said she felt 'violated' and feared people would think she had been a willing partner in the sting. She told the Mail: 'This was a violation of my privacy. I know I put photos on Twitter for the world to see but there needs to be some level of respect.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) suggested the Sunday Mirror had questions to answer about its sting involving Charities Minister Brooks Newmark (right), who resigned after sending an explicit photo of himself . Tory MP Brooks Newmark pictured with his wife Lucy, just after he was elected MP for Braintree in 2005 . She added: 'I don't like the fact they used one of my photos to bring someone down. 'He's a grown man and he may be married but the only people who should be concerned about what he's done are him and his wife.' Miss Sahlen told a Swedish newspaper she felt 'exploited' by her picture being used as the profile photo on the Twitter account. 'I have had a lot of emails, texts and phonecalls from different countries about it. It feels unreal,' she told Aftonbladet. 'I do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible, both for me and others involved in this.' She also took to her blog to inform her followers of her photo being used as the 'face' of the operation. The Twitter profile picture of 'Sophie Wittams', who is really a Swedish model uninvolved in the sting. The model, whose real name is Malin Sahlen, 22, said it was 'offensive' her image was used without permission . This picture of 'Miss Wittam's' legs - actually Charlene Tyler's - was used as the journalist encouraged Mr Newmark to send explicit images. Miss Tyler said the MP had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign . She wrote: 'I feel very confused right now and still can't comprehend that what has happened has happened. I can blog more about this another day, but right now I can't bare to talk about it. ‘This thing feels really unpleasant.’ Lloyd Embley, editor in chief of the Sunday Mirror, last night apologised to the two women. Anger: A photo by 'Sophie Wittams' was in fact of unsuspecting Charlene Tyler, from Lincolnshire . He said: 'At no point has the Sunday Mirror published any of these images. 'But we would like to apologise to the women involved for their use in the investigation.' The newspaper has defended its story as having a 'nailed-on public interest', because Mr Newmark is a founder of the Women2Win campaign group which aims to attract more women into politics. Associate editor Kevin Maguire said: 'If you have the minister for civic society, a minister charged with getting more women into politics but seems to be [more interested] in getting them into his own bed, I think there is huge public interest.' But the undercover investigation – conducted by a freelancer and sold to the Sunday Mirror – also targeted other MPs and has been branded a 'fishing expedition' by critics. Mark Pritchard – one of at least six other Tory MPs targeted – said he was reporting the newspaper to the Metropolitan Police and to the three-week-old successor to the Press Complaints Commission, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), saying it would be 'the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth'. Lawyers and media commentators accused the newspaper of 'entrapment' and questioned whether tricking Mr Newmark into sending the photo amounted to the crime of 'causing a person to indulge in sexual activity without consent'. Before the Sunday Mirror ran the story, it was turned down by both The Sun and The Mail on Sunday.","'Sophie Wittams' was an online alter-ego used by a Sunday Mirror reporter .

"Former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt has said NHS patients could be sent to India for operations . NHS patients could be operated on in India to make huge savings for the health service, former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday. The scheme could also see NHS doctors being flown to India to treat locals in a bid to raise money for cash-strapped UK hospitals – while cheaper Indian doctors come to the UK to perform operations. It would involve NHS trusts going into business with private Indian healthcare firms. Mrs Hewitt said there was a growing number of areas, including a range of cardiac procedures, where Indian doctors could deliver similar or better clinical outcomes at substantially lower costs than the NHS. A combination of income from ventures in India and learning from India’s ‘frugal innovation’ could help close the NHS’s projected £30billion funding gap by 2020, she added. But healthcare campaigners warned the proposals could compromise patient safety. Up to 20 hospital trusts are already in talks with Indian companies about the potential business agreement, according to the Mrs Hewitt, who was health secretary between 2005 and 2007. In an interview in the respected Health Service Journal, Mrs Hewitt said she expected ‘a half dozen to a dozen’ trusts of UK companies to have entered agreements with Indian healthcare firms by 2015. Mrs Hewitt, chairman of the UK India Business Council, said: ‘Our ambition is to get as many (NHS trusts, UK health companies and charities) there as we can.’ The cost of surgery in the UK is far greater than in India. Heart bypass surgery in India is as cheap as £1,000, compared with £35,000 in the UK. More than 70,000 Britons already fly abroad each year for private surgery, with many choosing to head to India. Healthcare campaigners have warned the proposals could compromise patient safety (file picture) Dr Kailash Chand, of the British Medical Association, told the Daily Mirror: ‘I think this is a huge scandal.’ He said the plans would mean losing manpower here – which could ‘pose a serious threat to patient safety’.

"George Osborne's Treasury knew about the EU's demand for an extra £1.7billion for almost a week before David Cameron was told. As the Prime Minister vowed not to pay the sum by December 1 and demanded answers about how it was calculated, it emerged junior ministers were aware of changes to the way the UK bill was calculated months ago. Labour today said the government's story was 'unravelling day by day', as Denmark's prime minister insisted that 'countries must follow the rules as they are'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has raged against the shock demand for an extra £1.7billion, but it has since emerged that the Treasury knew about the imminent bill for at least a week . Mr Cameron has reacted with fury to the demand by the EU, which sees some countries like Greece, Italy and the Netherlands paying more while Germany and France are in line for rebates. The PM interrupted a summit on Friday to demand answers about why the bill had been sprung on him without notice. Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik revealed that the Treasury was informed of the £1.7billion bill on October 17. He warned that the UK was obliged by law to pay by this deadline and would be liable for 'late payment fines' if it failed to hand over the cash. Mr Dominik said he was 'surprised' by the PM's reaction, insisting that the adjustment of Britain's contribution to the EU budget - known in Brussels jargon as 'own resources' - was a routine annual procedure about which London was well aware. The figures behind the calculation were provided by the UK's Office for National Statistics and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge being demanded, he said. Senior British diplomats were in talks in Brussels today on the massive bill, and Chancellor George Osborne is expected to raise it with fellow EU finance ministers including Germany's Wolfgang Schauble in the margins of an OECD forum in Berlin tomorrow. Mr Cameron secured agreement at last week's European Council for the issue to be discussed at a scheduled meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on November 7. But Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt played down the prospect of the EU making exceptions in its budget rules to assuage British anger. Ms Thorning-Schmidt told the Bloomberg news agency: 'I respect that the UK wants to discuss this among ministers, but there are rules that must be kept. Countries must follow the rules as they are.' New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . Treasury minister David Gauke was informed of the sum at a meeting on October 14, but Chancellor George Osborne says he was not told until October 21 . March 11: Then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan says the government is giving a 'high priority' to addressing concerns about impact of new economic measurements which impact on Britain's contributions to the EU . April 14: Farming minister George Eustice attends meeting of agriculture ministers. Minutes from the meeting referred to changes to the way contributions to the EU budget are calculated . October 14:  Treasury minister David Gauke is told the UK will have to make a significant extra contribution, but no sum discussed . October 17: UK officials informed by the EU that £1.7billion was required . October 21: George Osborne is told about the new bill from the EU . October 23: David Cameron is informed about the sum, as he is driven to a Brussels summit in an ambassador's car . In March Nicky Morgan, then a Treasury minister, then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said that the Government was giving 'high priority' to addressing the impact of the changes. Today it emerged that Farming Minister George Eustice attended a meeting of ministers in April. The minutes of the meeting referred to the changes to the methodology, in particular a report by the European Court of Auditors entitled 'Getting the Gross National Income (GNI) data right: a more structured and better-focused approach would improve the effectiveness of the Commission's verification'. The meeting on April 14 agreed that the process of checking the economic data of member states 'must be undertaken in the spirit of mutual trust and transparency'. It also urged that 'special attention should be given to the reliability' data compiled for changes under ESA 2010 rules which could see Britain paying even more from 2016. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggested the items were not discussed at the meting attended by Mr Eustice, but it emphasises that the issue was put into the spotlight at European Council meetings earlier this year. Chris Leslie, Labour's chief secretary to the Treasury, told MailOnline: 'Day by day the story that nobody knew until the last minute is unravelling. The Treasury certainly heard about this when David Gauke attended the Ecofin on October 17 which doesn't tally with the Chancellor and Prime Minister's story on this.' He said the fact that the changes had been on the radar for months 'should certainly call their competence into question'. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has said the demand for an additional payment should not have come as a surprise to Britain as member states' contributions were adjusted in this way each year in the autumn. 'Sometimes countries have to give more money. Sometimes they receive much more money,' he said. 'I understand the concerns in London, but any person that wants to look at it with objectivity and honesty to the rules that were approved by the member states, has to accept that sometimes these decisions do happen.'","PM accused the European Commission of 'thumping' UK with shock bill .

"A husband who committed suicide with his wife in a 'Romeo and Juliet' pact had sent a text message revealing they planned to kill themselves to a mental health worker the night before. But the message sent by Christopher Stonehouse, 44, on November 7 last year was not read until the following day and mental health officials have been questioned over the delay. An inquest heard he was found dead alongside his wife Alphira, 27, in their bedroom on November 8, with the couple having left a note signed 'Romeo and Juliet'. 'Suicide pact': Alphira, 27, and Christoper Stonehouse, 44, left a suicide note signed 'Romeo and Juliet' A copy of the play, with a passage highlighted, was also found next to their bodies and a Romeo and Juliet DVD had been playing on the television. The evening before, Mr Stonehouse sent mental health worker Damian Walsh a text message, which read: 'Alphira and I have chosen to . end our lives. 'We have suffered for too long and cannot bear it any . longer. Our backdoor and gate are unlocked.' The inquest into Mrs Stonehouse's . death heard that Mr Walsh did not see the message or that he missed . calls from Mr Stonehouse until around 9am the following morning, when he . was scheduled to see him. Concerned at the message, Mr Walsh said . he first tried to call Mr Stonehouse but it diverted to voicemail, then . sent him a text message but again failed to get a reply. Police were eventually alerted and found the couple, who married in 2005 and had been in regular contact with mental health professionals, dead in their two-bedroom home in Whyke Marsh, . Chichester, West Sussex. Detective Sergeant Sally Arbuckle said in a statement that a note found read: 'Unless you are the emergency services, do not enter. Alphira and Chris, aka Romeo and Juliet.' Tragedy: The couple were found dead in the bedroom of their home in Chichester in November last year . A post-mortem examination on Mrs . Stonehouse - who was her husband's full-time carer - found she died from . an overdose of prescription drugs. At a separate inquest into Mr Stonehouse's death last week, a suicide verdict was recorded. Today, Mrs Stonehouse's mother, Deborah Jacobs, questioned why the text message revealing the suicidal intentions of the couple was not acted upon sooner. She asked Mr Walsh: 'If Chris had sent you 34 texts before this one and none had given any indication of wanting to take their own lives, why didn't you call 999?' Mr Walsh said Mr Stonehouse left the message on his work mobile phone the evening before their deaths after he had finished for the day and he read it the following morning. He added that a full investigation had been launched and that part of it would centre on whether a new policy needs to be drafted relating to mobile phone use. Mrs Jacobs said her 'headstrong' daughter left the family home aged 18 and met Mr Stonehouse through her and his wife at the time. 'Alphira and I spent a lot of time at loggerheads with each other,' said Mrs Jacobs, from Redhill, Surrey. Missed: Mr Stonehouse had sent a text revealing the couple's intentions to a mental health work . 'Both of us are strong-minded and we . clashed, and Chris would take her under his wing because Alphira and I . weren't getting on particularly well.' Eventually, Mr Stonehouse and his wife split and he formed a relationship with Mrs Stonehouse, who was 17 years his junior, an arrangement Mrs Jacobs said she 'didn't entirely' approve of. She added: 'She was an adult and there was nothing I could do.' Contact between mother and daughter diminished as Mrs Jacobs said 'a lot of animosity' existed between them. 'There were several olive branches and several reconciliations but after a short period it would go back to her being quite mean towards me,' Mrs Jacobs went on. Mr Walsh said Mr and Mrs Stonehouse came to see him in April last year seeking help after a 'significant development' in their lives which was not expanded upon at the inquest. The issue meant that they had to give a police statement, he said. 'Both were distressed about those matters.' Dr Isabel Fernandez de Sifrim told the inquest that Mrs Stonehouse had taken an overdose and cut her wrist in a previous suicide bid. Inquest: The hearing at Chichester Magistrates' Court heard that Mrs Stonehouse had killed herself . When she saw her on May 31, Mrs Stonehouse was having trouble sleeping, suffering from anxiety and experiencing psychotic episodes. 'All the symptoms were related to something that had happened very recently,' she said. 'It was a kind of trigger. She had panic attacks and she wasn't in control.' With anti-depressants, her condition started to improve and the 'risk factors' disappeared slowly, with her thoughts turning positively to her future, including having children and contacting her father again. 'I didn't think she was going to commit suicide,' the doctor went on. Recording a verdict that Mrs Stonehouse took her own life, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said: 'I have to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that a person intended to take their own life. 'I wanted to be sure that Alphira had not been coerced into this. 'It appears to me that she was able to make up her own mind at the time of her death, and although Mr Stonehouse was some 17 years her senior this was something that she would have undertaken of her accord.'

"Women are failing to exercise for fear of being judged over their appearance and ability at the gym, a new study has found. Across the UK two million fewer women than men take part in sport and regularly exercise. And a new piece of research conducted by Sport England has identified three core factors holding them back. They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles. The study has prompted a new campaign to empower women, encouraging more to get active and improve their health. Scroll down for video . A new study by Sport England found 75 per cent of women would like to exercise but don't because they fear they will be judged . Of the 9.4million women aged 14 to 40 that Sport England are targeted as part of the This Girl Can campaign, 7.1million - 75 per cent - would like to exercise more. Set to launch in January, the campaign will encourage women to join local sports clubs, gyms, and exercise at home. The study found the fear of judgement is greater than women's self-confidence. Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England, said: 'Women do less sport and exercise than men, but most say they would like to do more. 'So we had to get to the bottom of what's holding them back. 'We found out by talking to women of all ages up and down the country that what's stopping them is fear, fear of judgement: whether that's about how they look, whether they're any good at it, or feeling guilty about spending time on themselves. 'Whichever way you slice it, women's fear of judgement is sapping their confidence. 'This Girl Can is a celebration of all the women who are finding the confidence to exercise: it's an attitude, and a call to action for all women to do the same.' While identifying a host of reasons holding women back from exercising, the unifying factor was a fear of being judged. They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles . The research has prompted a new campaign This Girl Can, which will launch in the new year and aims to encourage women to join sports clubs, gyms and exercise at home . Women who were interviewed knew they should exercise, and expressed a wish to take part in sport but despite that they did not achieve the recommended levels of exercise. The study uncovered a fear among mothers of being judged for spending too much time on themselves. Worrying that others will deem they are putting themselves first appeared as a major barrier to exercise for those with children. And among other women of all ages, concerns over how they look while exercising was enough to stop them taking part in sport and exercise. The third major barrier was a fear over ability, whether they were good enough, too good and therefore unfeminine, stopping them. The This Girl Can campaign aims to address womens' fears, by helping to show women are not alone in their fears. Sport England said it is hoped the campaign will inspire a 'moment of realisation' in women when 'they recognise that they are not alone', building confidence.","Sport England study found 75% of women would like to exercise more .

"Clearly her new role as a UN ambassador left her with little time to make her first store as immaculate as she might have liked. And it meant frantic preparations were still taking place at Victoria Beckham’s shop in the final minutes before it opened its doors. Windows were boarded up, while the paintwork was still being finished. Boxes were still arriving, and there were reports of bags of clothes seen lying on the ground, not yet hung up on rails. Scroll down for video . Frantic preparations were still taking place at Victoria Beckham’s shop in London in the final minutes before it opened its doors . Work was being carried out despite people having queued for hours outside the new Mayfair store . Windows were boarded up, while the paintwork was still being finished by contractors on site . The shop is Mrs Beckham's first stand-alone venue, though she does sell of her line online . Tins of paint lay discarded on stone steps outside the shop on the morning of the opening, as well as high-visibility jackets dumped by workers on their tea break. And it shocked the customers who had been queuing for hours outside. Many began speculating the opening might never happen, with some giving up and going home. The last-minute preparations shocked the customers who had been queuing for hours outside . Many began speculating the opening might never happen, with some giving up and going home . The shop has employed a modern look and does not have tills or even a window display . One, Declan Clancey said: ‘It’s just shoddy really. I’ve seen inside when someone came out and there’s all builders and bare floorboards, it’s a mess. There’s no ways it’s opening today, no way. It’s a mess. ‘They couldn’t even be bothered to sweep the fag ends off the steps. And the steps are crumbling, it’s a disgrace, I would be ashamed if I was her. I don’t even like the woman, I was just hoping David might be coming down. I don’t care about her shop but she’s making a mockery out of her fans. I thought there would be more people here than this but they haven’t missed much.’ Jessica Kalirai, 24, said: ‘It seems quite last minute thought it would have been ready, they’ve been doing it long enough. But I’ve been here since 9 and it’s been a bit frantic, lots of touching up and stuff.’ Mrs Beckham has advertised the launch of her store on Twitter over recent weeks and has described it as a family affair . David was on hand to man the store in his wife's absence, while Mrs Beckham’s mother, Jackie Adams, her father Anthony and sister Louise also dropped by . Mrs Beckham was at the UN in New York with world leaders on the shop's opening day, where she was named goodwill ambassador . Another woman, who did not wish to be named, added: ‘It’s not a terribly welcoming sight.’ The shop is Mrs Beckham’s first stand-alone venue, although her collections are also stocked in Selfridge’s and online retailer Net-a-Porter. In a recent interview the designer insisted the shop will be a family affair, with Mr Beckham on the door, Mrs Beckham behind the till and their eldest son Brooklyn, 15, working as a Saturday boy. The couple have three other children: Romeo, 11, Cruise, 9, and two-year-old Harper. And after using Twitter to publicise the store in recent weeks, it was indeed a family affair - with David, Mrs Beckham’s mother, Jackie Adams, her father Anthony and sister Louise dropping in. Outside the shop onlooker Surin Malik, 46, said: ‘The fact she [Mrs Beckham] is not here is a massive disappointment. I really, really hoped she would be. It’s such a shame. She’s let a lot of people down.’ Becks minds the shop: New goodwill ambassador Victoria wows UN in New York as her first fashion store opens its doors in London . By Paul Harris . They were separated by 3,500 miles and two rather different jobs. In six-inch heels, Victoria Beckham click-clacked in the footsteps of world leaders at the United Nations in New York yesterday and made an impassioned plea to safeguard women’s health and stop babies dying of Aids. And husband David? He stayed at home to mind the shop. The new shop in Mayfair. While Victoria Beckham hung out with world leaders at the UN in New York, her husband David stayed at home to mind the new shop in Mayfair . The world-renowned footballer-cum-charity do-gooder swapped roles temporarily with his fashion leader wife to allow her to make her political debut on the world stage. Meanwhile he bowled up in scuffed brown shoes for the launch of the ex-Spice Girl’s swish new clothing store. Ordinarily, those who queued for a first glimpse of VB’s sales floor might have expected their heroine to oversee the opening. But even as they scrambled for a peek inside, perhaps equally excited at the prospect of meeting DB, Victoria was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the UN after being made an International Goodwill Ambassador. The role gets her instant membership of a celebrity club that includes Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all used their star status to draw attention to UN good works. In a sober suit, and with barely a hint of her trademark pout, the 40-year-old said she was ‘humbled and honoured’ to represent the UN in its Aids campaign, adding: ‘For some reason people will listen to me. This is the beginning of an incredible journey for me.’ Despite it being the opening of her store, Victoria was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the UN after being made an International Goodwill Ambassador . The role gets the former Spice Girl instant membership of a celebrity club that includes Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all used their star status to draw attention to UN good works . That journey appears to have been inspired by a trip to South Africa, where she met children stricken by Aids and spoke to afflicted mothers. The visit was part of the Born Free initiative, which tackles the issue of HIV being transmitted from mother to child. ‘I came home and I knew I had to do something,’ the mother-of-four said yesterday. ‘I think every woman has the right to health, and every woman has the right to give their children a healthy future.’ Elton, she said (that’s Sir Elton John) was a ‘dear friend’ of her and her husband, and the couple had been patrons of the piano player’s Aids Foundation for 20 years. ‘Babies should not be born with HIV and we can stop that,’ she said. ‘I’m a mother, a woman, and I want to reach out and help as many women and mothers as I can.’ Back in London, David - who was wearing scuffed brown shoes - was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests . Back in London, David was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests. Her store is a bold venture into traditional retail as opposed to online shopping. Traditional, that is, until you step inside the shop. It would have been fun to see David Beckham behind a till, for example – but there aren’t any. Sales are made through iPads, doing away with anything so vulgar as a cash register. There is no window display, and the goods are arranged with the minimalist chic of an art installation (or, depending on your point of view, in a way that makes it look as if the shop has already been burgled). Victoria will be there from time to time – but she has other agendas. At the UN she said she would be back in South Africa in a few weeks ‘and then further afield next year’.","Frantic preparations were still taking place in final minutes before opening .

"Villagers were urged to stay indoors after 15,000 deadly Nile crocodiles escaped from a farm in South Africa. The reptiles, which can grow to 16ft long, were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby Limpopo river flood. Bosses at the Rakwena Crocodile Farm in the north-east of  the country opened the gates to the animals’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out. Leaping lizards: 15,000 crocodiles are on the lose in South Africa after escaping from a crocodile farm (file picture) The reptiles have since been spotted . all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and . wildlife experts have urged local people to avoid the animals and stay . indoors. The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa and the second-largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile. Prey consists of gazelles, antelope, waterbuck, sitatunga, lechwe, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, giraffes and Cape buffalos. They are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens, goats, sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans. Males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more. They are found in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, South Africa, Malawi, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and in Senegal. As the flood waters fell, many have been found trapped in the branches of trees. But at least one has been spotted on a nearby school's waterlogged rugby field. Rakwena's Zane Langman told South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper that he recaptures the animals whenever he is alerted to one. He said he had already caught 'a few . thousand' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm, but he . told the newspaper that 'more than half' of his reptiles are still . missing. Mr Langman said he . prefers to catch the reptiles at night, as their eyes reflect red in . torchlight and they are therefore easier to find. Nile . Crocodiles are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long. They . can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph. They . are extremely dangerous to humans. Their preferred method of killing is . to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it, alive, . underwater to drown it. Commercial . crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin, which is used to make . crocodile leather for items such as belts, shoes and handbags. There is also a small market for . crocodile meat, but most often the dead reptile's is fed to other crocs . as the species is cannibalistic. The . commercial crocodile farming industry is small, but growing, in South . Africa, where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around . 500,000 animals. Danger: Animal safety experts have warned local people to remain indoors and not to approach the reptiles . Because the quality of the skin is paramount, some farms keep each crocodile in its own, battery-style pen so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals. However this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens.","Fearsome Nile crocodiles are known to attack humans .

"Authorities continue to search for a 9-year-old boy and his father, who has been charged with internationally kidnapping his son. The FBI says Jeffrey Ford Hanson of Seattle could have sailed with his son, Billy Ginger Hanson, to Hawaii or other Pacific islands. It's not known exactly when Hanson set sail from Seattle with Billy. They were last seen by authorities August 28. Where are they? Jeffrey Ford Hanson, left, and his son Billy Ginger Hanson, right, may have sailed to Hawaii or other Pacific islands, the FBI says . The FBI doesn't know where they went, but Coast Guard nautical experts say they may have traveled to the Hawaiian islands and beyond 'based on the boat and Mr. Hanson's sailing abilities,' according to an FBI news release. The experts didn't tell agents how long it would take the sailboat to arrive in Hawaii or elsewhere, said Ayn Dietrich, FBI spokeswoman in Seattle. Billy was supposed to fly back to his mother in Pennsylvania on September 4 - though the FBI says he never boarded the flight. Hanson is accused of abducting Billy from Shilshole Bay Marina.

FBI agents in Honolulu on Wednesday asked Hawaii's sailing community to look out for Hanson's 1976 White Cooper sailboat named 'Draco.' A federal arrest warrant was issued for Hanson in September. 'When I talked to Jeff he told me they were going to Blake Island,' Billy's mother Joanna Hanson told KIRO in September. 'I love my son, and I want him back.' Last month, a Seattle FBI news release said 'They could be heading toward Mexico or islands in the South Pacific; however, the possibilities are endless.' The Star Advertiser described Hanson as 'a known drug abuser with a volatile personality.' 'Our focus is on helping the agents at the Seattle FBI recover Billy safely, so he can go back to his mom where he belongs,' said Tom Simon, a FBI spokesman in Honolulu. 'Hawaii and the islands of the Pacific have a vibrant sailing and nautical community, and we are appealing to that community to be on the lookout for this sailboat and contact authorities with leads.' The FBI said it is also contacting authorities in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and nations in the Pacific. Hanson has been described by the FBI as standing being 5'5"" tall and weighing 160 pounds, and Billy Hanson reportedly is 4 feet tall and weighs 90 pounds.

"Bad meatloaf from a Bob Evans restaurant in West Virginia killed a former state lawmaker and her husband, according to a lawsuit filed by their children. Former Delegate Virginia Starcher passed away aged 82 in December 2012 while her husband, Harold, died aged 84 in May 2013 after they both suffered massive complications from food poisoning, the suit claims. The couple, who were married for 60 years, ate part of their meatloaf meals, which included meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy, broccoli and a roll, at a Bob Evans restaurant in Ripley in October 2012. The meal was the last they would ever have together, according to the lawsuit, which was first reported by the Charleston Daily Mail. Loss: Virginia Starcher, pictured left and right, and her husband Harold, right, both died months after they were struck down with food poisoning after eating meatloaf at a Bob Evans restaurant, according to a lawsuit . Nine hours later, they both came down with vomiting and diarrhea and were rushed to hospital for food poisoning. Mr Starcher suffered a stroke that day, the lawsuit says. 'Such actions injured Mr. and Mrs. Starcher emotionally which resulted in lost sleep, disturbance of physical condition, extreme anxiety and rapid deterioration of health with consequential death - all requiring the attention of qualified medical personnel,' the lawsuit states. Mrs Starcher, who had suffered a stroke six years before eating the food, died two months later. Her husband's health was weakened by the incident and he needed open heart surgery for a heart valve infection in December 2012, the suit claims. He remained hospitalized until the next April and died at his home in May 2013. Missed: Mr Starcher is pictured with his daughter Ann, who has filed the lawsuit with her brother. It explains that her beloved father, a civil engineer, was able to run his own business until they ate the meal . Until he ate the meal, Mr Starcher was still fit to work and run his own business, but after the incident, he became rapidly ill, the lawsuit says. The couple's adult children, Mark and Ann Starcher, filed the lawsuit against Bob Evans Farms, which is based in New Albany, Ohio, in Jackson Circuit Court on October 3. The lawsuit says the couple incurred more than $250,000 in medical costs after the allegedly tainted meal. The court filing asks for a trial by jury. Bob Evans spokeswoman Hinda Mitchell said that the chain will vigorously defend itself in the matter. 'While we sympathize with this family for the loss of their loved ones, we believe this claim is without merit,' Mitchell said in an emailed statement. Battle: Representatives for the restaurant, which is based in Ohio, said the lawsuit had no merit . Virginia 'Ginny' Starcher, 82, first won her seat in Jackson County in 1986 - making her the first woman ever to be elected - and won one state House of Delegates re-election in 1988. She represented Jackson County and part of Mason County and served until 1991. Harold 'Punk' Starcher, who enlisted in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, was a civil engineer who owned the Chartwell Corp. of Ripley, according to his obituary. The couple left behind their two children and two grandchildren.","Former Delegate Virginia Starcher and her husband Harold Starcher ate meatloaf meals from a Bob Evans in Ripley, West Virginia in October 2012 .

"Vice President Joe Biden got aggressive while speaking about rape and sexual assault at a White House event on Tuesday. The Vice President said that where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, men acted when they saw a woman being assaulted. 'If a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the living cr*p out of him,' Biden told the audience, adding that what he just said wasn't very 'presidential or vice presidential' but 'something every man should begin to understand.' Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that where he comes from, 'If a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the living cr*p out of him if he did it.' Biden is pictured here on Monday at a college in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the event was to discuss the recommendations of the White House's Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and to announce the group's new website NotAlone.gov. Among the task force's recommendations to schools are the reevaluation of what consent to sexual activity is and their adjudication process for determining if student's have been sexually assaulted. Colleges and universities are required to investigate reports of sexual assault as part of Title IX in order to receive federal funding. The White House task force's report, released today, says that schools sometimes subject self-proclaimed sexual . assault survivors to 'harsh and hurtful' questioning about their sexual . history. At the event on Tuesday Biden announced the release of the first report of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the group's new website NotAlone.gov . Acting in concert with today's report, the Department of . Education will advise school's not to ask students about their sexual . history with anyone other than his or her alleged attacker. The Department of Education says 51 campuses currently have investigations open. On Tuesday Biden repeatedly called on men to get involved in the sexual assault awareness campaign. Rape and assault will continue, he said, until society and men 'step up.' 'We're never going to solve this epidemic until we get men involved,' Biden said. 'They have to be part of the solution.' During the event the White House played a powerful, new celebrity filled PSA featuring Biden, President Barack Obama, Steve Carrell, Seth Meyers and Daniel Craig, among other men, explaining what constitutes as sexual assault and that one sexual assault is too many. 'Rape is rape. Don't look away,' the Vice President encouraged listeners during the event. 'Do something. Speak up. Stand up.' Biden also told the audience that everyone - men and women - have the 'God-given right' to live free from assault. 'It's cowardly. Simply cowardly to raise your hand to a woman or a child or a man who is smaller than you,' Biden told the audience. Unless he is defending himself, 'No man has a right ever to raise his hand to a woman,' he said. 'It is assault.'

"A family has told of the 'terrifying' moment they had to escape their home just minutes before fire engulfed their home. Chris Beattie and his mother, Helene, were at their Cliff Drive home in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains - west of Sydney - when a fire took hold of their street. He said he had never seen a fire spread that quickly before as he watched it grow. Scroll down for video . The aftermath of Saturday's blaze, which authorities are treating as suspicious, in the Blue Mountains . This is the one house that has been destroyed by the blaze which is still burning through the area . 'It just went from a little bit of smoke and then it jumped up the mountain in a matter of seconds really,' he told 9News. The Beatties drove around the corner and five minutes later they heard it had jumped across the road where their house was located. Ms Beattie said she and her sons had a lucky escape but they would continue to live in the area and rebuilt their home. 'It was last moment but life is all the matters and I'm sure we'll find a new way of restocking and learn from this and really heightening the value of being alive. 'It's beautiful here. It's worth living here and taking that risk [of staying in the area].' Chris Beattie and his mother, Helene, were at home when the blaze spread to their street . Ms Beattie have told of the moment she and her son narrowly escaped the fire which claimed their home within minutes . Carl said the house and its contents could be rebuilt or re-bought, but the most important thing was everyone was safe and happy . Chris' brother, Carl, was not home at the time of the blaze. He said the house and its contents could be rebuilt or re-bought, but the most important thing was everyone was safe and happy. The Beatties surveyed their burnt-out home on Sunday and thanked firefighters as well as the community for their help, saying they had been 'blown away' by the support. As tourists packed into Katoomba's cafes on Sunday, just a charred shell remained of a family home on Cliff Drive on the township's outskirts, its corrugated metal roofing buckled and blackened. Surrounding properties around the Beatties' home - which was now just charred shell of blackened corrugated metal roofing - were still taped off as Rural Fire Service members extinguished spot fires. The house was gutted when erratic winds caused the bushfire to break containment lines on Saturday. A Rural Fire Service (RFS) member told AAP conditions had calmed down a lot. 'We're just looking after this one now unless something happens in the afternoon, like the wind changes,' he said. The fire, which the RFS suspects was deliberately lit, was still burning out of control in the valley below the gutted home but was no longer posing a threat to properties on Sunday. The Beattie family - the residents of the house - say they will now rebuild and described the fire as 'terrifying' Firefighters say conditions on Sunday have calmed down compared to Saturday's wild weather . A firefighter walks away from a burnt-out property in the Cliff Drive area in Katoomba . The Beatties assessed the damage to their Cliff Drive home on Sunday - the day after the devastating blaze . Firefighters are monitoring the fire and are putting spot fires out in the surrounding areas of the home . Fire crews were assessing the area as helicopters dumped water on the thick, smouldering bush. They will be backed up by Remote Area Firefighting Teams as weather conditions allow. Their biggest concern was a return of strong gusts, which could push the fire back up the cliff and towards homes. Saturday's first big test of the bushfire season came as the Blue Mountains community continued its recovery from blazes that destroyed more than 200 homes in Winmalee and Springwood in October last year. One home has been been lost to a relentless bush-fire which is still raging through Katoomba in the Blue Mountains . It was previously reported that two homes had been burned by the bush-fires, however this was revised after firefighters found that one home which was destroyed had two entrances . The fire services also confirmed that the immediate threat to properties has eased and it been revised back to a watch and act, but firefighters are continuing to work on the fire to contain it . With bushfire conditions worse than last year, Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill is expecting a tense summer. 'I certainly hope that this is it for the fire season, but I can't say that it is,' he told AAP. 'I've spent too much time speaking to families who've lost their homes, spent too much time seeing grief.' A fund established after last year's tragedy could help the Katoomba family that lost their home on Saturday, he said. About 100 people sought shelter in the local RSL as the fire encroached on Saturday, but they were allowed to return home later in the evening. More than 1,000 firefighters were deployed across NSW on Saturday to battle 70 bushfires and more than 200 firefighters remained on scene throughout the night. It was previously reported two homes had been burned by the bush-fires, but this was revised after firefighters found one home which was destroyed had two entrances. NSW Rural Fire Service has confirmed that the cause of the fire is being investigated and is being treated as suspicious . Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Mr Greenhill said his heart went out to the family who had lost their home in the fire. 'The loss of a home is not just the loss of bricks and mortar or roofs and walls, it's a loss of a sense of place, a loss of neighbours and a loss of memories.' he said. The fire started on Saturday morning near Cliff Drive in Katoomba, close to the Three Sisters at Echo Point. The blaze comes 12 months after more than 200 homes in the region were destroyed in a devastating bushfire season. If your life is at risk, call Triple Zero (000) immediately.

'This has an eerie feeling about it given the timing,' Mr Greenhill told AAP. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Saturday, NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman Joel Kursawe confirmed that there have been no casualties as of yet. 'There have been no injuries as far as we're concerned,' he said. Sunday's weather is expected to be more favourable for firefighters, with Sydney region's temperatures to peak in the low 20s and winds to be between 15-25km/h. Over 200 firefighters will remain on scene throughout the night . By midday, with temperatures reaching 36 degrees in some parts of NSW, the fire was in full blaze .

"Tony Blair's view that religious extremism lies at the heart of the Middle East crisis was dismissed last night by his former chief of staff. Jonathan Powell said Mr Blair was wrong to blame the region’s problems on tensions within Islam. He even suggested that his old boss’s mistaken analysis could lead to a ‘21st Century version’ of a religious war. Mr Blair has highlighted the dangers of religious extremism provoking conflicts in regions such as the Middle East and has urged people to realise there is a ‘problem within Islam’. Tony Blair walks alongside Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff at the time, who says his former boss's view of Islam could start a new religious war . But Mr Powell, one of the former premier’s most loyal lieutenants during his time in No 10, said: ‘I see it from a different angle. He [Blair] argues that this is a new phenomenon we are facing. I don’t accept that.’ In an interview with Total Politics magazine, Mr Powell said: ‘What Tony Blair is trying to do is to look at it from the inter-faith point of view, which is something beyond me. ‘The danger is that you can end up framing these conflicts in ideological terms and return to the religious wars of the 16th Century in Europe. You don’t want to let this Sunni / Shia divide turn into a 21st Century version of the Thirty Years’ War. ‘If you view the conflict on religious grounds you will create a religious war. That’s what we should be avoiding.’ Former diplomat Mr Powell was at Mr Blair’s side throughout his time in Downing Street and played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. He told Total Politics that British governments never learn that they cannot defeat terrorists by military means, adding: ‘Every time there is a new terrorist group, [the West] says we are going to defeat them, but never does.’ Mr Blair, who now acts as Middle East envoy for the EU, US, Russia and the UN, was unavailable for comment yesterday.

"Arrested: Nicole Edna Holton, 36, from Upper Darby, was arrested for letting her daughter fight a schoolmate over a dispute about boys . A mother who let her daughter fight with a schoolmate to settle a dispute about boys has been arrested, though she was unrepentant about the alleged crime. Nicole Edna Holton, 36, from Upper Darby, West Philadelphia, had allegedly arranged the brawl because her daughter’s school wasn’t dealing with the issues she was having, police said. Superintendent Michael Chitwood said that Holton took her daughter to a parking lot on Friday and watched her fight with another girl. He told the delcotimes.com: ‘This is apparently an ongoing battle between the two girls about boys. This mom sends a really great message [said sarcastically]. ‘She knew they were squabbling and said she was going to take care of it. The woman brought her daughter to the parking lot to commit a crime. One of them could have been seriously injured. This is stupid parenting.’ The fight was broken up by passing officers. Holton was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, endangering the welfare of children and two counts of corruption of minors, but argued that she was doing the right thing, according to the affidavit. She told the police: ‘These girls have been having issues at the school with each other, so I let them handle it.

"This is the moment a man pretending to be a taxi driver was pictured prowling the streets of Newcastle before he kidnapped and sexually abused a 20-year-old woman. Stalking the streets, businessman Mohammed Malik is caught on CCTV picking up a drunk 20-year-old who thought he was a taxi driver. The victim got into Malik's car near The Gate complex, on Newgate Street, and asked to be taken the short distance to the place in the city centre where she was staying with friends. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Malik captured on CCTV cameras driving the streets on the very evening he picked up a 20-year-old woman - who thought he was a taxi driver - and subjected her to a sexual assault . Another image showing Mohammed Malik prowling the streets of Newcastle before picking the woman up . Other CCTV camera footage from the night shows Malik, who is circled, entering local stores . Instead Malik drove her to the West End of Newcastle, parked up in a secluded spot and subjected the young woman to a horrific sex attack. He was snared after three men spotted the woman getting into the car and texted the registration number to police. Now the 30-year-old of Arthur's Hill, Newcastle, is facing years in prison after a jury at Newcastle Crown Court convicted him of kidnap and sexual assault. Prosecutor Julian Smith said the 20-year-old victim was a visitor to the city and had been out celebrating a birthday with friends in March when she started looking for a taxi around 4am. Mr Smith said: 'The complainant found herself drunk and alone, looking for a taxi. Malik was found guilty of kidnay and sexual assault by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court . 'Unfortunately for her, the car she got into, believing it to be a taxi, was nothing of the sort. She found herself in the defendant's car, who drove her to a secluded area to the west of the city, away from the city centre. 'He took her away under false pretences, he would not let her leave and he then took the opportunity to seriously sexually assault her.' The court heard the young woman and her friends had been to a number of bars and ended up in a takeaway near The Gate, at which point the 20-year-old left and went looking for a cab. She was unsuccessful in trying to hail a taxi outside Sinners bar and so started walking towards the Haymarket, up Newgate Street. Mr Smith said: 'At that point the defendant's car comes into view driving down the road away from the Haymarket and it stops in the lay-by taxi rank outside Debenhams. She approaches him and speaks to him then gets in the car.' Malik, who manages a number of properties, including a takeaway, drove off with the woman in his VW Golf estate. Three men passing by saw the woman getting into the car, which they noticed was not a taxi. They made a note of the registration number and texted it to police. Malik then drove up Elswick Road with the kidnapped woman, parking up in a secluded spot on Bentinck Road, Elswick. Despite her screams of protest, he pulled her into the back seat by her arms and legs and subjected her to a sexual assault. It was sometime after Malik's (far left) trip to this shop that he found his victim at a taxi stand . Mr Smith said: 'He would have known she was lost because she told him she was not from round here. 'It lasted some time and eventually, despite having no clue where she was, she told him he made her sick and had the courage to leave the car. She met two drunken good Samaritans who stayed with her.' Malik then reappeared in his car, acting as if nothing had happened and asking if she was going to get back in. She refused and the passers-by flagged down a genuine taxi to take her back to her friends. Police were called and when the woman was examined they found bruising to her arms and legs. Malik was arrested later the same day as a result of his number plate having been sent to the police. His DNA was also recovered from the victim's clothing. Malik, who had denied kidnap and sexual assault, will be sentenced next month. He was remanded in custody and faces a significant jail term. Judge John Milford told him: 'Doubtless you have been warned as to the sort of sentence you are likely to receive in terms of years.'","Businessman pretended to be taxi driver in order to sexually assault woman .

"When it comes to drinking champagne, Marie Antoinette has a lot to answer for. It’s said that the first champagne glasses, produced in the 18th century, were modelled on the French queen’s breasts. Well, all I can say is that she must have had very small breasts — the flat, bowl-shaped glasses that resulted are terrible for drinking champagne. Experts say that we are using the wrong champagne glasses as traditional flutes let out bubbles and aroma . The same goes for the glasses recently created which were based on the model Kate Moss’s left breast as a stunt for a Mayfair restaurant. The problem with these shallow coupes is that they don’t retain the bubbles or the aroma. The unique selling point of champagne is a perfect wine that is laboriously and expensively made sparkling — so it’s crazy to let the fizz escape. The swizzle-sticks popular in the Twenties presented the same problem. These little instruments — like a tiny chimney sweep’s brush with a silver handle — were used to dissipate the bubbles. What lunacy! They were just silly fashion accessories. What you want to do to enjoy champagne at its best is to maintain its ‘mousse’ — or sparkle — and you want it to be fine, delicate and persistent. But if you allow all the bubbles to leap out of the glass as soon as the champagne is poured, you’re losing this effervescence much too quickly. That’s why shallow open glasses have, over time, given way to the taller, narrower flute in which the drink is now commonly served. But now some experts are suggesting than champagne drinkers should ditch flutes in favour of nothing more special than an ordinary wine glass. Frederico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for drinks giant Pernod Ricard, says a plain wine glass emphasises the bubbles and aroma in more complex champagnes . Their reasoning is that higher-end brands taste better in a broader glass. Frederico Lleonart, global wine ambassador for drinks giant Pernod Ricard, says a plain wine glass emphasises the bubbles and aroma in more complex champagnes. However, he does say simpler sparkling wines (such as prosecco or cava) should be served in flutes to keep the drink colder for longer and to show off the bubbles better. I understand why Monsieur Lleonart recommends a white wine glass. It has a larger bowl narrowing to a smaller rim, so hangs on to the bubbles and captures the aroma at the top of the glass — right under the drinker’s nose. However, I believe the perfect glasses are those produced by the champagne houses themselves, such as Krug. Tall but generously-rounded before tapering to the lip, these are great at holding on to the liquid’s fizz and aroma. (In the champagne houses, they will also only serve a little bit of their precious champagne at a time in a glass — so you appreciate the drink properly.) Simpler sparkling wines (such as prosecco or cava) should be served in flutes to keep the drink colder for longer and to show off the bubbles better . Still, there’s no reason to throw out your flutes. Indeed, they are much favoured. Part of the point of champagne for many people is the luxury aspect — and a flute signals luxury to anyone looking on. People enjoy the theatre of it all. But the fact is that they are often straight-sided rather than tapering, which means the sparkle escapes more easily and the aroma doesn’t collect. Ideally, the sides of the glass should turn in at the top in a tulip shape. Even so, flutes are a lot better than anything inspired by Marie Antoinette, and preferable to the ice cream cornet-style ones, too. Fortunately, they went out of fashion in the Eighties when it was thought chic to mix champagne with orange juice to make Buck’s Fizz. They were a nightmare to clean because the citrus ‘bits’ got stuck at the bottom of the cone. I’m not against these new-design glasses, where a little scuff at the bottom makes the bubbles shoot up like a geyser inside the glass. Very dramatic! But Y-shaped cocktail glasses are a total no-no — they certainly let the bubbles out too fast. If you have some very special champagne, try one of the grander glasses — narrow at the top, with a wide bowl below. Give it a try and you’ll start to taste champagne differently. Of course, the enjoyment of champagne is really down to the choice of bottle — not the glass. A key to great champagne is maturity. I find Pol Roger consistently delicious, but if you want to buy a cheaper champagne and still enjoy the mature, fuller-bodied, smoother flavour, then buy it and keep it (on its side) for a year or more and it’ll improve enormously. I’ve done that to special offer Heidsieck (£15 a bottle). Works a treat! Regardless of what you choose, you will need glass that is sparkling clean because bubbles will attach themselves to any whisper of fluff. And it’s crucial, too, to rinse properly as a remnant of detergent will kill off the fizz. Temperature is also important. A study by the University of Reims (in the middle of France’s champagne region) suggested the local drink should be served at room temperature — 18c — because it produces more bubbles. But if you open yours at that temperature, watch out for the cork. The pressure in a bottle of champagne is the same as in a London bus tyre. Let it warm and the additional force could have your eye out. Also, you’re likely to lose half the contents of the bottle. I keep my champagne in a wine fridge at 8c. I open it at a 45-degree angle, which allows the pressure to escape without blowing out the liquid. Then, holding the cork, twist the bottle slowly to ease it out — the noise should be like a duchess passing wind! Don’t let it go off like you’ve won a Grand Prix. Pour into a glass — also held at 45 degrees so the liquid doesn’t foam out — sit down and enjoy one of the most delicious drinks in the world.","Flat, bowl-shaped glasses and flutes don't retain the bubbles or aroma .

"A woman teacher died after taking a cocktail of drugs at a nightclub called Six Feet Under, an inquest heard. Mother-of-one Sarah Mayhew, 30, suffered a heart attack in the nightclub car park after having a fatal reaction to the party drugs. Miss Mayhew took a cocktail of all three drugs in her hotel room with friends before going to the Six Feet Under nightclub. Tragic: Mother-of-one Sarah Mayhew, 30, who died after taking a cocktail of drugs in a nightclub called Six Feet Under in Newport, South Wales . The secondary school teacher had taken a combination of ecstasy, cocaine and mephedrone known as meow, meow. Police Inspector Denis Lewis told the inquest that the single mother became 'very ill' inside the club. But he said there were no signs she had been forced to take any of the drugs. A post mortem examination found her death was caused by a combination of mephedrone and ecstacy toxicity. An inquest heard Miss Mayhew travelled from her home city of Bristol to Newport, South Wales, to meet her boyfriend at a Travelodge in the city. Teacher: Miss Mayhewwas Head of House at King's Oak Academy, a specialist maths and computing college in Kingswood, Gloucestershire . Club: Six Feet Under in Newport where the teacher was partying before she collapsed . Gwent Coroner's Court heard levels of the drugs found were consistent with recreational use and that alcohol levels found in her body were 'negligible'. A pathologist report said the combined effect of the drugs was the reason for her death in the early hours of September 30 last year. Coroner David Bowen recorded a verdict of misadventure. He said: 'I am satisfied she voluntarily ingested drugs and she did not intend or foresee the tragic circumstances of those actions.'

"A thug who carried out horrifying acts of torture for Robert Mugabe escaped jail yesterday – despite earning £151,000 while working illegally in Britain. Phillip Machemedze, 47, was able to work here for seven years as a carer for those with learning disabilities and on a unit dealing with drug and alcohol addicts. He was able to secure the jobs by  showing a letter from the Home Office, a National Insurance number and birth and marriage certificates. These documents were not checked properly in a series of failures. Asylum: Phillip Machemedze, a former henchman of Robert Mugabe, earned £151,000 while working illegally in Britain . There was outrage earlier this year when he was allowed to stay in Britain to protect his human rights. An immigration court in May ruled he must be allowed to stay because he could face mistreatment if sent back to Zimbabwe. Yesterday he admitted breaking immigration rules – but was told he will not be jailed if he volunteers for just half a day a week for the next six months. Dictator: Robert Mugabe's former henchman was working as a carer . Machemedze – who is now jobless and . trying to claim benefits – admitted two charges of obtaining pecuniary . advantage by deception. Judge . Julian Lambert deferred sentencing for six months, but told him he had . to work for half a day a week at his local Pentecostal church. ‘I require you to work hard with your church to make better the lives of the poor and needy,’ he said. ‘You . should bring letters to show the good work you have done. I expect you . to devote half a day each week to serving the community through your . church. If I see you have done good work when you return and I have your . promise that you will continue that good work I shall give you your . liberty.’ Machemedze, from Bristol, worked as a bodyguard in Mugabe’s feared Central Intelligence Organisation. An immigration hearing heard he . committed ‘savage acts of extreme violence’, including torturing . numerous political opponents of the Mugabe regime. He smashed one victim’s jaw with a  pair of pliers, before pulling out one of  their teeth. Another victim was electrocuted, . slapped, beaten and punched unconscious and a woman victim  was taken to . an underground cell where she was stripped naked and whipped. Machemedze admitted putting salt in her wounds. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who represents . Kingswood, Bristol, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that our system allows these . people who have committed crimes elsewhere to remain in this country. Escape: Machemedze leaves Bristol Crown Court yesterday after learning he will not be jailed . ‘It’s ludicrous that people can hide . behind human rights acts in order to prevent themselves from being sent . back to their own country to face justice.’ Yesterday Richard Posner, prosecuting, . told Bristol Crown Court that Machemedze arrived at Gatwick Airport . from Zimbabwe in July 2000 and was given a six-month visitor visa which . banned him from working. But he stayed in Britain, working . illegally as a carer at the adolescent unit within The Priory, a drug . and alcohol recovery hospital, in Stapleton, Bristol, from June 2005 to . May 2010. He also worked as a support worker for . the Milestones Trust, a learning disabilities and mental health charity . from May 2003 to May 2010. In April 2005 bosses at the Milestones . Trust were tipped off that Machemedze was working illegally but after . Machemedze showed them the Home Office letter the matter was dropped. Mr Posner told the court: ‘At a . subsequent meeting the defendant provided a letter from the Home Office . confirming he was allowed to work in the UK. ‘That letter was deemed satisfactory and he was allowed to continue to work. ‘This case is primarily the use of . that Home Office letter in order to create a deception that the . defendant was allowed to work here.’ The court was told that in the seven years he had worked Machemedze took home a net income of around £151,000. Jane Chamberlain, defending, said her . client had indefinite leave to remain in the country and was allowed to . work but was now unemployed and seeking benefits. Machemedze’s wife . Febbie had been granted asylum.","Philip Machemedze broke the jaw of one victim with pliers in Zimbabwe .

"A mother savagely attacked as she shopped with her infant child at a Bed Bath and Beyond store was taken by such surprise that she didn't realize she was being stabbed, a family member says. Kerri Dalton, 29, of Keansburg, New Jersey, is recovering in a hospital after she was stabbed nearly two dozen times on Thursday evening. She was reportedly shopping for curtains and pushing her five-month-old daughter Anna Lynne in a stroller at the Middletown store when she was suddenly stabbed from behind. Attacked: Kerri Dalton is recovering in a hospital after the vicious stabbing attack on Thursday evening . On the mend: Mrs Dalton has been listed in good condition following Thursday's attack . Both of her lungs were punctured in the attack. Stunned and covered in blood, she managed to call 911. A family member said yesterday Mrs Dalton was caught her so off-guard that she didn't understand what was going on. Her brother-in-law, Charles Dalton, told the New York Post: 'She just felt, like, pricks at her neck, like someone would tap your shoulder. She didn’t realize she was getting stabbed at first.' The baby was unharmed. Mrs Dalton's alleged attacker, Tyrik Haynes, 19, was charged with attempted murder on Friday and held on $1million bail. He had previously been charged with torturing a cat a month ago. Dalton experienced significant blood loss and was airlifted from the Middletown store to Jersey Shore Medical Center where she was stabilized. Attacked: Kerri Dalton was brutally stabbed over a dozen times while shopping with her infant son in a New Jersey Bed, Bath & Beyond . Tyrik Haynes was charged with attempted murder, child endangerment, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon in his first court appearance on Friday . She is now in good condition. Kerri's husband, Roger Dalton, told CBS on Friday: 'She’s holding up, she's strong, she's a fighter, she's my best friend.' 'I want to thank everyone for keeping us in their prayers,' Mr Dalton continued. 'She’s a newborn mother; thank God the baby wasn’t touched,' he added. 'This guy came out of nowhere and I love my wife.' Meanwhile, in his first court . appearance on Friday, Haynes was charged with attempted murder, child . endangerment, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and . unlawful possession of a weapon. This . isn't his first brush with the law. In December, Haynes was charged . with animal cruelty for setting a cat on fire on Christmas Eve. Kerri Dalton was attacked with no warning and stabbed over a dozen times by a stranger with a knife . Suburban horror: At this Middletown, New Jersey Bed, Bath, & Beyond, a woman was stabbed over a dozen times by an apparent stranger . The Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told Asbury Park Press that Haynes was charged with using a lighter and aerosol spray to ignite the box while the animal was inside. The cat escaped but was later found dead from its injuries. Haynes is due in municipal court for that crime on February 11. Workers at the Petco on the same strip as the Bed, Bath & Beyond where Kerri Dalton was stabbed told reporters that Haynes often went into the store to stare at the animals. Clinical psychologist Dr Bart Rossi told CBS that cruelty to animals is often a prelude to violence against humans. 'This is not the result of a couple of bad days or a bad month. This is someone that’s developed personality problems over time,' Rossi said. Tyrik Haynes was charged with setting fire to a cat at Christmas .

"With expansive terraces, outdoor showers and loungers positioned to soak up every single ray of light, these spectacular apartments would not look out of place in sun-kissed California. However, the £6million penthouses are not to be found in the world's technology capital Silicon Valley. Instead they nestle in the rather less temperate climes of Silicon Roundabout, a traffic-snarled hub in London which is home to some of Britain's most forward thinking companies.

"A mother has been banned from a Florida elementary school after she complained about being asked to hide her breastfeeding on campus. Maegan Shoemaker, 25, was stunned when the principal approached her as she sat in the bleachers at Plew Elementary School in Niceville during her niece's track practice on Wednesday. She learned that another parent had complained about how she was breastfeeding her eight-month-old daughter Arya in view of the fifth-graders' athletics session. But the married mother insisted that she had made sure the students couldn't see her by sitting behind a barrier. Banned: Maegan Shoemaker, left with her husband Eric and right with her daughter Arya, has been banned from her niece's elementary school for getting angry when she was asked to hide her breastfeeding . 'When [babies are] hungry, they're hungry,' Shoemaker told the Northwest Florida Daily News. 'I don't eat under a cover, and I don't expect my children to eat under a cover.' But Principal Carolyn McAllister argued that  children could see her, proving a distraction. When Shoemaker went to the office  to explain that it was her right to breastfeed there and that she had done nothing wrong, McAllister said she became 'belligerent'. Shoemaker said: 'I wasn't backing down and I was standing my ground, but I wasn't violent.' She left on foot with her baby daughter and a few minutes later, the school's resource officer and McAllister caught up with her in a patrol car. They issued her a trespassing warning which bars her from entering school grounds for the rest of the school year. Scene: Shoemaker, 25, was watching her niece's weekly track practice outside the Florida school, pictured, when a parent complained to staff and the principal told her to be more discreet . Shoemaker usually collects her niece from school every afternoon and attends her parent-teacher conferences and school activities, which she will now not be able to do. McAllister said that she never told the young mother that she couldn't breastfeed and only asked her to do it so the children couldn't see. Shoemaker said she thinks this is more damaging to the children. 'Breasts are so... sexualized that they can't be used for their intended purpose,' she said. 'And that, to me, is wrong.' Since the fallout, Shoemaker has been vocal on Facebook about her treatment and others have supported her by sharing images reading: 'Nursing in public - not a crime! I stand with Maegan.'","Maegan Shoemaker, 25, was breastfeeding her eight-month-old daughter as she watched her niece's weekly sports practice .

"A survivor of the devastating Maine fire that tore through a home after a Halloween party has paid tribute to three of the five victims in a choking, guilt-ridden tribute. Nathan Long woke up to the smell of smoke at around 7am in the two-apartment building. By then the blaze - thought to be the worst in Maine for 30 years - was so ferocious he was forced to jump to safety from his window. Today he paid tribute to his flatmates David Bragdon Jr, Ashley Thomas and Nikki Finlay in a heart-rending Facebook post that read: 'The smoke was coming so fast, … so intense. ... The fact I didn't have one minute to kick in doors and save you will eat at me for the rest of my life.'

Survivor: Nathan Long woke to the smell of smoke but the fire was so strong he was forced to jump to safety . Bragdon's father, David Bragdon Sr, confirmed his 27-year-old son, a waiter at the Great Lost Bear restaurant nearby, is among the victims killed on Saturday morning. He says his son lived in the home and  hasn't been heard from since the fire. Bragdon, his eyes filling with tears, talked to reporters outside the house, saying: 'Is it true? Is it real? It's hard not knowing 100 per cent.' Kevin Bragdon, 20, on Saturday described his brother as a 'kind-hearted person. He would give you the shirt right off his back,' the Portland Press Herald reported. Ashley Thomas was a photographer for the wedding and lifestyle image firm she set up with her boyfriend of seven years, Mat Garber, called Mat & Ash Photography. Garber today posted a picture of the couple together, which has received numerous comments and tributes. Nikki Finlay had recently taken up a job at a local cafe and play center Greenlight Studios.

The fire swept through a two-apartment building near the University of Southern Maine's commuter campus, completely gutting the two-story structure after a Halloween party. It was reported at 7:17 a.m. on Saturday morning in Portland Maine. But it remains unclear if any of the victims were students and police are trying to find out more information about those who died. The fire is being described as Maine's deadliest fire in the past 30 years. Search: Investigators spent hours extinguishing the blaze that tore through the two-apartment building . Questions: One person managed to jump from a window but it is not known who the five victims are . Devastation: The fire which was reported at 7am on Saturday is thought to be the worst in Maine for 30 years . State fire marshals' spokesman Steve McCausland said: 'We do not know whether the victims are residents of the home or guests.' Initial reports suggested that the victims were students but McCausland later said they weren't. Portland Fire Chief Jerry LaMoria also said he didn't know if any of the victims were students. It was first thought that several people were unaccounted for after the fire, but by later in the day, authorities were unsure how many, if any, were still missing. One person suffered severe burns and jumped from a second-story window. He was reported in critical condition in the burn unit of a Boston hospital, McCausland said. A second person was treated and released from a hospital and seven people escaped from the burning building. Meanwhile, two bodies were found on the second floor and two others on the third floor. From the outside, one side of the building looked severely damaged by flames. Flames could be seen shooting out of the roof at the height of the fire and local residents surrounded the scene.

They both jumped onto a porch roof, then to the ground, where he saw the badly burned body of another person. 'I feel pretty lucky. I'm kind of numb,' Long told the newspaper.

"An Ohio Army veteran who lost the fight with local officials over therapy ducks that he says ease his post-traumatic stress disorder and depression vowed to continue fighting. Darin Welker, 36, was found guilty of a minor misdemeanor on Wednesday and fined $50 plus court fees for keeping farm animals in West Lafayette in violation of municipal law. 'The ordinance says there are no ducks, then there are no ducks,' prosecutor James Skelton told Judge Timothy France according to the Coshocton Tribune. 'Your hands are tied.' Therapy: Ohio vet Darin Welker, 36 says he will continue fighting to keep his 6 ducks, which a judge ruled to be in violation of a village ordinance . West Lafayette, about 80 miles from Columbus, passed an ordinance in 2010 that prohibited residents from keeping 'live poultry or fowl of any kind' including ducks within village limits. Welker's wife, Shirley Wagner, testified that the ducks are registered with a national emotional support animal service and that no neighbors have brought complaints about them to the family. Judge France said he was favorable to the idea, but that the laws 'make sense' and should be enforced. West Lafayette amended the ordinance in September to include allowances for two therapy animals per household, but the animals require approval from village council and a medial provider. According to the Daily News, Welker isn't giving up yet, saying, 'I'm gonna take it to the very end and push it as far as it can be pushed.' Welker served one tour of duty in Iraq with the Army National guard in 2005, a particularly violent period of the war. Ducks: Welker adopted 10 Pekin ducks and 4 mallards when they were days old, though later gave away 8 of his ducks . He returned with a back back. and the Department of Veteran Affairs paid for surgery in 2012, but did not cover physical therapy his doctor recommended and provided no mental health coverage. In March, Welker adopted 14 ducks when they were just days old. Though he later gave 8 away, he said keeping the ducks has eased his PTSD and depression, and led to taking less medication. 'Taking care of them is both mental and physical therapy,' said Welker. 'Watching them 'keeps you entertained for hours at a time.' 'He can come out if he's having real bad day and pick them up,' Wagner told WBNS. 'Talk to them, bare his soul to them and they're not going to tell a soul.' A Change petition directed at Mayor Jack Patterson circulated in July after news of the local battle became national news, garnering over 80,000 signatures. Patterson himself seemed baffled by the attention, and says that Welker can still keep two of the ducks under the village's amended ordinance. 'As long as they're less than 20 pounds each, he can have two therapy animals of whatever he wants and that's the ordinance and he knows that,' Patterson said.","Darin Welker, 36, was found guilty of a minor misdemeanor for keeping fowl in violation of West Lafayette village law .

"A stunning young beauty contest winner is using her title to raise awareness of disability. Nicole Kelly, 23, from Davenport in Iowa, America, beat off hundreds of rivals to take the Miss Iowa 2014 crown and is now hoping to encourage children with disabilities to pursue their dreams. The Theatre Management university graduate was born without a left forearm, but has never let anything hold her back. Nicole Kelly poses in a bejeweled gown and her Miss Iowa 2014 crown in Davenport . Before winning the pageant last June, Nicole worked on a Broadway play in New York and credits the experience for boosting her confidence and preparing her for the pageant. 'As I grew up I learned to counterbalance the initial stares I received from people with an outgoing personality that would not give in to no,' she said. 'This means that I tried everything. From baseball, to dance, to diving - there is nothing I would not try. 'I found my passion within a world where I was giving people permission to stare - the stage.' The beauty queen with one arm is  hoping to encourage children with disabilities to pursue their dreams . Now Nicole uses her position to speak about disability in schools and supports a programme providing art opportunities for people with special needs. And an important part of her work is meeting with parents of children with disabilities. 'Meeting the parents of amputee and physically differently-abled children has been a shocking experience at times,' she said. 'I had assumed everyone else's parents would be like mine, but many are far more concerned about limiting their child's lives to protect them from harm. She was born without a left forearm, but has never let anything hold her back . 'I saw then that I could make a change by showing these parents that their child can and should be able to do anything they want. 'Once parents accept this, it makes such a huge difference to how their child experiences and responds to their difference.' Now Nicole has launched a campaign called 'the power of one' to encourage people to embrace their differences. 'Every day I am out in the community speaking with people,' she said. 'I encourage people to share their stories about how they've felt different and celebrate it.' Now Nicole supports a programme providing art opportunities for people with special needs .","Nicole Kelly, 23, from Davenport, beat off hundreds to win Miss Iowa 2014 .

"The California 'nanny from hell' who made headlines earlier this year when she refused to leave her employers' home clashed on national TV with the family, accusing them of treating her like an animal. Diane Stratton, 64, gained international notoriety in early June when Marcella Bracamonte, 31, went to the press accusing the baby sitter of refusing to do any work around the house and then trying to take over their residence. When the family tried to force her out, Stratton told them that she had no intention of going anywhere. No holds barred: The Bracamontes (left) and Diane Stratton appeared on Dr Phil to air out their grievances in the infamous 'squatter nanny' case . War of words: Diane Stratton (left) accused her ex-employer, Marcella Bracamonte (right), of turning her life into a living hell and treating her like a dog . After a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations, claims of abusive behavior on the part of the Bracamontes and dozens of articles and TV segments, Stratton finally left the family's Upland home in August. On an episode of Dr Phil that aired Friday, Marcella Bracamonte and her husband, Ralph, once again came face to face with the infamous 'squatter nanny' to air out their grievances. During one fiery exchange between Marcella Bracamonte and Ms Stratton, the 31-year-old homeowner declared that had the nanny done the bare minimum of housework, she would still have a roof over her head today. But the 64-year-old woman insisted in response that she had done well beyond bare minimum while working for the Upland family. Stretton says when she answered the advert she was homeless and in poor health . Stretton has even filed paperwork to try and force the Bracamontes OUT of their own home, pictured here . Sitting opposite from Stratton, Mrs Bracamonte suggested that when they hired her off Craigslist in March, she entered their home armed with a plan to use a law pertaining to squatters in order to force them out of their own house – an allegation that Stratton vehemently denied. On her part, the 64-year-old caretaker accused her ex-employers of turning her life in their house into a living hell by deliberately blasting loud music from a speaker set up outside her door. Stratton claimed that Mrs Bracamonte dehumanized her by placing cans of dog food outside her room. 'You also yelled at me and told me I was a dog,' she said.'You are a vicious, malicious person.'. As the dispute grew more acrimonious, Marcella Bracamonte questioned Ms Stratton’s sanity. ‘Have you ever been evaluated?’ she demanded to know. ‘Do you have any mental issues?’ The taping of the daytime talk show was also attended by Stratton’s sister, who revealed that the 64-year-old sued her approximately 10 times over the years. United front: The Bracamontes insisted that they were in the right because Stratton was trying to force them out of their own house . 'You tried your best to break me, but I'm still standing,' the estranged sister told Stratton from the audience. 'It's time for you to stop.' Marcella . Bracamonte, 31, told MailOnline in a June interview when Stretton moved in things began well and she and . Ralph, 35, baked a cake for their baby daughter’s birthday with her . help. The photo of the nanny grinning with the freshly baked cake has now been beamed around the world. Marcella . said: 'She moved in the week of March 4 and March 8 was my baby’s . birthday, so that picture was taken March 7, we all made a cake . together. It was fun, I thought how fun, we could do this again every . year, I planned on her staying a long time, and she could have stayed a . long time she just had to help me.' The nanny also settled in quickly and would use the family’s swimming pool. Marcella . said: 'She would get in her bathing suit, come out have a beer with us, . barbecue, music. She liked it. She would sit in the layout chairs and . sunbathe she would go in the inflatable and lie in the pool.' However . the first signs of trouble came three weeks in when she began to refuse . to do housework or watch the children if Marcella - who had wanted to . set up her own business at home - wanted to go out for meetings. Had enough: Mother-of-three Marcella Bracamonte said she chose to speak out about what happened to her family to stop Diane Stretton doing it to anyone else . She said:  'After three weeks she would be like leaning on things and acting out of breath [while cleaning the floor]. My house is not very dirty… there was not a lot of work you had to do. 'All of a sudden it was like '‘It’s so hot in here'', ''You need to put the air on'’. 'I would make her breakfast, lunch and dinner she never came and helped me prepare those meals, but she was there to eat it and this was from day one. 'I asked her to clean her bathroom, she did it but then she threw a fit, she stomped out of the bathroom, went to her room, slammed the door and stayed in there the whole day and never came out….. She said it was too hard. She was like a teenager, it was like taking care of another child. It was like she felt she was entitled to us taking care of her.' Stretton didn’t mention her health problems when she took the job. Stumped: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte with their three children, ages, 11, 4 and one . Marcella said: 'She never told me she had COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) when I hired her, she told me nothing, she said she was perfectly happy. I said ‘'is there anything you can tell me that might prevent you performing this job?'’ and she said no.' Mr Bracamonte admitted she made a mistake hiring Stretton but believed publicizing it as she has will stop the nanny from doing it to anyone else. She said: 'I buy a lot of things from Craigslist, I’ve never met a psycho in my life except for her.' Asked what her message is to Stretton, a defiant Marcella said:  'If I could say one thing to her right now, it would be ‘'You can never do this again and get away with it, you will go the rest of your life now being labeled and I did this for everybody you victimized because it’s not right. You’re never going to do this again''.' Careful: Mrs Bracamonte, pictured with her children, said she carried out background checks on the woman . Diane Stretton claims the Bracamonte family took advantage of her when she moved into their home . In an interview with ABC's 20/20 in July, Stratton, on her part, said that she felt exploited by the family and insisted that she was the victim. She said that the initial job offer - light help around the home and watching over the children in return for free bed and board - had seemed like the ideal solution. But she claims that the work load was unreasonably added too, and said the couple took advantage because they knew she had nowhere else to go. In July, it was reported Stratton has been involved in at least six legal dispute since 2005, mainly involving her relatives - among her her own son.","Diane Stretton, 64, and the Bracamonte family aired out their grievances on Dr Phil show Friday .

"Victim: Model Derryn Gaiger, 18, was beaten and mugged by Lauren Simpson, 19, for a cigarette . A young model was mugged for her phone by a teenager who told her 'I'm going to gouge your eyes out' after demanding a cigarette. Derryn Gaiger, 18, was beaten by Lauren Simpson, 19, from Barry, South Wales, who has been jailed for a year despite being due to give birth next month. Cardiff Crown Court heard Miss Gaiger had lost modelling assignments because of her injuries and suffers flashbacks and insomnia because of the attack. On August 8 last year she was walking home in the dark when Simpson confronted her and demanded she handed over a cigarette. Prosecutor Tracey Lloyd-Nesling told her: 'Simpson grabbed her and repeatedly punched her to the face. 'She put her hand over her mouth to stop her calling for help, held her by the throat and head and threatened to gouge out her eyes. 'Her Blackberry mobile phone was taken in the assault.' Catalogue model Derryn was treated in hospital for her injuries and later identified Simpson through her Facebook profile. Mother-to-be Simpson, of Penarth, Cardiff, later admitted actual bodily harm and theft. Stephen Jeary, for the defence, said a suspended sentence was suitable because she was due to give birth next month. But Simpson wept in the dock as she was sent to a young offenders' institution for 12 months. In shock: Miss Gaiger, who is also an actress, had lost modelling assignments because of her injuries and suffers flashbacks and insomnia because of the attack . Judge Neil Bidder QC described Simpson as 'a very violent young woman'. He told her: 'It was a mean offence. You caused your victim to suffer an utterly terrifying experience that she will never forget. 'You recognised your victim's fear, assaulted her repeatedly and threatened to gouge out her eyes' He added: 'I regret the fact that you will give birth in custody.'","Derryn Gaiger, 18, was beaten by Lauren Simpson, 19, in South Wales .

"A love doctor who blossomed from a tragic teen to a top relationship guru now earns up to £100,000 a year dishing out dating advice. Hayley Quinn makes her living helping desperate men and women to get over their dating hang-ups and take control of their love lives. Since first helping a hapless romantic find love around five years ago, she has become one of the nation's most in-demand love gurus and is booked around-the-clock. Scroll down for video . The love doctor: Hayley Quinn, 27, makes her living helping desperate men and women to get over their dating hang-ups and take control of their love lives - for £200 a session . The Londoner has helped more than 100,000 men to fight their fear of approaching women, but the dating expert hasn't always been so lucky in love herself. The 27-year-old says she 'repelled' boys until she was in her 20's and even her first kiss at 14 turned out to be a cruel 50p joke set up by the school heartthrob and his friends. Hayley said: 'I was not an attractive teenager - I looked awful. I was overweight, I had bad hair, braces, hand-me-down clothes, bad skin - I was a total geek, I just repelled boys. 'I was crippled with shyness, anxiety and self-doubt all throughout school and university - and even though my looks improved as I got older, I was still painfully shy. Changed woman: She admits she 'repelled' boys until she was into her 20's (right) and even her first kiss at 14 turned out to be a cruel 50p set up by the school heartthrob and his friends but she's 'learned the hard way' how to engage with people and is now cashing in on it (left) Hitch: Since first helping a hapless romantic find love around five years ago, she has become one of the nation's most in-demand love gurus and is booked around-the-clock . 'That feeling stuck with me for years. And I had to learn the hard way how to engage with people. 'Even my first kiss was tragic - it is so embarrassing thinking back. I was completely in love with this boy at school, totally obsessed, and he came over and asked me for a kiss at a school disco. 'I couldn't believe it, and then he came over and did it again. I felt like the luckiest girl in the world, I thought everything was going really well. 'But it turned out that his friends had bet him 50p to kiss me, and they didn't believe he had done it the first time, so they made him do it again.' The real life answer to Hitch has struggled to hold down a serious relationship, enjoying the single life and preferring casual flings with both men and women. But after years of helping others find their soulmates, she has eventually found true love of her own and bagged her 'dream man', 27-year-old singer/songwriter and music producer Dan. Business: Hayley says she has blossomed from a tragic teen to a top relationship guru - and now she's earning £100,000 a year dishing out dating advice to hopeless romantics . Hayley added: 'When I met Dan I wasn't looking for a relationship, I was really happy being single. And I am bisexual so I guess you could say I was enjoying the best of both worlds. 'It took him months to get me to agree to a date. But now we've been together a year and everything has been amazing ever since. 'He is my absolute dream man - he's the guy I would have had plastered all over my bedroom walls when I was younger. 'At work, I teach my clients to strive for what they want most and to customise their relationships so it works for them and their individual needs. 'That is the type of relationship Dan and I have - he understands that I am bisexual and if I wanted to date a women, he is cool with that, he doesn't see it as a threat. He understands that it is all part of who I am.' Tricks of the trade: Hayley says she teaches her clients to strive for what they want most and customises their relationships so it works for them and their individual needs . With a lack of personal experience under her belt, Hayley fell into the world of dating expertise after a chance meeting with a pick-up artist involved with the controversial book 'The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists'. After slating the 'repulsive' book on Twitter, Hayley was contacted by one of the writers and arranged to meet up - shortly after, with a job offer as a ghost writer, she hopped on a plane and moved to New York. It was there that she learnt the art of picking up women and started dishing out advice to love-lorn men - writing the diaries of a 'London playboy'. She said: 'It was completely by luck that I got into this business. While I was at university my then boyfriend was obsessed with the book 'The Game'. Teen years: Hayley was shunned by boys as a teenage - a feeling that stuck with her for years leaving her crippled with shyness . 'But I thought it was disgusting and I took to Twitter - one of the guys saw my Twitter rant and got in touch with me asking to meet when he was next in London. 'He thought my writing was really witty and next thing I knew I was on a plane moving to New York to ghost write for them. 'Through working with these pick-up artists I learnt everything there was to know about how to pick up women and dating. 'Everyone deserves to find that special someone. When I work with people - regardless of looks, age, gender - I like to think I really see that person, I see something that is attractive in everyone. 'A lot of the people I work with are how I used to be - anxious, shy, nervous - but these are the jobs that I value the most. They are so much more rewarding.' Hayley charges around £200 for her private 90-minute tuition sessions and also holds seminars, speaks at events, writes regular columns for newspapers and magazines such as Men's Health.

"This is the terrifying moment bus passengers were caught in the path of an oncoming freight train after the driver ignored warning lights and ended up on a level crossing. The City Red bus was stranded across a hatched yellow box in Southampton, Hampshire, as the goods train hurtled towards it and coming to a halt just yards away. The incident is now at the centre of an investigation by the British Transport Police and bosses at First UK Bus, which runs the service. Scroll down for video . This is the horrifying moment a freight train almost collides with a bus after it's caught on a level crossing . It is thought the driver of the City Red bus ignored red flashing danger lights and loud sirens as it sat in traffic . The train driver, who had just dropped cargo off at Southampton docks, was forced to slam on the brakes . It is thought the driver of the number 11 bus ignored red flashing danger lights and loud sirens as he sat in a queue of traffic on Canute Road. And when the tailbacks failed to shift, his vehicle and its helpless passengers were left on the tracks of the advancing freight train. The cargo train had just offloaded 36 carriages of various goods at Southampton docks and was making its return journey. The terrifying moment was captured by Bradley Hurrion, 17, from Hythe near the city. Terrified passengers can be seen at the back of the bus as the freight train hurtles towards them . The train slowly approached the crossing as sirens blared and people waited to cross and was able to halt . He said: ‘It is quite alarming. I was just wondering whether the bus was going to stop and was worried for the welfare of the passengers.’ Bus chiefs have admitted their vehicle should have never entered the boxed junction at the level crossing. A First UK Bus spokesman said the fact a driver entered the area without being able to clear it immediately, as the Highway Code insists, was something ‘of concern to us’. A statement said: ‘We are extremely concerned at what we have seen on this footage. ‘We have launched an immediate investigation into what happened. Safety is one of our highest priorities. ‘While thankfully this incident did not result in a collision, we will conduct a thorough investigation into what happened and will then take whatever action is deemed appropriate as a result.” A danger light flashes warning motorists of an approaching train, but the driver still crossed into hatched box . The freight train is finally able to make its way across. An investigation has been launched into the incident . The horrifying moment was captured on camera by young rail enthusiast Bradley Hurrion (above) Mr Hurrion, a rail enthusiast, also filmed another close shave at a Hampshire level crossing. On that occasion a cyclist in Hythe can be seen narrowly missing a falling barrier coming down to allow a fuel train, which was leaving Fawley oil refinery, pass by. His footage has since prompted rail police to launch a national safety campaign called Operation Look. In a bid to raise more awareness of railway dangers, extra patrols are also under way at crossings throughout Hampshire. South West Trains said between April 1, 2013 and March 31 this year, eight motorists were charged or summoned for crossing misuse, with a further 69 issued with fixed penalty notices, and 22 cautioned for traffic offences. A further 290 drivers were sent on safety-awareness courses. Inspector Becky Warren said: ‘It is important people realise there is a serious penalty to pay for crossing-misuse. ‘However, while we will not hesitate to use the force of the law, we are also acutely aware of the need to promote safety at crossings through education. ‘We need drivers and pedestrians to realise level crossing misuse is a danger, not only to their safety, but the safety of others.’","City Red bus stranded across a hatched yellow box at level crossing .

"With the United Kingdom in the throngs of the autumn season, you couldn't be blamed for casting an eye on travelling to a more agreeable climate. Well the month of October is the time do it. Research has revealed that families looking to book a sunshine getaway this October half-term can enjoy significant cost savings on last year, with six out of ten popular destinations cheaper than in October 2013. Scroll down for video . Top view: With half-term approaching, families may look to chose Tenerife as a reasonable holiday option .

The cost of a one week holiday for a family of four has risen by an average of just 0.3 per cent (£23) since last October - significantly less than UK inflation (1.5 per cent). Half of the top ten most affordable destinations are in Europe, demonstrating the strength of the pound, which has gained five per cent on the euro over the past year. Short haul flights for European sunshine destinations also deliver additional cost benefits compared to travelling further afield. Tenerife is the most affordable sunshine destination this October half term, where a week long holiday will cost £450 per person. With nine hours of sun a day, and relatively short flight times, it is ideal for families on a budget looking for some warmer weather before winter sets in . Idyllic: Travelling to Antigua for October sun will not come cheap . In contrast, Antigua is the most expensive half term destination for sun seekers, costing £1,378 per person, with the higher price mainly due to the cost of travelling long haul . Menorca has seen the biggest reduction in price, falling by one per cent (£18) on last October half term, making it the second most affordable destination overall, at £453 per person . Meanwhile, a holiday to Florida has seen the biggest price increase; a family of four will see a rise of 2.1 per cent (£106) compared to October 2013. High flight and activity costs make it the second most expensive destination overall for those looking to get some sun this half term. Cyprus offers the best weather in Europe for this time of year; boasting average temperatures of 22°C, ten hours of sunshine and just 40mm of rain. This compares to an average temperature of 13°C, five hours of sunshine and 71mm of rain in the UK. Cyprus is also the fourth most affordable destination overall, costing £604 per person and, with an average flight time of just four and a half hours, is an ideal choice for many families. Long haul destinations offer the warmest weather, with Antigua and Barbados enjoying an average of 27°C in October, however the rainy season means higher levels of rainfall at this time of year. They are also among the most costly destinations, coming in at first and third most expensive respectively. Paul Stokes, head of products at M&S Bank, who have conducted the research, said: 'Due to the strength of the pound against the euro, holidaymakers can take advantage of better value getaways this half term and our research shows that families don't necessarily need to travel far afield to enjoy some sun, with some European destinations promising plenty of sunshine and high average temperatures.'

"Deon E. Warren, 19, is charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting dead a father of two . Police in Maryland have arrested a 19-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of a father of two who tried to break up a fight to protect his teenage son. Deon E. Warren, of Upper Marlboro, was arrested late Wednesday night at a motel in Anne Arundel County. He's charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 39-year-old Mitchell White, who was trying to break up a fight on Tuesday at around 5:35 p.m. when he was shot. White tried to protect his 16-year-old son and break up the altercation between him and another man at the parking lot at the Belair Swim and Racquet Club near Bowie High School. There were dozens of people there, and they all scattered when a shot was fired. White was struck and died at the scene. He had a 16-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter and was set to marry his fiancée, Tanya, in the Bahamas next spring, according to WTTV reported. His heartbroken family found out about White's death via Twitter, according to the station. 'I don't understand why this would happen,' the victim's mother, Netty Edwards, told WTTV. 'Why this man would take my son's life like that. It's just terrible.' Investigators working the case quickly identified Warren as the suspect aided by the series of of tattoos he has covering his face, including a black crescent moon and star — among other easily recognizable marks. 'All them tattoos, that's kind of crazy,' V. Watkins, who lives across the street from Warren, told WJLA. 'I wouldn't have myself marked up like that, it's a dead giveaway.' Court records show that Warren was cited for marijuana possession in December 2013 and May 2014, according to WJLA. Warren, who is being held without bond, also has a juvenile rap sheet but those records are kept sealed, the station added.","Deon E.

"Elizabeth Bolton had  been the principal legal officer of Burnley Council until she was arrested in 1999 for torching the car of a local authority park keeper . A lawyer's wife who was spared jail for fire-bombing a car amid an obsession with a teenage girl, has been caught stealing thousands of pounds from the council she works for. Former Girls Brigade chief Elizabeth Bolton had once been the principal legal officer of Burnley Council until she was arrested in 1999 for torching the car of a local authority park keeper. She was appointed clerk to Padiham Town Council, Lancashire, despite warnings over her arson conviction which at the time was said to have arisen out of her obsession with the worker's teenage girlfriend. But after being given her second chance, Bolton secretly overpaid herself by almost £12,000 over a four year period when she was working 22 hours a week at the council. Her scam was only discovered after an audit was carried out following her resignation. At Burnley Crown Court, Bolton, 59, sobbed as she admitted fraud between January 1, 2007 and December 29, 2011 but walked free after a judge said it was 'appropriate' she should be punished in the community. She was supported in court by her husband Peter - a conveyancing lawyer - and members of a local Methodist church where she attends services. Inquiries revealed the attack had arisen out of Bolton's 'almost unhealthy obsession' with the then 34-year old council employee's teenage girlfriend. Bolton had been taking an intense interest in the girl's welfare, taking her on holidays and encouraging her academically and got her a holiday in a local park as she awaited her A level results. But Bolton was said to be furious when she learnt the girl had fallen for the park keeper whose marriage was in difficulties at the time and she caught them embracing in a hut. After engineering his sacking, Bolton then carried out the arson attack whilst the man parked his car outside the girl's parents' house. He looked out of a bedroom window, to see a flash and flames engulfing the side of his vehicle. Dashing out, he kicked away a petrol-filled bleach bottle. He found Bolton about to drive off in her car, still wearing rubber gloves and smelling of petrol, and wrestled her to the ground. In 2001 at Lancaster Crown Court she was given a 12 month suspended jail term after admitting arson. Charges of indecent assault were allowed to lie on file. But despite the scandal, Bolton was appointed the following year to her £15,000 a year job managing the affairs of Padiham Town Council. Bolton was appointed the following year to her £15,000 a year job managing the affairs of Padiham Town Council (pictured). Bolton secretly overpaid herself by almost £12,000 over a four years while at the council . At the time councillors questioned her appointment voicing fears Padiham Town Hall would be left without fire insurance due to her conviction but the then mayor of Padiham Granville Lord said: 'Mrs Bolton was selected for her knowledge of local government. We had some excellent candidates and she came out the best qualified person for the position. 'We were fully aware of Mrs Bolton's past, but I do not think we should sit as judge and jury on someone's past life.' Speaking at the time, Mrs Bolton said: 'I just want to make a fresh start. People know about what happened and I can't change what I did, which was unfortunate.' She was one of only two paid employees at the council and was responsible for arranging payment of wages to both herself and the caretaker and looking after the town council's finances. But from 2005 onwards, she arranged that she would be paid a gross wage instead of net. Bolton disguised the shortfall transferred money from one of two charity accounts held by the the council into the council's main account as the tax year end approached. After the tax year concluded, she would then 'reverse' that payment by repaying the relevant charity fund from the main account, leaving a net shortfall in the main account. At Burnley Crown Court (pictured), Bolton, 59, sobbed as she admitted fraud between January 1, 2007 and December 29, 2011 but walked free after a judge said it was 'appropriate' she be punished in the community. Bolton then paid money in from other sources, including her own account, to make good, but from March 2008, she didn't make enough payments and the money owed began to ' almost run away with itself.' By the time she resigned in May 2012, the net overpayment was £11,696. Prosecutor Adam Watkins said: 'She was given a very considerable degree of autonomy and there were few, if any, checks conducted upon her.' In mitigation defence counsel Miss Katherine Pierpoint said: 'This shouldn't have happened. She's embarrassed it has happened. She apologises for that behaviour and she knows she must be dealt with by the court today.' The barrister said Bolton had struggled with mental health problems for a number of years. She had had help in the past and her mental health was particularly poor when she left her job. The defendant had a problem with alcohol. Bolton had recently started cognitive behavioural therapy. Miss Pierpoint added: 'She is dealing with her problems properly and it may well be that her mental health now is a lot better than it had been previously.' Bolton received 10 months in jail, suspended for two years, with a 22 week, 9pm to 7am curfew and must attend the Lancashire Women's Specified Activity Requirement. She was ordered to pay £1,000 costs. The hearing was told the money has been paid back - with interest. Judge Jonathan Gibson told her : 'You have, of course, a significant mental disorder and you are taking steps to deal with it. I think you can be appropriately punished in the community for what you did.'","Elizabeth Bolton had once been the principal legal officer of Burnley Council .

"Scotland Yard detectives are preparing to return to Portugal after getting the go-ahead to quiz fresh witnesses in the Madeleine McCann investigation. New prosecutor Ines Sequeira has paved the way for a new British police visit to the Algarve by approving a fifth international letter of request which had been gathering dust following her predecessor's departure in the summer. Officers in Faro are now scheduling the interviews, which will take place at the PJ police station in the town where four suspects were quizzed at the start of July. It was thought three of the suspects would be given a new grilling when the Operation Grange team led by DCI Andy Redwood returned to Portugal. Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have continued to fight to find their daughter after she disappeared seven years ago . But Mrs Sequeira, 49, is understood to have authorised only interviews with a string of witnesses who British police have never questioned directly. Respected Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias said Scotland Yard opted out of asking for permission to reinterview the suspects in their fifth letter of request, which state prosecutors received in August. Around 10 witnesses are expected to be quizzed, including some who were questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished from her holiday apartment in Praia da Luz more than seven years ago. The unnamed witnesses are expected to receive police summons in the next few days. As happened during the July round of interrogations, British police will sit in on the interviews but they will be led by Portuguese officers who will ask questions on their behalf. Three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings in Praia Da Luz more than seven years ago . The Operation Grange team last visited Portugal three weeks ago. A small team of three officers including DCI Andy Redwood met Policia Judiciaria bosses in Faro for an update meeting before travelling to the university city of Coimbra a five hour drive north to visit a lab where many of the DNA samples collected after Madeleine's disappearance are held. British police told bosses at Portugal's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences they wanted to retest some of the samples to try to crack the mystery of Madeleine's disappearance. They are yet to send a sixth international letter of request which mother-of-four Mrs Sequeira will have to authorise before Met Police forensics experts are allowed access to the lab or given permission to take samples to Britain to analyse them. The forensic material includes hairs and pieces of the curtains that hung in apartment 5A at the Ocean Club holiday complex where Madeleine was sleeping with baby siblings Sean and Amelie, now nine, while her parents Kate and Gerry ate tapas nearby. It emerged last week nearly 100 strands of hair tested during the original Madeleine McCann investigation were never DNA-matched. Portuguese forensic experts analysed 444 hair strands they believed could hold the key to the youngster's May 3 2007 disappearance. They found 432 were human and 12 non-human. They were unable to DNA-match 98 of them and only obtained partial results from 19 of them, it was reported last week. Institute president Francisco Brizida, said after the October 14 meeting: 'I have the certainty they went away very happy. 'The tonic of the meeting was about the possibility of the tests on samples collected in 2007 being re-done. Lead investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood (second left) with British police and their Portuguese counterparts investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in June of this year . 'The British police wanted clarification on the examinations the institute had carried out during the early stages of the inquiry in the areas of genetics and biology. 'We talked about non-identified material that was collected in Madeleine's apartment. 'I can't say for sure new DNA tests that didn't yield a conclusive result in 2007 could now yield an objective result. 'But technology nowadays allows us to go further than years ago in areas like genetic markers. 'Several possibilities are open. One could be that British police do the tests in Britain with British technology and another that the institute does them. 'But that's an area in which the institute does not have the last word. There's a situation of judicial cooperation and a new international letter of request would be necessary.' The Operation Grange inquiry is running in parallel with a new Portuguese probe, reopened in May more than five years after being shelved. Scotland Yard detectives suspect Madeleine, three when she vanished, was killed during a bungled break-in. British police shifting through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in June 2014 . They dug up waste ground and inspected sewers in Praia da Luz in June in a grim search for her body. One of the suspects questioned in July was a former Ocean Club worker and another a 51-year-old schizophrenic drug addict. They both denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance. Portuguese police believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer living in Portugal. However they have not ruled out the involvement of junkie burglar Euclides Monteiro, whose widow they questioned last year. Last month, it emerged the cost of the British police search for Madeleine will soon top £10 million  - double the original amount estimated by the Home Office when the force was called in by David Cameron in 2011. The Home Office has defending the rising cost of the probe, insisting: 'The Government believes it is right that it does all it can to support the search for Madeleine McCann.'

"Longtime MSNBC news commentator Keith Olbermann once apologized to President Bill Clinton – in writing – for aggressively driving the network's coverage of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal during 1996 and 1997. An internal White House email about his Damascene confession was included in a trove of nearly 10,000 documents released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library. It was the seventh such Friday afternoon document dump of previously secret papers from Clinton's eight White House years. 'Keith Olbermann has written to POTUS,' wrote West Wing senior editor Scott Michaud to press aide Lori Anderson, 'apologizing for ""whatever part I may have played in perpetuating this ceaseless coverage (of the Lewinsky story) .... I'll be heading back to my previous career in sports as quickly as possible ..."".' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Keith Olbermann's written apology to President Bill Clinton was among nearly 10,000 pages released by the Clinton Presidential Library on October 10 . Olbermann interviewed then-first lady Hillary Clinton on his MSNBC show in 1997, at the same time he was flogging the Lewinsky sex scandal – a habit for which he would later apologize . The internal West Wing email described the written apology and suggested a modified form letter in reply . Olbermann did indeed return to sportscasting until 2003 when he returned to MSNBC – this time as a confirmed liberal – for eight more years, becoming a thorn in the side of President George W. Bush. Anderson, then an assistant to White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry, forwarded the message to press aide Mark Neschis and communications staffer Jennifer Palmieri . She suggested in her forwarding email that the Executive Office of the President should send Olbermann a modified form letter in reply. 'Please take a look at the following draft letter to Keith Olberman [sic],' she wrote. 'I think we may want to make it a bit warmer.' The draft letter that presented for Clinton's signature read: 'Dear Keith, Thanks so much for your kind message. I've been touched by the many expressions of encouragement and support I have received from friends across the country. I'm grateful you got in touch with me, and I send you my very best wishes.' Palmieri, one of the staffers she consulted, is now President Barack Obama's White House communications director. Olbermann was then host of 'The Big Show with Keith Olbermann' and 'White House in Crisis' on MSNBC. He came to resent his management's pressure to drive ratings with constant coverage of the Lewinsky scandal, which involved a young intern who engaged in a sexual relationship with the president, according to E! Online. Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then a 23-year-old White House intern, and later lied about it under oath . In the years before Olbermann emerged as a consistent liberal, Olbermann bashed the Clinton spin machine nightly, bringing rare high ratings to MSNBC . At the time, E! reported that he wanted out of his three-year contract early, and took to calling his political program 'The White House Isn't in Crisis but We'll Keep Calling It That Because There's a Graphic.' In June 1998, in a speech at Cornell University, he told students that he was 'having the dry heaves in the bathroom because my moral sensor is going off but I can't even hear it, I'm so seduced by these ratings.' About the time he wrote to the White House, Olbermann – a legendary American sports historian who owns a reported 35,000 baseball cards – wriggled out of his MSNBC contract and joined Fox Sports Net. Five years later, he was back at MSNBC. That eight-year run ended in 2011 when the network suspended, and later fired, him for donating money congressional Democrats who had been guests on his show. Spokespersons at ESPN2, where Olbermann's sports show currently aired, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.","Left-wing host anchored a news show in between career stints as a sportscaster, and drove much of MSNBC's Lewinsky coverage .

"A 59-year-old man gallantly failed earlier this month to become the first hiker to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range in a wheelchair. Bob Coomber, who lives in the Livermore, California, has been in a wheelchair since he was 38 years old after developing osteoporosis in his mid-30's as a side effect of diabetes. Despite Bob’s predicament, it hasn’t stopped him from pursuing his passion for hiking and he has now twice attempt this feat of extreme endurance. Bob Coomber, from Livermore, California, bravely attempted earlier this month to become the first hiker to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range in a wheelchair . Bob pulls his chair over a rock on the Sierra High Route trail during the second day of his hike across the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range on September 18 in Independence, CA . Last year Bob had to turn around because his insulin pump failed him, but that made him only more determined to try again this year. Inspired by reading about Bob’s gallant first attempt, photojournalist Ezra Shaw met with him and decided to tag along on his second attempt. ‘Over the next six months, Bob and I would occasionally meet up for a hike through the hills around Livermore,’ he wrote about training with Coomber. ‘I was amazed at how he didn’t let being in a wheelchair deter him from difficult terrain. He just took the trails slow and steady and eventually got to where he wanted to be.’ On Bob's second attempt at crossing the mountain range, he planned to start on the eastern side of the Sierra's, before crossing over Kearsarge Pass and hoped to finish in Kings Canyon National Park . Bob Coomber attempts to cross a boulder field near Gilbert Lake during his third day of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, unfortunately he had to turn around because the rocks were too large and the field to long for him to go over . Bob Coomber rests for a moment: When he set out on the 22 mile hike he hoped to make the journey in a week, but sadly it wasn't to be . On Bob's second attempt at crossing the mountain range, he planned to start on the eastern side of the Sierra's, before crossing over Kearsarge Pass and hoped to finish in Kings Canyon National Park. The total hike would be 22 miles and Bob hoped to make the journey in one week. Over a three day period, Bob rolled up steep trails that were covered in rocks. At each rock that was too big to roll over, Bob would get out of his chair, slide across the ground, pull his chair behind him, and then get back into his chair. Towards the end of his third day of hiking, he encountered a field of boulders. He attached a rope to his wheelchair and then looped the rope around his back. Then he slowly started pulling himself across the rocks with his chair bumping along behind him. Unfortunately, the rock field was too much for Bob to handle. After sitting on the rocks for a few minutes, Bob made the decision that it was time to turn around. A group of hikers stop to shake hands with Bob as he rolls up the Sierra High Route trail during the second day of his hike across the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range . Coomber tapes up his blisters again during his third day of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, over a three day period he rolled up steep trails that were covered in rocks . Bob pulls his chair over a rock on the first day of his hike across the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Bob developed osteoporosis in his mid-30's as a side effect of diabetes, and has been in a wheelchair since he was 38 years old . 'The blister on his hand was getting worse and a new one was forming on his other hand. Although disappointed, he was still happy with how far he had made it,' wrote Shaw about the moment when Bob decided he couldn't continue. 'The reward is being out and in it all,' Bob told him. 'Seeing the deer go by and hearing the squirrels, and seeing the waterfalls, and knowing I can still do it.' 'I was amazed at how far Bob got. I know he wishes that he made it all the way through to Kings Canyon, but what he did accomplish is still beyond remarkable', wrote Shaw about Bob's bravery and determination. 'He said that he hopes it will inspire people that aren’t that active to get out and go for a hike. I know that it has inspired me.' Coomber stays warm at the Onion Valley campground at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range the night before he planned to start his hike on September 16 . 'The reward is being out and in it all,' Bob told his companion Ezra Shaw.

"A social experiment that brought together an enthusiastic hunter and a passionate vegan ended with some highly emotional and uncomfortable moments and a mutual agreement to disagree. Steve Lee, from Parkes in New South Wales, is an enthusiastic gun collector – with over 300 in his collection - who performs contract shooting at farms where wild pigs have become pests. He's also an avid hunter who spends a couple of days a month participating in the sport. Mr Lee spent 10 days with animal liberationist Felicity Andersen, who lives at Animal Liberation's headquarters in Victoria, as part of SBS's Living With The Enemy. The duo spent five days together in each of their homes, participating in the others' favourite activities and attempting to gain an insight into the other side of the hunting debate. Scroll down for video . Steve Lee, an enthusiastic hunter and gun collector from New South Wales, spent ten days with Felicity Andersen, a member of Animal Liberation and a passionate vegan from Victoria . Their first activity was a duck shooting protest in Victoria, where the government encourages hunters to take part in each year. Despite standing onside with the animal activists, Mr Lee was less concerned about the ducks, and more so about the hunters. 'When I first went down there I went on a duck shooting protest with them and I was taken aback by how horrible they are to the hunters and how derogatory they are, the way they torment them,' Mr Lee told Daily Mail Australia. 'Their approach appeared to me as quite vicious, the way they attack the hunters, and they act like their opinion is the gospel truth.' He suggested that the activists instigate violence among the shooters before pointing the finger back at them. Ms Andersen's account of the event was entirely different. The 41-year-old said Mr Lee was visibly uncomfortable while surrounded by the large group of activists who were 'emotionally charged'; particularly while attempting to revive one of the ducks that had been shot. The duo went on a duck shooting protest in Victoria where Mr Lee said he was shocked at the way the activists 'tormented' the hunters . Ms Andersen said that Mr Lee, who works as a pest eradicator at farms across NSW where wild pigs are a concern, told her following the duck hunting protest: 'I'd like to take up duck shooting' 'Everyone was quite sensitive and he was quite uncomfortable with that,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'He tried to make light of it by making a few jokes and when I asked him what he felt about the rescue he just said: ""I'd like to take up duck shooting"". 'So he was quite callous, but I understand because even if he did have a tiny change of heart he wouldn't want to admit it.' In contrast, when spending time at Mr Lee's property, the duo took part in Felicity's first ever pig hunt. 'I had every intention of sabotaging the hunt, but I failed,' Ms Andersen said. When spending time at Mr Lee's property, the duo took part in Ms Andersen's first ever pig hunt in which she said she tried but failed to sabotage the hunt . Inside Mr Lee's trophy room: Mr Lee said he believes Ms Andersen would have 'rather hung around with a goat  than with me' 'I was going to make sure I made lots of noise so that any wild creatures around knew we were there and if I'd seen any animals I would have stood between them and Steve, but unfortunately two pigs lost their lives towards the end of the hunt. 'For the rest of my days I will regret having let my guard down for those two moments. 'Steve's reaction when the pigs were killed was gleeful. He was excited and it was horrifying to see people so happy about a death.' Both Steve and Felicity said that despite having different opinions on hunting, they managed to generally get along. However, Mr Lee said he believed the hunting experience 'really hurt' Ms Andersen, adding 'I felt a bit sorry for her.' While Ms Andersen also admitted that she got along with Mr Lee, she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home, saying she believed it was 'disrespectful' 'I don't think she enjoyed who I was or my life, she's so anti-hunting that she couldn't get past it,' he said. 'I think she'd rather hang around with a goat or something than with me, and I'm not joking.' While Ms Andersen also admitted that she got along with Mr Lee, she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home. 'I didn't think I'd need to spell that out to him and I found it quite disrespectful and wondered if it was intentional,' she said. Overall, Mr Lee said he would do it all again but that his opinion of vegans had been greatly lowered after the experience. 'I'm more opposed to veganism than I ever have been now and I don't like their approach or their view of the world. They won't wavier either side, there's no compromise – it's more like a religion than a belief,' he said. 'I'm more opposed to veganism than I ever have been now and I don't like their approach or their view of the world,' Mr Lee said after the whole experience . He said that it was Mr Andersen's opposition to pest eradication – such as that of wild pigs or foxes – and her suggestion to sterilise them instead which 'made no sense'. 'I have shot foxes many times for eradication purposes - they are very detrimental to Australian wildlife and native mammals and birds and in Victoria the government has even put out a bounty on them,' he said. 'I talked to her about it but she just doesn't want us killing foxes at all. I said to her that one fox kills hundreds of thousands of Australian animals in its lifetime so I've done what you want me to do which is to save those animals, but no. There is no sense to her argument.' 'I told her that if you don't eat cattle then cattle won't live at all, and she was fine with that. I have a real problem with that because hunters want to maintain a species of animal. Ms Andersen said that she doesn't believe violent measures are ever acceptable in pest eradication, saying: 'just as we wouldn't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet' 'Hunters hunt for the sake of being able to come back and next year and hunt again - unless were trying to specifically eradicate a pest our idea is to harvest an animal for meat or occasionally for trophy heads - but there's not a lot of that' When she was asked by Daily Mail Australia on her view of pest eradication, Ms Andersen said that she doesn't believe violent measures are ever acceptable. 'Just as we wouldn't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet, I give all other species the same right,' she said.

Mueller III is completed into  the league's pursuit and handling of evidence . Assault: The former Baltimore Ravens star was suspended indefinitely after he was filmed punching Janay Palmer with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino in New Jersey . A condensed version? But now, Rice plans to claim that the video, first obtained by TMZ, was a 'cleaned-up, whittled down and condensed version of the events', reported ESPN. Above, Palmer is seen lying on the floor . The NFL has repeatedly said no one with the league saw the violent images until TMZ Sports released the video earlier this month. Miller through an NFL spokesman that he never received the video . Miller was responding to an Associated Press report onThursday quoting an unnamed law enforcement source who said thevideo had been addressed to Miller. Two weeks ago, that same . source had said he sent the package to the NFL, but did not . allow the AP to report who he addressed it to. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release details of the case, said he doesn't know if Miller ever saw the DVD or opened the package. His only communication with the NFL was a 12-second voicemail on April 9 from league offices confirming receipt of the package, in which a woman says, 'You're right. It's terrible.' 'Since the NFLPA and NFL have launched separate investigations into the league and the Ravens' handling of Ray Rice's case, I want to make a few things clear. No one from the NFL ever asked me for the inside-elevator video,' the official said Thursday. 'I mailed it anonymously to Jeff Miller because he's their head of security. I attached a note saying: 'Ray Rice elevator video. You have to see it. It's terrible.' I provided a number for a disposable cellphone and asked for confirmation that it was received. I knew there was a possibility Mr. Miller may not get the video, but I hoped it would land in the right hands.' Miller joined the league in 2008 as director of strategic security and was promoted to chief security officer in April 2011. Before joining the NFL, Miller spent nearly six years as the commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police. He worked for the state police for 24 years. Former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice yells during his introduction before an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns in Baltimore in September. The Ravens dropped him after the video came out . At the NFL, Miller's responsibilities include overseeing investigative programs and services. He is also in charge of event security and game integrity. When players get arrested, the NFL's corps of investigators rarely get involved, leaving that to local law enforcement. The league's security operatives gather court documents and police reports available to the public, but don't ordinarily interview witnesses or gather evidence independently. It remains unclear what happened to the video once it arrived at league offices. The report could complicate matters for the NFL as it . struggles to regain its credibility for its handling of the Rice . case and four other domestic abuse incidents, amounting to one . of the biggest scandals in America's most-popular sports league. The elevator security video of Rice knocking his now-wife . Janay Rice unconscious surfaced on TMZ.com on September 8, prompting . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to indefinitely suspend Rice from . the league after initially giving him a lighter punishment of a . two-game suspension for the domestic violence incident. Criticised: Following claims the NFL knew about the video in April, a social media campaign has  emerged aimed at forcing NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (pictured) to resign over his handling of domestic violence cases . Goodell has said he had not seen the video either until it . became public, but he called an independent investigation into . how the NFL handled the Rice case after the first AP report two . weeks ago. The release of the Rice video unleashed a wave of criticism . against the NFL from sponsors, fans, commentators and women's . groups and raised questions about Goodell's leadership and why . the NFL wasn't able to obtain the clip before TMZ. Before handing down the two-game ban to Rice, Goodell had . seen an earlier video showing Rice dragging his unconscious . fiancée from the elevator. Goodell has apologized for his initial lighter punishment . and has increased the ban on players who commit domestic . violence to a minimum of six games. Rice, a former Pro Bowl running back for the Baltimore Ravens, was arrested in Atlantic City on an assault charge for hitting Janay Palmer in February. A police summons stated that Rice had struck Palmer with his hand, knocking her unconscious. Rice has been accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, which enabled him to avoid jail time and could result in having the charge expunged from his record. Initially, Goodell suspended Rice — who has since married Palmer — for two games. After video of the punch in the casino elevator was released, the Ravens cut Rice and Goodell suspended him indefinitely. League and Ravens officials said they requested the video from law enforcement but were denied. ESPN and others have reported that the Ravens had a detailed description of the video shortly after Rice was arrested. After the AP reported that the video was sent to NFL headquarters, Goodell announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would lead an internal investigation. That probe is ongoing, and there is no timetable for its completion.","NFL Head of Security says he did not see the video showing Ray Rice striking his then-fiancée until September .

"It is one of the most anticipated next-generation titles, and now Ubisoft want Watch Dogs to compete with the likes of the Grand Theft Auto series. Speaking to Edge last week, the publisher's executive director for EMEA territories, Alain Coore, says they intend to bring something new to the open-world genre. Stunning: Ubisoft have released these new screens on their Watch Dogs Facebook page. The game will be appearing on current and next-gen consoles although it will likely look its best on PC and PS4 . 'Yes, Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest brands in the . industry and everybody respects the brand and we'll have fun playing the . next one too,' he said. 'But I think Watch Dogs' positioning is also on next-gen, bringing a lot of features - connectivity, interactivity, companion gaming and so on which is bringing some freshness to the genre.' He added: 'The spirit will be that this kind of game is great fun and I think Watch Dogs can also bring a lot of the same fans.' The game sees you play as Aiden Pearce who can hack into electronic devices tied to the city's central operating system. As witnessed in the E3 gameplay demo last year, this opens up numerous ways to complete objectives. According to a report on DSOgaming, Watch Dogs is powered by a brand new engine called Disrupt, capable of running across current and next-gen platforms. It is the second engine Ubisoft have revealed of late, following the use of AnvilNext in Assassin's Creed 3. Brutal: Watch Dogs is set for a Holiday 2013 release and has been confirmed as a PS4 launch title . Watch Dogs was last week confirmed as a launch title for Sony's PS4 during the 2013 holiday period. Other titles penned for launch release include Killzone: Shadow Fall and Drive Club. Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot, recently revealed that the team are focusing on the next-generation versions of the title, and are backwards adapting it for PS3 and Xbox 360. 'While the next-gen is further advanced, we will also optimise all that we have and feed that into the current-gen consoles,' Corre added. 'Our engineers say that it will be possible to have a great experience on both next-gen and current-gen. We are going to try and optimise as much as we can and try to respect the abilities of the current-gen so that the experience that players have on current-gen is great – that’s really important for us. Built from scratch: The game, which focuses around hacking, is reportedly built on a custom engine aptly called Disrupt . 'Watch Dogs is super-important on next-gen, of course, but it is also on current-gen because it will take a while before every gamer we have will play on next-gen. We must respect our current situation.' There is still no news on a Wii U version, although this is expected to be announced later in the year. NOW WATCH THE LATEST GAMEPLAY VIDEO: .

"A three-year-old is in critical condition after falling into the jaguar pit at a zoo. The child, whose name is being withheld by his family and authorities, was at the Little Rock Zoo in Little Rock, Arkansas, earlier today when he fell into the enclosure at around 10:45 am when a family member was holding the child on the railing. Employees at the zoo responded immediately, holding off the cats with a fire extinguisher as they lowered a ladder and removed the child, who was conscious and responsive the entire time.

The child was then handed off to their father and rushed to a local hospital. The child was taken to the hospital with extensive lacerations, a depressed skull fracture, and minor puncture wounds according to KTHV. It’s not clear if the injuries are from the 15-foot fall or one of the cats. Scary cats: Zoo workers held off the cats with a fire extinguisher .

"An American surgeon believes he can save the life of a six year old girl suffering from a rare and dangerous condition called hypothalamic obesity. Hana Tarraf has put on a kilogram a week since having a brain tumour removed at the beginning of the year. The procedure caused a rare condition where the brain can no longer regulate caloric intake. The little girl from Bondi, Sydney is wheelchair-bound most of the time as she struggles to 'stand in one spot for more than a minute', her mum Naomi Cook told Daily Mail Australia. Dr Thomas Inge says hypothalamic obesity, which Hana Tarraf suffers from, is very difficult to treat with diet because the body adapts . Dr Thomas Inge runs the Surgical Weight Loss Program for Teens, an Ohio-based clinic at the Children's Hospital Medical Centre. He told The Sunday Telegraph hypothalamic obesity is very difficult to treat by changing food intake, since the body will adapt and slow down metabolic rate to continue the weight gain. Dr Inge says hypothalamic obesity was very difficult to treat with diet because the body reacts to restricted calorie intake by slowing down energy expenditure to continue the weight gain. Instead he has urged the family to consider bariatric surgery, or gastric bypass surgery, which involves the removal of part of the stomach. It is generally shunned for children as young as Hana, and there is little research done on this age group, however the doctor believes it is her only viable option. The surgery restricts calorie intake, as well as working like interrupting the signals from the brain to eat. Dr Inge told the Sunday Telegraph: 'What it seems to do is readjust the set point for weight that the body is trying to achieve, whether the circuit is related to the energy burn or the energy intake, we don't know. There is something about the operation that works on the intake side, but it's more complex.' The doctor has agreed to consult with the Tarraf family next week. Dr Inge has urged the family to consider Bariatric surgery: Hana (centre) here with her dad Nour Tarraf (left), mum Naomi Cook (top right) and younger sister Maryam, 4, (bottom right) The six-year-old (second from left) is pictured here at Christmas time last year with her family. Dr Inge has recommended Bariatric surgery, or gastric bypass surgery, which is generally shunned for children as young as Tarraf as there is little research done on this age group, however the doctor believes it is her only viable option . Before her surgery she weighed 21 kilos, but now weighs 44 kilos and is continuing to put on weight . The six-year-old, here with mum Ms Cook, is gaining on average a kilo each week . Hana's condition also means she is constantly hungry, due to the signals being transmitted from her brain to her stomach. 'She cries a lot, she gets cranky, she gets grumpy and she'll stare into space,' Ms Cook said. 'She'll be playing a game and she'll say 'Dad I don't want to think about food',' her dad Nour Tarraf added. When they took their eldest daughter to hospital in January of this year with concerns about her thyroid, they were devastated when told she had actually developed a brain tumour. When the day of the appointment came Hana had been suffering from a 'massive headache' for two days and a scan was done as a precautionary measure. 'The CT scan found a tennis ball sized tumour', Mr Tarraf revealed. Hana had surgery the same month and her parents said the fallout from the operation could have been 'blindness, seizures and even death'. While their daughter was in intensive care recovering from the procedure to remove the tumour, 'Naomi started to look into what other complications there could be', Mr Tarraf said. 'She (Naomi) was in hospital asking the doctors about this increased chance of weight gain', he continued, before adding that through their research he and Ms Cook had discovered there was an 85 per cent chance of Hana developing weight problems. Now, nine months later, Hana, 6, is still gaining weight - almost a kilogram every week - with no sign of it slowing. Hana, pictured left on Sunday and right before her surgery, now spends much of her time in a wheelchair . Hana suffers from severe knee and ankle pain and struggles to walk for more than a few minutes . The youngster had a tumor the size of a tennis ball removed in January, after it was discovered by chance . She is constantly hungry as the messages from her brain to her stomach . 'It's ten months later and we have a child that is morbidly obese at six,' Ms Cook said. 'We do have to use the wheelchair to get around, she has severe knee and ankle pain. She can't stand on the spot for more than a minute.' This struggle can also be isolating for Hana at school, as she can't join her classmates sitting on the floor when they're reading, and instead must sit on a chair up the back. Breakfast: A bowl of cereal and a piece of toast with a spread on it . Morning Tea: A handful of nuts . Lunch: A sandwich and a salad . Afternoon Tea:  A piece of fruit or some nuts . Dinner: Vegetable soup with some rice, followed by a yoghurt . Hana's diet is very tightly controlled by her parents, and she is fed only small portions of very healthy food each day to slow her weight gain down. 'Hana's weight has nothing to do with diet, her body became hardwired ... her body is telling her she is starving', Ms Cook said. 'Hana is very disciplined, there's other conditions where children have no control and they simply eat what they see or go searching for food,' her father added. 'She doesn't eat unless we actually allow her to. She will sit there and cry but she won't actually go searching for food. 'Her stomach is full, but her brain is hungry. Her brain is saying eat eat eat,' he continued. Though the toughest part for Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf has been trying to get Hana specialised treatment in Australia. 'We have found it difficult to see someone - it's not considered an emergency so when you ring a specialist they just slot you in to their books', Mr Tarraf said. Hana's family are desperately trying to get expert medical help for their daughter . Her parents have been conducting their own research, and have contacted medical experts overseas. Hana is pictured here before her surgery . The couple have been conducting a lot of research during the 12 weeks they've been waiting for Hana to see someone, and have even reached out to researchers overseas. One German specialist responded to their five page long list of questions to him with an equally detailed answer, and Hana's parents believe they need to enlist the help of international medical experts if they want to combat their daughter's rare condition. 'Some children are very lucky and they do reach a stablisation after a few months, we haven't and see no signs of this happening yet for Hana,' Ms Cook said. 'In my mind and my husbands mind this is ultimately a life-threatening condition and we need help.' Hana, here with sister Maryam, needs someone who is willing to do some extra work to help their daughter . However Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf were adamant that the doctors that had been treating their daughter in Australia were at no fault, but their situation was particularly complex. 'We understand their position, we know that it's difficult and it might be outside is a lot of people's expertise,' Mr Tarraf said. 'What Hana needs is someone who is prepared to do some extra work and someone who's willing to get out of their comfort zone,' he added. Hana doesn't fit the mold for many people suffering from hypothalamic obesity,and a plan needs to be put in place according to her parents. Though Ms Cook said there was one thing she was thankful for out of this ordeal her daughter has gone through. 'She doesn't have yet - thank god - have any understanding that she is obese.' 'I hope that by the time she's old enough, or in the next few months, we will find a solution for her that will help that,' Ms Cook added.

"The wife of GOD TV co-founder Rory Alec who quit the channel over a 'moral failure' says he left her for the divorcee daughter of a farmer in South Africa. In a broadcast on the international television station British-born Wendy Alec said her husband of more than 20 years no longer wished to be part of the channel. She told viewers that the 'devil got in very, very easily' and alleged that Mr Alec had been having an affair with a divorced woman. Scroll down for video . Wendy Alec (right) says her husband of more than 20 years, Rory Alec (left), the co-founder of GOD TV, has left her for the divorcee daughter of a farmer in South Africa . Problems started in March this year when her husband returned from a visit to South Africa, she said in the broadcast. 'My whole world started turning upside down and the next morning he just went,' she said. 'It started to be extremely traumatic for me because suddenly my husband just started to change in a pattern and a way I had never seen him act before.' Mrs Alec said she and the board of GOD TV asked Rory to go for counselling and claimed she discovered he had been having an affair in August. 'The devil got in very, very easily,' she said. She added that the woman Mr Alec was having an affair with heard a voice from God telling her that he was her Mr Right and her husband. Mrs Alec said: 'Rory is on this lady's father's farm in South Africa. 'He doesn't want to be involved in the ministry anymore and as far as he's concerned, the marriage is finished. Rory Alec (right) had earlier said he would be stepping down from his role as boss of GOD TV due to a 'moral failure' in his marriage . 'He doesn't want restoration, he doesn't want counselling, he doesn't want anything to do with it. 'He wants a new life. 'It is traumatic because it's like your life is over, all our memories.' Last week Rory Alec said he was handing over the running of GOD TV to his wife. He said in a statement: 'After 20 years of service, I have had a moral failure this year. 'For this reason, I am stepping down. Please forgive me for the disappointment I've caused, but I know your eyes are on Jesus who is the author and finisher of your faith and not on me, an imperfect man. 'It is with a heavy heart that I confirm my season with GOD TV is over for now.' God TV can be seen in more than 60 countries and is popular in the US, where it competes with other religious broadcasters. It claims to reach more than 900million people with its mixture of sermons and uplifting stories of people saved by faith. The Alecs feature regularly along with US-based evangelists. Wendy Alec (right) told viewers that the 'devil got in very, very easily' and alleged that her husband Rory Alec (centre) had been having an affair with a divorced woman . Last year, they appeared in a show that attempted to exorcise ‘demons’ from President Obama to free him from ‘Jezebel’s clutches’. The couple, who are in their 40s, met as singers on the cabaret circuit in South Africa. Mrs Alec was born in London but grew up in Durban, South Africa, and became a devout Christian after seeing the face of Jesus in a mirror in the lavatory of a nightclub where she was singing. The pair decided to set up a Christian TV channel in Europe after hearing a prophecy that they would do so. They launched God TV with £140,000 in savings and it quickly became popular with US evangelists who paid to appear and gain access to European audiences. One of the first Christian broadcasters in Britain, God TV can be viewed online and on its Sky television channel . Rory Alec has not responded to the claims.","Wendy Alec says husband Rory had been having an affair with a divorcee .

"These are the shocking injuries suffered by a Chinese teenager after her father used diesel fuel to try and clean a burn on her foot. Cui Tung, 13, initially scalded her toes while carrying a pan of hot water from the stove to the bath at her home in southern province of Guangdong. Her worried father Cui Shen, 43, did not have any medication to hand, but was told by a neighbour that diesel fuel would solve the problem by numbing the pain. Scroll down for video . Lucky to be alive: Cui Tung, 13, suffered third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body after her father tried to use diesel fuel to clean a wound on her foot . Badly burned: Tung scalded her foot while carrying hot water from the stove to her bath, and her father Cui Shen decided to use gasoline on the wound after taking advice from a neighbour . Human fireball: Tung was engulfed in flames after the open fire in her home ignited the diesel fumes, causing her legs to burst into flames which quickly set her clothes alight . Shen said: 'He told me that the oil would soothe the injury and would also cool it as it evaporated.' But unfortunately the fumes from the diesel were ignited by an open fire in the family kitchen, turning the girl's legs into a fireball which quickly set her clothing alight as well. The girl's mother, Cui Wan Jen, was also burned after rushing to try to help put out the flames covering her daughter's legs. By the time the flames were extinguished, Tung had burns covering all four of her limbs, and her lower torso. Shen took both of them to hospital, where medics revealed his daugher had suffered third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body. Doctor Chi Li said: 'For a while it seemed as if she might not even survive. Blunder: Father Shen said a neighbour told him the fuel would numb the wound, and cool it as it evaporated . On the brink: Medics in China's southern Guangdong province said it was doubtful that Tung would survive at first, but her condition is now stable . 'However she is now on the road to recovery although she will need extensive cosmetic surgery and skin grafts to get any sort of normal appearance in the future. 'It's going to be at least five months before she can probably even walk again.' He added: 'The father had taken the fuel from his motorbike. Using diesel fuel to treat a burn is medically completely pointless and indeed, in this case, potentially deadly.'

"Russia has accused Ukrainian air-traffic control of sending Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 into the conflict zone where it was shot down last month. The Russian envoy to the UN Security Council has demanded Kiev release all records of its air-traffic controllers' communications with the plane, whose downing is the subject of a major diplomat crisis. The passenger jet carrying 298 people was hit by a missile the Ukrainian government and its allies say was fired from the rebel-held Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on July 17. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: The crash site of MH17, which went down on July 17 with the loss of all 298 passengers and crew . Tragedy: The downing of the jet over Ukraine's conflict zone has led to a major diplomatic crisis . Russia says there is a lack of proof for this claim and expressed concerns at the UN Security Council over Kiev's refusal to release transcripts of conversations its air traffic controllers had with MH17. 'Nothing is known about the record of talks between Ukrainian flight controllers,' said Russian envoy to the UN, Vitaly Churkin . 'They should produce the records of talks between their flight controllers so that it would be possible to understand why they directed the Malaysian plane into the conflict zone.' The West has blamed pro-Kremlin rebels using a BUK weapons system for the horrific incident, which killed all MH17's passengers and crew, pending a Dutch-led probe. Senior Russian military figures have claimed the plane was shot down by the Ukrainian army, a theory rejected by Kiev and the U.S. Mr Churkin claimed that the investigation is sidelining the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as well as the Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) which monitors the airspace in the former Soviet Union. He has called for UN assistance 'on the need to make the investigation international'. The remains of at least 15 Malaysians killed when a plane was shot down over Ukraine will be returned to their home country this week, the country's defence minister says. All 298 people on board died when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down on July 17. The plane was heading to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam and was shot out of the sky, crashing in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists. The victims included 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals. With fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian forces ongoing near the crash site, victims' remains were gathered and sent to the Netherlands for identification. Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said 28 Malaysian victims had been identified so far, including 15 passengers and 13 crew members. The remains of at least 15 Malaysians and a Dutch national who was married to a Malaysian will arrive in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, Mr Hishammuddin said at a news conference, adding that the exact number to arrive would be known later in the week. The government has declared Friday a national day of mourning. Mr Hishammuddin said Malaysia would not be competing with the Netherlands in terms of how the bodies are received. The Netherlands observed a minute's silence and solemn ceremonies were held when the remains of the victims arrived in the country last month. Dutch authorities said last week that they had identified 127 victims in all.","Russian envoy to UN demands Kiev release communications with MH17 .

"More than 40 head teachers are earning more than David Cameron (pictured today in Milan) More than 40 head teachers are earning more than the Prime Minister despite rules intended to curb huge salaries. The number of state school heads paid more than David Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year, has soared by a third in a year – to 41. Of those, eight earn at least £170,000 and two take home £190,000 or more. The revelation prompted calls for greater scrutiny of heads’ pay deals because the system offers ‘significant potential for abuse’. The School Teachers’ Review Body recommended earlier this year that heads could receive up to £132,685 in exceptional circumstances, rising to £141,250 in inner London. But the independent STRB also says that normally, the maximum pay for a head in charge of ‘multiple very large schools’ should be £106,148 or £113,000 in central London. It follows a call in 2010 from then education secretary Michael Gove for heads’ pay packets to be kept smaller than the Prime Minister’s. But he was forced to water down the plan amid warnings a cap would be seen as a target, forcing salaries up instead of down. The rise in bumper pay packets has been partly fuelled by the growth in academy schools, which are state-funded but enjoy greater freedom over staff pay. Latest figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, show that 933 heads were paid six-figure salaries last year, almost two-thirds of whom work at academies. This compares with 800 in 2012. A total of 41 were paid more than £142,000 – up from 31 the previous year. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, blamed ‘increased autonomy for schools and weak governance’ for the failure to ensure heads’ salaries are set in an ‘open, fair and transparent manner’. She added: ‘The opportunity and potential for abuse is significant … the pay system in schools can be summed up as “pay head teachers what they want and teachers what you can get away with”.’ The latest government guidance on setting heads’ pay, published in September, states that the maximum should be £107,210, rising to £114,437 for heads in inner London. This can be exceeded by 25 per cent where it is considered that ‘circumstances … warrant a higher than normal payment’ and in ‘exceptional circumstances’, a business case could be made to raise a salary even higher. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, blamed ‘increased autonomy for schools and weak governance’ for the failure to ensure heads’ salaries are set in an ‘open, fair and transparent manner’ A spokesman for the National Association of Head Teachers said six-figure salaries were rare, adding: ‘Head teachers perform demanding jobs … their leadership shapes the future for thousands of young people … Yet, despite this, the average head teacher earns nothing like a prime- ministerial salary.’ A Department for Education spokesman said the pay guidance introduced in September was ‘designed to ensure school leaders’ pay is appropriate to the challenge of the post and their contribution to their school or schools’. Pay rise: Sir Greg Martin, executive head at Durand Academy in Stockwell, received a 56 per cent pay rise . A head earning £229,138 a year is believed to be the highest paid primary school teacher in the country. Sir Greg Martin, executive head at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, received a 56 per cent pay rise last year, making his salary more than £200,822. The rise in 2013 was due to a loophole which means he is running more than one school. He received £28,316 in pension contributions last year. The school said his role was ‘hugely demanding’ and governors were ‘privileged to retain his services’. But Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said it was ‘remarkably hard to see how this can possibly be justified in a publicly funded school’. State-run Durand Academy, judged ‘good’ by Ofsted last December, is not under council control and has freedom over areas such as curriculum and staff pay.","Number of state school heads paid more than David Cameron soars .

"A group of Nazi hunters says it has identified 76 men and four women - many of whom may still be alive - who ran mobile death squads killing thousands of Jews during the 1930s and 40s. The Simon Wiesenthal Center claims to have identified dozens of former members of the Nazi death squads, and says it is now pushing the German government for a formal investigation. The centre's top Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff, said that his research is so solid that he last month sent the German justice and interior ministries a list of 76 men and four women he has identified as having served in the so-called Einsatzgruppen, adding that he is demanding those still living face charges. Victims: The Einsatzgruppen are known to have rounded up and shot Jews in the opening salvo of the Holocaust before the Nazi concentration camp system was properly established . The Einsatzgruppen - made up of primarily SS and police personnel - followed Nazi Germany's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war. They are known to have rounded up and shot Jews in the opening salvo of the Holocaust before the Nazi concentration camp system was properly established. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Einsatzgruppen had killed more than a million Soviet Jews, as well as tens of thousands of other people, by the spring of 1943. 'In the death camps the actual act of murder was carried out by a very small number of people - the people who put the gas into the gas chambers. But the actual act of murder in the Einsatzgruppen was carried out individually,' Zuroff said. Find: The Simon Wiesenthal Center's top Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff (pictured), said he is now pushing the German government for a formal investigation . 'Almost every person in the Einsatzgruppen was a murderer, a hands-on murderer,' he added. Zuroff said he narrowed down the list of possible suspects by choosing the youngest from a list of some 1,100 with dates of birth known to his organization. It is estimated that there had been about 3,000 members of the death squads. All 80 of those on his list would now be elderly if still alive, born between 1920 and 1924, Zuroff said. 'Time is running out,' he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. 'Something has to be done.' Because of Germany's strict privacy laws, the Wiesenthal Center has been unable to confirm exactly where the suspects live. But Zuroff said that task, and determining whether the individuals are still alive, should be relatively easy for police or prosecutors. He added that his office is willing to assist in any way in coming up with evidence or other details. 'The hope is that as many as possible will be alive, but there's no guarantee obviously,' he said. 'But every person alive today is a victory of sorts.' The Einsatzgruppen - made up of primarily SS and police personnel - followed Nazi Germany's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war. Pictured, SS leader Heinrich Himmler inspects . Germany's Interior Ministry had no immediate comment but the Justice Ministry said it had passed the details of the letter to the special federal prosecutors' office that investigates Nazi-era crimes. The head of that office, Kurt Schrimm, told the AP he hasn't yet received the new information. A handful of Einsatzgruppen members were tried and convicted after the war but most have gone unpunished. Schrimm has said, however, they could now be prosecuted under new German legal theory that service in a Nazi unit whose sole purpose was murder is enough to convict someone of accessory to murder - even without evidence of participation in a specific crime as had previously been required.","Simon Wiesenthal Center claims to have identified dozens of former Nazis .

"Winter is just around the corner, meaning we have to say goodbye to garden parties, barbecues and beer gardens for another year. With the colder months looking set to stay, more nights in are on the cards – whether by yourself, with your girly friends or perhaps with a loved one! Whether you're all loved-up or out on the prowl, it's always fun to glam up and get gorgeous. So this week, I thought I'd amp up the sex factor a tad and share with you how to achieve the perfect bedroom eyes. Scroll down for video . Beauty blogger Binky opted for a dark smokey eye for her sultry calendar shoot . LIDS . A sultry smokey eye is every girl's weapon of mass seduction – a timeless, alluring look that suits all eye shapes and skin tones. I find a jet black smokey eye to sometimes be slightly too harsh, though, so prefer to employ warmer brown tones for a softer yet equally sizzling result. The aptly titled Too Faced Boudoir Eyes Palette offers the perfect selection of silky neutral shades, from soft beiges and pinks to rich deep browns. To craft your come-to-bed eyes, first sweep the dusky pink shade Birthday Suit all over the lid using a fluffy shadow brush. Follow by applying the chocolate brown shade Voulez-Vous into the socket line and over your top and bottom lash lines, blending well as you go. Binky says that the smoky eye is the perfect beauty look for a romantic night in . Finally, take the deep brown shade French Tickler and dab it onto the outer corners of your eyes, winging the colour out for added va va voom. To give your peepers even more of a smoulder, line them gently with a soft brown kohl pencil such as Clarins Crayon Kohl Eyeliner Pencil in Intense Brown. Take the pencil halfway across your upper and lower lash lines for subtle, sexy definition. LASHES . Full, flirty lashes are a crucial component in creating the perfect boudoir eyes. If you haven't been blessed with naturally long, lustrous lashes, apply a coat of the Dior Maximiser Lash Primer before your mascara. This wonder serum instantly gives the illusion of longer and thicker lashes, and also provides an ideal base for your mascara to latch on to. Next, apply generous lashings of a volumising mascara to both your upper and lower lashes. Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara is my go-to mascara for seductive eyes, offering phenomenal volume and intense jet-black colour in just a few coats. Its smudge-proof formula will mean it won't budge all night, either! Binky recommends these products in order to create a smoldering boudoir beauty look . BROWS . Lastly, to frame your carefully crafted bedroom eyes, add some definition to your brows. The Guerlain Eyebrow Kit includes a range of blendable and long-wearing brow colour powders, designed to adapt to all tones. Gently sweep the colour onto your brows with the applicator before sweeping the pearly beige highlighter over your brow bone for a seductive arched look. And that's it – killer eyes to mystify any man, made in a matter of minutes! You can get all the products I've recommended at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. You may have heard that my 2015 calendar with Signature Calendars is now available.

"Animal welfare activists have labelled the shocking mistreatment of live Australian exports in Middle Eastern countries as 'atrocities'. Footage released by animal activist group Animals Australia has revealed 'sickening abuse' of cattle and sheep in Gaza, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia during the Islamic festival of sacrifice known as Eid al-Adha. During the festival, animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor, but the video footage shows such cruelty to Australian produce that the Federal regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny. 'It is nothing short of criminal, that a year on, we have again seen horrendous abuse of Australian cattle in Gaza while for the exporter legally responsible it is business-as-usual,' said Animals Australia Campaign Director Lyn White. Scroll down for video (censored due to graphic images) Animal welfare activists have labelled the shocking mistreatment of live Australian exports in Middle Eastern countries as 'atrocities' Footage released by animal activist group Animals Australia has revealed 'sickening abuse' of cattle and sheep . The abuse occurred in Gaza, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia during the Islamic festival of sacrifice known as Eid al-Adha. 'Despite extensive evidence of recurring breaches and shocking animal welfare consequences, there has not been a single prosecution of an export company, or a single charge laid.' In October, Animals Australia launched the largest coordinated live export investigation in history, which uncovered not only cruelty to live exports, but a cover up of the identification of offending exporters. The activist group pointed out that while the cruelty evidenced in the vision has come to be associated with the festival, the animal abuses have nothing to do with religion and everything to do with exporters who capitalise on the demand for live produce to slaughter en masse. In the footage, sheep are shown to be forced onto trucks for sale with broken legs, bulls with their legs and neck strung out between poles while their necks are roughly slashed open, and bulls repeatedly stabbed in public until they are unable to stand. Animals are also shown to have their tails broken, to be hit and made to bleed while crowds cheer, among other actions which the group have labelled . The activist group claims that investigators looking into illegal sheep sales in Jordan found that one company was offering locals four sheep in trade for 'beating up anyone with a camera'. During the festival, animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor, but the video footage shows such cruelty to Australian produce that the Federal regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny. They further claim that the Australian government has 'an abundance of evidence that ear tags are being removed from sheep and cattle being illegally sold and slaughtered in Jordan, Kuwait and Gaza — to prevent identification of the exporter. Akin to a burglar wiping away their fingerprints to avoid detection, nothing has been done to curb this destruction of evidence.' The group has named exporter Livestock Shipping Services in the investigation, claiming that the company has been implicated for at least 12 breaches of regulations in Gaza, Jordan and Kuwait. Meat and Livestock Australia allegedly failed to inform the Federal government that hundreds of sheep were being sold through a livestock market in Kuwait illegally, with Animals Australia claiming that this directly prevented action being taken for the animals in danger of abuse. Australia exports up to four million sheep and cattle per year, a figure which reflects a growing concern that animals exported have allegedly been deprived of water during extreme heat and left unable to stand after suffering debilitating injuries on long haul trips. Animals Australia have reported that nine complaints to the Department of Agriculture were lodged, and have said that the abuses could have been avoided if the Department had responded quickly and decisively. In October, Animals Australia launched the largest coordinated live export investigation in history, which uncovered not only cruelty to live exports, but a cover up of the identification of offending exporters. Sheep and cattle had their limbs tied and were denied access to water during periods of extreme heat . Animals Australia have reported that nine complaints to the Department of Agriculture were lodged, and have said that the abuses could have been avoided if the Department had responded quickly and decisively . 'This shocking abuse could have been prevented had the Department of Agriculture taken strong action against exporters who have repeatedly shown a brazen disregard for regulations in these markets,' said Ms White. The Department of Agriculture introduced the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) in 2012 to regulate the treatment of Australian cattle and prevent them being slaughtered in unauthorised abattoirs. A spokesperson from the Department said that the welfare of Australian animals remained a priority for the Australian Government. 'No-one supports animal cruelty, least of all Australian farmers and exporters. The Department of Agriculture is investigating the report and will publish its findings, along with any actions taken.' 'Through the ESCAS we continue to ensure that Australian livestock exported for feeder and slaughter purposes are handled and slaughtered in accordance with international standards.' 'Australia has arguably the strictest system in the world to ensure our exported sheep and cattle are treated as humanely as possible. We are the only one of 100 countries that export livestock that seeks to ensure international animal welfare standards are met throughout the entire supply chain.' However the activist group claim that the Department for Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, were failing to act in an organised and credible manner. 'Barnaby Joyce is overseeing a regulatory system that is shambolic and has no credibility whatsoever. The only reason the government even knows about these breaches is because of the work of a charity,' said Ms White. 'The fact that thousands of animals are continuing to be subjected to sickening cruelty in a number of markets, and yet we are seeing no commercial consequences for responsible export companies to motivate compliance, means that we are left with little choice but to relaunch our public campaign to end live export.' 'No-one supports animal cruelty, least of all Australian farmers and exporters. The Department of Agriculture is investigating the report and will publish its findings, along with any actions taken,' said a Department spokesperson .

"Ronny Deila hopes Celtic can be inspired by history when they seek to condemn Italian giants Inter Milan to a Europa League exit. The Parkhead club were paired with Inter in yesterday's last-32 draw in Nyon, creating a rematch of the Lisbon Lions' famous victory in the 1967 European Cup final. And Deila admits the echoes from Celtic's finest hour add another dimension to the glamour tie against Roberto Mancini's men. Ronny Deila (right) met Roberto Mancini on a visit to Manchester City when the Italian managed the club . 'It's going to be a very good match and I'm really looking forward to it,' said the Parkhead boss. 'We are meeting a big opponent but we always have a chance. 'I know Roberto Mancini is their manager now, that they have been struggling a bit for the last year or two and aren't the team they were in 2010 when they won the Champions League. 'But they are a good team and it's going to be a tough game. Everything is possible, however, and we have everything to play for. We will have to be at our best in both games to hopefully go through. 'The history adds to the match and every training exercise and match will be to prepare us as good as possible.' Celtic manager Ronny Deila is looking forward to glamour tie against Inter Milan . Celtic host Inter – currently mid-table in Serie A - on February 19 before the return leg in San Siro seven days later. Deila's side have lost their last two European outings, but will have Swedish striker John Guidetti eligible to play after he was sidelined during the group stage. 'It will be a positive thing to have John with us during these games,' Deila told the Celtic website. 'It's important to get everybody ready for the game, keep them injury-free and keep the squad as good as possible.' Celtic assistant manager John Collins also enthused about the tie, adding: 'It' s a wonderful draw, an exciting draw. They are a big Italian side but they are not firing on all cylinders in their league and are beatable, particularly at home with our support. 'They are a prestigious club, with a fantastic venue and a lot of history, similar to us. It's two massive clubs with great history going up against one another. Celtic were drawn against Inter Milan in Europa League last-32 draw on Monday . 'It's a very good draw and we will have to play well to win. It will have everyone excited - the players, coaching staff and the supporters. And that's what we want – we need excitement and challenges. 'It brings back wonderful memories, certainly among the older supporters, of a special day in the club's history. But the stories have been passed down from generation to generation. It ticks all the boxes. 'There will be a big crowd at Celtic Park and one that will excite the supporters, and the players will be motivated and fired-up for it. 'They have international-class players and it will be a big challenge. We wanted a big game and a big challenge. It's winnable but we will have to play well, which we are at the moment.' Inter managing director Marco Farrone represented his club at the draw and is eagerly anticipating their trip to Glasgow. 'The Celtic tie has the feel of a Champions League match, due to the two sides' history,' said Farrone. 'There will be an incredible atmosphere but we're ready to face that. Playing the second leg at home is a minor advantage. It will be one of the most exciting ties of the round. 'There are five rounds between here and (the final) in Warsaw. But we need to try and win this competition for the prestige and for the chance to qualify for the Champions League.'","Celtic to face Inter Milan in last 32 of the Europa League .

"The head of a celebrity rehab centre which treated Amy Winehouse faces being struck off after being found to have falsely claimed to be a doctor. Brendan Quinn, a former nurse, co-founded the Causeway Retreat, an addiction clinic based in a remote manor house on Osea Island off the coast of Essex in 2005. The £10,000-a-week centre also treated Take That star Mark Owen, actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and members of some of Britain’s wealthiest families. Tragic: Sarah Mulvey, left, stayed at Causeway Retreat in May 2009. She made a suicide attempt the day before she was told by staff to leave the island. The clinic was co-founded by Brendan Quinn, pictured right . But following the death by suicide of at least two former patients, including Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, health watchdogs launched an investigation. It was was closed in 2010 after being refused registration by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The firm behind the clinic, 27 Management, in which Quinn was a major shareholder, was taken to court at the time and was fined £8,000 for running an unlicensed hospital. The judge said the standards at Causeway Retreat 'would really shame a Third World country'. Today Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, was found guilty of a string of misconduct charges against him that included leaving drugs in a suitcase in an unlocked room and failing to properly supervise patients. It followed a series of sticky and high-profile legal proceedings involving Quinn, who described himself as a 'specialist nurse'. Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like ‘10 Years Younger’ and ‘How To Look Good Naked,’ committed suicide in January 2010 after she was treated at the Retreat. Miss Mulvey had stayed at the property in May 2009, after being signed off from work with stress. Celebrity patients: The £10,000-a-week centre treated Take That star Mark Owen and singer Amy WInehouse . She had self-harmed and made a suicide attempt the day before she was told by staff to leave the island. At an inquest into her death, her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, criticised the clinic, saying: ‘There were so many opportunities at this point to help her and they were not taken.’ Advertising material for the Causeway retreat named Quinn as one of Britain’s 250 best private doctors, when he was not even qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. He was also found to have admitted patients with mental health problems to the unlicensed facility, which did not have a doctor on site at all times. While he was in charge medication was administered by unqualified staff without valid prescriptions and drugs were stored in a suitcase in an unlocked room. And Quinn also failed to tell employees they were working illegally in an unlicensed hospital. The hearing into Quinn’s management of the Causeway began in 2012 and has been adjourned at least five times, having run for more than 90 days, costing the taxpayer more than £300,000. Quinn denied all the allegations against him, insisting former staff members had cooked up elaborate stories to ruin his reputation. He said: ‘They have been determined to absolutely destroy my career and indeed they’ve done an absolutely superb job. ‘They have come here and they have given evidence and they’ve had regular meetings outside this process.’ He claimed he had also been bombarded with anonymous text messages from pay-as-you go phones threatening him and his family. But the panel dismissed Quinn’s claims of an elaborate conspiracy saying it ‘lacks credibility'. James Spencer, NMC panel chair, said: ‘A number of assertions you made during the course of your evidence did not stand up to scrutiny. ‘The panel finds that holding yourself out as a doctor, in the way that you did was dishonest.’ Clinic: The Causeway Retreat, an addiction clinic based in a remote manor house on Osea Island off the coast of Essex, was co-founded by Brendan Quinn in 2005. It was later closed in 2010 . Earlier Krystal Whymet for the NMC said: ‘Quinn allowed for clients to be admitted to Causeway who were suffering from mental health matters, even when warned by the CSCI (Commission for Social Care Inspection) that this was not appropriate. ‘He did not ensure that the clients suffering from mental health matters were adequately assessed of supervised. ‘He did not ensure that patients with mental health matters were provided with adequate treatment plans or aftercare. ‘The registrant allowed a client who had suffered a stroke to be admitted to the Causeway despite not having adequate facilities for mobility restricted patients. ‘He failed to ensure that adequate arrangements were in place to prevent risks to the health and safety of clients staff and visitors.’ The NMC will consider whether Quinn’s fitness to practise is impaired by reason of misconduct on 24 November.

"This is the horrifying moment that an orphaned baby bear is brutally battered over the head with a metal pipe before its lifeless body is dragged away by its drunk attacker. Shocking footage of the incident shows a Russian man striking the cub with the 5ft pipe as his friend looks on and laughs. The young bear had been foraging for food with its sibling in woods near an oil field in Khanty-Mansiysk, western Serbia, when it was approached by two men drinking from large beer bottles. The cubs had lost their mother just weeks earlier. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Tame: The bear cubs, both used to human interaction, are unafraid as they are approached by two drunk men . Weapon: The man struggles to lift the heavy 5ft metal pipe as his friend, pictured in white, laughs behind him . The video, which was filmed by a man working at the Priobskoye oil field, in Khanty-Mansiysk, western Siberia, was met with widespread outrage after it was uploaded to YouTube earlier this month. The cameraman, known only as Alexey, said that the cubs, who were recently orphaned, had grown used to being fed by him and his colleagues. The cub that was attacked has not been seen since. Speaking to the Siberian Times, Alexey explained that the animals were both very comfortable interacting with humans - even allowing the oil field workers to put collars on their necks. He was filming the animals as they left the woods when two drunken men, drinking from large bottles of beer, stepped out a car and approached the animals. Strike: Lifting the pipe over his shoulder, the man prepares to strike one of the cubs as it backs into the woods . Unaware of the potential danger, the cubs remained calm as the two men walked towards them. Encouraged by his laughing friend, one of the men picked up a 5ft metal pipe that so heavy he appears barely lift it - and brought it down on the cub's head as it tried to back away. Still filming, Alexey is heard shouting 'What are you doing?', but said that he did not confront the men as he feared for his own safety. The lifeless bear was then dragged along the ground by its collar to the boot of the mens' car before the video ends. It is not known if the cub was put into the car, or if it was dead, but workers say it has not been seen again. Alexey explained he had released the video in the hope of identifying the men. Sickening: After striking the cub over its head, the attacker drags the cub's lifeless body from the undergrowth . Horrific: The cub is dragged by its collar to the back of a waiting car. It is not known what happened to it . He said: 'The sickening moment was filmed when both cubs came out to eat, and one of the oil workers decided to film them eating, not expecting this drunk scumbag to do what he has done. 'Perhaps a maximum punishment he will get will be a fine for being violent towards animals.' His hope of finding the culprits worked and the Khanty-Mansiysk Nature Protection Watchdog revealed the pair, one a Ukrainian citizen, had been quickly identified and had pleaded guilty. Alexey added: 'They said they had let the cub go and it got better but no one ever saw it again after that incident and now only one bear gets out to eat.'

"They are the Champions League holders, the European Super Cup holders and the Spanish Cup holders and Real Madrid can add another trophy to their growing haul if they lift the Club World Cup on December 20. Carlo Ancelotti's team arrived in Morocco on Sunday and play their semi-final on Tuesday. Here's our guide to the trophy only one English team has been able to win. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights of the first two Club World Cup matches . Gareth Bale (left) congratulates Cristiano Ronaldo for his goal against Ludogorets on Tuesday evening . Where is the tournament being held? In the Moroccan cities of Rabbat, and Marrakech. This is the second consecutive year Morocco has staged the tournament. Japan will host the next two versions of the competition. Any chance of a host victory? No. Atletico Tetuan were knocked out by Auckland City on day one. But the locals don't mind too much. They will all support Real Madrid now. James Rodriguez and, above all, Cristiano Ronaldo are the local favourites. Carlo Ancelotti, the head coach of Real Madrid, arrives at the team hotel in Rabat, Morocco . Cristiano Ronaldo is ushered into his hotel as Real Madrid's squad arrive in Morocco . And on a run of 20 straight victories, are Madrid are the overwhelming favourites? The pitches and their own injury problems may end up being their biggest obstacles. They sent their Galatico groundsman Paul Burgess to look over the pitch at Rabat but the game on Tuesday - against Cruz Azul, from Mexico - has already been moved to Marrakech after heavy rain left the surface in a 'farcical' condition. Because they are already without Luka Modric (thigh) until March and Rodriguez with a less serious calf injury the last thing they need is another man down. Real Madrid's World Club Cup semi-final against Cruz Azu has been moved to Marrakech after rain left the Rabat pitch in a 'farcical' condition . Apart from local support, will Madrid have Spanish backing? There are around 8,000 Spaniards in Morocco and some will travel for the tournament from Spain. Packages cost around £950 for the whole tournament and £300 to fly in and see just the final and then fly out again. Will Madrid definitely reach the final? They will have to beat Cruz Azul, who won the CONCACAF Cup against Toluca FC but have failed to reach the play-offs contested by the top eight teams in Mexico this season. Cruz Azul will face Real Madrid after they beat Western Sydney Wanderers . And if Real do reach the final, who will they face? The Pope's team – San Lorenzo. They beat Paraguay's Nacional in the Copa de Libertadores to win the tournament for the first time in their 106-year history and end a five-year run of Brazilian domination. If they beat  Auckland City in the semi-final they will stand between Madrid and their first Club World Cup. Auckland City players celebrate beating Moroccan side Moghreb Athletic Tetouan on penalties . Have Madrid ever won it before? Well yes and no. They won the tournament's predecessor - the Intercontinental - three times in 1960, 1998 and 2002. How have English teams fared? Badly. Manchester United won the old Intercontinental in 1999 and the Club World Cup in 2008 but no other English team has won either tournament since it began in 1960. Liverpool (twice), Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest were all runners-up in the early Eighties. And Liverpool again in 2005 and Chelsea in 2012 were also beaten finalists. Manchester United won the Club World Cup back in 2008, the only English club to do so . How badly do Madrid want this? It's one thing calling yourself the best team in the world but if you win the Club World Cup then it's official. This is one of five trophies they can win this season. The European Super Cup is in the bag, La Liga, the Spanish Cup and the Champions League could all follow. And as an added incentive Barcelona won this trophy in 2009 and 2011, so there is ground to be made up on the old enemy.","Real Madrid will take part in a semi-final match in Morocco on Tuesday .

"Jahi McMath, 13, was left with brain damage the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival without a respirator . The family of a 13-year-old who was declared brain dead 10 months ago following complications from routine tonsil surgery  has petitioned a judge to have her declared 'alive again'. Chris Dolan, the family's attorney, claimed he has 'medical experts, including world-class experts on brain death who will testify she is not brain dead'. Jahi McMath's relatives won a high-profile legal battle to keep their daughter's life support machine turned on at the start of the year, after a coroner issued her death certificate. The hospital treating Jahi released her into the care of her mother Nailah Winkfield and other family members who agreed to  be 'wholly and exclusively responsible'for the teenager. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Jahi spent the past several months being looked after at a Roman Catholic hospital in New Jersey at private expense. But if the judge sides with the family following their petition at Alameda County Superior Court,  it could lead to Jahi being cared for at state taxpayers' expense. However, Mr Dolan insisted that the latest legal maneuver is not about money. Although he did acknowledge that 'she would be eligible for the same state benefits as every other person not brain dead on a ventilator, and who gets full medical care'. He added that the family wanted Jahi to be looked after in California 'and not have somebody pull the ventilator on her if she is in the hospital'. The teenager suffered a cardiac arrest following a routine operation to remove her tonsils at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, on December 9. She was left with brain damage that the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a respirator was turned off.

"A man convicted of the thrill killing of an elderly Melbourne couple has today been jailed for 32 years. Thomas Hemming, 21, will serve at least 27 years behind bars for the murders of Robert Adamson, 65, and his wife, Cheryl, 60, at their Murrumbeena home in February this year. He had held lifelong fantasies about what it would feel like to kill, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. At 6am on February 19, Hemming put on black gloves and a black leather jacket, and went to knock on the door of his neighbours Robert and Cheryl Adamson, asking to use their phone. Once inside he stabbed Mr Adamson in the back and chest multiple times with a 'large and lethal looking knife' he had ordered online, the court heard. Mrs Adamson picked up a broom and swung it at Hemming before he turned on her. 'No Empathy': Thomas Hemming arrives in the Supreme Court in Melbourne on Friday . Killed for kicks: Robert Adamson, 65, with wife Cheryl, 60 were murdered by Thomas Hemming . 'Cheryl Adamson died protecting her husband and then herself,' said Justice Betty King in the Victorian Supreme Court on Friday. 'They were good, decent and caring neighbours and community members.' Justice King described the murder as a 'thrill kill' and said Hemming's lack of remorse made him an 'exceedingly poor prospect of rehabilitation.' 'You remain incapable of feeling any empathy, sorrow or regret for your fellow human beings,' she said in court. Prosecutor Gavin Silbert SC said Hemming had told police he thought it was better to kill an old couple than someone young. 'He wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone,' Mr Silbert told the pre-sentence hearing on Monday. Justice King said the Adamson's son and daughter  had experienced anger, grief and bewilderment  that their parents had been killed in their own home. 'It was unfortunate that their son was the person who found the bodies and undoubtedly that will be difficult to ever erase,' she said. Robert and Cheryl Adam were well known and like in their community. They are pictured here with their son, Michael . During his police interview Hemming initially denied his involvement in the Adamsons' deaths but has since pleaded guilty to the two murders. Defence lawyer Damian Sheales said Hemming was a young offender who had lived a narrow existence and had Asperger's syndrome. The court heard he had been up drinking whiskey the night before committing the murders. Psychologist Daniel Sullivan said Hemming had a preoccupation with killing. People with Asperger's syndrome are more likely to be victims of violence, than violent offenders, he told the court. A friend of the Adamsons, Andrew Masters, said the crime is scarier now that he knows there was no real motive. 'There was some suggestion that Asperger's limited his ability to feel for the victims, but I have Asperger's myself and I feel plenty for the victims,' he told reporters outside court. The court heard Hemming was a former student of De La Salle in Malvern and had difficulty making friends but came from a loving, stable family.","Thomas James Hemming will serve at least 27 years for double murder .

"A desperate husband has spoken of his despair at the disappearance of his real estate agent wife, who vanished showing a property to an unknown would-be buyer just as locals spotted a stranger pull up in a pick-up truck. Beverly Carter, 49, disappeared from a foreclosed home in Scott, Arkansas, after going to an appointment with an unknown buyer on Thursday, sparking a huge search effort. Her husband Carl Carter, who found her car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open, said 'I'm going to try to be strong as best I can - I just want my wife back'. His plea came as one neighbor revealed he saw a 'skinny white man' pull up at the house in a pick-up truck around the time of the disappearance. Scroll down for video . Missing: Carl Carter, left, spoke of his distress at the disappearance of his real estate agent wife Beverly Carter, right, who vanished from a home in Scott, Arkansas on Thursday . Hunt: Mrs Carter, a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas, has now been missing for three days . Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her. Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.' He could find no sign of her inside, and police and volunteers have been searching ever since. The pick-up driver described has not been found by police, and it is unclear whether he was the buyer Mrs Carter was going to meet. Beverly Carter, 49, vanished from the property in Scott, near Little Rock, Arkansas, after meeting an unknown person at the address on Thursday afternoon. She was reported missing by her husband Carl after she didn't make contact with her family for three and a half hours after the 5.30pm appointment. Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash . When Carter went to the property to look for his wife, he found her car, a brown Cadillac, containing her pursue, outside of the house, which had a wide open door. There was no trace of her inside. Police investigators say there was no evidence of a crime being committed. Mrs Carter is blonde, has green eyes, is 5' 2"" tall and weighs around 145lbs, according to search effort descriptions. Mrs Carter, who works for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was last seen wearing a black, sleeveless shirt and red shorts. According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash. Carter, who says it is extremely unusual for his wife not to stay in close contact, said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared. Search: Mrs Carter's husband, Carl Carter, told how he went looking for his wife and found an empty home and an abandoned car . He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said ""Yes."" Then she sent another text that said, ""My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."" 'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said ""Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends.""' 'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.' He told First Coast News: 'Her car was there, and the house was wide open, and I knew that something was wrong.' Search: Police in Arkansas continued their search for Mrs Carter today . Left at the house: Mrs Carter's husband arrived at the home to find her new Cadillac - with custom plates - left outside, while the door of the house was open . The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office started its second day of searching this morning, and is urging landowners in the area to search their property in case she is there. Colleagues described Mrs Carter as 'fun-loving' and 'the sunshine in the office', adding they will strengthen protections for estate agents heading out alone in future. Anybody with information regarding the case can contact the sheriff's office on 501-340-6600.","Beverly Carter, 49, was showing a home in Scott, Arkansas, on Thursday .

"Oscar winning actress Joan Fontaine has died aged 96. The Hollywood icon, who maintained a bitter rivalry with her sister and fellow actress Olivia de Havilland, passed away from natural causes in her sleep at her home in California on Sunday. Fontaine's assistant confirmed the death to The Hollywood Reporter, a fitting end for the star who once told Vanity Fair she wanted to die 'in bed – alone'. She had been fading in recent days and died 'peacefully,' her longtime friend Noel Beutel said. Hollywood legend: Joan Fontaine, who won an Academy Award in 1941 for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion, has passed away at the age of 96 . Strained . relationship: Joan and her sister Olivia De Havilland were bitter . rivals in their personal and professional lives and didn't speak to each . other since the Seventies . Joan won an Academy Award in 1941 for . her role in Alfred Hitchcock’s Suspicion, beating a host of other . actresses including her older sister Olivia to the prestigious honour. She starred alongside Cary Grant in the Oscar winning role while De Havilland had been nominated for To Each His Own. The actress and her sister were at loggerheads throughout their lives and finally stopped speaking to . each other in 1975 after their mother died of cancer. Fontaine said de Havilland had not . invited her to the memorial service, but her sister claimed Fontaine had . said she was too busy to attend. 'I married first, won the Oscar before . Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be livid because I . beat her to it,' Fontaine was quoted as telling the Hollywood Reporter . in 1978, according to the Washington Post. De Havilland, herself a two-time Oscar winner, is 97 and living in Paris. Long life: Joan, pictured here in 1981, was 96 when she passed away from natural causes on Saturday in Carmel, California . Three-time Oscar nominee: Fontaine in Vivien Leigh's flat in London in 1966 . Fontaine with Cary Grant (left) in her Oscar-winning film Suspicion and (right) with director Alfred Hitchcock . Both frankly confessed that, even as children, they detested one another. At . times, they were in competition for the same men - one was the eccentric . billionaire Howard Hughes. Sometimes they fought for the same leading . roles. In the case of Gone With The Wind, it was Olivia who won the role . of Melanie Hamilton Wilkes, and Joan who did not. But when it came to Alfred . Hitchcock’s screen version of Daphne du Maurier’s novel Rebecca, it was . Joan who beat her sister to the coveted role of the second Mrs de . Winter. Glamorous: Joan Fontaine, with her third husband, the writer and producer Collier Young, in 1958 . Beauty: Joan, pictured in 1936,  was one of Alfred Hitchcock's famed blondes and the only actor to ever win an Oscar for one of his movies . Famous role: Joan starred with Laurence Olivier in Rebecca, for which she received an Oscar nomination in 1940, the year before she won for Suspicion . Fontaine appeared in more than 30 movies, including early roles in The Women and Gunga Din, the title part in Jane Eyre and in Max Ophuls' historical drama Letter from an Unknown Woman. She was also in films directed by Billy Wilder including The Emperor Waltz, Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and, wised up and dangerous, in Nicholas Ray's Born to be Bad. Fontaine was featured in Jane Eyre with Orson Welles and she and Bing Crosby got top billing in Emperor Waltz. Her most daring role came in the 1957 film Island in the Sun, in which she had an interracial romance with Harry Belafonte. Several Southern cities banned the movie after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. Fontaine said she left Hollywood because she was asked to play Elvis Presley's mother. 'Not that I had anything against Elvis Presley. But that just wasn't my cup of tea,' she said. While making New York her home for 25 years, she appeared in about 30 dinner theater plays. She starred on Broadway in 1954 in Tea . and Sympathy and in 1980 received an Emmy nomination for her cameo on . the daytime soap Ryan's Hope. The cause of their estrangement went far beyond professional . sibling-rivalry, however. Its real roots lay in festering family jealousy and in . the desperate battle waged by both women for the love of their mother, . Lilian — who switched her affection bewilderingly from one sister to the . other for more than half a century. 'I regret that I remember not one act of kindness from her all through my childhood,' Fontaine wrote. De Havilland reportedly saw her younger sister as a sneaky attention-getter, melodramatically playing sick and trying to outdo her. The competition was more fierce in 1942 when both sisters were nominated for Oscars and Fontaine took home the statuette for Suspicion in which she played an English woman who begins to suspect her charming husband of trying to kill her. 'It was a bittersweet moment,' Fontaine later recalled. 'I was appalled that I won over my sister.' When de Havilland won her own Oscar . for To Each His Own, she snubbed Fontaine by ignoring her congratulatory . gesture at the ceremony. De Havilland reportedly was upset because Fontaine had made a catty remark about her husband. Fontaine . was nominated three times in all, for her role in Hitchcock's Rebecca . in 1940, for Suspicion and again three years later for Edmund Goulding's . The Constant Nymph. She . filmed her last big screen movie in 1966, the horror film The Witches, . and officially retired in 1994 after working on TV movie Good King . Wenceslas. Feud: Joan Fontaine (pictured in Rebecca in 1940) stopped speaking to her sister in 1975 after their mother died of cancer . Retired: . Joan, pictured in 1956, filmed her last big screen movie in 1966, the . horror film The Witches, and officially retired in 1994 after working on . TV movie Good King Wenceslas . Rival: Olivia de Havilland (left in 2006) and (right) with husband Marcus Goodridge on their wedding day in 1946 . Fontaine was . married four times, to Brian Aherne, William Dozier – the father of her . daughter Deborah - Collier Young and finally Sports Illustrated golf . editor Alfred Wright, Jr. She and Wright divorced in 1969. In her memoirs, Fontaine maintained she repeatedly turned down marriage proposals from multimillionaire Howard Hughes as well as offers to be the mistress of Joseph Kennedy and other political figures. In later years, she avidly tended her gardens and doted on her dogs, who numbered as many as five and were taken in from animal rescue agencies. Fontaine was also known for being exceptionally gracious to fans, answering correspondence and indulging autograph requests until shortly before her death. Joan is survived by her sister, . daughter Deborah and adopted daughter Martita. She previously admitted . to falling out with both of her children and it is not clear if they had . reconciled at the time of her death.","Icon passes away in her sleep after saying she wanted to die 'in bed - alone'

"Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear crew may have broken the law by switching number plates on his Porsche during their controversial trip to Argentina. The TV show's presenters' convoy was attacked by locals armed with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles amid claims the H982 FKL number plates were a reference to the 1982 Falklands war. Clarkson, 54, has insisted the plates' apparent reference to the conflict were an unfortunate coincidence and were changed as soon as it was noticed. But the scandal engulfing the show deepened today when it emerged that by attaching the vehicle's previous number plates, Clarkson and his crew may have broken the law. Scroll down for videos . Argentine officials and newspapers took offence to Clarkson's number plate, which they said was a 'provocation' and a 'very big offence'. They claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 Falklands conflict . Pictures from after the car was attacked show the controversial number plate - H982 FKL - had been changed to one previously registered to the vehicle - H1 VAE (shown, left) The Top Gear team (pictured during their trip to Argentina) including Richard Hammond (far left), Jeremy Clarkson (second left) and James May (far right) were forced to flee the country after being hounded by a mob . Clarkson was spotted in Chelsea, west London, today after flying home after flying home from Chile . Records show the car - which last changed hands in August, weeks before the ill-fated trip - was registered as H982 FKL to the Porsche 928 featured in the show in 1991. But it was later changed to H1 VAE - the registration plate later attached to the car in Argentina - by a previous owner in 2001, before being changed back. Records suggest that the H1 VAE plate is now registered to another car in a UK, a Porsche 911 Turbo, and has been since 2006. The DVLA today confirmed that it is an offence to drive a car 'in this country or abroad' under a plate assigned to a different vehicle. A spokesman said: 'The UK rules are clear – a vehicle can only display a registration mark that is currently assigned to that vehicle. 'Failure to comply with these rules can result in a fine of up to £1,000 and enforcement of this offence would be a matter for the police. 'We would always advise motorists planning on taking a vehicle abroad to check the vehicle registration rules of the individual registration authorities.' The BBC has said it is looking into the controversy but is unable to comment on the issue at present. It came as Clarkson claimed that Argentina allegedly told Chilean officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from the angry mob. Clarkson said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the Falklands War . The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road in Argentina before they fled across the border to Chile . The presenter said  they faced difficulty crossing into Chile when the Argentinians ordered that they were stopped. He told The Sun: 'Their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally. He added: ‘'Luckily for us, we’re really popular in Chile and they love the British so the official refused. In fact his direct quote was, “I told them, f*** you!”.’ Clarkson described the official as a ‘real hero’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into Chile. He also accused the Argentinians of taking advantage of their visit for 'political capital' and said the violent protest was 'state-organised'. ‘The more I think about this, the more I’m convinced we were set up by the local government,’ he added. The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina. The crew later fled over the border to Chile . Jeremy Clarkson (pictured after landing at Heathrow) said the number plate was a complete coincidence . The drama unfolded when the Top Gear convoy was attacked with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the BBC motoring show. Clarkson said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted: ‘This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'. They were eventually forced to flee Argentina under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to 'kill' them. The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said. The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991. FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA. Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner. Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. They faced a gruelling six-hour journey to the Chilean border in a collection of hired 4x4s, trucks and the three 'star' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘car football match’ for the show. They eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road, but a river, and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country. Earlier, Clarkson took to Twitter to confirm that he, along with the rest of the Top Gear team, had not meant to cause offence with H982 FKL plate. He wrote: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it. 'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths. 'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed. 'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong. 'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.' Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman has told the Guardian: 'Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme,. 'To suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue.' Clarkson took to Twitter upon returning to the UK to clarify that no offence was intended to be caused . April 2007 - Referring to a car made in Malaysia, he said it was built by 'jungle people who wear leaves as shoes'. October 2009 - Claimed TV producers were obsessed with having 'black Muslim lesbians' on screen. January 2012 - He compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004. January 2012 - Clarkson mocked the clothing, trains and food in India, as he ridiculed the country's sanitation by driving a Jaguar fitted with a toilet through slums. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC about the comments. March 2013 - The presenter joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had a 'slope on it'. The BBC later apologised but said it was not aware of the racist term at the time. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson had deliberately used racist language, but the BBC did not take action against him. April 2014 - He took to Twitter to introduce his new dog - a black terrier he named Didier Dogba after the Ivory Coast and Chelsea footballer, Didier Drogba. May 2014 - Clarkson was caught in a clip reciting the rhyme: 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe' before mumbling what sounded like 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Clarkson initially denied the incident but then backed down and said he was 'mortified' and 'horrified' when he realised it 'did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure'.","Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear crew hounded out of Argentina by a mob .

"Comedy superstar Michael McIntyre walked off stage during a sold-out show because a member of the audience on the front row kept using her phone, it has emerged. An angry McIntrye asked security to 'sort it out' and promised the audience at Darlington's Civic Theatre he would be back, before he left the stage at last night's performance. According to the Northern Echo newspaper, some fans chanted for the woman to be thrown out and security staff spoke to her. Soon after the comedian, 38, carried on his act, in which he previewed material for his 2015 tour. People on Twitter apologised to the comedian after the show. Scroll down for video . Not so funny: Michael Mcintyre, pictured performing at the Help The Heroes Concert 2010 held at Twickenham Stadium, stormed off stage because a member of the audience on the front row kept using her phone . One said: 'Michael McIntyre walked off stage in Darlington tonight because a woman in the front row kept using her phone. Stay classy Darlo.' Another said: 'Great show in Darlington tonight.... sorry about the idiot in the front row. You handled her perfectly.' And another wrote: 'You were absolutely fantastic my face cheeks are hurting. Sorry about the idiot front row.' McIntyre and wife Kitty arrive for a Best of Britain's Creative Industries Reception at the Foreign Office in June . Michael McIntyre, aged 17, and his father Ray Cameron in London in 1993, six months before his  suicide . This weekend the comedian said he was ‘heartbroken’ after his step-mother revealed his father committed suicide. The comedian said he disapproved of disclosing the ‘painful and personal’ information, which has been kept secret for more than 20 years. McIntyre was brought up believing his father Cameron had died of a heart attack, and only discovered that he had killed himself four years ago. His father, who was also a comedian and worked for four years on the Kenny Everett Show, suffered from depression after a downturn in his career. The BBC paid McIntyre about £500,000 to present his six-part chat show . He shot himself in the utility room of a Hollywood apartment block in 1993, aged 55. His widow Holly, now 58, decided to shield the truth from McIntyre, who was only 17 at the time, and his 15-year-old sister Lucy. But yesterday, she revealed that she was forced to tell her two step-children the truth in 2010 after McIntyre was invited to take part in a BBC series probing his background. She feared his death certificate would be found, revealing the real cause of death. McIntyre is one of the highest-grossing comics in the world and last year paid £2.5 million for a six-bedroom house in the Wiltshire countryside. The comedian turned BBC1 chat show host pocketed more than £9million for his 73-date Showtime tour, which included ten nights at London’s O2 Arena in 2012 . It is a far cry from his plight a decade ago, when he was £40,000 in debt and struggling on the stand-up circuit. Dame Helen Mirren (circled) once stormed off stage to shout at a drumming group that was disturbing her play at the Gielgud Theatre in London . McIntyre is just the latest performer to have a show brought to a halt by a phone. Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey had to reprimand a member of the audience when their phone rang out during a one-man show at London's Old Vic in June. He had to halt the legal drama Clarence Darrow to call out: 'If you don't answer that, I will!' He received a round of applause. Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig's unflappable reaction to a phone call spoiling their Broadway show A Steady Rain in 2009 became an internet sensation. 'Don't be embarrassed, just grab the phone,' Jackman urged at one point. Dame Helen Mirren once stormed off stage to shout at a drumming group that was disturbing her play at the Gielgud Theatre in London in May last year. After the incident the actress saw the funny side and helped promote the drummers' event . Some witnesses said the 69-year-old star told the group to ‘shut the **** up’. Others said she ‘stomped out and shrieked “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here!”' She was angry they had disturbed the first half of her play with their drumming, designed to promote gay and transgender festival As One In The Park. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said something 'had to be done' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor Paul Ritter could barely hear each other speak. She was playing the Queen in The Audience, a play about the monarch’s private weekly meetings with various prime ministers at Buckingham Palace.","The comedian left the stage for a short time while staff spoke to the woman .

"The future of TLC's surprise hit reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo hangs in the balance after it was reported that 'Mama June' Shannon is dating a child sex offender. And in an effort to set the record straight Mama June took to her daughter Honey Boo Boo's Facebook page with a message for her fans. The 35-year-old wrote: 'I want to make a post trying to clear up the rumors remember you can't believe everything you read!' 'Ppl sell stories to the tabloid everyday that r false!' She continued. 'It isnt true i promise my kids r #1 priority over anything else and I would never put them in danger period over this or anything else they r my life this is my past I left him 10 yrs ago for it and I wouldn't go back'. Scroll down for video . 'You Can't believe everything you read': Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June Shannon is reportedly dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel - allegedly pictured here in a hotel room last month . And her 14-year-old daughter Lauryn Shannon - otherwise known as Pumpkin - has spoken to RadarOnline about her mom's prior relationship with Mark McDaniel in a bid to douse the flames. 'The story is not true. My mom left Mark 10 years ago,' the teenager insists, adding: 'They haven’t seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years.' While TMZ has obtained a photo allegedly taken a month ago of the 34-year-old reality star snuggling up to the 53-year-old in a hotel bed, Pumpkin has slammed the evidence as simply 'Photoshopped'. Facebook message: The 35-year-old wrote: 'I want to make a post trying to clear up the rumors remember you can't believe everything you read!' Hitting back: The star has come out to defend herself . With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin states. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' The matriarch is also mom to Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, Jessica 'Chubs' Shannon, 17, and Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon Cardwell, 20. 'She is all about the kids': Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 - seen here in March 2013 - insists her mom and her ex 'haven't seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years' and the recently separated star is enjoying the single life since splitting from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson last month . The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell. According to reports confirmed by the MailOnline, Mark McDaniel is a registered sex offender in the reality show's home state of Georgia. The registry details that Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'. TMZ reports that Mama June has been dating her ex for the last few months, citing the aforementioned photo as proof of their liaisons. Just released: Mark was released from prison last month after being jailed for 10 years for molesting an unnamed eight-year-old relative of then-girlfriend Mama June's . The pair were also said to be romantically involved at the time of his arrest. Horrifyingly, TMZ claims that McDaniel was convicted of assault one of June's own relatives. The website reports: 'Prosecutors say he molested an eight-year-old child - forcing oral sex. 'We're told Honey Boo Boo's mom has been seeing McDaniel for the last few months ... sneaking away from production of the show and meeting up with him. We're told she's also been setting him up by buying him various gifts.' In light of the revelations, TLC said it is now examining whether the show will continue. Serious charge: The 53-year-old - pictured here in a mug shot believed to be from his original arrest - was convicted of aggravated child molestation reportedly perpetrated against an eight-year-old . Registered: McDaniel's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts . A representative told the MailOnline: 'TLC is not currently in production on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We are very concerned about this new information and are reassessing the future of the series.' TMZ contacted Mama June for comment but has yet to receive a response. The reality star does have a history of dating convicted criminals - including estranged partner Sugar Bear, who is the father of her youngest daughter and show star Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson. In 1998, he was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper. In doubt: The future of Mama June's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo - which stars her youngest daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson - is now being reassessed . Recent split: Last month, the reality matriarch and her partner on nine years, David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, revealed they had separated. The couple shared a televised commitment ceremony last year . The couple - who had a televised commitment ceremony last year after nine years together - only announced their split last month, but it is understood Mama June may have already been dating Mark at the time. Tragically, this is not the only sex offender that Mama June has been linked to. The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 17-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, Michael Anthony Ford, 37, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant, is currently behind bars. Criminal past: In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper . In 2008, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet due to an offence committed in 2005. According to prison documents, he was charged with two more counts of sexual exploration of a child, also steaming from 2005, and is currently serving 10 years for each charge. He is not expected to be released until 2026. Here Comes Honey Boo Boo first aired in 2012 and was a spin-off from TLC's Toddlers And Tiaras. The show aired its fourth season finale in August and, prior to the controversy, there had been no announcement on whether it would be renewed.

"There won't be any trick-or-treating in the northeastern Pennsylvania area where authorities continue searching for a suspect accused of killing a state trooper. Officials in rural Barrett Township in Pennsylvania canceled the beloved Halloween ritual and the annual parade because of the police manhunt for Eric Frein. But kids did get to 'trunk or treat' over the weekend. The event held at a school parking lot included candy, a costume contest and car trunks decorated for the spooky holiday. Scroll down for video . Still at large: Frein (left and right), a self-taught survivalist, allegedly used a rifle to open fire outside the state police barracks on September 12, killing Corporal Bryan Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex Douglass . Halloween was canceled in Barrett Township as police continued the manhunt for the cop-killer - but kids did get to 'trunk or treat' over the weekend in the school parking lot (pictured) Organizers called it a success, saying hundreds of children and adults attended. Still, Halloween parade chairwoman Betty Oppelt says the community is missing a major tradition this year. Frein is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove barracks on September 12, killing Trooper Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. The search for Frein - who allegedly used a high-powered rifle to open fire outside the state police barracks on September 12 - has reached its 48th day. Frein was identified as a suspect in the barracks shooting on September 16 after his disabled SUV was found abandoned a mile away, according to The Morning Call. Officials believe the self-taught survivalist - who allegedly prepared for the ambush and his escape for months - is hiding out in the woods on the border of Pike and Monroe Counties. Although hundreds of families attended the 'trunk or treat' event, Halloween parade chairwoman Betty Oppelt says the community is missing a major tradition this year because a killer is still on the loose . Hundreds of state police and federal agents have been involved in the widespread, intensive search that reportedly continues to exceed $1million a week. On September 21, investigators discovered a gun belonging to him. The search team has largely shut down the area near Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his parents. Although a 'shelter in place' order has been lifted for residents, citizens have been urged to avoid the woods and take caution when outside of their homes. Law enforcement officers wearing bulletproof vests and armed with rifles can still be seen marching the streets, while unmarked helicopters regularly fly overhead. Frein belonged to the rifle team at Pocono Mountain High School, and as an adult joined a group that performed military re-enactments of Eastern European conflicts in the modern era. He even played a small role in a 2007 movie about a concentration camp survivor - earning him a mention in the movie database IMDb - and helped with props and historical references on a documentary about World War I. Pennsylvania state troopers walk along Route 191 after searching the woods in Henryville, Pennsylvania on Monday in the continuing manhunt for suspected killer Eric Frein . Citizens have been urged to avoid the woods and take care when outside of their homes as troopers continue the search to track down the killer . 'He was a very friendly guy to me,' said Jeremy Hornbaker, who hired him for the documentary. 'We left on very good terms.' Frein's father, retired Army Major E. Michael Frein, told police that he had taught his son to shoot. He 'doesn't miss,' the father told state police during a search of the family home, when he also disclosed that an AK-47 and a .308 rifle with a scope were missing. A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom. Frein had for a time attended nearby East Stroudsburg University and held a number of jobs over the years but never any for very long, authorities said. Police have not yet determined what may have led to the suspect's apparent hatred of police.

"John Franklin, pictured, asked his teenage victim if he could perform a medical assessment on her in his private ambulance as part of his training . A  medic who sexually assaulted three women while pretending to perform medical assessments has been jailed. John Franklin, of Sittingbourne, Kent, asked his teenage victim if he could perform a medical assessment on her in his private ambulance as part of his training. But the 39-year-old, who was a member of St John Ambulance, then carried out internal examinations and touched her intimately, a court heard. Franklin was charged by Kent Police and was convicted of two counts of assault by penetration in February after a jury heard evidence from medical experts that none of these acts were necessary or should have formed part of his training. But the jury could not reach a verdict on four other counts relating to other victims; three of sexual assault and one of rape. Franklin was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the Urban Blue Bus in Maidstone between 2011 and 2012 following a retrial last month. He was acquitted of one count of rape and one of sexual assault dating from 1996. He was jailed for a total of eight years for the four offences of which he was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Inspector Neil Kimber, of Kent Police, said: 'I'm glad that together with the Crown Prosecution Service and commitment of the victims we were able to bring Franklin back to court to face a retrial on four serious allegations that were outstanding from his previous trial. 'His victims bravely came forward and reported these violations and it is important for them to see justice being served with the substantial sentence that has been passed. 'I would like to thank the victims for their bravery and commitment and hope that they will be able to rebuild their lives now that this sentence has imposed. John Franklin was jailed for eight years for the four offences he was convicted of at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) 'If anyone has been the victim of a sexual assault I would encourage them to report it. 'They will get our full support through any subsequent investigation and we will support you fully throughout the process.' A spokesperson from St John Ambulance said: ‘St John Ambulance was appalled to hear of the actions and abuse of trust of Mr Franklin and our thoughts go to those affected by his crimes. 'Mr Franklin resigned from the organisation in 2011 and his membership was terminated.’","John Franklin asked victim if he could perform assessment on her as part of his training .

"A Pennsylvania town near the woods where police are still searching for alleged cop killer Eric Frein has canceled Halloween because of the massive manhunt. The Barrett Township said its annual Halloween parade - the town's biggest event of the year - and 5K Scarecrow Race will be canceled indefinitely and trick-or-treating is banned this year. Some residents of the Pocono Mountains town said they fear that if Halloween goes ahead, Frein could escape with the help of a costume, WNEP reported. It comes as the search for the self-described survivalist, who is believed to be hiding out in the woods near to the town, reaches its fourth week. Scroll down for video . Where is he? Police released these digitally-enhanced pictures of Eric Frein to show what he might look like a month after he shot a trooper. He is hiding out in a wooded area, causing a nearby town to cancel Halloween . Frein has eluded authorities since he shot dead Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, as he stepped outside during a shift change on September 12. Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, was critically wounded. Local residents expressed their disappointment that the events had been canceled, while others said they are more fearful in their hometown. 'This parade is probably one of the biggest events that the town has every year,' Ralph Megliola, chairman of the township's Board of Supervisors, told ABC News. 'Everyone looks forward to the parade. Myself and my family personally have been away and cut our vacation short to get home in time for the parade. Thousands of people line the streets.' The parade, which would have been the town's 50th, should have fallen on October 26. Search: Officers are searching the wooded area next to Barrett Township, which has canceled Halloween . Relentless: A FBI agent looks out over a bridge on Thursday in Henryville, Pennsylvania during the search . If he is found before Halloween, the town will reconsider its Halloween activities, Megliola said. 'It's taking a toll on everybody,' Barrett Township Police Chief Steven Williams told WNEP of the search. 'It's taking a toll on the police department. It's taking a toll on the public.' The search is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. Residents reported seeing scores of police cars along the roads and helicopters flying above. Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues. Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis. In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks. 'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. Gunned down: Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, (left) was allegedly killed by Frein on September 12, while Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, (right) suffered a critical injury when he ran to Dickson's aid . Hunt: An FBI agent searches a creek bed on Thursday. Authorities say they spotted Frein earlier this week . 'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.' The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any  individual. Instead, in sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been looking for Frein ever since. The most recent sighting came on Tuesday afternoon, when an officer thought he spotted a brief glimpse of Frein from about 200 yards away, State police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said. That was the fourth sighting by police or the community since Friday, he said. 'We will get Frein. Whether that is today, whether that is tomorrow or whether that is next week, remains to be seen,' Bivens said.","Barrett Township has banned trick-or-treating and its Halloween parade .

"A federal judge dismissed indictments on Thursday against 10 of 28 Washington D.C. defendants in major drug cases pending an investigation into an FBI agent who may have tampered with evidence including guns and narcotics, authorities say. The alleged misconduct of the unnamed agent has led to the release of more than 20 prisoners, one of whom had been serving a sentence of up to 10 years, according to the Washington Post. More cases will be dropped and more prisoners may be released. Those who have already entered guilty pleas can withdraw them and their charges will be dropped, according to The Crime Report.

The Post reports that the investigation began the week of Sept. 29, coinciding with the time officials say the agent was found slumped over the wheel of his unmarked FBI vehicle with empty bags in the car believed to have contained drugs. Never: Robert Lee Jenkins Jr., a lawyer defending one of the released felons who admitted a drug conspiracy charge, said he had 'never seen something like this before' The agent, assigned to a D.C. police task force in the FBI’s Washington Field Office, has not been criminally charged but has been suspended indefinitely, authorities say.  He is being investigated by the inspector general's office at the Justice Department. The nature of the agent's alleged misconduct has not been made public, and defense lawyers involved in the affected cases have said that the mass freeing of convicted felons is 'unprecedented.' It is reportedly not uncommon for cases to be dropped due to police misconduct, however freeing those who have been found guilty is unusual. Though the investigation's details have not been made public, the agent's alleged tampering has had, what authorities call, a 'significant' impact on substantial drug cases. One of those cases includes 13 drug gang members and their alleged ringleader 62-year-old Lester Pryor who allegedly imported cocaine from California into the District, Virginia, and Maryland. All members, including Lester, have been freed from jail or prison, according to the Post. This delivers a blow to the FBI who conducted a year-long investigation into the group resulting in the raid of 26 homes, the seizing of 11 pounds of drugs, and thousands of hours of secretly recorded telephone calls. Information about the investigation had been filed under seal, but information was leaked after a judge quietly ordered the release of more than 12 felons and others with pending charges last month. Robert Lee Jenkins Jr., a lawyer defending one of the released felons who had entered a guilty plea to a drug conspiracy charge, told the Post that he had 'never seen something like this before,' referring to the release of the prisoners. 'It suggests to me that whatever is going on is very significant,' Jenkins said. U.S. Attorney's Office: Ronald Machen, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, is working with the office to do a case-by-case review of all matters in which the agent was involved . Another affected case involves 10 defendants accused of selling cocaine and heroin in the District; prosecutors reportedly filed papers saying they would drop charges against the defendants. Another substantial case that may be affected by the agent's misconduct is the case of a drug organization reportedly led by Juan Floyd that led to the indictment of thirty-three people. None have been released. The freeing of defendants has begun, but the situation may not be limited to the total of 28 defendants. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia is conducting a case-by-case review of matters in which the agent is believed to have been involved.","A federal judge dismissed indictments against 10 of 28 defendants in drug cases pending an investigation .

"Russian men caught paying for sex could soon be given the choice of either going to jail or marrying the prostitute, under draft legislation being considered in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg. The unusual proposal, which has been put forward by Local MP Olga Galkina, is aimed at curbing prostitution in the country's second city. Ms Galkina said: 'If it is adopted, clients of prostitutes will have the choice between paying a fine of 100,000 roubles (£1,450) or serving a 15 day jail term.' Indecent proposal: Russian men caught paying for sex could soon face a  choice of either going to jail or marrying the prostitute under draft legislation being considered in Vladimir Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg . 'They can avoid going to jail if they agree to marry the prostitute.' The plan comes from the same city authority that pioneered Russia's controversial laws forbidding the promotion of gay sex to under age children. Galinka said her bill was a response to a proposal to make prostitution a criminal offence which was drafted by anti- gay politician Vitaly Milonov. Plan: Local MP Olga Galkina believes the measure would help to curb prostitution in the country's second city . Local reports says the exemption allowing punters to tie the knot with sex workers is a 'populist' measure but Galkina insists she is serious about tackling the problem. Currently, men who pay for sex face no penalties under Russian laws. Galkina, 33, a mother-of-one, set up a tourism company after graduating from St Petersburg Institute of Management and Economics.

"It seems Francesco Totti woke up on the wrong side of the bed ahead of Roma's Serie A clash with Genoa on Sunday. Coming off the bench in the 77th minute, Totti didn't seem too happy on the touchline as midfielder Seydou Keita attempted to pass the Roma captain the skipper's armband. Waving his hand as if to suggest Keita should turn around and get back into position, club legend Totti, who has captained the Serie A side since 1998, flatly refused his team-mate's gesture.

"Sam Kass has a to-die-for job as personal chef to the Obama family but whipping up their meals is probably the least important part of his portfolio. Mr Kass, 31, also has a fancy title as White House senior policy adviser for healthy food initiatives. That job has put him out front this month as the first lady marks the second anniversary of her campaign against childhood obesity. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Digging in: Sam Kass (left) has worked extensively with First Lady Michelle Obama on her healthy-eating initiative . Mr Kass has travelled the country to promote Michelle Obama's eat-right-and-exercise-more message, demonstrating along the way the pivotal role that he's come to play in helping establish policies that affect what millions of school kids consume each day and in trying to influence the American diet. When Mrs Obama was asked during a recent interview what was next for her ‘Let's Move’ initiative, she quickly passed the question to Mr Kass. ‘What you got?’ she demanded. ‘We've got stuff,’ he promised her. ‘You're going to be busy.’ On a recent trip with Mrs. Obama, the assistant White House chef was seemingly everywhere: emceeing a ‘Top Chef’ school lunch competition, moderating a round-table discussion between the first lady and parents, briefing reporters on federal nutrition initiatives, and more. Helping hand: Mr Kass has travelled the country to promote Michelle Obama's eat-right-and-exercise-more message, one such appearances was on the reality series Top Chef (shown above) Mr Kass, with his distinctive shaved head, wears a broad and relentless grin and speaks with an enthusiasm that's infectious as he gives shout-outs to people and programs that are ‘amazing,’ 'incredible,’ and ‘powerful.’ He has a knack for popping out just the right statistics about obesity, nutrition and exercise. Among the health-conscious recipes Mr . Kass has talked up in recent months: seared tilapia with fried rice and . broccoli and carrots, garden herb-roasted chicken with braised greens, . broccoli soup, sweet potatoes and greens, and cauliflower gratin. But no matter what his policy duties may be, five days a week Mr Kass retrieves his chef's coat in the afternoon and heads upstairs to fill the Obamas' plates with healthy and appealing meals at 6.30pm, when President Barack Obama cuts short whatever's afoot in the West Wing to head home for dinner. There's no need to consult with the first family on menu options — Mr Kass knows their likes and dislikes by heart. Mr Kass is discreet about what he feeds the family, often batting away questions with a ‘top-secret’ dodge. But he says the family ‘walks the walk’ on healthy foods, eating balanced meals often dictated by what's in season in the White House garden. With, of course, the occasional splurge to keep the kids happy. Feeding the family: Mr Kass (second from left) is discreet about what he feeds the family,but he says the family ¿walks the walk¿ on healthy foods, eating balanced meals often dictated by what's in season in the White House garden . Mrs. Obama, for her part, says her girls ‘can't stay out of the kitchen when Sam is cooking.’ Among the health-conscious recipes Mr Kass has talked up in recent months: seared tilapia with fried rice and broccoli and carrots, garden herb-roasted chicken with braised greens, broccoli soup, sweet potatoes and greens, and cauliflower gratin. His healthy snack suggestions include warm grapefruit with honey, and banana boats stuffed with raisins, nuts and crushed whole grain cereal. The star power that comes with his chef's jacket only helps reinforce Mr Kass' message about the importance of eating right. One minute he's demonstrating how to make turkey lasagna with spinach on morning TV or chatting with Elmo about healthy school lunches, and the next he's discussing new standards to improve meals on military bases or working with Wal-Mart to reduce the sodium content in packaged foods. Fresh produce: Both Mrs Obama and Mr Kass (pictured) have been scheduling more public appearances of late since the first lady's cook book will be released in April . ‘We're seeing real changes, both big and small, happening all over the country, and incredible partnerships and people stepping up in ways that we just never could have foreseen,’ Mr Kass says. ‘And this kind of effort has just been inspirational and gives us a lot of hope that we can truly overcome these problems in the years to come.’ It's a measure of Mr Kass' growing stature that he's gone from People magazine's ‘most beautiful’ list in his first year in Washington to Fast Company's ‘most creative people in business’ list in 2011. Tom Colicchio, New York restaurateur and co-host of Bravo's ‘Top Chef,’ says Mr Kass' passion for healthy eating and knowledge of the issue make him a natural for his dual role. ‘He knows this stuff inside out,’ Mr Colicchio said. ‘It's not him latching on to some trend. He's taken the time to learn it and understand it.’ When more than 500 chefs gathered on the White House lawn in 2010 to launch the ‘Chefs Move to School’ program, pairing up chefs to work with individual schools, ‘that came directly from Sam,’ says Mr Colicchio. ‘This is something he cares deeply about.’ Walter Scheib, White House chef for 11 years in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, says it's a ‘wonderful thing’ that Mr Kass' cooking has become secondary to his policy work. ‘It's way overdue that chefs be involved in that component,’ says Mr Scheib. While past White House chefs might offer occasional behind-the-scenes advice on nutrition matters, Mr Scheib says, ‘We were always thought of as, 'Go back in the kitchen and be quiet.'‘ . Mr Kass' relationship with the Obamas began when he cooked for the family in Chicago before the 2008 elections. He was a history major in college, who discovered a love for cooking during a summer job at a Chicago restaurant. He finished his college years abroad, and ended up training in Vienna with an acclaimed Austrian chef. Hobnobbing with the stars: Mrs Obama and Mr Kass were featured with Dallas Cowboys football player Miles Austin (centre) when the appeared on Tom Colicchio's reality show Top Chef where they prepared healthy meals for students . Back in Chicago (where his schoolteacher . father taught Malia Obama in fifth grade) Mr Kass worked at the . Mediterranean restaurant Avec before opening a private chef business, . Inevitable Table, that promotes ‘a healthy lifestyle that focuses on the . quality and flavour of food to encourage good eating habits.’ These days, Mr Kass mixes plenty of cooking with his advocacy: He's fixed honey crisp apple salad at the Agriculture Department cafeteria, served Elmo a burrito bulging with peppers, lettuce, rice and beans, and prepared Swiss chard frittatas for children on the White House lawn. He doesn't see much of his basement apartment as he juggles the roles of cook, policy wonk and family friend — even golfing with the president when the family vacations on Martha's Vineyard and in Hawaii. He's also a big advocate for the White House garden, often helping troupes of schoolchildren harvest its bounty and teaching them about healthy eating. Encouraging good behaviour: Mrs Obama convinced TV host Jay Leno (who has notoriously bad eating habits) to try a vegetable pizza as a part of her campaign for a healthy eating initiative that she has worked on with Mr Kass . At a child obesity conference last summer in California, Mr Kass told about fretting over nightmare scenarios before hosting a group of schoolchildren for a summer harvest of broccoli, kale and other vegetables — an event that was to be observed by a sizeable press corps. He worried about the fallout if just one child set a vegetables-are-yucky tone that would derail the event. ‘I didn't sleep at all the night before,’ he confessed. ‘One kid with some broccoli that they didn't like would be a national disaster for us. ... Everything we're doing would've been set back two years.’ Instead, Mr Kass found himself having to rein in a girl who sneaked off to a back bench to stuff her face with fresh-cut cauliflower. ‘It's the only time in my professional career that I've ever had to ask a child to please put the vegetables back on the plate,’ he recalled to laughter, before turning serious. ‘These kids were engaged in some part of the process of what it meant to grow and eat food,’ he said. ‘And that little thing is absolutely critical to making the connection and having the foundation that kids will build on in the future to live healthier lives.’ WATCH VIDEO HERE .","Chef Sam Kass, 31, helps First Lady Michelle Obama with her national healthy-eating initiative ."
"A woman arrested on charges of murder after allegedly throwing her autistic son off of a bridge had recorded a video just last year talking about how hard it was to raise her challenged child and her desire to 'pull a Thelma and Louise.' Jillian McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was taken in after authorities discovered the body of her son London in Oregon's Yaquina Bay just hours after a woman called 911 Monday evening to say she had thrown her son off of a bridge. She has been charged with aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jillian McCabe (left), who was arrested after she allegedly threw her severely autistic son London (right) off of a bridge Monday evening, had talked of 'pulling a Thelma and Louise' in the past . Loving father: In addition to her autistic son, Jillian's husband Matt (above) was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . Now, family members close to Jillian describe the young mother as mentally unstable, and old videos and blog posts written by the woman seem to highlight her difficulties raising a child with severe autism. Family members say her downward spiral began soon after her father died and her husband, Matt, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 'I'm sorry but to wake up one day and your whole world is topsy turvy in a world that already was topsy turvy with our son,' Jillian said of the situation in a 2013 video. 'All of a sudden, my husband who was your provider, the caregiver, my captain Kirk, and its hard to talk to him, and everything's hard.' In that same video, which she recorded and posted to thank her friends and people who were supporting her and her family financially after Matt lost his job, Jillian said; 'Matt and I love you guys. ... If we don't know you, we still love you. You are making this experience livable versus us pulling a Thelma and Louise, which I have totally thought about.' Other videos on her YouTube page show London throwing coins into a fountain, playing with his iPod on a hammock, and visiting his father in the hospital. Woman on the verge: Now, family members are saying Jillian (above in her mugshot) was mentally unstable . Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, told NBC News, 'Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.' She added, 'It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get. We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.' Tanya also said how shocked and heartbroken she was to find out what happened to London. 'Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition,' she said. 'When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was.' Good mother?: On family member, Tany McCabe, described Jillian as 'patient and loving' when she was caring for son London (above) Heartbroken dad: Matt (above with London) has yet to comment on what happened . London's uncle, Andrew McCabe, also cites Jillian's mental instability as the cause of this horrific tragedy, saying; 'The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need.' “She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. Jillian, who was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder, and first degree manslaughter, is being held on $750,000 bail. The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body . Her first hearing will be on November 12.","Jillian McCabe, a  mother who has been charged with killing her son, recorded a video in 2013 saying she wanted to 'pull a Thelma and Louise'

"Empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture lay piled up in the front yard to nearly half the height of the house itself. A ginger cat crawls over and picks through plastic bags full of rubbish, old paint tins, a rusted wheelbarrow and a suitcase and the gates almost burst at the seams holding back the mountains of trash. Located in Sydney's beachside suburb of Bondi, arguably one of Australia's most sought after areas at less than a kilometre from the iconic Bondi Beach, the house has not been lived in by its occupants for years. Scroll down for video . This residence in the beachside Sydney suburb of Bondi has been and eyesore for locals for at least two decades . Mary, Liana and Elena Bobolas live on the property, but neighbours say they have not resided inside the house for many years . But Mary, Liana and Elana Bobolas - known locally as the Bondi hoarders - still inhabit the front and back yards of the Boonara Avenue house, guarding their piles of trash as if it is treasure. For at least two decades this property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home. Although this is not the first time it's riled up people in the area, and the council cleaned the property just six months ago, some neighbours said the house is as bad as they've ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'. Bits of old wooden furniture, empty cans and tins and deflated sporting equipment can all be found among the mountains of rubbish . Locals and many passersby often stop to stare at the objects piling up in the front of the Boonara Avenue house . The front gate and fence can barely contain the trash which fills the front yard and covers the front porch . One woman, who lived nearby but had two friends living on the street said she had been completely baffled by the state of the home for years, and revealed that residents were outraged about the state of the place. 'I don't understand, I just don't understand it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's unbelievable, it's outrageous. 'It's not fair for people who live nearby and want to sell property ... I just don't understand why the council can't do anything about it,' she continued. Liana Bobolas, one of Mary's two daughters is pictured here in April sitting defiantly guarding her piles of trash . Inexplicably, the side of the house and path leading down in to the backyard is much cleaner with hardly any items littering the ground . One neighbour said people often come and go from the house but the residents are sometimes not seen there for days at a time . Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity. 'They've got away with it for the last 20 years and they'll probably get away with it for another 20 years', she added, speaking of the very public squalor Mary and her two daughters were living in. The woman said sometimes the Boboloas wouldn't been seen at their home for days at a time, while another added she had seen one of the family members arriving home with piles of new objects. A ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic containers . One neighbour described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' and said they found one of the women going through her rubbish . Two doors down from the squalid house another neighbour said the situation used to bother her, her husband and their small children but now 'it's just sad'. 'The council cleans it up every so often but there's an underlying mental issue ... Cleaning won't fix it, it's sad,' she said. 'The council have been brilliant, they send residents letters to keep us updated and hold meetings about the house. The street is one of the most expensive in Bondi, located just a kilometre from iconic Bondi Beach . '(But) it's sickening because it's prime real estate,' the neighbour added. The woman described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' recounting one evening when she returned home from an evening out to discover one of the women going through her rubbish bin, who when asked what they were doing simply said they were searching for something they had lost. 'My husband and I have joked about offering them $50,000 for the place', she added, before saying it did upset her that the home owners were quite clearly struggling with some form of mental illness.

"A mother of four who was jailed for taking a legal high into a prison during a visit has been released after prosecutors realised they were wrong over the charge. Sharon Bolton, 38, spent 19 days in prison and missed her daughter's 18th birthday while she was locked up. She had been jailed for taking Voodoo, a legal high, into prison during a visit to a former partner because it was believed to be on a list of 'banned substances.' However prosecutors were forced to admit they had made a mistake when they realised Voodoo was not on the 'banned list' and Ms Bolton had not actually committed a crime. Sharon Bolton, 38, was wrongly imprisoned for taking legal high Voodoo into prison before prosecutors realised it was not on a banned list and she had not broken the law . She was then released from prison after 19 days. The grandmother of three is now set to demand compensation from the Crown Prosecution Service, which has admitted there could be other cases of people wrongly punished for having substances which are not classed as illegal. She said: 'I was put in a cell on my own and I was really nervous. We were locked up 21 hours a day. 'My concern was for my family. Two of my children live at home. 'My grandson was a few weeks old.' The mother of four and grandmother of three spent 19 days at HMP Peterborough, where she was incorrectly imprisoned for a legal high 'offence' Ms Bolton was wrongly imprisoned for the 'offence' of having Voodoo in a prison, but the CPS admitted the legal high is not on a list of banned substances . Ms Bolton, whose children are aged between 16 and 22, was sentenced to nine months in jail after she took Voodoo into a prison where she was visiting a former partner, according to Louise Smith, of the Daily Mirror. She was told Voodoo was on a list of 'banned substances' and pleaded guilty at a hearing at Lincoln Crown Court on September 18 to 'conveying a prohibited item into prison'. While she was serving her sentence at HMP Peterborough prosecutors realised their mistake and the 38-year-old was taken back to court where Judge Michael Heath ordered her release. A spokesman for the CPS admitted there could be other cases where people had been incorrectly punished. He said 'a small number of cases' were now being checked. 'The decision to charge was made by the police,' he added. 'But we acknowledge the issue should have been picked up.' When he jailed Ms Bolton in September, Judge Michael Heath said: 'There has to be an element of deterrence. Those people who take items like this into prison have to go to prison themselves.' Ms Bolton, of Rhodesia, Notts, was also given a six-month conditional discharge for possessing amphetamine.","Sharon Bolton, 38, spent 21 hours a day in her cell .

"Jon Stewart has delivered a blistering message to pundits who have used his Obamacare jokes to criticize U.S. President Barack Obama: 'Go f*** yourselves!' The comedian played clips during Thursday night's 'Daily Show' of cable news talking heads discussing the impact of Stewart's mockery. 'Look, making fun of something, that's . nothing new for us, so don't act like us making jokes . about a certain program or president is evidence that that politician or . issue has reached some kind of tipping point for action,' Stewart said. Scroll down for video . Demolished: Jon Stewart trotted out a choir on Thursday night's 'Daily Show' to tell the media who used his comedy to criticize Obamacare: 'Go f*** yourselves.' Stewart is known for skewering politicians on his show, however conservative commentators claim he is 'more sympathetic to' the Democrats. So when the funnyman gave a scathing critique of the rollout of Obamacare on a recent show, saying 'Democrats can’t spin this turd', some pundits jumped on it. Many questioned what effect 'losing Jon Stewart' would have on the national dialogue. 'When your political program becomes a punchline, you’ve got problems,' Howard Kurtz wrote for Fox News. Some commentators also used Stewart's comedy routine to call for Obamacare's administrative chief, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, to step down over the website's botched delivery. 'When Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live are making fun of the job you are doing, and the website, what that speaks to is the fact that young Americans are laughing at the Secretary and the website,' a Senator said on Fox News, TPM reported. However, when that Senator suggested that . Sebelius resign after being lampooned . on television, Stewart joked: 'If that causes things to end, . why was the network you were on still on the air?' The anchor went on to question why former President George Bush didn't resign after constantly being mocked on TV. Under fire: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (left) and U.S. President Barack Obama (right) have been criticized for the botched Obamacare website rollout . It's a comedy show: Jon Stewart asked if laughing at federal officials meant it was time for those officials to step down, why didn't anyone mention that to former President George W. Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney . That's when Stewart trotted out the choir and unleashed his scathing attack. 'The jokes that we do on this program seem to accomplish very little,' Stewart sang. 'They do perhaps provide a little catharsis or perspective maybe a little. But most of the things we complain about never change. 'Don't . you use our jokes as evidence that the thing you hate must be stopped, . because I'm sure when we joke about s*** you like, you're more than . happy to ignore it. 'We add insult, not injury. GO F*** YOURSELVES!'","Jon Stewart hit back at the media who used his comedy to criticize Obamacare .

"Posing confidently for the camera, they exude the magnetic appeal of demure, yet alluring coquettes. The subliminal message shrieks that they are glamorous, glorious and – most importantly of all – real women who aren’t afraid to flaunt their flabby bits. Who can but applaud, we are encouraged to believe, the recent spate of advertisements from the likes of M&S and Dove cosmetics in which stick-thin, taut and toned models have been rejected in favour of what are euphemistically known as ‘big’ girls? Marks & Spencer use models to promote the retailer's Sexy Shapewear range - Dr Ellie Cannon said some could be overweight while 'one was obese' Taking the test: From left, Julia, Angela, Sarah, Melissa, Tracey and Monica gave their verdicts on the underwear after the advert stirred up controversy . The message is loud and clear: forget Twiggy and Myleene Klass, the former faces of all things fashionable, and instead embrace the woman you truly are, complete with your voluptuous curves and pudgy love handles. At face value, it all sounds very encouraging. Very ‘inclusive’, to coin a current buzz word. But hold on a minute, aren’t we rather ignoring the elephant in the room here (pardon the pun)? Fat, truth be told, is neither a feminist nor a  cosmetic issue. It is, quite simply, a health issue. And we shouldn’t allow ourselves to be steered into losing sight of that fact. It may appear laudable, in our current politically correct climate, to claim that criticising the larger lady is just as despicable as taunting the disabled or discriminating against someone because of their age or origin. But, frankly, it’s utterly wrong. The fact is it is absolutely outrageous that, in an effort to illustrate the diversity of women, obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours. Yes, these adverts have captured the notion of individuality beautifully, by using women in their 50s. But including overweight – and therefore unhealthy – women in the mix is downright  misguided, at best. Too good to be true? The Mail asked real women Julia, Angela, Monca and Melissa to put M&S slimming clothes to the test . Overweight? The M&S models said to represent ordinary women, could be overweight according to the Dr . For example, in the M&S advert, for its Shapewear control underwear, which uses women from sizes eight to 16, I would say that, lovely as they all look, at least two, if not three, are overweight, while the biggest girl is obese. Yet, when women took to Twitter to voice their response to the adverts, the majority complained the models were: ‘Too perfect, with too few wobbly bits.’ All too often celebrities such as the model Sophie Dahl or Nigella Lawson are touted as real women with real bodies. But both have trimmed their  figures (in Sophie’s case, by several stone) and say they are much happier having shed the flab. Statistics show that the prevalence of obesity in the UK has tripled in the past 25 years but the fact it is now so common does not make it satisfactory or healthy. It may seem unfair to criticise what is essentially a very common problem, but day-to-day as a GP  I deal with the medical consequences of patients who are overweight. Obesity makes a woman four times as likely to suffer with high blood pressure and three times as likely to suffer a heart attack. According to the Department of Health, obesity costs the NHS a staggering £5.1billion a year. I am really concerned by this trend of supposedly empowering women by what has become known as the ‘body acceptance movement’ which embraces the notion that fat is fine. While fat may be fine cosmetically, it is not fine for your health. Body shape has been hijacked solely as a fashion issue, and as ammunition in the war of cool versus uncool. Thus it is perceived as cruel and ‘size-ist’ to attack those who are fat. I strongly condemn bullying, whether it be for personal appearance or any other reason, but what worries me is that the real health risks of obesity are being glossed over in an effort not to offend anyone. Yet, at the same time, we are running around in circles trying to find the obesity solution in the food and fitness industries, as well as the pharmaceutical and medical fields. While we readily criticise and ban smoking, junk food is still an acceptable vice and overeating is rapidly becoming the biggest eating disorder in the country. Indeed, compulsive overeating has recently been recognised in medical literature as a disorder in its own right. There is an understandable backlash against  the anorexic models the fashion industry has  promoted for the past three decades. The continuing use of ill-looking, skeletal models is shameful and rightly condemned. We know  from studies of anorexics that when they idolise and obsess over images of these very thin women, it exacerbates their illness and perpetuates their self-loathing and body dysmorphia. Isn’t it just as irresponsible to promote the notion that being overweight is perfectly normal? The All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image was established in 2011 to challenge the growing trend in negative body image and they work with those such as the advertising industry to address this issue. They have, for example, stopped the use of size zero models. While this is admirable, we need  to ensure that, by trying to sort out one problem, we don’t exacerbate another. Given that a third of British women are overweight, it will do our teenage daughters no favours to normalise obesity. Companies such as M&S have a firm place in the hearts of the public and in that respect they often mould opinions and shape our aspirations. It is a shame they wasted a great opportunity to promote what is healthy.","Dr Ellie Cannon: 'It is utterly wrong... obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours.'
' Two, if not three, are overweight, while the biggest girl is obese' the doctor claims ."
"Disgusted passengers donned masks and complained of an ‘unbearable’ stench after liquid from bathrooms ran down the aisles of a Virgin Australia flight to Sydney on Monday. The situation was so excruciating for passengers and crew that the plane was forced to turn back and land in Los Angeles just three hours into its 14-hour transpacific journey. Virgin Australia described it as a ‘fresh water overflow’ from lavatory sinks and denied passengers’ stomach-churning claims that human waste had seeped into the cabin. Virgin Australia denied passengers' claims that the liquid contained human waste (different aircraft pictured) Passenger John Collins sent tweets suggesting the toilet had exploded during the flight . But passenger Julia Malley, from Christchurch, New Zealand, told the New Zealand Herald that she could see human waste running down one of the aisles of the Boeing 777, which became known as the ‘poo plane’ on social media. She said: ‘We could see it go through the aisles, like it was very obvious. They said over the loudspeaker that they were going to clean it up and then three hours into the flight they were like, “I'm sorry we're going to have to turn around, it's unsafe”.’ ‘They cleaned it up but the smell couldn't really be hidden.’ She told the newspaper that one crew member even joked it was a ‘sh***y situation’. The airline insisted it was not human waste as the toilets operate on a separate drainage system. The aircraft was inspected by engineers after it landed at LAX and cleared to return to service . John Collins, a Melbourne musician, was one of around 350 passengers on flight VA2 . Passengers were delayed for nearly 15 hours before they were put on another flight to Sydney . But Ms Malley rejected the airline’s claims and was adamant she saw human waste in the aisles. She said: ‘If it was water, why would they turn the plane around? We saw bits of toilet paper and cr**.’ One of the 350 passengers, Melbourne musician John Collins, tweeted that the liquid smelled like vomit and it was believed a toilet had exploded. A Virgin Australia spokeswoman told News.com.au that two of the sinks suffered leaks, but there was no hygiene issue aboard flight VA2 and the safety of the aircraft was never in question. She said the aircraft was inspected by engineers after it landed at LAX and cleared to return to service. Sorry: Virgin Australia apologised to passengers and offered a travel credit for the disruption . The sinks may have overflowed due to a blockage caused by a toothpaste cap, according to reports. In a letter to passengers, who were delayed for nearly 15 hours before boarding another flight, Virgin Australia apologised and offered a travel credit or bonus rewards points. Roger Lindeman, the airline’s general manager of ground operations, wrote: ‘Unfortunately the aircraft did need to return to Los Angeles due to an issue with plumbing in the fresh water overflow system on board and could not continue with the journey. ‘At no time was health or safety at risk to any persons on board the aircraft.’","Plane returned to LAX for passengers' comfort just three hours into flight .

"A journalist who says she was forced out of the BBC after 30 years claims ageism and sexism within the corporation is still rife. Olenka Frenkiel, 59, was asked to sign a gagging confidentiality agreement when she left in 2012, but she refused on the basis that she wanted to speak openly about discrimination. The reporter, who was the first BBC journalist to cover reports of the Berlin Wall collapse, has spoken out after hearing evidence in the House of Lords select committee on broadcasting and women. Scroll down for video . Olenka Frenkiel (right), 59, refused to sign a gagging confidentiality agreement when she left the BBC in 2012 . She told the Guardian: 'I find it extraordinary that BBC Current Affairs still claims it's trying to find older women - when it's spent the past decade getting rid of us. 'I don’t like it that the greatest broadcasting organisation in the world is getting away with not telling the truth. Frenkiel, who also makes documentaries, claims it's not just presenters who are being pushed out when they get older - it is reporters 'who appear on screen for their journalism'. She told the paper that for a while she 'fought back' by asking round other departments in the hope that she would get her films commissioned, after they were rejected by her own bosses. The former Newsnight presenter describes the process as being 'starved' of work so you seem unproductive and then fighting to be heard, which comes off as being 'difficult'. Eventually she began to notice the men of her age were thriving while the women were gone and she was being 'rubbed out' - and she decided to leave quietly. Her complaint comes three years after Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after she was dismissed from the programme. The former Newsnight presenter has described feeling 'rubbed out' of the BBC when she got over 50 . The then director general, Mark Thompson, said the case would be a turning point for the corporation - but Frenkiel emailed him the very same day to argue that such judgments were still happening. She reportedly told him the current policy employed by the BBC which forces middle-aged women to leave 'has to stop'. Another former BBC reporter, Liz Mackean, also refused to sign a gagging order when she left 18 months ago, after her film on the Jimmy Savile scandal was controversially cancelled. She has pointed out that the fact there are fewer older women than men suggests 'a gender bias'. However, the BBC claims that around one in six female presenters are aged over 50, while nearly 25 per cent of female news correspondents are in the same age range. A BBC spokesman said: 'We actually have many excellent experienced female journalists across BBC News: Lyse Doucet, Orla Guerin, Sarah Montague, Martha Kearney, Carole Walker and Maxine Mawhinney among others. 'Maxine is one of the best known faces on the BBC News Channel, and we’ve increased the number of presenter appearances of Carole Walker too in recent months. 'We will continue to work hard to make sure our presenting teams are as diverse as possible.' The spokesman added that improving representation of women on-air is a priority for the organisation and said they have been working hard to achieve. Other female presenters disgruntled by their treatment by broadcasters include Anna Ford, who claimed she was jilted because of her age when she left the BBC in 2006 at the age of 62. While Selina Scott was awarded £250,000 by Channel 5 after she successfully sued them for ageism in 2008 when she was 57. The current director general, Tony Hall, announced last year that the BBC would stop using the controversial gagging orders.

"It is a far cry from the eco-conscious hybrids we are used to seeing on the roads. Lamborghini today launched the Asterion, which boasts both traditional and electric motors. The firm says this allows the car to 282 travel miles per gallon - yet still hit 200mph. Scroll down for video . The Lamborghini Asterion, which was revealed at the Paris Auto show. It has a 5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion. The Asterion has a  5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion. Together they produce 910 horsepower, sent to all four wheels. On the electric engine alone, it can reach up to 125 kilometers an hour for 32 miles. With the V10, it has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph). It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h  in just 3 seconds. Based on a monocoque made entirely of carbon fibre . Two different driving modes: in hybrid mode it is combining the V10 engine with the three electric. In pure electric drive mode only the two electric motors in the front are used. Called the Lamborghini Asterion LPI 910-4, it has a  5.2-liter V10 that creates 610 horsepower, along with 300 horsepower worth of electric propulsion. Together they produce 910 horsepower, sent to all four wheels. On the electric engine alone, it can reach up to 125 kilometers an hour for 32 miles. The Asterion, described as a 'technology demonstrator,' has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph). The firm say the car is 'defines a solution to significantly reducing CO2 emissions through technologies available today, guaranteeing the unique Lamborghini driving feel with a smooth and reactive driveability and with superior power, including an exceptional pure electric range of 50 km.' They say the car is a technology demonstrator representing a Lamborghini model that could be realistically produced today, using technologies currently available and drawing on Lamborghini's own expertise. 'Lamborghini is always looking ahead, investing in new technologies and setting new benchmarks, delivering the unexpected,' says Stephan Winkelmann, President and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini. 'Lamborghini continues to focus on weight reduction as a means to reducing CO2, for example through the investment in carbon fiber engineering, which also contributes to our quest for the best super sports car handling and performance. A transparent engine cover in the rear is comprised of three hexagonal glasses that turn according to the engine driving mode selected. A hostess poses next to a Lamborghini Asterion LPI 910-4 AT during the press day at the Motor Show in Paris. The Asterion, described as a 'technology demonstrator,' has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph). 'To significantly reduce emissions on a car in this moment however, plug-in electrification is the best option for us, because for Lamborghini such a car must still provide a truly emotional driving experience. 'In the Asterion this is guaranteed through a naturally aspirated engine that is combined with PHEV technology, which not only offers exceptionally low CO2 emissions of 98 g/km, but a practical pure electric driving range of 50 km. 'The Asterion LPI 910-4 is a true Lamborghini: emotional, with a stunning design, powerful, yet conceived more for comfortable luxury daily cruising than for ultimate track performance.' The lithium battery is placed longways in the central tunnel area, normally reserved for the transmission. This allows for better balance of the car and also protects the battery area in case of lateral crash impact. The Asterion has two different driving modes: in hybrid mode it is combining the V10 engine with the three electric motors guaranteeing a permanent four-wheel drive without being dependent on the battery's state of charge. The firm says 'The Asterion, like all Lamborghini cars, has clearly defined lines, separating flat planes from the side of the car and distinguishing between panels' The Astwerion is among a range of cars revealed at the show. One of the showcase cars is the aptly named Bentley Mulsanne Speed, unashamedly billed as 'the world's fastest ultra-luxury driving experience.' The Mulsanne name is lifted directly from Bentley's roots in motorsport: Before it was acquired in 1931 by Rolls-Royce, Bentley won five of seven races from 1924 through 1930 at the fabled Le Mans endurance circuit in France, where racecars reach peak velocity on the track's Mulsanne Straight. The Bentley Mulsanne Speed, billed as 'the world's fastest ultra-luxury driving experience.' Owned since 1998 by Germany's Volkswagen, Bentley has been slowly rebuilding its image as a purveyor of fast cars. The new Mulsanne Speed, expected to retail for upwards of 250,000 euros ($320,000), boasts a massive twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 395 kilowatts (530 horsepower), enabling a top speed of 305 kilometres per hour (190 miles per hour). In the same stratosphere is Ferrari's 458 Speciale A, a limited-edition two-seater based on the Italian automaker's 458 Spider.

Although pricing hasn't been officially announced -- a 220,000 euro ($280,000) sticker has been mooted -- word in Italy is that all 499 copies have been reserved by prospective buyers. Fitted with a 450 kW (605 hp) V8 engine, the Speciale is said to reach a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph). Compared with the Ferrari and the Bentley, Germany's Daimler appears to have more modest aspirations for its new Mercedes-AMG GT, a new sports car that arrives next year, priced from around 95,000 euros ($120,000).

Top speed is projected to be 310 km/h (193 mph), which makes it look like something of a bargain next to its rivals.","Can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just 3 seconds .

"This is the moment an eagle-eyed photographer spotted a tiny spider spinning a  web inside the hole of a leaf. The little arachnid was seen settling down inside the leaf on a forest path in Burgundy, France, after a caterpillar dug out the perfect habitat. Photographer Burtrand Kulik spotted the miracle of nature unfolding in front of him and captured the tender moment up close. Mr Kulik, 34, said: 'When I approached I saw a very little spider inside, it was a real present for me. A great meeting. The hole in the leaf was made by a caterpillar before the spider discovered it was the perfect size for his home . The tiny spider pictured as it goes about setting up home inside a leaf in Burgundy, France . 'I think that a caterpillar made this hole in the leaf, before the spider decided to make a web inside. 'Nature is amazing and when we open our eyes we can see some great things.' Mr Kulik used a Canon 100mm 2/8 macro-lens to capture the image - meaning he could pick up much more intricate detail. He said: 'When I saw this leaf, I immediately new that it could be nice for taking a good macro picture. I have taken lots of macro pictures and this kind of opportunity is unusual. 'The light was really nice because sunlight was just behind the leaf and for macro photography it's very important to have a good light.' He had to be extremely patient to get so close to nature, and said he was always looking for the perfect picture. He added: 'I do lots of macro photography and when I take pictures, time stops. If I don't have my camera with me, I miss what is in front of my eyes everyday.' The photographer, who is also a concert violinist, said: 'Photography is a means of expression, and whether it's a camera or a violin in my hands, the important thing for me is to go in search of colours and materials, and communicate to others what touches me. 'I like watching nature before taking my pictures and I try to feel my pictures before making them. Photography is a real passion and it's growing more and more.'","French photographer captures moment a tiny spider spun web inside a leaf .

"Three sisters battling heroin addiction have allowed Dr Phil's cameras to film them as they went about their day scoring drugs on the street and getting high. The chilling footage was aired Tuesday as part of an episode about enablers. Parents Linda and Rich came on the show to confront their daughters about their drug dependency, which has ravaged their family. Scroll down for video . Three sisters battling heroin addiction have allowed Dr Phil's cameras to film them as they went about their day scoring drugs on the street and getting high . Chilling footage: Three sisters battling heroin addiction have allowed Dr Phil's cameras to film them as they go about their day getting high . Wasted lives: Valeen (left), 27, was the most popular girl in school and was headed to college; Amanda (center), 25, was homecoming queen and aspired to become a dental hygienist, and Tiffany (right), 22, the baby of the family, was a star athlete. Ringleader: Valeen, 27, the oldest of the three, is in charge of scoring drugs for the trio . Valeen, 27, was the most popular girl in school and was headed to college; middle sister Amanda, 25, was homecoming queen and aspired to become a dental hygienist, and Tiffany, 22, the baby of the family, was a star athlete. But somewhere along the way all three girls have fallen under the spell of heroin, which has become the drug of choice for the trio and the thing that binds them together. ‘Once we found out that each other was using, we were, like, what the hell? We might as well all get high together,’ Valeen says in the video. For the three sisters, each day begins the same way. The sisters before they became addicted to heroin - they now all shot up together . 'When we wake up in the morning, the first thing on our minds is to get high,' Valeen says in the video. Cameras were rolling as the three young women got into a car and headed to meet up with Valeen's drug dealer to score $140 worth of heroin. With drugs in hand, the sisters rush home to get their morning fix, but Valeen cannot wait that long and injects the heroin into her vein on the ride over. Can't wait: Valeen begins her day by contacting her drug dealer and driving out to meet him to buy heroin, which she injects right in the car on her way home . Parent's worst nightmare: Rich (bottom left), the sisters' father, got to watch his girls get high in the video . Out cold: By 12.30pm, the three sisters lie in a heroin-induced stupor . Somewhere along the way all three girls have fallen under the spell of heroin, which has become the drug of choice for the trio and the thing that binds them together . ‘Heroin is my drug of choice,’ Amanda says. ‘At first I was sniffing it, then it turned into shooting it, and now I need it.’ Tiffany, who only recently was released from jail after being arrested for a fourth time on drug charges, was forced to start shooting heroin into her legs after all her other veins collapsed. ‘It's just a vicious cycle of misery,' a somber Tiffany says. As they arrive home, Valeen, Amanda and Tiffany grab their needles and settle in to get high together. By 12.30pm, all three are lying in a heroin-induced stupor. ‘I can't look at my daughters ‘cause I hate them. They're disgusting. I'm embarrassed by them, I'm ashamed,’ says the girls’ mother, Linda, who herself had struggled with a cocaine addiction when her daughters were younger. Apple didn't fall far from the tree: Linda, the girls' mother, used to be a cocaine addict . Broken: Valeen turned to prostitution to support her and her sisters' drug habit, and she eventually lost custosdy of her daughter . Glimmer of hope: Dr Phil offered to send the girls to rehab, provided that they agree to go to three different clinics to avoid triggering one another . The heroin addiction has come to dominate every aspect of the sisters’ life, with disastrous results. Valeen, a slender, striking brunette, has turned to having sex with older men for money to support her and her sisters’ drug habit, and Amanda also recently got into prostitution to pitch in. The 27-year-old woman, described as the leader of the trio, has tried cleaning up her act by entering rehab, but her sobriety did not last long. Valeen eventually lost custody of her daughter after injecting heroin in her presence. The young woman also tearfully admitted to Dr Phil that she often drives while high. Dr Phil estimated that cumulatively, the three sisters have shot up heroin 36,500 times. The show ended on a hopeful note, with Dr Phil offering to send the three girls to rehab, provided that they agree to go to three different clinics to avoid triggering one another, and later part ways indefinitely.","Valeen, 27, Amanda, 25, and Tiffany, 22, shoot up heroin together and get high in their parents' home .

He came up with the idea in a bid to raise the funds to pay his gas bill, the Court of Appeal in London heard today. Safe: Distressed by the messages from her son, Mrs Swift called the police. The next day officers arrived to find him in bed with his girlfriend at his home in Sheffield. Above, the road where Swift lived . Swift subjected his mother to what she described as 'the most terrifying night of her life' after sending a string of text messages in June last year that implied he had been kidnapped. He told his mother that he didn't know where he was and said that he would not be allowed back to his home until a debt of £125 was cleared. The messages continued through the night, making Mrs Swift so desperate that she phoned the police. But the next day officers arrived at his Sheffield home to find him in bed with his girlfriend. Swift, who had previously borrowed almost £7,000 from his parents in just two years, told police that he was 'living beyond his means'. He was jailed for 18 months at Sheffield Crown Court in July after he admitted blackmail. His sentence was halved on appeal on Monday. Mr Justice Sweeney said the father-of-two bombarded his long-suffering parents with 'persistent demands' for cash in the two years before his scam. 'The demands, although not criminal, were relentless and unbearable,' the judge added. He said that Mrs Swift and her husband Gerald had to create a ledger to keep track of the payments they could 'ill-afford'. Between June 2011 and June, 2013, Swift received £6,821 from his parents but paid back just £75. The court heard that he would often change his mobile phone number and would text his requests for cash up to three times a week. Before midnight on June 27 last year, Swift sent his mum a text asking for £100 to pay a debt, which she transferred to his bank account. Further texts were sent that night declaring that Swift had been sectioned and asking his parents to pay £1,000-per-week to cover the costs of caring for him. The judge said: 'The text messages continued in the evening of June 28, in which Swift began to imply that he had been kidnapped and was in danger. 'He said that he didn't know where he was and that, until he cleared a debt of £125, he was going to be kept from his home.' Alisdair David Swift sent his mother messages implying he had been kidnapped. Swift, who was jailed for 18 months, had his sentence halved at the Court of Appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice, London (pictured), today . The string of texts continued through the night, making Mrs Swift so desperate that she called the police. Mr Justice Sweeney added: 'It's clear that the parents believed the text messages and were terrified for the plight of their son.' Mrs Swift, also of Sheffield, later described it as 'the most terrifying night of my life'. The next day police tracked the phone being used to send the messages to Swift's home - and discovered him safely in bed with his girlfriend. Despite initially denying any knowledge of the con, he ultimately admitted he was 'living beyond his means'. He had tried to swindle the cash to pay off rent, gas and electricity bills. His parents said that they found themselves 'deeply conflicted' by his arrest and stressed that they did not want him to go to prison. They emphasised that they loved the 'troubled young man' very much. To the author of a pre-sentence report, Swift said he had 'failed to think through' the consequences of what he did. He also showed deep remorse and stressed that his relationship with his parents had since improved. On appeal, his counsel, Richard Sheldon, argued that Judge Peter Kelson QC had punished him too harshly. He suggested that Swift's jail term should have been suspended. Mr Justice Sweeney, sitting with Judge Michael Pert QC, said that there was 'no doubt' that the custodial threshold had been crossed and an immediate prison sentence was required. However, Swift's 18-month jail term was 'too long', he ruled. He concluded: 'We propose to quash the sentence imposed and to substitute for it a sentence of nine months' imprisonment. 'To that extent this appeal is allowed.'","Alisdair Swift sent his mother string of texts implying he had been abducted .

"A Washington state couple were convicted of manslaughter Monday in the gruesome starvation and hypothermia death of a teenage girl they adopted from Ethiopia. A jury found Larry Williams, of Sedro-Woolley, guilty of first-degree manslaughter, while his wife, Carri Williams, was found guilty of homicide by abuse as well as manslaughter. The jury also convicted them both of assault and each faces a possible life sentence. Hana Williams died in May 2011 in the backyard of the couple's home, where she was forced to stay as part of a strict system of child-rearing outlined in a Christian parenting book. Manslaughter: Larry (left) and Carri Williams react in a Washington court Monday as a jury read their guilty verdict. The couple were guilty of manslaughter in the death of their 13-year-old Ethiopian adopted daughter . Dragged away: Carri Williams is taken into custody last month after a jury deemed her guilty of the 2011 death of her daughter. She was also found guilty of homicide by abuse . Hana Williams was found frozen and starved to death in the yard of her adoptive parents' Washington home in 2011. They were given maximum sentences today for causing her death . An autopsy showed that Hana died of hypothermia that was aggravated by chronic gastritis and malnutrition. Her bone-thin body was covered in . bruises, including a lump on her shaved head, and red bloody markings on her . hips, elbows and face. Defense lawyers argued that questionable parenting practices don't necessarily amount to a crime. Hana . is believed to have been 13, but no documentation of her birth in . Ethiopia was available. The trial was postponed several times and her . body was exhumed in January. The jury began deliberating last week. On Monday, they announced their decision to convict both the Williams' of first degree manslaughter. The class A felonies can mean life in prison and/or $50,000 fines, according to the Skagit Valley Herald. The jury was unable to decide if Larry Williams was guilty of homicide by abuse. In the end, only Carri Williams was convicted on that charge. Both Larry and Carri were also convicted of first degree assault on Hana's adopted brother Immanuel. Tests on Hana's teeth and bones gave varying . estimates and experts were unable to agree on her age. Her age was significant because the homicide by abuse charge applies only if the victim was younger than 16, though experts were unable to say for sure if she was or was not. She was adopted in 2008. Guilty: Larry Williams listens in Skagit County court days before a jury found him and wife Carri guilty of neglecting and ultimately killing their adopted Ethiopian daughter Hana . Wicked: Carri Williams cries during her trial. She was convicted of homicide by abuse in addition to manslaughter . A foster mother testified during the trial that the couple's other adopted son Immanuel . was rail-thin and covered in scratches when she took him in. The . testimony from Sheila Jackson came on day 18 of the Williams murder trial. The . couple left their 13-year-old Hana, to . starve and die in the cold after brutally punishing her and . her step-brother, Immanuel. Jackson, . who is deaf, told the jury in a Mount Vernon courtroom that when the . Williamses’ son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia, came to . live with her, she could barely keep up with his demands for food. Remorseful? Williams is pictured here testifying for his defense in August. The Washington man and his wife were both found guilty of first degree manslaughter and both face a possible life sentence . Extreme: The deeply religious couple are believed to have been following an extreme form of Christian parenting outlined in the book To Train a Child . 'He ate fast. He ate a lot. He ate more than I expected,' she told on the stand, the station KIRO-TV reported . Following the couple's arrest, Child Protective Services removed Immanuel and seven other children from their home. Sheila Jackson said the boy was terrified to talk about his adoptive parents. Wasting away: Hana, pictured left sometime after her arrival in the U.S., lost nearly 30lbs between 2009 and 2011, and had her head shaven when she was found dead in the backyard . Angelic: Hana, pictured second left, seen as a young girl with her family back in Ethiopia . According to the foster mother, the child was so emaciated that his ribs were showing through his skin covered in markings from past beatings. Immanuel, now 12 years old, testified during the trial that the Williamses beat him and Hana with belts and switches. Lingering fear: Foster mother Sheila Jackson, who took in Immanuel after the Williamses' arrest, said the boy was very thin, always hungry and  terrified to talk about his adoptive parents . The parents kept the family isolated from non-relatives, home-schooled the children and followed strict religious principles described in the Christian parenting book titled ‘To Train Up a Child,’ investigators said. As punishment for bad behaviour, the teen told the court that he and his step-sister were fed frozen meals, hosed down and forced to sleep in closets, where they would listen to recordings of the Bible on tape and Christian music. The defense has attempted to paint Immanuel as a disobedient boy with an attitude problem. The lawyers for the couple said Immanuel hit and bit Jackson’s daughter so badly that her teacher ended up calling CPS after the child came to school with bruises. Sheila Jackson said that Immanuel has been getting counselling and his behaviour has been improving. In 2008, Immanuel was 7 years old when the American couple, both devout Christians, adopted him and Hana from Ethiopia. Larry worked at Boeing while his wife was a stay-at-home mom home-schooling the two adopted kids and their seven biological children. In his testimony, the 12-year-old told the court that his adopted parents would beat him with a stick until blood was running down his face. Other disciplinary measures included having Immanuel hosed down in the yard for bed-wetting and keeping him and Hana outside in the cold. Tough disciplinarians: Hana and her adoptive brother were allegedly spanked, hit with sticks, hosed down and forced to eat frozen food . Cruel death: Hana's emaciated body covered in bruises was found face down in the mud in the backyard of the family's home in Sedro-Woolley, Washington . Cause of death: An autopsy showed that the 13-year-old died from hypothermia exacerbated by malnutrition and gastritis . 'I would suffer with the pain until it eventually went away,' he said in sign language July 29. Larry’s attorney, Rachel Forde, characterized the Ethiopian boy as a troublemaker who lied to his adoptive parents and refused to do lessons assigned by his mother. While the couple's biological children, five of whom had testified during the trial, were generally treated better, the strict rules in the Williams household applied to them as well. According to Joseph Williams, however, he and his siblings were given the authority to punish and even spank their adopted brother and sister, KIRO-TV reported. Joseph was called to the stand to describe the night of May 12, 2011, when his 13-year-old adopted sister died. Joseph Williams told the court that after Hana died while sitting in the yard in 40-degree weather, his mother instructed him to bring the girl's body inside, where she performed CPR and called 911. The mother of nine said on the call that her daughter Hana 'has killed herself.' Blaming the victim: On a 911 call after Hana's death, Carri Williams (left) told the dispatcher that her 'rebellious' adopted daughter had killed herself by throwing herself down to the ground and refusing to come indoors . When asked by the 911 dispatcher why she believed her daughter had taken her own life, Williams said that the girl was not breathing and lying face down in the mud after refusing to come indoors, according to the Seattle Times. Calling Hana 'rebellious,' the mother said that she had seen the 13-year-old throwing herself to the ground and staggering about the yard after taking her clothes off. A local weather station reported that the temperature that night was 42 degrees. First responders arrived just after midnight and rushed Hana to Skagit Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead an hour later. An autopsy report concluded that the girl died from hypothermia, with malnutrition and chronic gastritis as contributing factors. According to the girl’s medical records, between 2009 and 2011, she had lost nearly 30lbs and was short for her age. Larry and Carri Williams were arrested September 29, 2011, on charges of homicide by abuse in connection with their daughter's death, and first-degree assault of a child stemming from mistreatment of Immanuel. If convicted, each faces a prison term of between 20 and 29 years, according to state sentencing guidelines.","Larry and Carri Williams of Sedro-Woolley, Washington were found guilty of neglecting, abusing, and ultimately killing 13-year-old Hana Williams .

"A man has confessed to killing his girlfriend's mother in a Bali hotel, and his girlfriend has admitted to helping him stuff the bludgeoned body into a suitcase, Indonesian police have claimed. Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, from Chicago, were arrested on August 13, a day after Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was found in a blood-splattered suitcase outside their luxury resort. Police Chief Colonel Djoko Heru Utomo said today that Schaefer confessed to killing his girlfriend's mother during an interrogation on Monday. He said he killed her after an argument. The chief added that Heather Mack, who is two months pregnant, acknowledged her role in separate questioning later this week. Scroll down for video . 'Confession': Tommy Schaefer, pictured left being escorted by an Indonesian police officer during his arrest on August 13, has reportedly confessed to killing his girlfriend's mother at a luxury Bali resort last month . 'Killers': He is pictured with his girlfriend Heather Mack, who has reportedly admitted to helping dispose of her mother's body. Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was found stuffed into a suitcase . Attempts to reach their Indonesian lawyers were not immediately successful. The couple has yet to be formally charged. Utomo said officers hoped to complete their investigation and file their case with prosecutors before the couple's detention period ends in mid-October. Police say they have interviewed dozens of witnesses, including the taxi driver and hotel employees. The butchered, half-naked body was discovered on August 12 inside the suitcase that Heather and Schaefer had allegedly taken from the luxury St. Regis hotel down to a taxi, saying they would return. But they failed to return after two hours and the driver began to get suspicious when blood started to seep from the case. He went to the police station where the grisly discovery was made. The young . lovers, who both come from the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, . were arrested asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the Bali . international airport, after allegedly attempting to get hotel staff to . open her mother's safe deposit box so they could retrieve their . passports. Police . claim the young couple initially told them that they been taken captive . at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. They said they . managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta . area of Bali. Murdered: 62-year-old Sheila von Wiese-Mack (pictured) was reportedly heard arguing with her daughter (pictured left) over the hotel bill the night before she was found murdered . Behind bars: Heather Mack, from Chicago, stands at the police district headquarters after she was arrested . Heather . is two months pregnant with what is believed to be Schaefer's child. Indonesian authorities say if she is convicted, the child could grow up . in prison with her mother. Due to this, the unborn baby has been granted a lawyer to look after his or her interests. Attorney Vanessa Favia arrived on Bali last week along with Mack's Chicago-based lawyer Michael Elkin to make sure the baby, due in early spring, gets all the help it needs. Mack's Indonesian lawyer Raja Nasution told MailOnline that Favia will 'ensure that the humanitarian and governmental interests of Heather's unborn child are safeguarded now and in the future.' Mack has claimed she was put in solitary confinement in the jail and was sexually assaulted 'multiple times' by guards, her lawyer said. 'She is emotionally and mentally drained, and told me, ""I don't know how long I can take this"",' her Chicago attorney said. Authorities say her had been hit repeatedly . about the face with a heavy blunt object. They say the 62-year-old was folded into the silver-colored case, with her back arched forward at an almost impossible angle and her legs bent up around the sides of her head. But because she had been lowered into the 3ft-long suitcase on her side, the lid would not close completely over the body of the murdered 5ft 5in woman. In a panic, her alleged killers wrapped the suitcase in a sheet and pulled the cloth tight around it in the hope that it would disguise the fact that it was not closed. Gruesome: von Wiese-Mack's body was found inside a bloodied suitcase left in a cab outside their hotel . Shocking: An image shows investigators looking inside another case containing blood-stained sheets . Pathologists say she suffered . asphyxiation, a broken neck and a broken nose and that she had probably . been killed between 6.45am and 10am local time. During . her autopsy, several defensive wounds were also discovered - suggesting . Mrs. Mack, the widow of Chicago musician James L. Mack, who died in . front of Heather during a family vacation to Greece in 2006 - had fought . back while being attacked. Dr . Dudut Rustyadi, the forensic chief at Sanglah hospital morgue in the . Balinese capital of Denpasar, said: 'From the wound, we found violence . using blunt objects. 'We found many wounds, open wounds and bruises, including wounds on her left arm. We allege that the victim fought.' In the hours leading up to her murder, Mrs Mack had been seen on CCTV footage walking around the hotel lobby at 3.45am. Authorities say one sequence caught on hotel security cameras shows Mrs Mack arguing with her daughter and Schaefer about who should pay the hotel bill. She was heard by staff telling her daughter that she had paid for Schaefer’s air fare to Bali so the two of them should pay the bill. After the . murder, police in Mrs Mack's hometown of Oak Park revealed that they had been . called to the family's former home 86 times over a ten-year period — an . average of once every six weeks — to help calm fights between her . and her daughter. They never made an arrest in all of those visits even though Mrs Mack was found with a broken arm on one occasion in 2011. It . was also revealed that Mrs Mack called cops just last month after her . credit card company told her about an unauthorized charge. Police went . to the Conrad Hotel in downtown Chicago, where they found Tommy, Heather . and seven other youngsters partying in an eighth-floor suite. Schaefer . was arrested and was due to appear in court in September on charges . related to the incident. Mrs. Mack's brother, William Wiese told the Chicago Tribune that Heather . grew more difficult after her father's death, which the family alleged . resulted from an injury he suffered on an earlier cruise in 2006. Mrs . Mack won a $1.5 million settlement from Royal Caribbean Cruises. Taken to custody: An . Indonesian police officer escorts American Tommy Schaefer (left) as he . is brought to the police station for questioning in relation to the . death of his girlfriend's mother . Wiese told the Tribune he believed Schaefer showed up in Bali without his sister's knowledge as she was trying to make a fresh start with her daughter by taking her on the vacation. 'She was such an optimist,' he said. 'She was forever trying to help that girl.' 'I think my sister loved Heather more than anything,' Wiese added. 'She would seek our input and advice. She tried so hard to help Heather through the years with therapists and psychiatrists. It was always a struggle to get Heather to (cooperate).' Mrs Mack sold the five-bed, five-bath Oak Park mansion to a developer for $650,000 last year. After extensive renovations it is now back on the market for $1.68 million. At the time of her death, she and her daughter were living in a 18th-floor luxury apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast area with stunning views overlooking Lake Michigan.","Body of U.S. socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack was found stuffed in a suitcase at a luxury Bali resort last month .

"A Canadian hunter was accidentally shot by his son-in-law who was trying to save him from a bear attack. Wilf Lloyd, 56, was hunting with Skeet Podrasky in Fernie, British Colombia on Sunday when the bear attacked. It is understood that Podrasky, in a bid to save Lloyd from the bear, fired his rifle - missing animal. Wilf Lloyd was shot by his son-in-law who was trying to defend him from a grizzly bear attack, file picture . A second shot hit and killed the animal according to CBC. Lloyd, from Cranbrook, was rushed to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. An air ambulance took him to Calgary's Foothills Hospital for treatment. Animal behavour expert Kevin Van Tighhem told Calgary CTV News: 'Even if you're able to score a lethal hit on the animal as it’s coming at you, it can still complete the attack because it’s running on adrenaline. On the other hand, bear spray, all it requires is a wall of spray between you and the bear. As soon as it hits the wall of spray, its attention is about getting away from that spray.' It is understood the bear weighed in the region of 400lbs. Medics are planning to fit a metal rod into Lloyd's leg. It was feared at one stage that Lloyd could have lost his leg due to the severity of his injuries.","Wilf Lloyd was mauled by the bear in Fernie British Colombia .

"Sareena Ali (pictured) and her baby died after poor care at Queen’s Hospital, Essex. The midwife who failed to care for her - Rebecca Matovu - has now been suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council . A senior midwife who went home instead of helping a heavily pregnant woman and her unborn child - who both later died - has been suspended for just three months. Rebecca Matovu failed to help Sareena Ali, 27, despite desperate pleas from her family that she was in agony at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex. Ms Matovu ignored three calls from Ms Ali’s panic stricken husband and brother, even refusing to help when the family resorted to banging on the nursing station doors. When she realised Mrs Ali was cold and unresponsive, Ms Matovu went home instead of helping with resuscitation efforts as her shift had ended, the Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing heard. Ms Ali had to have an emergency Caesarean section, but the baby died shortly after being born. The mother was left in intensive care on a life support machine, but died from a ruptured womb and massive organ failure five days later. At the inquest in 2011, coroner Chinyere Inyama found that staff at the hospital’s maternity unit, one of the largest in the UK, had contributed to the death through neglect. Ms Matovu has now been suspended for three months after the NMC hearing for failing to help the ‘utterly dependent’ Mrs Ali. Clive Powell, chairing the NMC panel, said: ‘By ignoring the pleas for help that were made by the patient’s husband, Ms Matovu failed to listen to the people in her care and this is especially serious given that she was acting as midwife in charge. ‘This demonstrated a failure to act kindly and considerately. ‘Further, it should have been abundantly clear to Ms Matovu that the actions of her team were placing the patient at risk and yet she took no action. ‘Moreover, Ms Matovu is an experienced midwife who should have been able to recognise the signs that a serious situation was unfolding before her. ‘It is agreed that Ms Matovu should have recognised that an emergency situation had arisen given that she was personally asked to call the crash team. ‘As a midwife in charge, even if she had formally ended her shift, it was imperative that Ms Matovu assisted her colleagues and sought to find out whether her skills were required.’ Mrs Ali, a sales assistant at Harrods, was induced on January 23 2011 because she was overdue at 40 weeks. She arrived with her husband, mortgage consultant Usman Javed, at the hospital at 10am, but by 7.05pm she was in obvious difficulties. Between then and 9.40pm, Mr Javed went to the nurses’ station for help three times but was ignored by Ms Matovu and her colleagues. He told the inquest: ‘The midwife just laughed and said that once she is in labour the pains are just going to get worse. ‘One of them told me ""have you not been reading books? What have you been doing for the last nine months?"". But I told them I am not a doctor, I don’t know what to expect.’ Ms Matovu left the ward before the crash team arrived, and failed to provide any assistance to colleagues about Mrs Ali’s condition. At . the inquest into Ms Ali's death in 2011, coroner Chinyere Inyama found . that staff at the Queen's Hospital maternity unit, one of the largest . in the UK, had contributed to the death through neglect . Resuscitation was attempted on Mrs Ali, who had suffered a miscarriage before, started at 10.05pm, and the baby was delivered soon afterwards but showed no signs of life. A 2011 investigation into the hospital after a string of mother and baby deaths, including Mrs Ali, exposed a ‘culture of abuse’ among midwives. Ms Matovu is the second midwife to be hauled in front of the NMC over the death of Mrs Ali and her baby. She claimed she had handed over care of her patients when she left the hospital, and said she was not the ‘midwife in charge’ at that time. However the NMC panel found she had failed to respond to reasonable requests of assistance from Mrs Ali’s family. She was also found to have failed to provide adequate assistance to colleagues and to have left the ward before the crash team arrived.","Rebecca Matovu failed to help Sareena Ali, 27, at Queen's Hospital, Romford .

"Tilda Swinton has been announced as the new face of Nars at the age of 53. The British star will follow in the footsteps of fellow actress Charlotte Rampling, 68 - the face of Nars' Audacious Lipstick collection - to star in the cosmetics company's spring 2015 campaign. The blonde beauty was shot for the ads by the brand's founder and artistic director François Nars, who described her as a 'living legend' and the 'perfect choice' to front the campaign. Ethereal beauty: Tilda Swinton has been announced as the new face of Nars at the age of 53 . He told WWD: 'As a photographer, working with an actress like Tilda is very enjoyable . 'She is a living legend. I love her bold style and really admire her work. As an actress, she brings such strong personality to the camera. And as a woman, she lives the experience of transformation and expression. She was the perfect choice for Nars.' So far just one of three images from the campaign has been released. It shows Tilda posing with a black net scarf around her neck, her signature blonde cropped haircut standing on end. The star looks stunning in graphic black eyeliner, her shoulders bare and her porcelain complexion flawless. Francois - who celebrated his eponymous brand's 20th birthday this year - previously gushed over The Grand Budapest Hotel star in a piece he wrote for Vogue's October issue in celebration of the milestone occasion. The French-born make-up artist admitted he adored Tilda's 'ethereal' look and is an admirer of unconventional beauty. Unique look: The blonde beauty (pictured on Monday) was shot for the ads by the brand's founder and artistic director François Nars, who described her as a 'living legend' and the 'perfect choice' to front the campaign . Long time fan: Francois  previously gushed over The Grand Budapest Hotel star (pictured in character) in a piece he wrote for Vogue's October issue in celebration of the milestone occasion . He said: 'My favorite actresses - Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Silvana Mangano, Romy Schneider, Catherine Deneuve, Charlotte Rampling, Tilda Swinton - are not what you would call typical beauties. 'Tilda is almost ethereal, but these women I've used for Nars over the years are beautiful in an unconventional sense. I find my best work as a make-up artist has always been with those kinds of faces.' Tilda - a long time admirer of Francois - was equally thrilled with the team-up and has admitted the pair are keen to 'do more things together'. She said: 'I met François only recently, having long been an admirer of his from afar for many years. Ageless beauties: The Scottish star follows in the footsteps of fellow actress Charlotte Rampling, 68, the face of Nars' Audacious Lipstick collection (pictured) 'I liked him immensely and immediately and we were eager, from that first session, to do more things together. [The shoot was] the greatest of fun - supremely nice people, full of ease and play.' This is just the latest in a sequence of 40+ women nabbing big-name cosmetics contracts. Prior to Charlotte Rampling, 46-year-old Daphne Guinness was chosen as the face of Nars. In February, Marc Jacobs named Jessica Lange, 65, as the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty, and L'Oreal's spokespersons include Andie MacDowell, 56, and Diane Keaton, 68 .","She follows in the footsteps of Charlotte Rampling, 68, who fronts the brand's lipstick line ."
"A debate between the two candidates hoping to become Florida's next Governor was delayed last night because one had an electric fan in his podium. The second televised debate between Governor Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist was held up, as Scott initially refused to take part because the fan inside his opponent's lantern. Scott felt it violated the rule prohibiting the use of electric devices. The panelists spent a few minutes discussing how they should proceed, with Crist insisting the debate go on without Scott. The governor eventually walked on stage, and Crist kept his fan. Scroll down for video . The televised debate between Democrat candidate Charlie Crist (left) and Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott (right) was delayed because Scott objected to his opponent having a fan in his lantern . After the initial delay, the candidates debated on a range of issues including gay marriage and Florida's 'stand your ground law' - Crist (pictured) said the law should be amended . During the televised debate at Broward College, Scott took credit for lower unemployment during the recovery . The peculiar build up to last night's debate reflects the tension between the two nominees, in what has turned in to a nasty campaign at times. After the issue with the fan, the candidates debated on gay marriage - which they disagree on - and Florida's 'stand your ground' law. They also discussed how each has handled education and the environment and blamed each other for rising utility costs. When the candidates were asked if justice was served when neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder for fatally shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin last year, Crist used the opportunity to suggest amending the stand your ground law, which allows use of deadly force if people are in fear for their lives. 'Everyone believes in that American premise and it is the right thing to do to defend yourself and your property,' Crist said. 'But when it gets to the point where you have a statute on the books that allows the instigator...to end up killing another human being after they started the incident, there is something fundamentally wrong with that law.' Scott said Martin's death was tragic, but the law should remain as it is. 'I believe in the right to defend yourself. I can't imagine losing a child like that but I have talked to sheriffs and police chiefs,' Scott said. 'I stand with them that we need to have the existing law in place.' After the debate, Scott's campaign manager Melissa Sellers issued a statement saying, 'Crist can bring his fan, microwave, and toaster to debates - none of that will cover up how sad his record as governor was compared to the success of Rick Scott' The two candidates stand on opposite sides of a number of key issues, including education funding, same-sex marriage, medical marijuana, Cuba policy and raising the minimum wage . Polls show the two candidates neck and neck in the race in a state that Scott won by only 60,000 votes in 2010 . As he has done throughout the campaign, Scott blamed Crist for rising unemployment during the recession and took credit for lower unemployment during the recovery. 'Charlie is the zero-wage governor: 832,000 people went from wages to zero wages when Charlie was governor,' Scott said. But Crist retorted: 'Rick, there you go again, trying to blame the global economic meltdown on me. It is unbelievable that he would continue to say that, but he says it. And he also says he created all these new jobs all by himself. 'You just can't trust Rick. And it's sad. It's unfortunate.' Once the debate got underway a few minutes late both candidates wasted no time attacking each other, despite warnings from the panel that the public was upset with the negativity of the campaign so far . Scott was asked if Florida's constitutional ban on gay marriage was discriminatory, but he refused to directly answer the question, even when asked a second time. He did say he supports traditional marriage. Crist said he was in favour of gay marriage. 'Who is it for us to tell other people who to love and what is it in our right to tell other people who to marry?' Crist said. The 2014 Florida gubernatorial election will take place on November 4.

"He was the flawed genius who was famous for his exuberant approach to fashion, his love of the theatrical and his clever grasp of cut. Now some of Alexander McQueen's most striking designs are to go on display at the V&A in London, among them 30 previously unseen pieces. Savage Beauty originally went on display at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in the wake of McQueen's death in 2010 but will relocate to London in the Spring. Finale: McQueen's S/S10 collection explored what people would look like had they evolved from sea creatures . New sections will include one that focuses on the early years of his career in London, as well as garments lent by stylist - and McQueen's close friend - Katy England, the Isabella Blow Collection and the House of Givenchy. The Cabinet of Curiosities will be expanded, with pieces created by McQueen in collaboration with milliner Philip Treacey and jeweller Shaun Leane included in the display. McQueen, who was found dead on the 11th February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers and the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. Striking: A Shaun Leane Tahitian pearl necklace from SS01 and a duck feather dress from the AW09 collection . Clever: As this SS04 collection reveals, McQueen never lost his passion for the theatrical . After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans. The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. Beautiful: A fantastical dress from McQueen's AW06 collection and an equally spectacular SS01 gown . Genius: Alexander McQueen, who died in February 2010, was one of Britain's most influential designers . But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital. Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. 'The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.' The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series. But it is Savage Beauty that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show. Wonderful: Philip Treacey and Shaun Leane were regular collaborators and made these spectacular hats . Legacy: Although the designer is gone, his label lives on in the capable hands of designer Sarah Burton . Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last he would ever create. His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength. 'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.'","Savage Beauty, a retrospective of McQueen's work, will move to London .

"A California man has become the first passenger to die in a car crash while using the rideshare service Lyft. Shane Holland, 24, of West Sacramento and his 27-year-old boyfriend Brady Lawrence ordered a car through the mobile app early Saturday morning while going home from a Halloween party. Their Lyft driver Shanti Adhikari, 31, swerved in the rain to avoid a stalled car in the center lanes of the freeway and crashed into a tree on the shoulder of the road. Holland died at the scene. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones involved in this tragedy,' said Lyft spokeswoman Erin Simpson on Sunday. 'We are deeply saddened to hear this news and will continue to support those involved as well as authorities in the ongoing investigation.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Shane Holland, 24, died Saturday morning while riding as a passenger in a Lyft rideshare car near Roseville, California . Damage: Holland and his 27-year-old boyfriend Brady Lawrence were being driven by Lyft driver Shanti Adhikari when the driver swerved to avoid a stalled vehicle in the middle of the road and crashed into two trees on the shoulder. Holland died on impact. Above, pictures of the scene of the crash . Fast lanes: Just minutes before the Lyft crash, a white-colored car side-swiped the Kia which caused it to stall on this stretch of I-80 pictured above . The incident happened just before 1:30am on Saturday as Adhikari was driving Holland and Lawrence in his Toyota Camry  westbound on Interstate 80 near Roseville. Just minutes before, the driver of a Kia was sideswiped by a white-vehicle, causing his car to stall in the middle of the road. Adhikari swerved in the rain to avoid the Kia, and lost control of his vehicle, which veered onto the right shoulder, struck a tree and then spun clockwise to hit another tree. Despite the fact that both passengers were wearing seat belts, Holland died on impact. Both Adhikari and Lawrence sustained moderate injuries in the crash. The driver told Fox 40 that he was recovering at home and is 'very sad' about the accident. It's unclear whether Lawrence was hospitalized for his injuries. So far, no charges have been pressed against any of the drivers in the accident. California Highway Patrol says the investigation is ongoing, but it appears no drugs or alcohol were a factor. Couple: Holland (far left and far right) pictured with his boyfriend Lawrence (center) above in photos posted to Facebook. Lawrence sustained moderate injuries in the crash. It's unclear if he was hospitalized . However, CHP spokesman Chard Hertzell says Adhikari was going too fast for the weather conditions. 'If you're going slower you're gonna be able to see a vehicle stalled out in front of you, especially in wet weather,' Hertzell told Fox. Simpson confirmed that this was the first death for the company, which has a $1million liability policy to cover Lyft drivers, passengers and third parties in crashes. Competitor Uber has not had a similar fatality involving a passenger yet. However, one Uber driver did fatally hit a 6-year-old pedestrian in San Francisco in January. The family of that victim has filed a wrongful death suit, claiming the driver was distracted on his phone, looking at the Uber app, at the time of the crash. Uber maintains the crash was not their fault. A first: This was the first fatality involving a Lyft passenger. The rideshare program has a $1million liability policy to cover such accidents.

"Accused paedophiles are importing child-like sex dolls - but claiming they are harmless toys to avoid prosecution. One Sydney man is expected to fight a charge of possessing one of the dolls, insisting it is not child abuse material. A man has been charged with possessing a silicon sex doll, allegedly in the shape of a teenage girl. In a case that is thought to be one of the first of its kind in NSW, the man will reportedly allege that he does not fit the legal definition of a child abuser. If the defence of his case, thought to be the first of its kind in NSW, is sucessful, the 32-year-old  it could force the government to rethink what is defined as child sex abuse. Scroll down for video . A Sydney man has been charged with possessing a silicon sex doll, allegedly in the shape of a teenage girl . Police reportedly raided the man's house in January 2013 and found the child-like mannequin lying in his bed, dressed in a satin nightgown. According to The Daily Telegraph, Police said the mannequin, which featured a removable silicon genital insert, was in the shape of a female 'approximately 12 to 14 years of age'. Police also believe the mannequin was purchased via a Chinese website for $3667. The Australian part of the site has since been taken down and the Chinese site has removed the 'child dolls' from their inventory. Police reportedly raided the man's house in January 2013 and found the child-like mannequin lying in his bed, dressed in a satin nightgown . The man is set to go before a court to claim that he does not fall under the child abuse category as there were no photos or videos taken of the mannequin. The current NSW Crimes Act defines child abuse material as videos, images and literature but not physical objects. The man's doll is 132cm tall and weighs  30kg. His lawyer, Benjamin Goh, said the legal definition of child abuse material needs to be updated. The man is set to go before a court to claim that he does not fall under the child abuse category as there were no photos or videos taken of the mannequin . He said his client cannot be convicted until the definition of child abuse in NSW law includes inanimate objects. 'The government needs to make sure the law keeps up with what's on the market,' Mr Goh said. 'It is similar to when synthetic drugs were not captured under law — there were substances that had similar effects to LSD and ecstasy but were completely legal before the laws were changed.' Alleged paedophiles are reportedly importing sex dolls in the shape of young children from abroad and disguising them as props for film sets. According to reports, a man from Narrabeen was the mastermind behind the Australian site. He allegedly told customers he could disguise the dolls from customs, by writing that they were worth less than the actual sale price. The Narrabeen supplier was also charged with possessing child abuse material after police allegedly found more than 8000  images and videos on his personal computer.

"Parents will be able to take their children out of school during term time for special occasions in a relaxation of the holiday ban introduced by Michael Gove. After a string of controversial cases, the new guidelines drawn up by head teachers' leaders make clear when families can take children away from classes. The rules have been backed by new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals, recover after a personal or family crisis, attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill. Scroll down for video . New Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is backing a relaxation of the rules drawn up by the National Association of Head Teachers . Under the new guidelines revealed in the Sunday Times, parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time. They were drawn up by the National Association of Head Teachers and have been backed by Ms Morgan, whose Mr Gove brought the changes in last year . They ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year in special circumstances. It left parents facing fines of £60 per pupil per parent if they took children out of school without permission and those who refused to pay were fined £2,500 by the courts and could even be jailed for up to three months. The new rules were aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education, but became one of Gove's most unpopular policies. The move was criticised by campaigners who claimed it was unfair on parents and had no affect on the level of a child's academic achievement. Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, which collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who opposed the new rules. He said: 'This is a very welcome U-turn. However the devil is in the detail. We will now be monitoring the situation and we may still press for some families to be allowed to take cheap term-time holidays.' Previously, he told MailOnline: 'The government's own research says that a small amount of authorised holidays has no negative affect on achievement and may in fact result in better outcomes. 'The time that parents have to concentrate on their children means that if they do ensure that work is put into academic issues then it can be better for the children. 'There are many cases where families are badly impacted by the new rules. Families should be supported by the government rather than family life made more difficult.' Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, who oppose the ban . Since the changes were brought in, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval. Dozens of parents have been convicted by magistrates' courts after refusing to pay penalty charges of £60 per child, rising to £120 if not paid within 21 days. In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine for keeping her daughter off school for seven days. Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups. Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. She was ordered to pay the fine, but cleared of a criminal act. Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days . In another case taken up by the campaign group, a five-year-old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad. Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September. Because of his work commitments as a police officer, Mr Stephenson was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went. In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the US to attend a family memorial service. He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term. But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the US. Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays. Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work. He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine. But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission. In response to the new rules, a DfE spokesperson said: 'The NAHT is clear that they firmly support the current policy and term-time holidays should only be granted in exceptional circumstance. 'There are no plans at all to change the policy and no u-turn. Headteachers have always been able to decide what exceptional circumstances are, but if they find that the NAHT's guidance assists them in making this judgement then we welcome that.' The new legislation, brought in on September 1, aimed to stop youngsters missing chunks of their education .","Ban on parents taking their children out of school during term to be relaxed .

"A super-religious former football star kept his eldest son prisoner in the basement for two years because he had ‘sinned’ by stealing a DVD player, the MailOnline can reveal. Strict Recardo Wimbush Sr, 33, and wife Therian Cornelia Wimbush, 37, locked up 13-year-old Recardo Jr as punishment for his ‘wicked’ act to keep him on the ‘straight and narrow’. The child was kept in a tiny, sparsely furnished room with all the windows blacked out. Scroll down for video . Recardo Wimbush, Sr, a devotee of a religion dedicated to Yah, allegedly locked his son, 13, in the basement of the family home for two years . Wimbush and his wife Therian Wimbush (pictured) have been charged with child abuse and their 10 children taken into care . The parents were so angry with the boy's actions that he was banned from having any contact with his nine younger siblings and wasn’t allowed to read books or play with toys. Gwinnett County police have now charged former Georgia Tech football star Wimbush and his wife with cruelty to children. The couple – both devoted to an unusual religion which worships Yah - told investigators they had locked Recardo Jr in the basement for 'disciplinary reasons,' said Corporal Jake Smith, spokesman for Gwinnett Police. 'The victim had been confined to the room for most of the past two years and a lock had been added to the victim’s room in January 2013,' Smith said. Recardo Wimbush (left) and Therian Wimbush in 2005 mug shots. The parents had previously been arrested in 2005 on simple battery charges, according to Gwinnett County Detention Center records . Recardo Wimbush wearing the number 42 shirt for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets . 'The victim had no access to books, toys, entertainment devices, or his siblings.' Social workers discovered the boy was being confined to a small room that contained a bare box springs and mattress and 'a large plastic jar, which was apparently used as a toilet,' Smith said. The Buford couple was charged with malicious and intentional cruelty to children and false imprisonment and must turn themselves in to authorities by the end of the day Friday. The Wimbushes told a judge at a June 19 family court hearing that the 13-year-old was a threat to their other children. But according to sources the child claims he was being punished for stealing a DVD player that wasn’t his. The . arrest warrant said the child was 'sent to the basement of the family . house for the past two years in deplorable conditions due to being . disobedient.' The family live in a large home in Buford, north of Atlanta, Georgia. Strict: The Wimbush children (Recardo Jr pictured center back) are home-schooled and their parents are known to be disciplinarians . Harsh punishment: Recardo Wimbush with son Recardo Wimbush, Jr as a baby, who was allegedly kept in a basement with no light and nothing to occupy his mind for two years . There is a slide and child’s swings in the back yard but neighbors said the children were held to a strict regime. Neighbor Pam Harris, 46, says the family moved in around 11 years ago. She said they are strict disciplinarians who rarely allowed the children to talk to ‘strangers’. ‘They were a very odd family, they had ten children who were all home schooled and nicely dressed but weren’t allowed to be sociable. ‘You would . never see the children playing outside on their own or in twos or . threes, they would only ever go outside all together as a family with . the parents watching. ‘They seemed very strict disciplinarians. They didn’t believe in Christmas and didn’t celebrate Halloween. ‘If children in the neighborhood knocked on their door for trick or treat the parents would hand out bibles instead of candy.’ Mrs Harris said the children were home-schooled. She also said the family often displayed religious messages and posters on their front door. She . said: ‘Once they had a notice on their door that blew in to my yard. It . said those who work on Sunday should be put to death. ‘It’s . so sad that that little boy was kept in the basement, we heard he had . sinned and stolen a DVD player, but they told police it was something . worse. That poor boy.’ Mrs Harris said police came to the property last Thursday after a tip off and removed the ten children. An . undated family website shows a large, seemingly happy family and . explained the importance of religion and its devotion to ‘Yah’. On . the website Recardo and his wife preach their family purpose as being . ‘Wisely Instructed Meek Believers Uncompromising & Steadfast in . Humility (WIMBUSH). They say the Wimbush vision is to: ‘Be a family of Yah that, much like Mosheh, is found TRUSTWORTHY in all YAH’s House!!!’ Family website: The site contains family pictures and statements about their religious beliefs . Sporting career: Wimbush attended Georgia Tech where he was a star football player . Full of secrets: The family moved into this home 11 years ago and neighbors say the children were never allowed to play outside unless under the watchful eyes of their parents . In amongst dozens of family photos the family vision is stated as: ‘Love and Fear YAH or Elohim, Guard His Charge: even His laws, and His right rulings, and His commands, ALWAYS!!! Serve Him, and cling to HIM and swear by HIS Name.’ Photos include a family group shot with the whole family dressed in white , individual snaps of the children including one of their pet dog Budd and photos of muscle bound ‘daddy’ Wimbush and ‘mommy’ Therian. JAH is the shortened form of the divine name YHWH (also spelled Jehovah or Yahweh), an anglicized version of the Tetragrammaton. Recardo Jr was one of three children the couple had while at Georgia Tech where Wimbush was a linebacker captain of the football team during his 2002 senior season. Therian was a tutor when they met before she was graduated with duel degrees from Tech and Spelman College in 2000. Recardo was described as a diaper-changing dad who got furloughs from team duties to be with his family. 'I knew I always wanted kids,' he then told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'They bring a bright spot to your heart, and they have with me.' According to the Atlanta Journal the charges shocked Wimbush’s former teammate Jeremy Muyres - who was a co-captain with Wimbush on the 2002 team. 'The one thing I do know is Recardo’s one of the best guys I’ve ever been around,' said Muyres, a teacher and football coach at Norcross High School. Overzealous: The family often posted religious messages and posters on their front door, one of which stated that people who work on Sundays should be put to death . Rescued: Recardo Wimbush, Sr, with son Recardo Wimbush, Jr (bottom front) and two of his other children . Broken family: Therian Wimbush, with one of the couple's many children, has been charged with child abuse after a tip-off to police . 'Obviously, hearing about it, it’s shocking, but I don’t know all the details. None of us do yet.' The warrants arose out of an investigation by the Department of Family and Children Services following an anonymous tip. The boy was in good health, as were his nine siblings, and there were no other signs of abuse. After a hearing, a judge removed all the children from the house and contacted Gwinnett Police who searched the house the next day,  Cpl. Smith, said. Detectives found that the boy was fed at normal meal times and that the room was kept clean; the parents had added a sheet to the make-shift bed since the visit by the social workers, Smith said. But detectives don’t believe the boy was being schooled - none of the children attended public school - and was only occasionally let out to use the bathroom, Smith said. The room was dark, with no light bulb in its fixture and the 'single window was painted white which let in a small amount of light during daylight hours,' Smith said. Wimbush, who grew up in Blakely, was a Georgia Tech linebacker from 1999 to 2002 and was the team captain his senior year, the same year he was a second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection. According to the Atlanta Journal he was a standout athlete not only for team records, but also because he pursued his degree at the university after his athletic eligibility ended. He earned it in 2010. Wimbush signed with the Falcons in April 2003 as an undrafted free agent but was released after training camp. 'I just remember he was always a good guy, always did the right thing,' Muyres said. 'He was a guy who would always have your back, a guy who would always be there for you, a guy you could count on. He was just that type of person.'","Recardo Wimbush, Sr, 33, and Therian Cornelia Wimbush, 37, have been arrested for child abuse .

"The Obama administration is . considering imposing a forced quarantine on healthcare workers who return to the . United States from the Ebola hot zone of West Africa, after a . New York doctor who treated patients there tested positive . for the virus on Thursday. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Tom Skinner told Reuters on Friday that a mandatory quarantine is one possible plan under discussion by officials from . across the administration. 'There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to . the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are . returning to the United States from affected countries,' Skinner . said. Jeff Hulbert of Annapolis, Maryland, held up a sign in front of the White House on Friday; he wants a mandatory quarantine for all people – not just doctors – who have returned to the US from Ebola-ravaged countries . President Barack Obama meets with Ebola survivor Nina Pham (right) in the Oval Office on Friday, as the CDC scrambled to upgrade its plan to contain the virus before exposed people can spread it in the US . 'We want to strike the right balance of doing what is best . to protect the public's health while not impeding whatsoever our . ability to combat the epidemic in West Africa. Our risk here . will not be zero until we stop the epidemic there.' As for a possible quarantine, 'that's one of the options on the table,' Skinner said. The CDC-led discussions began on Thursday after Dr. Craig . Spencer in New York became the fourth person diagnosed with the . disease in the United States. Skinner said discussions are likely to produce some change . in current policy and that the aim is to reach a decision as . soon as possible. The Spencer case has heightened public anxiety about the . virus and the Obama administration's response to its arrival on . U.S. soil. Last month, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan became the . first case diagnosed in the United States after arriving in . Dallas from his home country. He died on Oct. 8. Two nurses who helped treat him came down with Ebola, . stirring fear about infection dangers and uncertainty about U.S. preparedness for dealing with the virus. Current policy calls for returning healthcare workers and . military personnel to be monitored for Ebola symptoms during the . virus's maximum 21-day incubation period. But lawmakers have . expressed concern that those being monitored are also able to . resume normal routines, potentially placing members of the . public at risk for infection. Dr. Craig Spencer of New York City became the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after he came home from a stint in Guinea treating Ebola patients with Doctors Without Borders . Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, testified Friday on Capitol Hill and begged the government to implement stricter controls so more nurses don't contract the deadly contagion . 'Whatever option we come up with just simply can't hamper . ability to respond to the situation in West Africa,' Skinner . said. 'Because as long as that's going on over there, our risk . will never be zero.' The United States is undertaking a major effort to contain . the worst outbreak of Ebola since the disease was identified in . 1976. At least 4,877 people have died of the disease, . predominantly in the impoverished West African countries of . Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The U.S. response includes sending up to 4,000 troops as . well as doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers to West . Africa. On Friday, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives . took issue with a Pentagon policy that subjects troops to only . 10 days of monitoring before they return home from the region. Pentagon officials told lawmakers that troops would still face . 21 days of monitoring under current CDC guidelines once home . while resuming their normal daily routines.","CDC says the US might segregate homecoming doctors and nurses for three weeks if they were in Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone .

"A drunk had to be rescued by Russian emergency services after he clambered onto an ice floe to cross a river after a night out - and it floated away with him. Cyril Aksyonov had earlier managed to get a lift to his local bar on the other side of the Ob River in the Parabeliskii region of western Siberia in Russia. But when the 38-year-old wanted to go home he found the car had already left, and he faced a 10 mile walk in freezing weather to the nearest bridge. Cyril Aksyonov (circled) had to be rescued after he clambered onto an ice floe on the Ob River in the Parabeliskii region of western Siberia in Russia . Rather than walking along the shore, he jumped onto a huge piece of ice on the river hoping to get across. But he was unable to control the ice floe and was swept along what is the world's seventh longest river before being spotted by residents who raised the alarm. Emergency crews raced against time as the ice crashed against other chunks in the river, threatening to throw Aksyonov into the freezing water. Rather than walking along the shore, he jumped onto a huge piece of ice flowing downstream on what is the world's seventh longest river . Rescue worker Irakli Golubov said: 'It was not possible to use a vessel because it could have been sunk by the huge chunks of ice that were crashing around, so we had to get a helicopter in to rescue him. 'It was extremely foolish and dangerous not just for the man but for rescuers as well.' Aksyonov was eventually airlifted to safety and returned to his home where he lives with his mother. He was unhurt in the incident but faces a fine, although no criminal charges are likely.","Cyril Aksyonov climbed on to ice floe in Ob River in western Siberia, Russia .

'Another house just up the road sold for around $1,902,500 just a month ago,' Mr Dunn said.

"If you're still holding out hope that you might be part of the 'millionaires' club' one day, then you may be disappointed by a new report which claims the average Aussie  takes 97 years to hit the big money. While Australia has over one million millionaires in the country, the situation is pretty bleak for ambitious fat-cats. According to the report, the median Australian adult was worth more than $200,000 in June 2012, the highest in the world for the fifth consecutive year. While Australia has over one million millionaires in the country, the situation is pretty bleak for ambitious Gina Rinehart wannabes . However, despite our financial stature on the world map, the latest Global Wealth Report from Credit Suisse, is sure to put a dampener on aspiring Australian's, who were hoping to be part of the glitterati one day. Money expert, Michelle Hutchinson from finder.com.au, says many Australians would struggle to enter the millionaires market, going by current statistics and trends. 'The average Australian adult earns $1,516.90 per week and saves just 9.4 percent, which is worth an average of $142.60 in savings per week,' Ms Hutchinson said. According to the report, the median Australian adult was worth more than $200,000 in June 2012, the highest in the world for the fifth consecutive year . The site's Millionaire Calculator estimates that an average 30-year-old Aussie who is saving $142.50 per week would take 97 years to become a millionaire. The financier praised Australians who were growing richer and recognised Australia's rank compared to many other nations  however she believes it is becoming harder for Australians to save. Interestingly, those who live in a capital city are likely to save 21 percent more than those living outside capital cities. 'Many Australians are growing richer and it's great to see that we rank high compared to many other nations, she said. Finder's Millionaire Calculator estimates that an average 30-year-old Aussie who is saving $142.50 per week would take 97 years to become a millionaire . 'There are a lot of Australians who would struggle to reach the 'millionaire's club', with the wealthiest 20 percent of households in Australia accounting for almost two-thirds (61 percent) of total household net worth – an average net worth of $2.2 million per household. Not surprisingly, baby boomers are the wealthiest people of the nation. In 2011-12, households aged between 55 and 59 years  held the highest average net worth of just over $1 million. This was put down to the fact that many of the people in this age bracket were nearing the end of their time in the labour force or had recently retired. Ms Hutchinson urges potential millionaires to invest their money wisely and take a hard look at their savings accounts. Not surprisingly, baby boomers are the wealthiest people of the nation . 'If you are 25 years-old and have $10,000 sitting in your transaction account earning next to no interest, and you save $1000 per month, it will take you about 79 years to reach millionaire status. However, if you had your savings in an average savings account with 3 percent interest (using the same scenario), you would be a millionaire in 41 years – that's about half the time compared to saving with no interest earned,' she said. 'So it's important to make the most of your savings and consider using a high interest savings account or add it to your home loan,' she continued. In 2011-12, households aged between 55 and 59 years held the highest average net worth of just over $1 million .","A new report shows over one million Australians are in the 'millionaires club'

"Thailand's police chief has insisted that the Burmese men held for the murder of two British tourists did not confess to the crimes under duress. General Somyot Poompanmuang defended the arrest of the two Myanmar workers, saying that officials involved in the case had done a 'perfect job' - despite concerns the men had been tortured into making a confession. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, after being bludgeoned to death on September 15. The suspects, who have been identified only as Saw Rim (left) and Win (right), both 21, have been charged with the murder of both Britons and the rape of Miss Witheridge . Thai national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung speaks during a press conference in Bankok . Last week, police said the Burmese men had admitted to killing the tourists and DNA found on Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects. Mr Miller died from drowning and blows to the head, while Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds. The suspects, who have been identified only as Saw Rim and Win, both 21, have been charged with the murder of both Britons and the rape of Miss Witheridge. If found guilty, they could face the death penalty. 'I insist that all officials in this case have done a good job. A perfect job,' the national police chief told a news conference in Bangkok. But a lawyer contracted by Myanmar's embassy in Thailand to defend the suspects said the case was a 'set-up and not based on hard facts', according to the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent Myanmar news organisation based in Norway. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, (left) and David Miller (right), 24, were found on September 15. Autopsies showed that Miss Witheridge died from head wounds while Mr Miller suffered  blows to the head and drowned . 'From what we have learned, there are inconsistencies with both the forensic report and evidence provided in the case,' the lawyer, Aung Myo Thant, was quoted as saying. He was not available for comment. But Thai police stressed the importance of their DNA evidence. 'DNA found on the deceased's body matches the suspects,' said Police Major General Suwat Chaengyodsuk, the officer who led the investigation. 'This is something that cannot be denied.' Police said a mobile phone belonging to Mr Miller was also found on Saw. A third Myanmar migrant worker is in police custody but has not been charged. Some rights groups have voiced concern over accusations of abuse during the investigation. Displaying little obvious emotion as they stood on the Koh Tao beach where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found bludgeoned to death, the men gave officers detailed information of the killings . 'A number of serious allegations of physical abuse against Myanmar workers as part of the questioning process in this murder case have been raised to us,' said Andy Hall, a rights activist and researcher based in Thailand. 'The accusations do not concern the two or three persons currently detained for the murder. 'We do not have enough evidence or information at this stage to comment on how or if the two accused have been scapegoated for this crime or not.' Migrant workers often face discrimination in Thailand and have been used as scapegoats for crimes before. But police denied using force during their interrogation. 'I confirm that there was no abuse of any of the suspects,' said lead investigator General Suwat. Last week, were paraded by police and used in a bizarre re-enactment of the crime on a Thai beach. They wore white motorcycle helmets and handcuffs for the reconstruction – a common practice in Thai murder cases. The two Burmese workers, Saw (left) and Win (right), sit and pray together escroted by a police officer . The two Burmese bar workers said to have confessed to murdering Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were caught on CCTV riding a moped on Koh Tao on the night of the killing. It is not known which of the three they are . Crowds of onlookers watched as the two Burmese labourers replayed the murders, one holding a dustpan in place of the alleged weapon – a garden hoe. Police lieutenant general Decha Butrnamphech said: ‘I am very satisfied with the investigation.’ Two years ago, Thai police said they would stop public reconstructions of crimes using alleged perpetrators after complaints that they prejudiced trials – but they resumed after a few months. The reconstruction follows weeks of pressure on police to find the murderers of the British backpackers. There has also been growing criticism over the standard of the investigation, from not sealing off the crime scene quickly enough to letting potential suspects leave the island. The killings have dented Thailand's image as a happy-go-lucky holiday paradise. They come after the tourism industry, which contributes almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product, was already battered by months of political protest, a May 22 coup and military rule.","Police defended arrest of suspects, insisting officials had done a 'perfect job'

"Boris Johnson yesterday piled the pressure on David Cameron over Europe by saying the PM’s bid to wrest back powers from Brussels should be ‘easy’. A day after launching his audacious bid to return to Parliament, the London Mayor appeared to set Mr Cameron up to fail by saying there was little to prevent success in his European negotiations. Senior Tories fear Mr Johnson is setting a ‘trap’ by demanding a string of unachievable reforms before he would agree to support continued membership of the European Union. Scroll down for video . It's a bit smaller than my one: Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson looks around a double decker caravan with a 'stately home' style interior during his visit to Sutton House in Hackney, north London . In a wide-ranging interview, the Mayor also hinted at his ambitions to ‘run government’ and insisted he has become more serious since he first became mayor. Mr Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that he is looking for a Commons seat in what is being seen as a springboard for a future leadership bid. Most of the speculation has been around the recently-vacated safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in West London. Friends said last night that Mr Johnson was still mulling his options and that he had around ten days to submit his application. But it was reported that Tories in Uxbridge were expecting Mr Johnson’s application to arrive within the next 48 hours – perhaps as soon as today. Other constituency options for Mr Johnson, who takes two weeks’ holiday from today, include Hertsmere and Kensington and Chelsea. David Cameron on holiday with his wife on Tuesday: The Prime Minister has promised an in/out referendum on European Union membership in 2017 . Mr Cameron has promised an in/out referendum in 2017, after he has brought back powers such as a crackdown on benefit tourism. But on Wednesday, Mr Johnson demanded even more – including renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is highly unlikely to be agreed by other EU leaders. And he suggested that if he does not get the reforms he wants, he will not be happy to support staying in Europe in 2017. He told the London Evening Standard yesterday: ‘I think you could easily [secure changes by 2017]. ‘There is no reason why an intergovernmental conference to settle all those points shouldn’t be done in that space of time.’ Mr Johnson added that the Prime Minister needed to be tough by ‘going in hard and low’ in talks to succeed. But he denied sabotaging Mr Cameron, saying: ‘I believe what I’m doing is simply amplifying what Dave has said.’ Amid criticism from some Tories about his conduct when he was last an MP, Mr Johnson insisted that he was now a ‘totally different’ person. When he was last in Westminster, he sparked a row with Jamie Oliver, upset the people of Liverpool and was forced to resign over allegations he had an affair. But he insisted: ‘I think I understand the business of government pretty well now.’ Mr Johnson, who if successful will spend a year as both mayor and an MP before his City Hall term ends in 2016, also made a number of statements suggesting he had a vision for ruling the entire country. ‘I want a country that is open, optimistic, generous, where people have a sense of opportunity,’ he said. But yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the mayor’s ‘bumbliness’ was a front to disguise his ruthless ambition. ‘He treats his political ambition like he treats his hair,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘He wants everyone to think he does not care but actually he really, really does care.’ But yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the mayor’s ‘bumbliness’ was a front to disguise his ruthless ambition. ‘He treats his political ambition like he treats his hair,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘He wants everyone to think he does not care but actually he really, really does care.’ A number of Tory backbenchers fear Boris Johnson could prove a ‘disruptive influence’ in the run-up to the general election. Some have questioned his previous performance as a shadow minister, while others warn they are turned off by his liberal views on immigration. Mark Field, MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, told BBC Radio 4’s World Tonight: ‘I think he has a great track record, but there are some of the old guard who think that he did not make much of an impact last time.’ And Eurosceptics are not happy with his stance on immigration. Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, said: ‘He does need to take a harder line on immigration. An amnesty is a crackpot policy and you can’t sell it on the doorstep; it would be a disaster. On whether he would be a good leader, Mr Jackson said: ‘I’m not caught up in Boris mania: he needs to get a seat first, but he’s an asset.’ A poll of grassroots Tory voters for the ConHome website found Mr Johnson had a popularity rating of 83.3 per cent– just above Chancellor George Osborne on 83. But one senior Tory said: ‘While he is popular generally, it is not clear that there is a lot of support for Boris among many Tory MPs. ‘Many remember his performance as a shadow minister, where some thought he was…not taking the role seriously enough.’","London Mayor sets Cameron up to fail by boosting his chances in EU talks .

"The Duke student-turned-porn-star defended her choice to make adult films today saying that she was taking a stand for her sexuality and that she had watched porn since she was 12 years old. 'Belle Knox', 18, took questions on talk show The View on Monday after her burgeoning porn career was outed by a fellow student at the prestigious school last month. Miriam Weeks said that making adult movies - she has starred in around 30 films so far -left her feeling empowered. She said: 'For centuries, sex workers have been the untouchables of society. I'm sick of it, I'm taking a stand against it.' Scroll down for video . Miriam Weeks, 18, aka porn star 'Belle Knox' is a student at Duke University. She appeared on The View on Monday to defend her choice to be an adult porn star . First porn star on The View: 'Belle Knox' said she felt like Sherri Shepherd (second from right) was judging her during her appearance on The View on Monday . The 18-year-old, whose real name is Miriam Weeks, has caused nationwide . uproar and family heartache, was raised a devout Catholic in . a loving home in Spokane, Washington. Miriam’s Catholic father Kevin and . mother Harcharan, reportedly have been ‘floored’ by their daughter’s decision to . turn to porn to fund her $60,000-a-year education at the . elite school. Miss . Weeks said today that her parents were not aware of her decision to . enter the porn industry but are now 'absolutely supportive' of her choice. She added: 'We tell our children through school and socialization that sexuality is bad' before adding to the shock of the panelists that she had been watching online porn alone since the age of 12. Miss Weeks has explained that she entered the porn industry to pay for her $60,000-a-year tuition at Duke. The teenager makes around $1,000-$1,500 for each film she stars in. When asked by Barbara Walters why she could not work at something else to help pay her way through college, she replied: 'I'm an 18-year-old without a college degree. Any other job would not have footed the bill.' She described her career in porn as 'empowering' because it allowed her to make decisions in a 'safe, controlled environment'. Exposed: A fellow student outed Duke University porn star Belle Knox. Her real name is Miriam Weeks, 18, from Spokane, Washington, and was an A-grade student at the $11,000-a-year Jesuit prep school she attended . However she admitted that life at Duke has been difficult since her porn career was made public. She said: 'I have received numerous death threats, people threatened to throw garbage on me. There are petitions online to have me expelled from Duke. It's been a hostile, unsafe, unwelcoming  environment.' However Miss Weeks remained upbeat saying that she plans to graduate from Duke with her class and wants to become a lawyer for civil rights, particularly women's rights. She is unsure whether she will continue in her porn career after college. A family member told MailOnline exclusively last week that despite the shock, the teenager won't be abandoned by her parents. Amanda . Minor, the mother-in-law of Miriam’s brother Paul, told MailOnline: . ‘This is a tragedy in the family.  The father is one of the best human . beings I’ve ever met. He is just back from Afghanistan; he served his . country, how awesome is that? ‘He’s . so proud of his daughter; there’s no way they could have known this was . going on. It’s terrible. But they would never abandon their daughter. This is a nightmare what the family are going through.’ Last week, Miriam had claimed in interviews that her parents had only themselves to blame for her decision. 'The financial aid that I was given to . pay for my tuition was insufficient and just really an enormous . financial burden on my family,' she said. Shocked: Dr Kevin Weeks returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan to discover his daughter was making X-rated films to fund her college studies. He and his wife Harcharan are heartbroken over what Miriam is doing . Several relatives, friends and associates of the family interviewed by MailOnline painted a picture of an extremely devoted couple who have only wanted the best for their three children, Miriam, sister Anita, 20, and brother Paul, 22. Kevin, 54, and Harcharan, 48, were dumbfounded when they learned that their daughter was a porn actress just 24 hours before the news broke. In their suburban home in Spokane, 250 miles east of Seattle, the couple was slowly coming to grips with their daughter’s new lifestyle. Mr Weeks, a religious Catholic, is an esteemed doctor at the Mann Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, which deals only with war veterans. His Indian wife comes from a culture where pornography is generally vilified. Educating their children and setting them . on the right path meant everything to them, say family members, and . their financial outlay on their children’s education has been . staggering, even on Dr Weeks’s six-figure salary. Grin and bare it: Even before emarking on her new career, sexy Miriam like to show off . All the children, including Miriam, attended Gonzaga Prep School in Spokane, a Jesuit school known for its high academic and sporting achievements. Tuition is about $11,000 a year. It was well worth the outlay. Miriam was a straight A ‘genius’ student. She was given the ‘Spokane Scholar’ in Foreign Languages during her final school year, 2012-13. It’s hardly surprising that out of 38,000 applicants, Miriam Weeks was one of just over 3,000 students admitted to prestigious Duke University. A doctor of Miriam’s father’s standing would earn in excess of $200,000 a year plus deployment pay. It’s believed that Mrs Weeks is not working right now. Putting three children through private schools and college would cost over $1 million. As Miriam herself said in an interview with the website www.realcleareducation: ‘I have siblings in college, who are being supported by my parents, and my parents are paying $1,000 a month just for their own student loans and my dad graduated 20 years ago. 'One of my parents is recently unemployed. I was offered $13,000 in financial aid. That wasn't enough -- that's $47,000 still unaccounted for.’ The couple also recently moved to a new house on a private estate in Spokane. They bought their four-bedroom home costing $477,730, but they are burdened with a substantial mortgage of $460,607. In all likelihood, friends conclude, the family are going through financial hardship and cut Miriam’s funding because they couldn’t afford the tuition fees and the living expenses, which total in excess of $6,000 a month. But many who know the Weeks say that talk of them simply abandoning their child is ridiculous, which rings true considering how much Miriam backed off her initial claims of financial abandonment. As one family member says: ‘The more interviews she did, the more the truth came out that the family didn’t cut her funding. She just said that paying such a large amount would be a strain on any family, but it’s hard to see they’d abandoned her. ‘It seems more reasonable to suspect that she didn’t tell the family the truth as to how little aid she was getting from Duke. Ironically, she may have been trying to protect them from further financial pain,’ said one source. John Steven’s, Miriam’s agent who spoke to MailOnline, insists her family is at fault for all of this. He says: ‘She’s not done anything wrong. Her parents have cut her off financially. In the first semester, her parents worked out a payment plan with the university for tuition of $5,000 a month. But that lasted until the month of January, and then they cut her off. ‘So starting February 1, she owed the school $5,000 a month. Where is an 18-year-old girl supposed to get that?’ Steven, who runs Matrix Models in Beverly Hills, said he had ‘Belle Knox’ booked up for four days solid of shoots in New York, Phoenix and Los Angeles during the media frenzy. No regrets: Her agent insisted to MailOnline that she is 'level-headed, intelligent' and 'never regretted doing porn'. For now, at least . Smackdown: Miriam smooches with a fellow porn star, a prelude of more to come in one of her racy  flicks . ‘If she hadn’t done porn, she’d have . been thrown out of school, as she would have missed the monthly . payments. I have no idea why they cut her off, as far as I know her . parents were running into financial problems. ‘She . makes a lot of money from porn. She could easily make $10-15,000 a . month, that’s for multiple shoots. She gets $1,500-2,000 per shoot, then . I get a cut, which is less than 20 percent and then it’s taxed. It’s a . legitimate business I run. ‘She . simply had to make a decision whether she wanted to continue with her . college career or drop out of school.

"'@freyanewman' trended in Sydney on Thursday, with hundreds of Australians voicing their opinions on Twitter as Australian university student Freya Newman fronted court. The 21-year-old pleaded guilty to accessing files with restricted details regarding Tony Abbott's daughter Frances' $60,000 university scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design. However - those hundreds of people were sending their tweets to the wrong Freya Newman. On Thursday @freyanewman 'trended' on Twitter, meaning a high volume of tweets were using the term . Hundreds of Twitter users used the handle @freyanewman to tweet about the court case in which Australian Freya Newman pleaded guilty to accessing files with restricted details regarding Tony Abbott's daughter Frances' $60,000 university scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design . A completely unrelated 'Freya Newman' from Bath in England was inundated with tweets and begged for a reprieve, explaining the mix up was causing her phone to crash . A young woman of the same name on the other side of the world was bewildered when tweets starting flooding in, using her Twitter handle to discuss Thursday's court case. Soon, the volume of tweets was so high that the notifications started to 'crash' Ms Newman's phone. 'hi im sorry but you've got the wrong freya newman, would love if u could (retweet) this cus the notifications are crashing my phone', Ms Newman tweeted from Somerest in England. A Twitter photo of the English Freya Newman who has nothing to do with the Francis Abbott court case, but had her Twitter account mistaken for the Australian involved, also named Freya Newman . The real Freya Newman, 21, appeared at Sydney's Downing Centre Court on Thursday  for hacking a computer to leak details about Frances Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at the Whitehouse Institute of Design . The English Freya Newman was also inundated with messages on Facebook, but was quick to see the funny side of the situation. 'such nice supportive messages from strangers on facebook x' she tweeted. Freya Newman was also sent good-intentioned but misdirected support messages on Facebook . Freya Newman saw the funny side of the sitution, tweeting 'such nice supportive messages from strangers on Facebook x' Her tweet was accompanied by screenshots of Facebook messages from well-intentioned but slightly off-the-mark people, wishing her the best for the trial. 'I think a poor woman in Bath's phone is melting down!' tweeted a cluey Aussie. Some Twitter users realised the wrong Freya Newman was on the receiving end of the tweets . Twitter users joke about the Bath resident being flooded with what must have seemed like tweets . One Twitter user was quick to make sure @freyanewman didn't feel left out, bidding her a good day . However, many are still continuing to direct their messages to the baffled Brit. One kind Twitter user decided to send a message to the English Freya Newman, just so she didn't feel left out. '@freyanewman hey I know you aren't the whistleblower we're all supporting but I hope you have a nice day anyway' Mason McCann tweeted. The Aussie Freya Newman is believed to not be on Social Media. An selection of the many tweets that @freyanewman was notified of - much to her confusement . The university student will have to wait another month to find out her fate. She was due to be sentenced on Thursday, but Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan adjourned her sentencing until November 25 after submissions from the defence and prosecution. Scroll down for video . Newman, who studies communications at the University of Technology Sydney, pleaded guilty in September to accessing restricted data. She then handed the information to journalists . Ms Newman's lawyer Tony Payne SC, who was representing her for free, asked the Magistrate not to record a conviction. 'Freya suffered and continues to suffer the consequences for the rest of her (life),' he told the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. He said the 21-year-old suffered anxiety due to the media attention the case had attracted and added that future jobs and travel would potentially be affected if a conviction was recorded. 'A sense of injustice motivated Ms Newman, not greed or a desire for notoriety or to embarrass Ms Abbott,' Mr Payne said. 'She was not aware that her actions were against the law or that her identity would become known.' The prosecution agreed the offence wasn't done for personal gain or notoriety but out of a sense of social justice and public interest. Newman accessed the files about a $60,000 Whitehouse Design Institute scholarship given to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter Frances in 2011 . The Hunters Hill woman was a casual library assistant at the fashion and design college where Ms Abbott studied and used her position to access information about her enrolment. Ms Newman used the log-in and password of another staff member on May 20 to access Ms Abbott's details through the student record system, according to court documents. The documents allege she then emailed two other employees at the private design school saying '... there's a bit about Frances meeting with Leanne J, the CEO of Whitehouse Institute on February 21, 2011 and then receiving a Managing Director's Scholarship three days later'. 'Got em. Might go meet Chris now to talk tactics.' The following day, a story headlined Leaked Documents Cast Doubt on Abbott's $60,000 Scholarship Claims was published on news website New Matilda, written by Chris Graham. Newman, who lives in Hunters Hill, was a casual library assistant at the  college where Ms Abbott studied . Ms Newman used the log-in and password of another staff member on May 20 to access Ms Abbott's details through the student record system, according to court documents . A handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing . No sensitive data was accessed and no information about any other student was viewed during the 103 minutes Ms Newman was in the database, Mr Payne told the court. She also committed the offence in the full knowledge she was under CCTV surveillance, admitted what she had done to her employer and resigned the following day, he said. But the prosecution argued a conviction should be recorded to deter anyone else from committing the offence. Ms Newman's family and supporters were packed into the court room and rallied around the student as she left. She faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Groups voicing solidarity for Newman have sprung up on Facebook and a handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing. Outside, neither Ms Newman, her parents nor Mr Payne commented. Ms Newman's will return to the same court on November 25. Newman later emailed two other employees at the college saying she had to meet Chris to talk tactics. The next day, a story was published on news website New Matilda written by Chris Graham .

"The boss of the countrywide pub chain JD Wetherspoon has said Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurants are pushing street rents up and forcing pubs out of business. Tim Martin, chairman of pub chain, says the willingness of Jamie’s Italian, the restaurant group founded by the high-profile celebrity chef, to accept high rent costs is causing rents for other operators to be pushed up. The scathing attack on Jamie Oliver came a week after Wetherspoons announced it had closed five pubs in the ten weeks to July 6, including a site at Finchley’s 02 Centre in north-west London. Tim Martin (left) who is the boss of the countrywide pub chain JD Wetherspoon has said the Italian resturant chain owned by Jamie Oliver (right) are pushing street rents up and forcing pubs to close . Mr Martin told The Publican’s Morning Advertiser’s sister titel M&C Report: 'It’s a pub we have had for years with sales well above average, but with the higher rents it was not working out for us. 'We’re wary of open-market rent reviews and normally never agree to them. In fact, we don’t agree to them now; we normally have fixed uplifts in our rental agreements so we at least know where we are. 'You have to be very careful, particularly in central London,' he said. Mr Martin said that there had been 'virtually no rental increases' in the past five or six years even at sites with upward-only rent reviews. Inside: The restaurant chain comprises of more than 40 restaurants across the UK . 'The only one you have to be careful of around the country is Jamie Oliver, because in general he seems to agree to higher rents in several locations that are pushing up the rents for other people. 'My advice for Oliver is: Be careful, son. You’re an excellent cook, but do you know about rent reviews or understand the property market?' The restaurant chain - Jamie’s Italian - currently comprises of more than 40 restaurants across the UK along with some overseas establishments. The boss of the countrywide pub chain JD Wetherspoon has said Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurants are pushing street rents up . Jamie’s Italian was founded in Oxford in 2008 and was inspired by the chef's love of the Italian way of life. On his website, he writes: 'Since I was a teenager I’ve been totally besotted by the love, passion and verve for food, family and life itself that just about all Italian people have, no matter where they’re from or how rich or poor they might be. 'And that’s what I’m passionate about – good food for everyone, no matter what. But the thing I love most about the Italians is that somehow, although they have some of the best fashion designers and cars in the world, they’ve managed to retain a unique sense of tradition and village spirit'. The Publican’s Morning Advertiser said Jamie’s Italian declined to comment.

"From 3D sets, to televisions with curved screens - it may seem as if there is already a TV to suit any living room. But Google is reportedly working on screens that fit seamlessly together - potentially making the days of having to pick the perfect sized screen to fit a given space a thing of the past. The search giant said the screens would fit seamlessly together in a similar way to Lego bricks, and won't have a surrounding bezel, like current smartphones and tablets. Scroll down for video . Google is reportedly working on screens that can fit seamlessly together to create a larger ones. Its modular system would be different to video walls (illustrated) which show different images on different screens with spaces between them . Engineers at the Google X lab, in California, which is also responsible for the company’s self-driving car, are working on the new screens, The Wall Street Journal reported. It is rumoured that the screens could be put together to form different shapes, enabling users to watch films on a large widescreen, before reassembling the screen blocks to view a document in portrait format, or simply choosing to use one of them as a smaller screen. The project is at an early stage as the experts at Google try to work out how to makes screens without bezels that can connect together seamlessly, and work as one large screen. It is reportedly being led by Mary Lou Jepsen, co-founder of One Laptop Per Child. It appears that Google believes the future is likely to be modular, because the company is already working on Project Ara smartphones (pictured), where components clip together. They could be ready for consumers to buy in January . According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger phones will be able to accommodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. The phone is set to be available in January 2015 with prices starting from just $50 (£31).

"Brutal: Andrew Bullock, 19, of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, was jailed for up to 37 years for raping an 85-year-old nun behind a church . An 85-year-old western Pennsylvania nun issued a statement forgiving the man who raped her  as the judge sentenced the 19-year-old to between 18½ and 37 years in prison. The victim didn't appear in a Beaver County courtroom when Andrew Bullock, of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, was sentenced Wednesday. Rather, another sister read a statement on the victim's behalf. The letter sent by the woman who is part of, Sisters of St. Jospeh, says: 'My profound and permanent prayer for you, Andrew, is that you wholeheartedly take advantage of the educational, uplifting, socially positive opportunities that may be available during your prison time.' In a victim impact statement she wrote that she could forgive Bullock with the grace of God. The nun was 85 when Bullock approached her at a recycling bin behind St. Titus Church in Aliquippa on December 13, 2013. After offering to help her load some newspapers, he exposed himself, punched the nun in the jaw and knocked her face-down while raping and screaming at her. During a preliminary hearing, the victim told a magistrate that she thought she was going to die during the attack. In the first half of the letter she states that prior to the assault she didn't fully understand the meaning of the word 'terror' and now she finds it difficult to sleep. The victim also described how when someone unexpectedly approaches her 'a single second of cold fear rips through me'. Members of Bullock's family were in the courtroom when the sentence was handed down and they said they hoped the victim would find closure. Nadine Toliver, Bullock's stepsister told WTAE: 'We feel bad for her and her family, and that maybe now she can find some closure.'But, I do want to apologize for her about what happened.' Forgiveness: In the letter, the 85-year-old victim says that she forgives Bullock by 'God's merciful grace'. She also describes the lasting impact the attack has had on her . Attack: Bullock asked the victim for help loading newspapers before punching her in the jaw and holding her down behind the St. Titus Church in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, last December . Another stepsister Marjorie Jackson added: 'I can't even begin to wonder why or how he done it,' That's not the brother that I knew.' Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Popovich told the station: 'While they speak of forgiveness, there is still a place for punishment and that is what I believe we’ve seen here today in court.' Judge Harry Knafelc also deemed Bullock a sexually violent predator . This means when Bullock is released he will have to take part in monthly counseling sessions for the rest of his life and register his address on the Megan's Law website. Support: A statement from the Sisters of St. Joseph of Baden, Pennsylvania, says the 'sister' asks for 'continued prayers for her and for Andrew Bullock . Future: Bullock (pictured left at time of attack and right in court on Wednesday) was deemed a violent sexual predator and, following his release, will have to attend monthly counselling sessions for the rest of his life .

"A New Zealand mother, dubbed the Black Widow for murdering her husband, has been ordered to pay compensation from behind bars after she sent herself a series of abusive text messages and then tried to frame her son, leading to him being falsely imprisoned. Helen Milner, 50, will have to pay Adam Kearns, 23, $55,000 after the High Court in Christchurch, New Zealand, deemed her actions to be 'outrageous and calculated', and designed to put her son behind bars. The New Zealand Herald reported that in April 2010, Milner informed police that Mr Kearns had sent her and his ex girlfriend, Kasey Woodstock, death threats. 'Black Widow' murderer Helen Milner (pictured), will have to pay her son, Adam Kearns, $55,000 after she framed him and he was sent to jail . Adam Kearns (pictured) launched civil action against his mother Helen Milner, claiming 'hurt, distress, humiliation' and financial loss from being put in jail from being framed by her . She told officers her son, who was thought to have breached a protection order, was 'extremely aggressive' and that she feared for her safety. Mr Kearns was held in custody for more than a fortnight before it was revealed Milner actually sent the bogus messages herself but were made to look like they were from her son. The discovery saw Mr Kearns launch civil action, claiming 'hurt, distress, humiliation' and financial loss from being put in jail. Milner is currently serving a life sentence in jail for the murder of her husband Phillip James Nisbet in 2009. She was found to have poisoned her husband's dinner by mixing in the drug Phenergan and then may have suffocated him once he was sedated. Milner also tried to present Mr Nisbet's murder as a suicide attempt and fabricated several notes and a suicide cellphone text to deceive his family, friends and police and cover her tracks. It's believed she was motivated by her husband's $250,000 life insurance policy. To this day, Milner still proclaims her innocence and is currently trying to appeal against her conviction through New Zealand's supreme court. Adam kearns' lawyer told the court, Helen Milner's action against her son, forcing him to serve time in jail, were 'wicked' Rhys Nisbet (pictured left), Lee-Ann Cartier (middle) and Andrew Nisbet (pictured right), family of Philip Nisbet. Helen Milner is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of her husband Phillip Nisbet in 2009 . Mr Kearns lawyer Kerry Cook, described the mother's behaviour as 'wicked'. 'Such conduct defies the supposed maternal bond between a mother and her child,' the New Zealand Herald reported Ms Cook telling the court. Justice Christian Whata, who described the case as clear cut, said Milner's conduct was 'outrageous and calculated', ruling her to pay her son compensation. 'It was a difficult step to take his mother to court, but as the judge said, she had framed him, and so he took an unusual step in what was an unusual case,' Ms Cook told the New Zealand Herald outside court. Mr Kearns was also glad the decision had finally given him some closure and he would be seeking to chase up the funds his mother owed him. 'She’s dead to me. I’ll never speak to her again,' he told stuff.co.nz .","Helen Milner, 50, has been ordered to pay her son, Adam Kearns, 23, $55,000 in compensation .

"James Lumley-Savile, pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court today, is the great-great grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough . An aristocrat is accused of threatening his girlfriend with a pair of kitchen knives because she made a joke about poisoning her father. James Lumley-Savile, great-great-grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough, allegedly flew into a rage after his partner made the quip. After grabbing the blades from the kitchen, the heir to the title Baron Savile is said to have waved them at her outside his £800,000 Fulham home. He then brandished the weapons at a taxi driver who was called by his terrified girlfriend, prosecutors claim. The cab driver drove away and called the police. Officers who later searched the 39-year-old Google employee’s west London address also found a small bag of cannabis in the property. Lumley-Savile, who appeared in the dock in a smart suit spoke only to confirm his identity during today’s brief hearing at Isleworth Crown Court. He is charged with two counts of possessing an offensive weapon and a third charge of possessing a Class B drug. Judge Phillip Matthews said: ‘Your next appearance will be on the 30 September at this court, in the meantime you remain on unconditional bail.’ His father, Eton-educated businessman and war hero Hon Henry Leoline Thornhill Lumley-Savile, was injured during the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 while a lieutenant with the Grenadier Guards. Lumley-Savile is descended from the Earls of Halifax and Scarborough and is part of one of the oldest landowning families in Yorkshire. He is set to inherit estates in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Recently Lumley-Savile sought planning permission to convert their hunting retreat, Walshaw Lodge in Hebden Bridge into a five-star twenty-bedroom hotel. Although the family’s ancestral seat in the town was sold in 2009 to pay inheritance tax, they still own almost 6,000 acres of land in the county. Lumley-Savile of Fulham will next appear in court on 30 September to formally enter his pleas.","James Lumley-Savile allegedly flew into a rage at his Fulham home after his partner made a joke about poisoning her father .

"Drones have been used in emergencies and to capture the scope of natural disasters, but what if it was the new and improved way to simply walk your dog? Dave Jansen and his Jack Russell terrier Tyler put 'drone dog walking' to the test at an oval near their Sydney home on Monday. Footage from the drone shows Tyler hilariously running around, much to the delight of his owner who stumbled across the potential dog walking technique by accident. Scroll down for video . Tyler the Jack Russell terrier tested out 'drone dog walking' on Monday at a Sydney park when his owner encouraged him to chase a remote-controlled quadcopter . 'The first weekend I took it out I noticed that my Tyler seemed to think it was a giant bird and he loves to chase birds. He was chasing after it and trying to jump and grab it,' Mr Jansen told Daily Mail Australia. 'So yesterday when I took him for a walk, I brought the quadcopter with me and let him chase it around the sports oval near my house. 'I thought it would make a fun video to point the camera at the ground and film him. I then simply tried to keep him in the centre of frame as best I could and keep the copter high enough that he couldn't actually catch it.' Dave Jansen, who stumbled across the dog walking technique by accident, filmed his dog Tyler hilariously running around the park with his tail wagging . Footage captured Tyler wagging his tail as he tried to jump up in pursuit of the remote controlled quadcopter, before he chased it across the length of the oval. While there are limitations on where you can use a quadcopter in Australia, Mr Jansen said it's an option he would consider using again at his local oval. 'It is a great option for giving him exercise. He certainly runs around more than a typical walk,' he said. Tyler chased the drone across the length of the park thinking it was a bird, his owner said .

Footage captured Tyler wagging his tail as he tried to jump up in pursuit of the remote controlled drone . 'It wasn't my initial thought to use it as a regular option but since the oval is at the end of my street, it will definitely be something I do on the weekend to keep him fit. 'He loves it. The trick is to keep it just out of his reach so he can't catch it and make sure he is sitting next to me on take off and landing. 'Quadcopters have spinning blades so I wanted to make sure he wouldn't have a chance to actually get near them. Thankfully he listens when told not to touch something.' Mr Jansen said Tyler ran around much more than he would on a typical walk and was considering using the quadcopter again . While there are limitations on where you can use a quadcopter in Australia, Mr Jansen said it's an option he would consider using again at his local oval . Mr Jansen said it wasn't his initial thought to use the drone as a regular exercise option as he was just trying to learn how to fly the quadcopter . Mr Jansen, who works for a public relations company, has been learning to fly a quadcopter over the past few weeks so he can train media to use them at an upcoming event launch for Western Digital. He also works as a music video director on weekends with his own company FunMonkey Media and has worked with the likes of English singer, Passenger.","Dave Jansen has put 'drone dog walking' to the test at a Sydney oval .

"Have you paid your credit card bill this month? An hour in the company of The Repo Man is enough to convince anyone never to buy anything ‘on tick’ again. You don’t want Sean James turning up on the doorstep to take your car away. A Gulf War veteran, 37 years old and built like the side of a Centurion tank, James has a no-nonsense approach to repossessions. In his tow-truck, James parks on the drive of a house where finance repayments haven’t been made. Reaching into a car as the driver pulls up, James grabs the keys, soaks up a barrage of abuse and then drives off with the vehicle in tow. It must feel like being mugged by a grizzly bear. Grizzly: Sean James in C4's The Repo Man . He doesn’t just take cars. If the payments are late, James will take anything — ‘teeth-whitening machines, stone crushers, walk-in chillers, foot-binding machines, we’ve done them all,’ he says. This doesn’t make him popular. James can’t see why — his victims borrowed money, and chose not to repay. He once collected a Range Rover from a luxury home, and was told by the indignant family: ‘We’ve just come back from a holiday at Disneyland, and now you’ve ruined it!’ And it’s not as if he uses excessive force. ‘People always think I take too much of a hard stance,’ he protests, ‘but they haven’t been run over, they haven’t been told: “We’re going to kill your kids.” ’ He seems to enjoy the rough and tumble of his job, which is handy since some debtors try vigorously to hang on to their goods, using baseball bats, golf clubs, hammers, pickaxe handles and even shotguns. In the cab of his tow truck, James lets off steam: he rants about the number of immigrant faces he saw last time he visited hospital, and the injustice of paying 20 per cent taxes. ‘We don’t live in a civilised country at all,’ he said bleakly. ‘The human race is s***.’ So it is surprising to watch him caring for his two sons at home, feeding the baby in his high-chair and building Lego spaceships with his older boy. He clearly dotes on them, and they worship him: ‘He’s like no other dad, he’s always there for me, he’s just really cool basically,’ says ten-year-old Lucas. And it’s even more unexpected when James reveals he has a second job: painting ‘muriels’, as he calls them, on children’s bedroom walls. The grizzly bear is just a big cuddly teddy — but don’t count on seeing his soft side if he comes for your car. The flash red Ferrari of education executive Lorraine Donegan might be at risk of repossession in Waterloo Road, as the school goes through one of its frequent financial sticky patches. The new term of this long-running drama was heaving with excitements — drug-taking, death threats, kidney failure and a 14-year-old having a sex change. And that was before break. My favourite scene harked back to more innocent days. Waiting for their English teacher to turn up in class, the pupils took a breather from peddling pills and realigning their genders, and chucked paper aeroplanes around instead. If someone could teach them how to flick ink pellets, this disaffected bunch might actually start to enjoy education. Not enjoyable: The Politician's Husband stars David Tennant and Emily Watson . There was nothing to enjoy about The Politician’s Husband. Like the Sunday night period drama The Village, this is a good story concept, ground down into a miserable grey paste. The characters are uniformly nasty, the cynicism is depressing and the bedroom scenes are brutal. And so much of it wasn’t credible. Why was David Tennant’s character, ex-Minister Aiden Hoynes, hanging around internet cafes in a hoodie, looking like a terrorist, when he could have sent his anonymous tweets from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone? Why did he stage his conspiratorial chats right under the Chief Whip’s nose? Most of all, after that hideous rape scene before the opening credits, why didn’t Emily Watson’s character crack him over the head with a wine bottle and kick him out of the house? ‘We can all do things we’re not proud of,’ Tennant muttered. And he said it like he was talking about this whole show.","The Repo Man, C4; Waterloo Road, BBC1; The Politician's Husband, BBC2 ."
"Huw Jones, 18, admitted drunkenly urinating on a war memorial in Porthmadog, Wales . A teenager who urinated on a war memorial was told by magistrates that ‘boys your age were being killed’ exactly 100 years ago. Huw Jones, who was spotted drunkenly relieving himself on the steps of the monument, could now face having to clean it as part of his punishment. The 18-year-old, who had been drinking heavily after a game of rugby, was given a stern lecture in court on the sacrifices made by his forefathers. ‘This was a disgusting offence on the community and the punishment must reflect that,’ Peter Lunt Williams told Jones when he appeared in court in north Wales on Monday. ‘This is a sensitive time – not only is it Remembrance Sunday at the weekend, but it is 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War when boys your age were being killed and injured in their thousands. ‘Last week we saw soldiers returning from Afghanistan and during that war many soldiers were killed and injured. ‘You should be ashamed of yourself and I am sure the community of Porthmadog are not happy at all. Although we can’t order it, we’d like to see you clean the war memorial.’ The memorial, which was erected in 1922, records the names of 156 men and women – several of them teenagers – who lost their lives in two world wars. It bears a moving verse by a Welsh poet that translates as: ‘Let there be everlasting memory of their costly brave work, for the freedom of the neighbourhood, the civilisation of the world.’ Police officers found Jones urinating on a wall at the war memorial on October 18, magistrates were told . Jones was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid worker and handed a weekend curfew, but will not be forced to clean the war memorial . Among the names is that of David Morris Williams, who was a 32-year-old cook on a merchant ship sunk by a German U-boat in the Bay of Biscay in April 1917. Last night his granddaughter, Carol Foster, who lives near Porthmadog, said: ‘I cannot understand the mentality of anyone who desecrates war memorials in this way, and I wonder whether people like this fully understand the significance of war memorials, or even care? Remembered in Porthmadog: Among the names on the memorial is David Morris Williams (above), who was a 32-year-old cook on a merchant ship sunk by a U-boat in 1917 [Picture: Courtesy History Points] . ‘I have only recently found out what my grandfather looked like, and also more about how he died during the First World War. The fact that his name is on the Porthmadog memorial means a huge amount to me.’ Diane Williams, prosecuting, told Caernarvon magistrates that PC Kevin Roberts saw Jones urinating on a wall at the top of the memorial steps on the afternoon of October 18. The jobless joiner admitted outraging public decency and was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work, put on a curfew for eight weeks and told to attend an alcohol counselling class. His solicitor, Carys Parry, said: ‘He had been drinking alcohol and did not think what he was doing. He did not mean to be disrespectful and apologises for what he has done.’ The hearing was adjourned while prosecutors seek a criminal behaviour order requiring him to clean the memorial regularly. Local poppy seller Ifan Buckley, 83, said: ‘They should have locked him up – or put him in the Army and let them teach him some respect. At 18, he’s old enough to know better.’ A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: ‘War memorials honour the memory of the British armed forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice and those who defend the freedom we enjoy. They deserve to be treated with the utmost respect.’ The memorial will form the centrepiece of Porthmadog’s Remembrance events this weekend. In 2009, student Philip Laing was told he had narrowly avoided being jailed after he was pictured urinating over poppy wreaths at a memorial in Sheffield after a drunken night out run by the infamous Carnage organisation.The 19-year-old was instead ordered to carry out community service. The minimum age to enlist in the Army during the First World War was 18 but many children lied about their age in order to join the fighting with the result that boys as young as 14 died in combat. According to one historian, 250,000 signed up for the Army despite being underage and many of them were sent home without seeing action when they were found out. Recruiting sergeants were paid two shillings and sixpence for everyone who enlisted following the outbreak of war, and with the minimum height being only 5ft 3in it was easy for taller teenagers to lie about their ages. Among those who slipped through the net was Sidney Lewis, who was just five months past his 12th birthday when he enlisted with the East Surrey Regiment in August 1915. He was fighting on the Somme by the age of 13. The youngest killed in action is believed to be Private John Condon who was also 12 when he lied about his age to recruiters in Waterford, Ireland. He died two years later in the Second Battle of Ypres and his grave is now among the most visited on the Western Front. Boys could be sent to sea by the Royal Navy when they were just 16, while the mercantile marine took them from even younger ages, facing the perils of the German U-boat campaign. The youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross was John Travers Cornwell from East London who was just 16 when he suffered fatal injuries at the Battle of Jutland in July 1916. The ‘boy first class’ had remained at his post on HMS Chester when it came under heavy shellfire from German cruisers. Analysis of First World War casualty records from one regiment found one in eight were killed when they were 19 – the most dangerous age – but 4 per cent were 18 or under.

"Police and relatives are baffled after a potential hostage situation and a fatal police standoff erupted from a motel room filled with people with no obvious connection to one another. Five people gathered at the Plaza Inn in Oklahoma City for an unknown reason on Wednesday afternoon - but a 911 hostage call led to a gun battle in which a woman died and four people were injured. Samantha Rae Monden, a 30-year-old mother of two, was allegedly taken captive and shot in the head by Shane Leon Rhea, 39, an ex-convict. Shootout: Shane Leon Rhea, left, has been charged with the murder of Samantha Rae Monden, right. He also allegedly shot another man in the back in a gunfight at an Oklahoma City motel on Wednesday . Another man, Randall Leon Williams, 57, was shot in the back. Two police officers who responded to the situation were shot in the arm. Bonnie Boen, 30, a former Zumba instructor, was also in the room, as was her boyfriend Erik Patterson, 29, according to police reports. Neither were injured, though both are in police custody, according to The Oklahoman. The situation - which is still surrounded in confusion - came to a head after a woman, whom police think is Bonnie Boen, called 911 to say she was being held captive. Scene: The mysterious encounter happened at the Plaza Inn motel, next to the I-35 freeway . When officers arrived at the scene, around 4.30pm, and approached the motel room to investigate, shots were fired from inside. Two officers, Sergeant Cody Koelsch and Sergeant Grant Brooks, were hit in the arm. Kolesch was also shot in the torso, but his bulletproof vest stopped the round. Reports from the surviving people in the room say Rhea, who has previous convictions of burglary, assault and battery, shot Williams in the back at this point. Police reports then describe how Rhea fled the room with Monden in tow - though it is not certain whether or not she was a hostage. He ran from the motel onto a service ramp for the I-35 freeway, and reportedly shot Monden in the head with a semi-automatic handgun. An officer then shot Rhea with a rifle, which he survived. Rhea was arrested on suspicion of murder, kidnapping and shooting with intent to kill. Involved: Bonnie Boen, left, and her boyfriend Erik Patterson, right, were also at the meeting. Both were put in jail over previous charges, though neither has been formally linked to the shooting . Boen and Patterson were also arrested, but over previous complaints. Neither has been charged over the shoot-out Wednesday. The motivations behind the meeting - and the subsequent gunfight - remain unclear. A cousin of Monden told the Oklahoman: 'Nobody has any idea why she was there. We don’t know. We don’t understand.' A spokesman for Oklahoma City police told reporters at an impromptu press conference after the incident that it was unclear how many shots were fired, by whom, or why the people had come together. However, it has been suggested that the meeting could have been to do with drugs. Boen's estranged husband, Joe Shaddix, said that Rhea, Patterson and Boen had met before, and that his wife has an amphetamine problem. He said: 'This was about drugs. There’s no doubt about it.'","Five people gathered Wednesday at motel room in Oklahoma City .

"Home to Gogglebox's 'posh couple', the £3.5million Salutation mansion in Kent is familiar to many as the chintzy pile where Dom and Steph Parker drink in front of the television. But on Saturday, it was the setting for an altogether different type of entertainment when a schoolfriend of Kate Middleton's held an exclusive, £500-a-ticket, sex party there. Only the 'sexual elite' were invited to the May Ball organised by the Killing Kittens private club, founded by Emma Sayle, who boarded at Downe House with the future Duchess of Cambridge. Scroll down for video . Sex: The Salutation, the £3.5million Kent mansion owned by Gogglebox's 'posh couple' was scene for orgy . Private club: The Killing Kittens website offers swingers the chance to 'interact with the world's sexual elite' Familiar: Viewers of Channel 4's Gogglebox know the mansion from watching Steph and Dom Parker . Killing Kittens sex club is run by Emma Sayle, above right, and right, a friend of the Duchess of Cambridge, left . Antiques: Bowls of condoms were laid outside beside the beds at Saturday night's Killing Kittens orgy . Swingers wearing masks and black tie parked their Ferraris and mingled in the seven-bedroom home designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens for champagne and oysters before the evening's real entertainment began. As the evening wore on, many of the 60 partygoers peeled off their dinner jackets and dresses and slipped into one of the bedrooms, or 'playrooms', to have sex with each other.  The beds were dressed only with sheets, while bowls of condoms were placed nearby. Those who didn't want to join in the orgy could watch, and the Sun's Jennifer Tippett said one couple had sex on an antique rocking horse while in another room, a grey-haired man wearing just his socks had sex with a woman. In one twin-bedded room, there were couples on both beds while others leant against antique furniture inches away. Invited to the sex party by its organiser, Miss Sayle, the reporter stayed for an hour before leaving as the orgy got into full swing. Set up nine years ago, Killing Kittens describes itself as 'the network for the sexual elite', dedicated to 'the pursuit of female pleasure'.  Membership is for those aged 20-45, while older swingers can become Silver Kittens. Desirable: The Lutyens-designed seven-bedroom mansion is for sale through Knight Frank for £3.5million . Viewers of Gogglebox enjoy watching the Parkers' wine-soaked television commentary from their chintzy sofa . The party at the Parkers' mansion was a Silver Kittens event, and Miss Sayle said the older members needed no encouragement. 'Tonight has got going quite quickly, normally it is around midnight before the action starts,' she said.  'The older crowd are comfortable in their skin. 'You can have loads of young girls who are lacking in confidence even though they are gorgeous, but our silver kittens ooze confidence and have a disposable income, too.' While alcohol was available, costing £17.40 for two glasses of white wine, red wine was banned to ensure the carpets at the historic home were not stained. Guests at the KK orgy arrived in black tie and enjoyed oysters and champagne before having sex . The Parkers, stars of Channel 4's hit show, were not believed to be at home when the orgy took place . Only couples or single women are allowed to attend Killing Kittens parties, with tickets for women going up to £60 per event and couples up to £500.  Masks are mandatory, but swingers are forbidden from taking phones to events to protect people's privacy. The Grade I-listed Salutation mansion, which the Parkers hire out at £1,700 for a night and also run as an upmarket B&B, is on the market for £3.5million as the Parkers are said to be keen to 'do something different'. Set within the medieval town of Sandwich, the property has gardens inspired by Gertrude Jekyll, as well as a coach house and three other smaller houses in the grounds. Neither Mr Parker, 49, nor his 47-year-old wife responded to MailOnline's request for a comment today, but they are believed not to have been present at the weekend's orgy, which was a corporate booking. No-one at Killing Kittens was available for comment.","Dom and Steph Parker's house, the Salutation, was hired out for sex party .

"A man who claims to be a missing telephone worker who vanished in 1990 is set for a court battle with the missing man's wife over his $300-a-month pension. Kwame Seku, 65, says that he was stricken with amnesia and found himself wandering the streets of San Diego with only a few dollars in his pocket and no idea who he was. But after years of searching, he claims he has realized his true identity - Winston Bright, a New Yorker and father of three who vanished for no reason. Dead or alive: Kwame Seku claims that he is Winston Bright, a telephone worker whom a New York court declared dead in 2000 . Seku, who adopted his current name after reading it in a magazine, built a new life in California but says he would occasionally remember fragments of his previous existence. He found out about Bright online and, he claims, realized that he was the man in question - despite the fact that a Manhattan court declared Bright dead in 2000. The declaration allowed Bright's widow, Leslie Bright, to collect her husband's pension from Verizon, with whom he had 20 years' service. Winston Bright went missing on October 12 1990. Bright recalled her husband calling her up from work at lunchtime, and again on he was home. But he never arrived. According to Seku's claims, his memory around that time is a complete blank, and his first clear recollection is finding himself wandering in California. Match? Winston Bright is pictured left in a missing person's poster issued shortly after he vanished . A judge there granted him a new identity. He qualified as a teacher and worked until his retirement, before remember his past life. Now Seku wants the court to affirm his identity so he can claim the Verizon pension for himself after discovering his past life - and the issue is set to be decided in court after his wife contributes to the case, the New York Daily News reported. Seku tried to overturn the declaration of death before and have himself recognized as Winston Bright - but the case was thrown out because he had no way to prove it. Wedding day: Leslie Bright is pictured above with her husband Winston when they married. She maintains that Seku is making up his claims, and will go to court to fight for her husband's pension . But, Seku claims, since then blood tests comparing his DNA with that of Bright's mother and his adult children have proved the link. However, in a court hearing Friday, Bright slammed her alleged husband as a 'scammer' who never attempted to provide any proof. Her children appeared to back up her claims. Judge Rita Mella of Manhattan Surrogate Court said that Bright has until November 14 to file a formal objection to Seku's request, which can then be officially decided.","Kwame Seku, 65, claims he is Winston Bright, who vanished in 1990 .

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila felt his side could have hit 10 goals as they swept aside St Mirren with a 4-1 victory at Parkhead. Deila's side moved six points clear in the Scottish Premiership after Scott Brown's early double helped put them 3-1 up inside 18 minutes. Celtic looked like running up a huge score as they went on to dominate after St Mirren's decent start but the hosts only hit the net once more, through Anthony Stokes. Ronny Deila (centre) shouts instructions to his team as Celtic ran out 4-1 winners against St Mirren . Stefan Johansen, John Guidetti and Nir Bitton and Stokes all came close and Stefan Scepovic missed a hat-trick of sitters after replacing the injured Swedish striker. Deila said: 'We are creating chances and that is positive. Also some of the attacks are the way I want to attack, with opposite movements and three players involved. 'There were some good attacks and we are playing more forward now as well. There is also a quick reaction to winning the ball back. 'There were a lot of pleasing things but again I was thinking 'is this enough? Should we be scoring more goals?' 'That's something we have to work on if we are going to improve - we need to be more clinical. 'It's hard sitting here and being critical when your're winning 4-1 and could have scored 10, but again that shows the potential in the team.' James Forrest, who scored Celtic's second goal, went off at half-time with a migraine while Guidetti limped off early in the second half. Jamie Forrest (right) slots in his team's second goal as Celtic cruised to victory in the Scottish Premiership . Scott Brown (centre) celebrates scoring Celtic's third goal in their 4-1 win against St Mirren at Parkhead . Deila said of the Swede: 'They have checked him and said they think it's just a kick but you never know so we will have to see. It was a tackle and if it was a twist or a hard tackle, I don't know.' Deila now turns his attention to the Europa League draw on Monday and he would prefer to avoid a rematch with Legia Warsaw, who knocked his side out of the Champions League qualifiers before a registration error saw the result reversed. 'They are a good team of course,' Deila said. 'They have won almost all their games. 'It will be a special game if that's the draw. Hopefully we get something else. The players will be up for the game whatever comes and if that's going to be Legia Warsaw, I don't think there's any problem.' Meanwhile, St Mirren caretaker manager Gary Teale saw enough attacking intent from his team to give him confidence ahead of Saturday's clash with fellow strugglers Motherwell. Sean Kelly equalised in the 10th minute but Kenny McLean should have opened the scoring in the first minute. Celtic striker John Guidetti (right) scored  but also had to limp off injured in the second half . Teale, who stepped in when Tommy Craig left in midweek, said: 'I take a lot of positives because of the chances we created. 'But the goals we concede are far too easy and I need to change the mentality on that because it can't continue. 'Celtic are always going to create chances but if we come here and create chances, then we know the confidence is going to come back.' Teale has thrown his hat into the ring for the job on a permanent basis. St Mirren caretaker manager Gary Teale was left ruing the easy goals that his team conceded against Celtic . 'It's something I'm confident I can do, and even if offered the job here I would be over the moon to accept,' he said. 'But that's not a decision for me. The whole experience has been a bit of a whirlwind and I have probably not slept. 'I'm sitting here is if I will be in charge next weekend, but that can obviously change.'","Celtic were 3-1 up against St Mirren inside 18 minutes at Parkhead .

"Police hunting alleged cop killer Eric Frein have found two potentially lethal pipe bombs hidden deep in the woods and believe that the three-week manhunt may be taking a toll on him. The bombs were covered in metal nuts designed as shrapnel said Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State Police on Tuesday. 'They could cause significant injury. They could be fatal,' said Bivens. The revelation came as the hunt for 31-year-old Frein reached its 18th day with no sign of coming to an early end. Scroll down for video . Found: The Pennsylvania State Police have discovered two pipe bombs in the Pennsylvania woods during their search for alleged cop killer Eric Frein. Both were working bombs and one was in a plastic bag . Where is he? Police have been searching for Frein for three weeks now after he shot dead a trooper and wounded another in Pennsylvania. They have revealed they have come across discarded pipe bombs . But Bivens said he is confident that Frein is getting desperate and careless, leaving behind items that he may need in a future battle with the police he has vowed to kill. The two bombs were not deployed, Bivens said, but they were fully functional and could be set off either by a fuse or a trip wire. One of them was in a plastic bag. 'It is typical of his non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance,' said Bivens. 'All of this indicates that we are putting significant pressure on him.' Bivens said he believes Frein left behind some items as cops move in. 'He abandoned them because he was under pressure. It was not from his own choosing,' he said. 'He may very well be looking for a fight. He already picked the fight.' Explosive experts in the Pennsylvania State Police are now examining the bombs. 'They have assured me they are fully functional devices,' Bevins added. Pushing on: At a press conference on Tuesday, Lt. Col. George Bivens points to the images of the pipe bombs. He said authorities believe he discarded them in panic because he knows police are closing in on him . Manhunt: Three U.S. Marshals patrol in Barrett Township, Pennsylvania on Monday as the search continues . Desperate: More than 1,000 officers are searching for Frein in the woods as the search enters its third week . Authorities believe his supplies are running out and he'll soon be looking for a way to escape the woods, possibly targeting nearby cabins, homes and stores. 'He's going to have to resort to getting supplies from there,' said Bivens. Bivens confirmed that Bryon Dickson, the 38-year-old father-of-two was was killed on September 12, had not been due to be on duty that night but swapped shifts with a colleague. Speaking directly to Frein - who police believe has a portable radio with him - Bivens urged him to surrender. 'Eric, you are clearly stressed,' he said. 'You are making mistakes. We continue to take your supplies and weapons. Our troopers resolve is very strong and we aren't going anywhere.' Frein is wanted for the ambush killing of Dickson, 38, who was shot late on September 12 as he left the Blooming Grove barracks at the end of his eight-hour shift. Troopers Nicole Palmer and Alex Douglass went to Dickson's aid as he lay dying and the sniper shot again, narrowly missing Palmer and hitting Douglass, 31, in the pelvis, critically injuring him. Bivens said Douglass is continuing to recover and should be out of hospital within days. One source told MailOnline that police had measured the distance from the trees where the shooter lay in wait and the spot where Dickson was hit at 83 yards. On Tuesday, the search for Frein seemed greatly scaled back a day after the focus of the manhunt shifted to an area of woods along the Brodhead Creek which runs through the picturesque Poconos village of Canadensis. Gunned down: Corporal Byron Dickson, left, was killed by Frein while Trooper Alex Douglas, right, was injured . All day Monday, officers looked in an area behind the Barrett Elementary Center, a school which closed last year. FBI officers on camouflage went in and out of land around the Pasold Farms Natural Preserve. But all they found was a married couple who had gone into the woods to get a closer look at the searchers. The couple was given a reprimand and hauled out of the search area. By Tuesday, officers had returned to the area around Snow Hill Road, where earlier Bivens had said they had Frein contained in a five-square mile area. Cops say Frein then made his getaway in a green 2001 Jeep but crashed it into a swamp two miles north of the barracks. They say he then made his way on foot 25 miles through dense forest back to the area close to the home he shared with his parents and teenage sister. Over the past week they have found an AK-47 that was missing from his home along with soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarette. Frein is known to have read survivalist literature that advises wearing a diaper to allow someone to remain in place over extended periods, leading to locals dubbing him the 'diaper sniper.' Escape: Frein is believed to have driven this jeep to a swampy area before abandoning it after the shooting on September 12. The vehicle was later found by the Pennsylvania State Police . Determined: Frein, pictured, has managed to elude his hunters and get outside police officers' perimeters . A heavy smoker, he was obsessed with Serbia, a country he has visited at least once. He was a member of a military simulation group called Istocni Vukj - Serbian for Eastern Wolves. Police are also understood to have recovered at least two pieces of Frein's clothing from the woods, one of which was a jacket found along with energy bar wrappers. Although Bivens would not say exactly what had been found he said a significant number' of items had been recovered. Cops had long thought there may be pipe bombs in the woods where Frein is hiding out. He is known to have experimented at his home in the two years leading up to the shootings. Bivens said officers have made a number of sightings of Frein dressed in dark clothing, the most recent within the past 24 hours. He said there have been occasions when Frein has managed to elude his hunters and managed to cross roads and get outside the perimeters that up to 1,000 officers have set up. Still looking: Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, pictured last week, says he believes the bombs were hastily discarded, suggesting that Frein is feeling pressure from the search . 'We have found a number of locations I believe he has stayed in, there has not been a bunker per se, but partially constructed shelters such as deer blinds,' he said. The search for Frein is about to get more complicated as bow hunting for deer in the woods is set to start on Saturday. Pennsylvania Game Commission spokesman Travis Lau said that assuming Frein is not captured overnight, hunting would be closed in the area of the search, which is teeming with hundreds of heavily armed law enforcement officers. Lau said the exact perimeter of the closure has not been finalized. Hunters have already been asked to keep an eye out for cabins or other structures that look like they've been tampered with or used by Frein. Officers have found several structures where they think the suspect has stayed, Bivens said, and police also know what Frein is eating and drinking. He would not provide specifics. Pennsylvania State Police confer along Snow Hill Road in Price Township, Pa, on Tuesday as the search for suspected killer Eric Frein carries on for the 18th day . Bivens said he didn't want to be 'overly dramatic' but the danger of Frein taking a hunter hostage was a possibility. 'The idea of having hunters in the woods does cause us some concern,' he said. 'But I don't believe we have the authority to prohibit people. There is a balance that has to be struck. Last week, police said a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years. The hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as 'how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival,' Bivens said. Police also were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month. Frein hung up after one ring. The FBI has added Frein to its 10 Most Wanted Fugitive List and announced a new reward for $100,000 for information leading to his capture. Crime Stoppers have also offered a $75,000 reward.","Police discovered two fully functional pipe bombs in the Pennsylvania woods that could have been set off by either a trip wire or a fuse .

"Australia beat India by 48 runs in a thrilling end to the first test at Adelaide Oval on Saturday, with Nathan Lyon picking up seven wickets after Virat Kohli scored an inspired century for the visitors. A match that had begun in high emotion after the death last month of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes ended in high drama after an absorbing final day in South Australia. Set 364 to win after Australia declared on their overnight score of 290-5, India seemed to be on their way to an unlikely victory after a brilliant 141 from Kohli and a gritty 99 from opener Murali Vijay. Nathan Lyon of Australia is mobbed by Australian team-mates as they celebrate winning the first Test . Lyon whirls away after taking the final wicket and earning his side the unlikeliest of wins against India . Lyon appeals as he takes the wicket of Murali Vijay with the game turning rapidly on day five . Lyon finished with stunning figures of 7 for 152 as India blew their advantage away on the final day . Virat Kohli trudges off after being dismissed during his first Test match as India captain . But Lyon, a former groundsman at Adelaide Oval, turned the match the home team's way with his offspinners, as India's tail collapsed and the tourists were bowled out for 315. Lyon finished with 7-152, giving him 12 wickets for the match, a career-best, and giving the Australians the early advantage in the four-match series, which resumes in Brisbane next week. Kohli, in his first match as Indian captain, almost won the match single-handledly for his country. He scored centuries in both innings and dominated Australia's bowlers on a pitch favouring spin. His career-best 141 came off just 175 deliveries and featured 16 fours and one six. He also shared a third wicket partnership of 185 with Vjay, who made half-centuries in each innings but fell agonisingly short of a deserved hundred. Kohli had been in brilliant knick, scoring a career-best 141 off just 175 balls as they chased victory . Kohli consoles Vijay as the opener threw his wicket away on 99 - the catalyst for a batting collapse . With India seemingly in control at 242-2 after tea, Vijay suddenly had an attack of nerves and threw his wicket away with a rash attempt to reach triple figures, trapped lbw by Lyon after swiping at the ball. His departure triggered a catastrophic batting collapse as India lost their last eight wickets for just 73 runs with Lyon the chief destroyer. Kohli continued to play a lone hand but when he mistimed a pull shot and was caught in the deep, the end came quickly for the visitors. Australia's win did come at cost, however, with captain Michael Clarke limping off the field with a hamstring problem that he said would likely keep him out for the remainder of the series.","Nathan Lyon takes a seven-wicket haul against India on day five .

"Angelo Mathews insists England are still the team under pressure in the sixth one-day international in Pallekele despite their impressive win at the same venue to trail only 3-2 in the series. Alastair Cook's tourists narrowed the gap and kept themselves in with a chance after all of starting their World Cup winter with a series success, if they can win the final two matches against Sri Lanka. Mathews, however, remains confident his team are capable of much better - as long as his spinners make the most of home conditions. England narrowed their deficit in the series to 3-2 after five ODIs thanks to an impressive Joe Root century . 'The pressure is still on England,' he said, after fine performances from Chris Woakes with the ball and then centurion Joe Root and James Taylor with the bat had redressed the balance in a match spread over two days because of rain. 'We just have to go and be aggressive and positive. 'We're very confident. We don't need to panic. It's just that we didn't play well. We know that and we know the mistakes we made.' One or two tweaks may be in the offing for Sri Lanka, who have delivered plenty already with their plethora of spinners. This time they would be in selection, although the tinkering will start in earnest back in Colombo next week should they clinch the series on Saturday. 'There might be a few changes,' said Mathews. 'Whoever comes in, we have to try to win the series. It was disappointing the way we played. But we can't take a step back. Chris Woakes picked up six wickets in the fifth match of the series which keeps England in contention . 'We need to move forward, and try to learn from our mistakes.' Mahela Jayawardene has hinted of late that he would like to move up to open the batting - and with Kusal Perera dropped from the squad after his run of moderate form, the veteran may have his opportunity. 'The options are still open for the opening slot,' added Mathews. 'Mahela is one option. 'We've given opportunities to Kusal. He's fared pretty well, in a couple of games, but he could have done better. 'We expect a lot from him. We have nine more games (before the World Cup) to try and experiment with the opening slot.' Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews insists the pressure is still on England, who must win the last two games . Sri Lanka's selectors have updated the squad for the last two matches - leaving out Perera, middle-order batsman Ashan Priyanjan and spinner Ajantha Mendis. Batsmen Dimuth Karunaratne and former captain Dinesh Chandimal plus leg-spinner Seekkuge Prasanna have all been added - while uncapped chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan and seamer Suranga Lakmal are also in the reckoning for a late entrance into the series. Mathews said, however: 'We're not looking to experiment too much (yet). Mathews accepts his team were poor in the last game, but says he will not experiment until the series is won . 'We'll see how it goes in the next game, and then see if we can do that a bit in the last one. Our objective is to win the series first, then do the experiments. 'We still bank on our spinners - especially on that wicket, turning square. They didn't bowl that well. But I'm pretty sure they'll come back hard. 'We need to get the combinations right. We can't play three off-spinners, just to give an opportunity to a certain player.'","England won fifth match of seven-game series to make score 3-2 .

"A 5p charge on throwaway carrier bags came into force in Scotland yesterday, leaving England as the only home nation yet to tackle the blight and waste they cause. The new levy is designed to encourage shoppers to switch to re-usable bags. It is hoped the move will have the same positive effects as in Wales and Northern Ireland, where there has been a massive reduction in the number of bags issued at tills. Scotland has introduced 5p charge on carrier bags, making England the last home nation to introduce the levy . At the same time, profits from the bag charge will be donated to good causes, providing a financial lifeline to charities, particularly those involved in tackling litter and improving parks and green spaces. More than 160 retailers including Marks & Spencer, McDonald’s and The Co-operative Group have registered for Zero Waste Scotland’s Carrier Bag Commitment, launched earlier this year. This means organisations have agreed to donate the net proceeds from the charge to good causes. The introduction of a charge has proved popular with shoppers where it has been introduced, based on the evidence that it reduces waste, litter and harm to the environment. But the Coalition government in Westminster has dragged its heels on adopting the system in England. England is expected to see a 5p charge introduced in October next year, however this is not certain and it is wrapped in a series of small print caveats which means it will be more complex and less effective. The scheme in England will exempt small shops, despite the fact the Association of Convenience Stores say they do now want to be left out. The front page from the Daily Mail's 'Banish the Bags' campaign, which was launched in February 2008 . It will also exempt paper bags, despite the fact they are considered more damaging to the environment than plastic in terms of the energy used in production and the gases created when they are dumped. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which speaks for the biggest supermarkets and other national chains, said the adoption of the different and ‘overly complex’ scheme for England will confuse shoppers. The Daily Mail’s ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign launched in February 2008 called for action to end the waste and litter blight caused by discarded bags. The introduction of charges in other countries, from Ireland to parts of the US, India and China, has led to reductions of more than 80per cent in the numbers handed out at the tills. The Scottish government estimates that 800 million single-use bags are given out by supermarkets every year in Scotland alone. Campaigners hope this figure could be cut by 750million. The Scottish Environment Secretary, Richard Lochhead, said: ‘I’m extremely proud that this landmark legislation is now in force. Our carrier bag addiction is symptomatic of our throwaway culture and has serious implications for the environment. He added: ‘Huge numbers of these bags end up as litter, blighting our communities and clogging up our seas and natural habitats, affecting many sorts of wildlife and marine species in particular. ‘We want that to change and for people to stop and think about whether they really need to take another bag. Alternatives like bags-for-life are easy to get and are much more sustainable.’ The Marine Conservation Society said the moves in Scotland highlights the lack of action by the Westminster government. Emma Cunningham, MCS Pollution Campaigns Officer, said: ‘It’s truly unbelievable that England is being left behind in this matter. Scottish Environment Secretary, Richard Lochhead, said he is 'extremely proud that this landmark legislation is now in force' ‘Despite successful and popular actions from all the Devolved Administrations – the latest from Scotland – which we applaud, it looks like the English charge will not follow the successful systems in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but instead will have caveats for the charge depending on the size of the shop and the type of material.’ MCS Pollution Programme Manager, Dr Laura Foster, said: ‘A 5p charge on all single-use carrier bags, regardless of the material they are made from is a really encouraging step forward and millions of bags will now not end up in Scottish waters thanks to this decision.’ She added: ‘We have strong evidence that turtles and other sea creatures mistake plastic bags for food like jellyfish. They eat them and then die a painful death from choking or stomach blockages. Gulls are regularly seen eating bags looking for the food they once carried, and many other animals are known to consume plastic bags accidentally.’ MCS hopes retailers will donate the charge to environmental organisations that, for many years, have been spending time and money campaigning for a ban on bags and, more importantly, clearing them up. The introduction of a charge has proved popular with shoppers based on the evidence that it reduces waste, litter and harm to the environment.

"From carpets that switch to wooden beams at the touch of a button, to floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors – the bedroom of the future is set be a high-tech affair. Experts predict that, within the next decade, we could also be sleeping on bedding with built-in cooling and heating systems,and surrounding ourselves with 3D printed ornaments. And for people who don’t have a scenic view, smart windows could be used switch between rainforests scenes, valley views and even double up as projector screens. Scroll down for video . The bedroom of the future (illustrated) was designed by London-based Betta Living. Its predictions include carpets that switch to beams, floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors . Betta Living, the bedroom furniture firm, also details how many of these so-called futuristic concepts are already in the making, or available to buy. Starting with a morning routine, Betta Living claims that mirrored glass on wardrobe doors will be superseded by virtual mirrors. In September, the National Sleep Foundation released its first international Bedroom Poll. It compared the amount of sleep and attitudes, habits and bedtime routines of people living across the United States, Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany and Japan. The results discovered that while a third of Britons prefer to sleep naked, Germans have to air their bedrooms weekly to achieve a good night's sleep and half of both Japanese and Americans take naps every two weeks to catch up on their shut eye. Oral B has already developed a similar smart mirror prototype for the bathroom, and Betta Living believes they will become commonplace in bedrooms within five years. The intelligent interactive surface will not only display the contents of the wardrobe, but micro-tagged clothes could be tried on virtually using gestural technology. This means users can virtually swipe through choices, and see how items look when worn together. It could also be used as a personal stylist, helping people to decide what to wear depending on their diary entries, when linked with a smartphone, or the weather. Users will also be able to shop online from these mirrors, to find shoes and accessories to match existing items. Elsewhere in the futuristic bedroom concept, clear glass windows will be replaced with ‘smart windows’, automated to the time of day and season, or personal preferences. The screen could be translucent, fade completely to black, work as a virtual window blind, display a scene of the user’s choice, or be used as an interactive screen to watch TV, check the weather and even browse and update social media accounts.

On to the beds of the future.The next-generation mattresses and beds could use a cantilever mechanism to store the bed in the ceiling rather than a wall, according to Betta Living. At the touch of a button, the bed could elevate up into a spot lit surround, and disappear into the ceiling. The bedding could be high-tech too. Duvets of the future, for example, could be connected to body monitoring systems, telling sleepers to heat up if their body is getting too cold. To boost and monitor health, future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets. The system would be able to optimise the heat and light to a person’s exact needs. Honeywell’s evohome (pictured) already lets users schedule, and personalise heating and hot water wirelessly . This trend has also been seen recently with products such as LightwaveRF (pictured) - that controls everything from power sockets and light dimmers from smartphones - and Beddit’s ultra-thin film sensor, which connects wirelessly to a smartphone to provide sleep analytics . And thanks to an in-built cooling system, this bedding will cool the body down to prevent night sweats. Pillows could incorporate the same light technology used in lamps to combat light sensitivity, and could light up gradually as people wake. To boost and monitor health further, future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets. The whole system would then be able to optimise the heat and light to suit a person’s exact needs - even down to heart rate and core body temperature.

And Honeywell’s evohome lets users schedule, zone and personalise their heating and hot water wirelessly, using a touchscreen controller or an app. On the subject of fitness, Betta Living also predicts that bedrooms of the future will double up as gyms. Homeowners will be able to elevate the bed to reveal a home gym, such as the Domyos Training Box. This box (pictured) contains a weight-lifting bar and selection of weights and a weight bench . Experts also predict that the flooring will be interchangeable at the flick of a switch. This means that carpets could be switched for laminate flooring at the touch of a button, and it could be cleaned using Roomba vacuums (pictured) that can be set to clean whenever the owner wants . Energy-bills will be substantially less too, as lighting becomes more energy-efficient. In addition, self-iron fabrics could spell the end of ironing duvet covers.

And it could be cleaned using Roomba vacuums, or Dyson's latest automated vacuum, that can be set to clean the floor whenever the owner wants. Barry Rourke said: ‘Our bedroom of the future is all about multi-functionality to make the most of space, fabulous design and making home comforts even more sophisticated. ‘As people flock to popular urban areas, domestic spaces are shrinking but in our transformative bedroom, even the smallest of spaces will not restrict the homeowners in the future. ‘Windows will adapt to whatever we want our view to be and interactive living surfaces will mean we have access to our lives and wardrobe in one clever screen. ‘Even the traditional bed will become tech driven and be linked to everything else in the room by clever sensors and smartphones. There are so many exciting things being developed our problem designing the bedroom of the future was what to leave out.’","The bedroom of the future was designed by experts at Betta Living .

"Defending champion Charl Schwartzel will try to make it three Alfred Dunhill Championships in a row when he tees it up at the Leopard Creek Country Club this week. The 2011 Masters winner has won by 12 shots and four shots in the last two years and he is going for the hat-trick, having won his maiden European Tour title on this course a decade ago. 'Even if I am playing badly it seems to treat me well,' Schwartzel told European Tour Radio ahead of the second event of the 2015 schedule.

"Nick Easter has defied convention throughout his career. The veteran No 8 did not plough a conventional furrow from academy into the professional ranks. He followed a lesser-trodden path to the top — via Rosslyn Park and Orrell — before embarking on an 11-year association with Harlequins which shows little sign of ending. A new contract is being discussed and, with the 36-year-old playing as well as ever, both parties are keen to agree a deal. Nick Easter has no plans for retirement as he prepares for a second Champions Cup clash with Leinster . Easter tackles Darragh Fanning of Leinster during the Harelquins' European victory last week . Veteran still hopes he can make his way back into the England set up, despite playing his last game in 2011 . Despite the advancing years, and Quins’ domestic struggles this season, the former England star has no plans to hang up his boots and make way for the next generation. Easter believes he still has unfinished business at international level — although he is less optimistic about his chances of ever completing it — while the challenge of pitting his mental and physical strengths against younger men on a weekly basis remains a huge motivating force. He will take the field at the Aviva Stadium to face Leinster ‘fresh’ from a man-of-the-match performance last Sunday which prompted Conor O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby, to predict his senior statesman could carry on until he is 40. ‘I’m enjoying it and my body’s holding out,’ Easter said. ‘My mind remains fresh, too... it’s not just about whether your body fails you when people decide to pack in. There’s also the mental side. ‘You’re always aware you could just wake up one day and not feel like your body is up to it any more. But they monitor your fitness, strength, speed and everything else — I’m still improving those scores. Easter (centre) charges up field during an Aviva Premiership match between Harlequins and Saracens . The Quins star still relishes taking on the next generation of young players, despite turning 36 this year . ‘The age thing has never bothered me. It’s been as much about the mental side as the physical. I’m still hungry to win things with Quins. That’s what drives me on. ‘You’ve got to adjust to the way the game is going all the time. I am fortunate to be at a club where I can judge myself because we’ve got so many successful young kids coming through the system. ‘It is not as if I’m keeping up with the old guard and the dinosaurs. I’ve got to keep up with the younger guys. ‘If I was just doing it ticking off the years I don’t think it would be worth carrying on. I don’t want to be dead wood in a squad and not contributing in the way I have over the past 11 seasons. ‘With all the youngsters coming through you get a proper benchmark of where you are in the modern game. At the moment I’m happy with where I am.’ Aseli Tikoirotuma touches the ball down for a try during Harlequins defeat of Leinster . Danny Care (centre) slips past Leinster's Rhys Ruddock as Harlequins storm to victory . One of those ‘kids’ will be alongside Easter in the back-row tonight with 21-year-old Jack Clifford starting against the three-time European champions in place of injured England captain Chris Robshaw, who the club yesterday announced will not need surgery on the shoulder he injured last week against Leinster. Twenty-one-year-old fly-half Tim Swiel also starts at No 10 in place of the injured Nick Evans. A repeat of last Sunday’s impressive home victory over the same opponents would leave Quins sitting pretty with four wins from four at the top of Pool 2. ‘Missing those guys does make the job harder but we’re halfway through the season now and you half expect those kind of injuries,’ Easter added. ‘It’s about a squad effort if you want to achieve any silverware. Harlequins captain Chris Robshaw will miss the Champions Cup game through injury . Tim Sweil (centre) will start at No 10 against Leinster after replacing the injured Nick Evans . ‘We are expecting a massive war down there with a huge step-up in intensity. ‘We know we’re going to have to be better than we were on Sunday and they will definitely be stronger. They are a class outfit.’ On the subject of class, it has been clear for some time that Easter’s is of the permanent variety. The last of his 47 caps came in Martin Johnson’s final game in charge as England coach. That abject World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in 2011 marked the end of a disastrous England campaign as well as Johnson’s reign. And, despite continuing to produce international-quality club displays, it appears increasingly unlikely that Easter will ever wear the Red Rose again. Easter has not appeared for the Red Rose since losing to France in the quarter-finals of the 2011 World Cup . Easter has not spoken seriously about an England return with current coach Stuart Lancaster . He has not spoken seriously about rugby to current England coach Stuart Lancaster or his coaching staff for more than two years and, with the World Cup less than a year away, it will require a seismic shift in selection policy for him to earn a recall to the international side. ‘It’s very hard because this conversation has been going on ever since I was left out of the side when Stuart came on board,’ he said. ‘I don’t think I could have done much more with my performances. You never say never but it’s clearly a very long shot. ‘The door is not shut on England but the handle is turning. But I’m still motivated. I enjoyed my England career but it ended on a low and that is a bit of unfinished business that still motivates me. ‘I’m happy with the way I’m playing. It’s a pity I can’t do it on the international stage but I’ve got Leinster in front of 50,000 people at the Aviva which is the next best thing. ‘I don’t really have time to feel sorry for myself.’ Leinster: R Kearney; Z Kirchner, L Fitzgerald, I Madigan, D Fanning; J Gopperth, I Boss; J McGrath, S Cronin, M Ross; D Toner, K Douglas; R Ruddock, D Ryan, J Heaslip (capt).

"A second victim of the Washington high school shooting died on Sunday, two days after a teen-aged gunman opened fire on a group of his best friends and family members involved in an apparently tragic love triangle. Gia Soriano, 14, succumbed to gunshot wounds she suffered when 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg opened fire on the group in the canteen at Marysville-Pilchuck High School during lunch break on Friday. Jaylen shot dead the girl he had a crush on, Zoe Galasso, 14, and wounded four other teenagers - Andrew Fryberg and Nate Hatch, Ms Soriano and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit - before shooting himself dead. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Gia Soriano, 14, has become the third to die following the Washington school shooting on Friday . 'Our beautiful daughter, we'll miss her': Gia's family issued an emotional statement announcing her death . Tributes: More than $3,000 has been raised for the family by members of the community in less than a day . Andrew Fryberg, 15, and Mr Hatch, 14, were the shooter's cousins and Ms Soriano and Ms Chuckulnaskit, also 14, were close friends of the group. Mr Soriano's family said in a statement: 'We are devastated by this senseless tragedy. Gia is our beautiful daughter and words cannot express how much we'll miss her. 'We’ve made the decision to donate Gia’s organs so that others may benefit. 'Our daughter was loving, kind and this gift honors her life. 'Thank you to Providence for their excellent care – bar none – from beginning to end. 'Thank you to our friends and family who have supported us. Thank you to Drs. Bill Finley, Sanford Wright and Anita Tsen for their tremendous support and compassion. And thank you, to Bill and Ben with LifeCenter. 'We ask that you please respect our privacy and give us the space and time we need to grieve and spend time together as a family in memory of Gia.' She died at the Providence Medical Center, which described Ms Soriano's death at 9.30pm PST as a 'senseless tragedy' and invited the community to join a minute's silence at 10.39am on Monday - exactly 72 hours after the attack. Two of the three remaining survivors - Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Andrew Fryberg - are still in critical condition being treated for severe head wounds. The third, Nate Hatch, is recovering but cannot talk and still has a bullet in his chest. Last night, Nate gave hope to friends and relatives reeling in shock by posting a Facebook update from his bed at Harborview Medical Center saying: 'Greatful [sic] to be alive'. He was shot in the jaw by his cousin and best friend, Jaylen. His grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate had started communicating with his family by writing notes. Donald Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends. He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Dead: Zoe Galasso, 14, (left) died in the attack before shooter Jaylen Fryberg (right) turned the gun on himself. It has been rumored that his outburst could have been fueled by romantic feelings for Zoe . Spoken out: Nate Hatch posted this Facebook message from Harborview Medical Center where he is being treated for a gunshot to the jaw fired  by his cousin Jaylen Fryberg in Friday's school shooting . Improving: Nate has improved from a critical condition to stable, but he still unable to talk . 'Very critical': Gia Soriano (left) and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit are both being treated at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, following the deadly attack at Marysville-Pilchuck High School . 'His eyes could barely open,' Mr Hatch added. The other survivor, Andrew Fryberg, is fighting for life at the same hospital as Nate Hatch, Harborview. It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew. Ms Galasso was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire. She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students. Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Ms Galasso and Ms Chuckulnaksit said they were outgoing, popular kids. He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.' Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000. Love triangle: Jaylen allegedly had a crush on Zoe (pictured right), who was dating Andrew Fryberg (left), the shooter's cousin . Victims pictured with the shooter: Zoe Galasso is circled far right with Jaylen Fryberg's cousin Andrew. His other relative Nate Hatch is pictured left and the gunman is posing at the back . Friends: Jaylen was a vibrant member of the friendship group, pictured left with Shaylee and right with Nate . He told the paper: 'I'm pretty surprised. I put $10,000 as the goal as a pie-in-the-sky thing. I'm shocked.' A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Shaylee posing alongside the Jaylen Fryberg. The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his father's gun, before turning the gun on himself. A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'. He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.'

"Rory McIlroy has won the Golf Writers' Trophy for the second time in three years following a stunning season that saw him claim two major championships and play a leading role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory. The 25-year-old was the overwhelming choice for this prestigious award following votes cast by members of the Association of Golf Writers. In addition to his victories in the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship, McIlroy also won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. 'First of all, I'd like to say a huge thank-you to the members of the Association of Golf Writers who have felt me worthy to receive this honour, I really do appreciate it,' said McIlroy. 'To win it for the first time in 2012 felt like a great achievement but to win again in 2014 is testimony to what has been a truly fabulous year for me.' Rory McIlroy has won the Gold Writers' Trophy after a fine season which included victory at The Open . McIlroy, pictured in action during the fourth round of the Australian Open, also won the award in 2012 . The Golf Writers Trophy was first awarded in 1951 and is given to the European who has made the most outstanding contribution to the sport during the year. Previous two-time winners include Sir Nick Faldo, Padraig Harrington, Tony Jacklin, Sandy Lyle, Bernhard Langer and Annika Sorenstam. The only players to win it three times are Seve Ballesteros and Lee Westwood. Martin Kaymer finished runner-up following his wins at the US Open and the Players Championship, with Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team rounding out a high-quality top three. McIlroy poses with his Europe team-mate Graeme McDowell after winning the Ryder Cup in Scotland . McIlroy also lifted the Wanamaker trophy at Valhalla after winning the US PGA Championship . Added McIlroy: 'I think one of the nicest things for me is the relationship I have developed over the years on tour with the members of the AGW. I'd like to say, and I know all the players would agree, we appreciate the job you do in covering the sport – even if we don't always agree with what you write.' Derek Lawrenson, Sportsmail's golf correspondent  and chairman of the AGW, reflected: 'It seems amazing that a man can win the US Open and the PGA Tour's flagship event and still not get a look-in for this award, but that sums up a remarkable year for European golf. 'Congratulations to Martin Kaymer on his victories, to Europe's Ryder Cup team and also to Charley Hull, who is poised to win the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit at the age of just 18. But I don' t think too many people would argue Rory is a most worthy winner.'","Rory McIlroy has won the award for the second time in three years .

"A North Carolina diner has introduced an optimistic new pricing format - leaving it all in the hands of God. Just Cookin, based in Dallas, N.C. and owned by Dana Parris, announced its new menu system last week with a Facebook post that read: 'I am letting go and letting GOD!! No prices… no totals… you pay what you think your meal is worth!!!' According to Grubstreet, Ms Parris experienced a divine intervention after a busy summer of trying to attract new customers, and said: 'The way I could show I was giving God control was to give him control of the cash register.' Divine intervention: Just Cookin, based in Dallas, N.C. (pictured), announced its new menu system last week with a Facebook post that read, 'I am letting go and letting GOD!!' The post inspired a great deal of predictable social media chatter, mainly favorable. 'May God Richly Bless You for your Immaculate Belief!' wrote one woman. 'I am Blessed to even share this. Keep Believing in God. You have Wondrously Blessed My Soul. Thank You!' Others were less ecstatic, with one writing: 'What if I walk in like Jesus with a crew of homeless people, order everything on the menu, hand you a rusted penny?' Announcement: The restaurant's owner Dana Parris later explained, 'The way I could show I was giving God control was to give him control of the cash register' Bargain: Prices at Just Cookin (pictured) start at $1.69 for a serving of 'livermush' and run up to $5.99 for 'chopped steak' The restaurant - which requires employees to wear uniforms that bear the slogan 'Believing' - serves sandwiches, egg platters and burgers, among other options.

"With their trademark maroon berets, the soldiers from this elite regiment pride themselves on being the fittest of the fit. Which is why those wanting to join the British Army's Parachute Regiment have to pass one of toughest job interviews imaginable. The  28-week training course which must be passed in order to become a Paratrooper has become famous within the forces for its sheer intensity. Now, for the first time in 30 years, camera crews have gone inside the regiment's training camp to follows the fresh-faced recruits as they find out what it takes to earn the coveted maroon beret. Scroll down for videos . A seven-part series, due to air tomorrow, follows fresh-faced recruits as they attempt to survive the gruelling 28-week training course to earn a place in the British Army's Parachute Regiment . For the seven-part series, the cameras follow a platoon of young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their final Pass Out Parade seven months later. When filming began there were 34 recruits - but by the end of the course, only eight of those are left to take their first step into the British Army. The fly-on-the-wall footage, called Para Platoon: Earning the maroon beret, also includes an in-depth look at 'P Company', the famously gruelling final test which makes or breaks the strongest of recruits. The eight tests which make up P Company include the stretcher race – in which recruits carry a metal stretcher weighing almost 180lbs over five miles – and the 60ft high aerial assault course, designed to see if the men can jump out of an airplane. During the episodes, the wannabe soldiers are seen physically retching as they test their physical limits. They are pushed to the point of exhaustion as they are filmed wading through knee-deep water and clambering over giant obstacles - only to be told to get up and start all over again. More than anything, the course is the chance to 'take the civilian head off their shoulders for three and put them into a military environment'. And, if they succeed in doing that, the rewards are huge. In the first episode, the men are shown arriving at Catterick Garrison - where the British Army trains all its infantry recruits -  for their Parachute Regiment Assessment Course. The PRAC is an initial three-day test to see whether or not the men have the endurance to take on the full 28-week training course. Course commander Corporal Rob Price, who has done three tours of Afghanistan, puts the men through their paces using a series of tough physical assessments, designed to assess their fitness and determination. For the first time in 30 years, cameras have gone inside the training camp to document the young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their Pass Out Parade, seven months later . But - incase they ever dare start to get ahead of themselves - the men are constantly reminded how far they have to go: 'You are not paratroopers yet, gents. You are far from that,' they are told. Explaining why the course is so tough, Corporal Price tells the camera: 'We don't go looking for these recruits. These recruits come to us. You either want to be here or you don't. 'If you don't, no problem to us, we will leave you where you are. But if you want to be here, you want to be part of the best regiment, you've got to step up to the task. The recruits' first day is a snapshot of what is to come. The men must complete a physical fitness assessment - including 48 sit ups and 48 press ups in two minutes - as well as a 1.5mile run in less than ten minutes. Some of the tough obstacles which the men have to complete include a steeplechase, dotted with tough obstacles (right) and swathes of muddy water (left) They are also expected to complete a two-mile steeplechase - dotted with tough obstacles and swathes of muddy water - in less than 21 minutes. Coporal Price tells the camera that, apart from wading through deep water against the clock, the men will be ruined from the blisters they sustain by running for probably the first-time ever in chunky army boots. And it's that event which claims the first casualty of the course, who is seen slumped against the wall, shattered and half-broken. But the men barely have a second to get over their exhaustion, being told to 'stop feeling sorry for themselves' because it is 'the easiest event in the world'. The recruits are then made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain. Corporal Price explains the lengths that some recruits have gone to, in a bid to ensure they pass the test. He said: 'You have got to pour blood, sweat, tears to get up it. We have had guys that have been crawling up it, trying to get up there with their nails just to get up the top of it. 'We are not setting them up for it, we are just setting up to see if they can do it.' The recruits are also made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain, which the course commander said you have to 'pour blood, sweat, tears to get up' The recruits are also put through the trainasium - a 60ft training assault, unique to the regiment. Expected to run and jump at heights, the event simulates the so-called exit phase of a parachute jump. Corporal Price explains: 'It is the event that conquers your fear of heights. You can either do it, or you can't. 'If you can't do a 60ft beam walk in the air, there is no way you will be jumping out of a Hercules C13 at 800ft. There's just no way.' The documentary follows the journey of some of the individuals who have embarked on the course, who come from all walks of life. There's a 26-year-old who used to be a support worker competing side-by-side with a man who is trying his luck for the second time, after leaving the army, aged 16. Corporal Price said there are several soldiers who comes from difficult backgrounds, who want to join the Parachute Regiment to better themselves. Another of the challenges involving boxing with one another - something which causes many recruits to fall at the final hurdle . Meanwhile, Private Phil Howard explains how he gave up the chance of going to university to take a shot at the course. He said: 'I always wanted to do it since I was tiny. I always wanted to join the army. I joined because I wanted to make a difference and to have a bit of meaning. I wanted to join the Paras because it is the elite unit.' And for Private Michael Coates, who worked as a support worker with those with learning difficulties, joining the Paras is a way of escaping his mundane life on 'Civvy Street'. He said: 'When you're on Civvy Street, you feel like you're doing nowt, not achieving nowt. 'If you want to do something remarkable with your life, because you're only living it once.' The Parachute Regiment is the airborne infantry element of 16 Air Assault Brigade. It is an infantry force with expertise air-land deployments, by helicopter, airplane or parachute. It is also trained to provide direct support to United Kingdom Special Forces, with whom it maintains close links. The regiment was created after Winston Churchill, speaking in June 1940, called for the formation of an elite Corps of troops, of at least 5,000 parachute troops. A Parachute Training School was established at Ringway Airport, near Manchester. By the end of the Second World War, the regiment comprised of 17 battalions. The regiment wore the maroon beret and the nickname 'red devils' was bestowed by the enemy forces during fierce fighting in North Africa. Following many famous operations during the war, the Parachute Regiment went on to serve everywhere from Palestine to Northern Ireland to the Falklands. More recently, the regiment led in war-torn Kosovo and Sierra Leone. The regiment is made up of 1 PARA, which forms the Special forces Support Group (SFSG); 2 PARA, which forms part of 16 Air Assault Brigade and is based in Colchester, Essex; 3 PARA and 4 PARA, the reserve parachute battalion with its headquarters in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. Another would-be soldier tells the cameras how he failed a selection course for the Royal Marines 'by a fingernail'. But, three years on, he has grown tired of his everyday life. He said: 'I got sick to death of it. I want to proper money, proper mates and get a proper family about us.' The comradeship is also something hammered home throughout the episodes. Corporal Price said: 'Once you are in the reg, you are in the reg for life, you will need no other family once you're in here. 'It's hard to say, because I love my family as well and the majority of the guys will say that again, but being with the blokes - your guys, your men, your muckers - there's no feeling like it. 'If someone is in trouble, guys will bust a gut to help you.'

"After 24 painful years of searching for answers, the families of three murdered Aboriginal children are a step closer to finding justice. Colleen Walker-Craig, 16, Clinton Speedy-Duroux, 16, and Evelyn Greenup, four, disappeared from the Bowraville community on the NSW north coast over several months from 1990 to 1991. The bodies of Clinton and Evelyn were found in bushland on the outskirts of the town, while Colleen's body is still missing. After 24 painful years of searching for answers, the families of murdered Colleen Walker-Craig, 16, Clinton Speedy-Duroux (pictured), 16, and Evelyn Greenup (pictured) are a step closer to finding justice . The bodies of Clinton and Evelyn were found in bushland on the outskirts of the town, while Colleen's body is still missing . In 1991, local man Jay Hart was charged with the murder of Clinton and Evelyn, but was acquitted of murdering Clinton in 1994. Shortly afterwards prosecutors also dropped the charges relating to Evelyn. After an inquest into her death in 2004, Mr Hart was once more charged with Evelyn's murder and again acquitted. Due to technicalities in NSW legislation, key pieces of evidence were excluded from the trials and the three murders were never considered in a single trial. After a 12-month investigation, a NSW parliamentary inquiry on Thursday found flaws in the way police investigated the cases. It also called on the NSW government to look at clarifying laws to allow a single retrial to be held. Michelle Jarrett, Evelyn's aunt, was in parliament when the report was tabled. '(I'm) relieved in finally getting the acknowledgment that we weren't lying in how we were being treated,' she said. 'It's really great to be acknowledged ... we need it.' She said her family was now one step closer to justice. 'The light's getting a bit bigger,' Ms Jarrett said. Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin has worked on the case since 1996 and says families have been let down by the justice system. Clarice Greenup (pictured, middle), the aunt of Evelyn Greenup, Marg Campbell (pictured, right) and Raymond Robinson after a march on New South Wales Parliament House in Sydney . He told the inquiry race had impacted on how the murders were investigated. Det Insp Jubelin said on Thursday there were overwhelming links between the murders and that they must be heard in a single trial. Committee chair and Liberal MP David Clarke hoped the recommendations brought the families closer to justice. 'A killer whose crimes constitute evil at its very darkest and most depraved is still free,' he told the chamber. 'Justice demands that the killer of these three children whose lives were brutally cut short before they really ever begun should be brought to account.' Clinton's sister-in-law Leonie Duroux says the government should apologise to the families over the mishandled murder investigations. Colleen's brother Lucas Craig was also in parliament. 'It was a very emotional day and a very happy day,' he said. Helen Duroux, the aunt of Clinton Speedy-Duroux, speaks at press conference at the NSW Parliament House in Sydney .

"Channel 4’s racing coverage have been dealt a blow with news that flagship presenter Clare Balding is to cut back her appearances from 40 to only nine per year. In 2015, Balding will only front the Channel’s racing output from the Cheltenham Festival and Royal Ascot. The station can take some comfort from the fact that Balding has signed a two-year deal and will also present their coverage of the Crufts dog show and 2016 Paralympics in Rio. Clare Balding will continue to work for Channel 4, but will be involved far less in 2015 . The experienced broadcaster will miss the Grand National and the Derby this year . Balding will broadcast on just nine days for Channel 4 in 2015 . The fact that Balding, 43, has cut back on her work in racing was expected. She is in an in-demand presenter whose profile has soared way beyond the narrow confines of the racing world. But not chosing to present coverage of the Boat race over the Grand National in April and also step down from the Derby at Epsom in June is a bitter blow. Nick Luck, who will now assume the position of lead presenter, is a hugely talented broadcaster, but, without Balding, there is no-one on the team who can claim national recognition with appeal to a broader constituency of viewers. Balding said: ‘I have been lucky and honoured to work as a racing broadcaster for the past 20 years and will continue to promote the sport on and off screen. ‘I look forward to working with the enormously talented Channel 4 Racing team at Cheltenham and Royal Ascot next year and, of course, to the Paralympics in Rio in 2016.

It has also emerged that a mysterious man captured on CCTV walking through the graveyard of a nearby church and then doing a quick u-turn around the time the student went missing has not come forward, despite police appeals. The inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria was stopped after the barrister for Matthew's family, Kieran Rainey, complained of too many 'gaps' in his final hours and said there were 'unanswered questions'. Mr Rainey told a witness giving evidence for Cumbria Police: ' You've got a blank spot on this and you're giving evidence today which is completely divergent to what the family understands.' Coroner Ian Smith said he did not want the family to go away 'unhappy', but warned all the answers may never be known. Matthew's mum Claire, 43, told the inquest her son was good at directions and cannot understand how he ended up on Rayrigg Road, close to Windermere, as it was in the opposite direction to the cottage where he was staying. She said: 'There's still a gap and we are still adamant people have seen him on Rayrigg Road that night and that Matthew would have asked them for help. An unexplained bruise on Mr Jordan's head was also found during a post mortem but a small cut to his eye was 'missed'. Several 'figures' in 'groups' on the streets that night have not been traced, a detective revealed. Mr Jordan a Teesside University student, had travelled from Middlesbrough with three friends on a spontaneous trip to the Lakes. The group ate and drank at pubs including The Stag's Head Hotel where they got split up around midnight. Mr Jordan's family pictured at an earlier press conference around the time he went missing. His mother Clare, centre, told the inquest she cannot understand how he ended up near to the lake . Mr Jordan was told to go to the toilet after being sick but the group got split up and he was last seen trying to get help at the The Hole Int Wall, which was closed. His three friends - Michael Blakey, Jordan Gill and David Russell - estimated he had drunk around six-and-half pints of lager, some shots and half-a-bottle of wine. His post mortem examination showed he was two-and-half times the drink drive limit, which on its own was not sufficient to kill him, the inquest was told. While he was described as 'swaying', witnesses said he was sufficiently 'coherent' to ask for help and speak to people. The last contact his phone had with the network was at 12.31am. Specialist police teams and a marine unit searched Windermere for Mr Jordan after he went missing following a night out with friends . Mr Jordan had not been drinking regularly due to a fitness regime, the hearing was told. His cause of death remains 'unascertained' - partly because of decomposition after he was found in the water at Rayrigg Wyke, just off the A592 on Rayrigg Road near the Windermere Steam Boat museum. CCTV footage from the museum showed the security lights activating around the time of his disappearance but there is no-one or any animals on film - which detectives cannot explain. Consultant pathologist, Dr Nicholas Mapstone, is also unable to explain bruising on Matthew's head. He said: 'There are a number of things I didn't find and it leaves me with a problem . 'Although it's not uncommon in drowning. 'There was no definite evidence of drowning but that doesn't exclude drowning. Two possible causes are drowning and hypothermia.' Detective Sergeant Andy Lamb, of Cumbria Police, said the operation to find Mr Jordan was ‘comprehensive’ Dr Mapstone said the bruise was not serious enough to be fatal but 'was caused when he was alive.' However, he added that the bruise could also have been due to his position in the water. But the Lancaster-based consultant pathologist believes there was 'no evidence' of Matthew being assaulted but said he was not a 'forensic pathologist'. Detective Sergeant Andy Lamb, of Cumbria Police, said the operation to find Mr Jordan was 'comprehensive' with hundreds of statements taken and CCTV footage examined. He said it was the first missing person search in Cumbria on such a scale in years. DS Lamb said: 'Has someone hit Matthew? I've certainly not come across any material or any witness that suggests otherwise. 'I think, having heard all the evidence and reviewed all the statements, the hypothesis which has the most likelihood is that Matthew has been drunk, perhaps fallen over, and ended up in the lake and to do that, he would have had to cross a field.' Floral tributes were left outside the Winderemere steamboat museum near to where Mr Jordan's body was found . Asked how Matthew's body could have ended up at Rayrigg Wyke, DS Lamb said: 'It's fairly common in Windermere - it has a strong current underwater and various vegetation that someone could get caught up on, or then move around.' A mysterious man captured on CCTV walking through the graveyard of St Mark's Church and then doing a quick u-turn around the time Matthew went missing had not come forward despite police appeals, he said. DS Lamb said they had spoken to who they believed the person to be, who had said he was at home on the night. After the inquest Matthew's family said in a statement: 'There is no criticism of anyone in this matter. The issue is that, there is a gap in the evidence for the period between Matthew leaving the 'Hole in the Wall' to the time when he entered the lake. 'We understand that there is further evidence which was not produced at the inquest and our solicitor will be requesting sight of that evidence in the hope that this will provide a clearer picture of events.'

"The Detroit Lions' bid to reach the play-offs for the first time since 2012 was boosted by a 34-17 win over the Chicago Bears. Detroit got off to a sloppy start but pulled away with touchdowns on their final three possessions of the opening half to build a 24-14 lead. Trailing 14-3 after the first quarter, Matthew Stafford threw two second-quarter touchdowns to Calvin Johnson sandwiched around a one-yard run from Joique Bell, his first of two scores on the day, that gave Detroit the lead for good. Calvin Johnson evades Kyle Fuller to grab Matthew Stafford's pass for his second touchdown of the day . Johnson poses the Phil Sims All Iron Thanksgiving MVP award after a vital divisional win over the Bears . 'I felt great,' said Johnson, who had 11 catches for 146 yards in his fourth game back from an ankle injury. 'To get us going, get us back in sync and make some big plays for the team, all the guys contributed today and we had a big day.' The Lions (8-4), who entered the game tied with the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers for the final National Football Conference playoff berth, are now joint top in the NFC North with the Green Bay Packers. Stafford finished the game completing 34 of 45 passes for 390 yards and two touchdowns to put the Lions in position to secure their first playoff berth since the NFL's 2011 season. Matthew Stafford completed 34 of 45 attempts for 390 yards with the two touchdown passes to Johnson . Joique Bell ran for 91 yards from 23 carries and scored two touchdowns to batter the Bears . Detroit have to play only one team with a winning record, at the division rival Packers in the regular season finale next month, over their final four games. The Bears got off to a solid start, marching down the field with ease on their opening possession as quarterback Jay Cutler capped a six-play 55-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffrey. Chicago then took advantage of a turnover deep in the Lions end when, two plays after Stafford was sacked and fumbled the ball, Cutler found Jeffrey again with a six-yard pass. It marked the last time the Bears would find the end zone. For Chicago (5-7), the loss deals a severe blow to their play-off hopes as they entered the contest needing to win their final four games to have any chance of reaching the postseason for the first time since 2010.","The wide receiver looked back to full fitness following an ankle injury, catching 11 passes for 146 yards with two first-half touchdowns .

"One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up. The allegation was made in the third part of the German documentary that has exposed serial doping in Russia which is being treated by the IAAF ruling body as a highly serious issue for the sport with investigations into the TV allegations being carried out by the IAAF ethics committee, anti-doping body WADA and the IOC. German TV station ARD have alleged evidence from an unnamed whistleblower in the IAAF Medical Commission that the alleged cover-up of drugs cheats went far beyond the boundaries of Russia. One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up . IAAF vice-president Sebastian Coe said on Monday he believes athletics' reputation is damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries . The information about the British involvement came from ARD’s whistleblower from within the IAAF Medical Commission. His evidence alleged that the protection of possible drugs cheats by the IAAF went far beyond Russia. The list — seen by Sportsmail — was compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the advent of blood passports that have greatly helped in the battle to beat the dopers. It contains names of Russian athletes but also others from Ukraine, Greece, Bulgaria, Spain, Morocco, Kenya and Germany as well as the UK trio. The star British name was on the highest colour red tier of suspicion for blood counts HCT and HGB — so should have automatically been target tested for the blood-boosting drug EPO. But ARD’s IAAF insider says the necessary follow-up tests were not done at that time. And if so, very sparingly. Journalist Hajo Seppelt, who made the ARD documentary, said: ‘I trust the source of these documents 100 per cent. They are genuine.’ A spokesperson for the British star was made aware of the exact allegations but was not available for comment. Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping . The IAAF claimed that a single blood reading is not definitive and their medical staff would not necessarily know if a target test had taken place. A rebuttal statement said: ‘The blood data collected before (2009) was used for target purposes to trigger follow up urine tests for EPO detection. Abnormal results were followed up whenever possible. One cannot draw any conclusion on whether or not an athlete has doped on the basis of one single blood value. ‘When they are available, the IAAF has used pre-2009 blood values as secondary evidence. However these values do not have the same reliability and strength as samples collected under strict conditions. ‘The IAAF has been using the pre-2009 blood data to identify countries where there was a high risk of doping and to adjust its doping control programme accordingly.’ The documentaries have been sent to the IAAF’s independent ethics committee who are already investigating other whistleblower evidence of systematic Russian doping that was also covered up. The IAAF also have to deal with further allegations about IAAF President Lamine Diack’s son Papa Massata, a marketing consultant for the organisation, around Doha’s failed bid to host the 2017 World Championships. This comes after London 2012 chief Lord Sebastian Coe claimed athletics' reputation is being disproportionately damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries. Lord Coe, an IAAF vice-president who is standing in next August's election to be the organisation's president, called the allegations 'very serious' and promised any investigation into them will be completely independent. 'This is not in every country of the world - there are 213 federations,' he said. 'But you do have to say a disproportionate amount of the reputational damage is in a relatively small number of countries, and I think we have to recognise this. 'They are very serious allegations. The very fact that the allegations are in the public domain means that they are serious. So, we have to be very clear that this is a very, very difficult time for our sport.'

"The Philadelphia Eagles served up a Thanksgiving Day rout over the Dallas Cowboys to move top of the NFC East. Dallas and Philadelphia came into the game as co-leaders of the division but when time expired the Eagles took a significant step toward the postseason after quarterback Mark Sanchez ran for a touchdown and threw for another while LeSean McCoy rumbled for 159 yards and a score. The Eagles took control early with Sanchez diving in from two yards out to cap an impressive opening drive before hooking up with Jordan Matthews on a 27-yard touchdown strike on their next possession for a 14-0 first quarter lead. Mark Sanchez (left) shares a moment with coach Chip Kelly after an impressive win for the Eagles . After Sanchez went over on the first drive, the Eagles never looked like relinquishing their lead . LeSean McCoy ran for 159 yards and a touchdown to secure his his fourth 1,000-yard season since 2010 . DeMarco Murray, the NFL's leading rusher, put Dallas on the scoreboard when he dove over from the one early in the second but the Eagles would answer with three Cody Parkey field goals to take a 23-7 advantage into the intermission. Dallas converted a LeSean McCoy fumble into a short Dan Bailey field goal early in the third quarter but on the next possession McCoy made up for his drop by racing 38 yards for a touchdown to put Eagles up 30-10. 'It is a team win, that's all it's about,' said McCoy, praising his offensive line. 'We've been criticised all year, all the doubters, but no matter who is in there they give 110 percent and that's what it is about. 'It doesn't matter what anybody says, it's all about what goes on in the locker room.'","Sanchez led the Eagles to touchdowns on their first two drives to put the Cowboys on the back foot from the start .
McCoy ran for 159 yards and two touchdowns as he reached 1,000 yards for the fourth time in five seasons .
