"Russian Tennis Federation head Shamil Tarpischev was unrepentant about the comments he made about the Williams sisters, saying on Saturday they were only meant as jokes and that he doesn't understand why he was banned for a year by the WTA Tour. Tarpischev was fined $25,000 (£15,500) and suspended from tour involvement for a year after referring to Serena and Venus Williams as 'brothers' on a Russian TV show and called them 'scary' to look at. Asked whether he regretted his comments, Tarpischev told The Associated Press at the Kremlin Cup that the programme on which he spoke was 'a humorous show,' adding: 'I don't answer stupid questions.' Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev has been fined £15,000 and banned from women's tennis for one year following his 'Williams brothers' remark about Venus and Serena on a TV talk show . Tarpischev faced a backlash after making the offensive remarks about Serena (left) and Venus (right) When asked about his ban, Tarpischev said: 'I can't comment. I don't understand it.' In a statement released later by the Russian Tennis Federation, Tarpischev denied any 'malicious intent' and said his quotes had been taken out of context. 'I didn't want to offend any athlete with my words,' he said. 'I regret that this joke ... has garnered so much attention. I don't think this incident deserves so much fuss.' The Williams sisters are 'outstanding athletes' who 'personify strength and perseverance,' he added. The WTA said it would seek his removal as chairman of the Kremlin Cup tournament, which ends on Sunday. Serena Williams poses with the U.S. Open trophy on top of the Empire State Building after winning her 18th Grand Slam singles title in New York last month . Venus Williams celebrates winning a point in her third round US Open match with Sara Errani . Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko told the ITAR-Tass agency that he regretted that Tarpischev had made the comments and that his suspension was 'an unpleasant fact,' but suggested his sanction should be reduced. 'It's probably worth trying to get the punishment softened,' Mutko said. Tarpischev has been chairman of the Kremlin Cup, Russia's only WTA event, for all of its 18 years as a women's tour event, and is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. During the 1990s, he was the personal tennis coach to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and served as his adviser on sports matters. He made his comments during an appearance on a Russian talk show this month alongside former Olympic singles champion Elena Dementieva. When Dementieva was asked what it was like playing against the Williams sisters, Tarpischev interjected and called them the 'Williams brothers.' He also said that 'it's scary when you really look at them.' The WTA tour issued a sharp rebuke on Friday. 'Mr. Tarpischev's statements questioning their genders tarnish our great game and two of our champions,' WTA Tour chairman and CEO Stacey Allaster said in a statement. 'His derogatory remarks deserve to be condemned and he will be sanctioned.'","Shamil Tarpischev fined and banned after remark on TV chat show last week .

"A woman endured the nightmare of waking on an operating table after hospital staff failed to check she had had enough anaesthetic. Alexandra Bythell, 36, came round with tubes down her throat and her eyes taped shut as doctors prepared to remove her appendix. But Mrs Bythell could not move or alert doctors as the drugs she had been given had paralysed her, but could hear them speaking and prodding her stomach. Alexandra Bythell says she woke up during surgery to remove her appendix and that she now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence . The nurse from Burnley in Lancashire, said the incident was so traumatic that she has suffered flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks and anxiety issues ever since. She has now called on the NHS trust responsible to ensure lessons are learned from her ordeal. She has also won an undisclosed settlement after the East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust apologised and admitted that staff failed to check the levels on the anaesthetic machine - leaving her panicking and fearing for her life as she awoke while being prepared for surgery. Mrs Bythell, who lives with her husband Robert, 38, and her four-year-old daughter, said she has struggled to return to work fully since the incident as she suffered from severe PTSD. Her lawyers said the payout will now cover her lost earnings and the therapy she has needed to help her manage her ongoing psychological problems. Mrs Bythell said: ‘The whole incident was terrifying. The body isn't prepared to be awake in those situations, I had tubes in my mouth and my eyes were taped up - I was hysterical with panic but completely unable to do anything about it. Mrs Bythell believes the incident occurred because staff at the Royal Blackburn Hospital failed to check if there was enough of the anaesthetic drug still in the machine administering it . ‘I thought I was in surgery already and I felt like I was going to die. ‘Afterwards I tried to explain to the staff what happened but felt that I was being fobbed off with excuses and was constantly given the wrong information - first it was hallucinations, then it was a faulty machine. ‘It was incredibly distressing to find out that this was all caused by somebody not checking the machine actually had gas in it. ‘When it first happened I was absolutely traumatised. I just hope improvements are made to the anaesthetic process so they don't let this happen to anyone else - I would hate for people to suffer what I have.’ She added: 'My overriding memory is not being able to move, being paralysed. Anaesthetics are used during tests and surgical procedures to induce sleep and to prevents pain and discomfort. General anaesthetics are used with the aim of leaving the patient completely unconscious and unaware of the procedure. Anaesthetics work by blocking the signals sent along the nerves to the brain. These nerves are bundles of tiny fibres that use signals to pass information around the body. Anaesthetics stop the nerve signals that keep people awake from reaching the brain. Once it wears off, the person will regain consciousness and feeling will return. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, feeling cold, headaches and other aches and pains. In very rare cases, they can cause anaphylactic shock, permanent paralysis and even death. Several studies have also suggested that up to one or two patients in every 1,000 wake up during their operation. However, . an audit for the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) and the . Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) revealed last year that the figure could be more like one in every . 15,000. It is thought . most cases involve the patient being aware when they are being prepared . for the operation or when the operation itself has finished - rather . than during the actual operation. This . can occur because anaesthetists have to carefully balance giving a . patient enough of the drug to put them to sleep without giving them so . much it is harmful. 'It felt like hours but it was probably about five minutes I was awake for. At that point I just thought I was going to die. 'It . was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced. From what I . remember there were marking out with pens, but I thought they were . starting to cut me up.' Mrs Bythell, who is now heavily pregnant, was first told by doctors at Burnley General Hospital’s A&E she needed her appendix removed in September 2010 after suffering from abdominal pains whilst working as a psychiatric nurse. On the day of surgery, which took place at Royal Blackburn Hospital, she was taken to the anaesthetic room and told she would be put to sleep and that she should count backwards from 10. She said she remembers starting to count, but then believes she must have fallen asleep as the next thing she remembers is being wide awake while hospital staff were working around her, preparing for surgery. Her eyes were taped over, she had breathing tubes in her throat and, believing she had woken up mid-surgery, she began to panic as she could hear machines beeping and hear the medical personnel talking around her. She tried to alert the staff but she was unable to move because the drugs staff had administered paralysed her and she could hear them speaking about her size and weight. She then felt someone poking and prodding at her abdomen before there was a shout for more morphine and she fell back asleep. A Critical Incident Report by the hospital later concluded that it was human error in not checking a vaporiser, which was empty, rather than a fault on the machine. The anaesthetist subsequently wrote to Mrs Bythell to apologise and the NHS Trust admitted they were at fault and that she had suffered 'anaesthetic awareness'. Sarah Sharples, an expert medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘What happened to Alexandra is totally unacceptable. This was supposed to be a routine surgical procedure and she should have woken up after surgery safe in the knowledge that everything had gone well and she would make a full recovery. ‘Instead she woke up paralysed, thinking that she was actually in theatre and thinking that she was about to die. ‘She was left distraught over what had happened and why she had effectively woken up. ‘The experience has had a massive effect on Alexandra psychologically. She put her trust in NHS staff but sadly on this occasion she was let down. ‘It is crucial that the NHS Trust learns from this mistake and ensures that it cannot happen again. ‘This was not a faulty machine. This was a simple avoidable human error and it is crucial that systems are introduced to stop this happening again.’ Mrs Bythell was off work for a few months, eventually returning to work in January 2011, as she sought help for her PTSD. Mrs Bythell has now received compensation from the hospital trust to cover her lost earnings and to pay for her post-traumatic stress disorder treatment. Image shows the Royal Blackburn Hospital . She then had to learn to cope with panic attacks and feelings of anxiety on a daily basis. Throughout her recovery Mrs Bythell has suffered a number of relapses which have left her unable to work for a time. Dr Ian Stanley, Interim Executive Medical Director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We are very sorry for the distress experienced by Ms Bythell. 'We are pleased that a settlement has now been agreed and procedures have been put in place to reduce the chance of this happening again.'

'And the recent surge in travellers researching Correns on TripAdvisor is further proof of that. 'If you are planning a trip there though, you may have to form an orderly queue since it only has one hotel, or you can book one of the 55 holiday rentals currently listed on TripAdvisor.'

"In all his years on the pitch, former England footballer Gary Lineker was never even booked with a yellow card. But watching his home-town club Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 on Sunday, the Match of the Day presenter couldn’t quite contain his emotion - and may have stained his squeaky-clean image in the process. As he watched the relative minnows Leicester score more and more goals against the Premier League giants, his excitement was reflected in a series of foul-mouthed messages he posted on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Watching his home-town club Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 on Sunday, the Match of the Day presenter couldn’t quite contain his emotion . In all his years on the pitch, former England footballer Gary Lineker was never even booked with a yellow card . First he wrote ‘B***** hell!’, then ‘F****** hell!’ and then rounded it off with: ‘S*** on Man United!’ There were reports yesterday that the presenter - who fronts the Saturday night highlights programme that is supposed to present an impartial view of Premier League matches - was reprimanded by his BBC bosses. But 53-year-old Lineker later Tweeted to say this was not the case, while the BBC confirmed he had not even received a wrap over the knuckles. It all happened during the nail-biting match between Leicester City and Manchester United on Sunday afternoon, which ended in City winning 5-3 after being 3-1 down. The fightback secured their first victory against United since 1998. Lineker played for Leicester in the late 70s and 80s, and was made an honorary vice president after helping save the club from liquidation in 2002. Lineker posted his Tweets while becoming wrapped up in the drama. While the use of the F word may have been bad enough, the insult towards Manchester United - who are often the main focus of Match of the Day - may be considered more offensive. Lineker posted his Tweets while becoming wrapped up in the drama of Sunday's pulsating match . The fightback secured Leicester's first victory against United since 1998. Lineker played for Leicester in the late 70s and 80s, and was made an honorary vice president after helping save the club from liquidation in 2002 . There were reports yesterday that the presenter  was reprimanded by his BBC bosses but he denied that . Yesterday reports emerged that Lineker had been given a telling off by BBC bosses, but he appeared to kill off speculation by Tweeting: ‘Dear papers, if I can’t swear when Leicester come from 2 goals down to beat Man Utd 5-3 then I never can. Thanks though for your concern.’ The father-of-four, whose wife is Welsh model Danielle, later posted: ‘It possibly amuses you to make stuff up, but the BBC has never expressed concern to me about any of my tweets.’ And appearing to joke about the situation, Lineker then wrote: ‘Anyway enough of that! I’m done swearing until Leicester beat Manchester...f******...City.’ Last night a spokesperson for the BBC said Lineker was regularly reminded to Tweet responsibly, but that he had not on this occasion been ticked off for his potty mouth. The father-of-four, whose wife is Welsh model Danielle, was born in Leicester in 1960 and played 194 times for the club, before going on to represent Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham and Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan . The spokesperson said: ‘Gary’s is a personal twitter account but we regularly remind him of his responsibilities around football based tweets. He has not been reprimanded and he is not going to be reprimanded. That is the end of the matter.’ Lineker was born in Leicester in 1960, the son of a local greengrocer who had inherited his well-established business from his own father and grandfather. Lineker played 194 times as a striker for Leicester City, before going on to play for Everton, Barcelona, Tottenham and Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan. He is the second highest goalscorer for England and was the top scorer in the 1986 World Cup, . As well as forging a successful career as a broadcaster after his playing days ended, he still fronts the advertising campaigns for another well-known Leicester export - Walker’s Crisps.","Watching his home-town club Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 on Sunday, Lineker could not contain his emotion .

"He's been accused of sexually assaulting male masseurs - but today John Travolta was heaped with fresh embarrassment after photos surfaced of him cross-dressing. The Pulp Fiction star appears in full drag - and the pictures, published in this National Enquirer, are allegedly not for a film role. In the snaps, the 58-year-old actor is wearing a white dress, brown belt, fur stole, earrings and a necklace. A bra is even visible beneath the knit frock. New drama: New photos have surfaced of John Travolta in drag . He also wears a face full of makeup, including thick black eyeliner and pearly pink lipstick as well as a blonde wig pulled back into a ponytail. The photos were obtained by The National Enquirer from a party in Los Angeles that John attended in 1997, just six years after marrying Kelly Preston. Unhappy home life: Travolta's wife of over twenty years, Kelly Preston, is said to have moved out . In another bitter twist of fate, the magazine claims that his wife of over twenty years has left him in the wake of his cross-dressing scandal. A 'friend' of the actress' says: 'Kelly told me their marriage is over and made it clear that she's no longer living in the family home. 'She's put up with John's double life for decades while his behaviour remained in the shadows. 'But all this coming out in public has humiliated her. Kelly is absolutely destroyed.' No doubt his children, Ella, 12, and Benjamin, 18 months, will be affected by this recent scandal. John is certainly no stranger to dressing up in drag. He wore women's clothing on the big screen as Edna Turnblad in the 2007 silver screen adaptation of Broadway musical Hairspray. Though his tongue-in-cheek role had many laughing, this current photo scandal is certainly no laughing matter in the wake of recent reports that he sexually assaulted male masseurs. The New York Daily News reported today that one of the two accusers was offered $125,000 by Team Travolta to keep his mouth shut. Though the Get Shorty star's lawyer, Marty Singer, calls the claims 'completely false', John Truesdale is firmly standing by his story. The former US Army medic reportedly turned down the offer and hired celebrity crisis lawyer Gloria Allred. Travolta and family: John's kids Ella and Benjamin will no doubt be affected by this scandal . However, the 40-year-old black belt withdrew his $2 million federal lawsuit last week, as did the other accuser, who has not been identified and is referred to simply as 'John Doe No. 1.' Truesdale's innocence was called into question on Tuesday when his name was called into question in an unfavourable way. RadarOnline reported that he was fired from a North Carolina massage job eight years ago for being 'sexually inappropriate' with clients and co-workers. It was he who reported claims of misconduct on May 8 when he said that Travolta touched him inappropriately at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 16. For his part,  flight records and photos have placed Travolta 3,000 miles away from the alleged incident in California. Trousdale claims he got the dates wrong.","Masseur John Truesdale 'offered $125,000 by Team Travolta to keep quiet'"
"The show is yet to begin but Judy Murray has already posted the first selfie for Strictly 2014. Hours after the red carpet launch of the series, the mother of tennis champion Andy Murray huddled with her fellow celebrity contestants before forwarding the photo to her Twitter followers. The 54-year-old’s red sparkly dress with cut-away panels is a far cry from the outfits she usually wears on the side of the court. However, she is clearly relishing her moment in the spotlight. Cuddling close to the stars: Judy Murray posted the first selfie of the series on Twitter with the caption: 'Selfie from the red carpet launch of Strictly 2014. Hope you like it kids' Mrs Murray was joined by rivals including pop star Pixie Lott, 23, MasterChef host Gregg Wallace, 49, and TV presenter Caroline Flack, 34. But the contestant Mrs Murray appears to be fondest of is former Scottish rugby star Thom Evans, 29, who also features in several of her Twitter images which she posted ahead of a pre-record of the first show which will be seen by viewers on Sunday night. In one Tweet she wrote: ‘This is the only dude I want to beat on Strictly.......Thom Evans. Local derby. #SCD,’ alongside an image of the pair arm in arm. A short time later she posted a photograph of Evans being made up and wrote: ‘Thom Evans getting his slap on. He’s got his uber-sequinned shirt unbuttoned to the navel. Already. Desperate. #SCD.’ The contestant Mrs Murray appears to be fondest of is former Scottish rugby star Thom Evans, 29 (pictured) And when asked by a fan ‘who is this pretty man and where can I purchase one?’ Mrs Murray wrote: ‘It’s Thom Evans and I think u can buy him online. It all appeared to be a bit of a laugh for Mrs Murray. Evans retaliated to her good natured Tweets with an image of her getting her nails painted, writing: ‘Hmm.. I wonder who the pre- Madonna is in BBC Strictly?’ But the exchanges are likely to leave Mrs Murray’s tennis star son Andy Murray unamused. Last night the former Wimbledon champion was preparing to take on Novak Djokovic in the US Open quarter-finals. On the red carpet: Judy couldn't help but let out a beaming smile in her red dancing frock ahead of the shows . Earlier this year it was reported that Murray, 27, was embarrassed by his mother’s involvement in Strictly. A source told a national newspaper: ‘He’s embarrassed, mortified and doing everything he can to avoid being dragged to a live show. It’s all a bit OTT for him. He likes his downtime when he’s not on the court unless it’s charity stuff.’ Before Mrs Murray was confirmed as a Strictly contestant, she said in an interview: ‘It was on the front page of the papers during Wimbledon and Andy asked me about it. I said “no” and he said “thank God for that, you would be absolutely terrible.'","Mother of tennis stars Jamie and Andy Murray shows off red cut-away dress .

"There are certain tools a teacher can employ when dealing with unruly pupils, whether it’s a stern look or slightly raised voice or perhaps the threat of a detention. But for the head of Educating the East End’s Frederick Bremer, the greatest tactic is wearing sky-high stilettos, so she can tower over the teenagers in her school. Jenny Smith, 41, has admitted she stores several pairs of high heels under her desk in a specially designated ‘shoe cupboard’. Scroll down for video . The headteacher of Educating the East End's Frederick Bremer school, Jenny Smith, pictured, wears high heels so she can tower over teenagers in her school . Jenny Smith says she wears high heels as it means she is always several inches above even the tallest pupils in her coeducational community school (pictured is a scene from the programme) It means she is always several inches above even the tallest pupils in her coeducational community school. And she said the added height helps her command respect from insolent teens, despite not having the ‘natural authority’ of a male head. Ms Smith’s school is the subject of Educating the East End, which is Channel 4’s latest fly-on-the-wall documentary series. It follows Educating Essex in 2011 and Educating Yorkshire in 2013, both of which threw a spotlight on the challenges faced by teachers, the unruly behaviour of their pupils as well as stories involving personal hardships.

Ms Smith, pictured left with deputy head Miss Hillman, said she thought it was important for students to see women in top positions . Educating the East End follows the same format but this time the focus is on Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, east London. Speaking ahead of episode one tonight, Ms Smith said: ‘I do think there are challenges to being female. 'It’s a different set of challenges, not least the fact that most of the population of the school are considerably taller than me which is why I have to wear such ridiculous heels all day. ‘I think there are times when people don’t see that I have the natural authority because of my gender. Therefore it takes longer for me to assert that authority, partly because people aren’t used to female leaders, because there aren’t enough of us.’ In both the previous series the head teachers have been men. But Ms Smith said she thought it was important for students to see women in top positions. Frederick Bremer School is the subject of Educating the East End, which is Channel 4’s latest fly-on-the-wall documentary series . The opening episode features scenes of despairing teachers, teenagers answering back, and even a student calling her tutor a ‘d*******’. Ms Smith is pictured sitting behind her desk at the school . She said: ‘I think it’s a tremendous asset having a strong female team in a school. It’s brilliant for our kids to have strong female role models. 'It’s important for both the girls and the boys in this school to see women taking on jobs that aren’t usual, or that they haven’t experienced before. That was one of the reasons I was very, very keen on doing the programme.’ When Educating the East End begins tonight, it will perhaps be clear why Ms Smith and her staff might at times feel a lack of respect from the children in their care. The opening episode features scenes of despairing teachers, teenagers answering back, and even a student calling her tutor a ‘d*******’. One scene in the programme shows a pupil pushing himself around outside the school doors on an office chair (pictured) In the past the schools in the Educating series have been criticised for not effectively disciplining their students (pictured is a scene from the show) Educating the East End, which was filmed at Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, begins tonight on Channel 4 at 9pm . At one point a young teacher named Joe Bispham declares to his class he is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, before confiding in a fellow teacher that he is thinking about leaving his job, although Ms Smith has since claimed Mr Bispham was joking. The girls wear piercings and large amounts of make-up. And one student is seen being punished after uploading a semi-naked photo of a class-mate onto Facebook. In the past the schools in the Educating series have been criticised for not effectively disciplining their students. Last year Educating Yorkshire featured scenes of out of control classrooms and gangs ruling the playground at Thornhill Community Academy. In Educating Essex, teachers at Passmores School and Technology College were heard calling their students ‘scumbags’, while in one episode the head teacher was seen making a lewd hand gesture at his deputy.

"At 79 she is at the height of her powers, but Mary Berry is thinking about a time when she becomes too old to cope. The Great British Bake Off star said she would like it if her children could give her a pill to enable her to take her own life if she ‘lost her marbles’. Miss Berry, who also said she had no wish to live to 100, is the latest celebrity to voice support for legalising assisted suicide. Scroll down for video . 'I don't think very old age can be very nice': Mary Berry with her husband Paul Hunnings and their children Annabel and Thomas . Under current guidelines, if her son Thomas or daughter Annabel chose to help their mother die they would be committing a criminal offence. Her comments come as peers prepare to scrutinise the Assisted Dying Bill, promoted by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, in a House of Lords committee. The Bill aims to legalise the practice for some terminally ill patients. Miss Berry said: ‘I certainly don’t want to be a burden, although under British law you can do nothing about it. But I would love my children to be able to give me a pill, although of course I do understand that could be abused.’ Miss Berry has been investigating her family history as part of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? While appearing on Who Do You Think You Are? Miss Berry discovered that her great-great-grandfather Robert Houghton was a baker . Miss Berry's appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? is set to air on September 11 . Her mother Marjorie Berry died three years ago at the age of 105. That motivated the Bake Off star, who will turn 80 next March, to think about her future. ‘I have no desire to be a centenarian,’ she said. ‘I think 90 is a great time. You’ve had a good innings. You have to deal with the cards that have been dealt, of course, but I don’t think very old age, if you haven’t got your marbles, can be very nice. ‘My mother was in very good health until the last few months. And health is key, isn’t it?’ Marjorie Berry’s husband Alleyne died aged 85 in the 1990s. Miss Berry, who also said she had no wish to live to 100, is the latest celebrity to voice support for legalising assisted suicide . Speaking about how her mother coped with later life, Miss Berry told Radio Times: ‘My father was the leader of the family and we thought she would go downhill after he died, but far from it. ‘She was very cross that everyone kept dying around her – “Another member of the bridge team gone”, that sort of thing. She drove her car until she was 95, when we had to persuade the doctor to say she couldn’t do it any longer.’ Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in Britain, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison, although guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges. Last night pressure groups on both sides of the debate reacted to Miss Berry’s comments. Miss Berry made her comments in this month's issue of the Radio Times . Alistair Thompson, from Care Not Killing, said: ‘This is deeply depressing for such a well-loved celebrity like Mary Berry to speak out in favour of legalising euthanasia. It is clear that her reasons for backing euthanasia relate to her fear of becoming a burden. It is this reason that means we should never change the law.’ However Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity In Dying, welcomed Miss Berry’s contribution. ‘A change in the law on assisted dying would give people who are terminally ill and mentally competent the choice to control the manner and timing of their death,’ she said. ‘[It] would mean dying people would no longer have to take drastic measures behind closed doors, and that family members would not have to risk prosecution to help a loved one to die.’ In recent months a string of well-known names have backed assisted dying. Actress Jane Asher, 68, said she would have no hesitation in attending the Swiss euthanasia clinic Dignitas if she had an ‘unbearable’ terminal illness. Singer Cilla Black, 71, has also said she supports the clinic. TV hosts Judy Finnigan, 66, and husband Richard Madeley, 58, have agreed an assisted death pact should one fall seriously ill. In recent months Miss Berry – whose third child, William, died in a car crash at the age of 19 – has been investigating her family history as part of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are? Among her discoveries were that her great-great-grandfather Robert Houghton was a baker, something she had never known before. Her episode of Who Do You Think You Are? will be broadcast on BBC1 on September 11 at 9pm.","TV celebrity said she would like it if her children could give her a pill to enable her to take her own life if she ‘lost her marbles’

"High street winner: Miss Berry in the bomber jacket fans loved . She has already amassed a multi-million-pound fortune thanks to her bakeware and cookbook empire. Now Mary Berry wants to launch a fashion range for older women because she dislikes modern trends such as low-cut tops, which can reveal skin that is ‘all wrinkled down there’, and ‘dreadful’ jegging trousers. The Great British Bake Off star, 79, has attracted as many headlines for her style credentials as she has for her cake-making skills. Giving an interview in which she revealed her plans, Miss Berry said: ‘I’ve been thinking about that and I’d like to do a range for somebody like Jaeger or MaxMara. I would do good, stylish cuts in durable fabrics that hem well and don’t crease – that’s why I never wear linen, because I like things to look pristine.’ Miss Berry criticised modern fashions such as micro-shorts, saying: ‘They’re dreadful. Dreadful! And I think jeggings and leggings are no good on most women, either – certainly not older women. Obviously women can do what they like, but I wouldn’t dream of wearing them.’ Miss Berry made headlines for her fashion choices after wearing a series of high street blazers on Bake Off. It started in 2012 with a floral bomber jacket, which cost £29.99 at Zara. Hundreds of Twitter users demanded to know where she bought it. And since then sales of designs she has worn have soared, some high street brands have reported. But despite being an apparent trendsetter, Miss Berry said she struggles to find clothes she likes because few retailers cater for her age group. Speaking to Glamour magazine, she said: ‘Well, I hope that I dress for my age. Because there’s no need to be dowdy, is there? ‘But most things are totally unsuitable for somebody of 79. You have to really hunt at my age because an arm is not beautiful at this stage. Also a fairly high neck is a good thing.’ She added of low-cut tops: ‘I don’t like to see it all wrinkled down there … but if you’ve got a good bra, then it’s OK.’ Miss Berry, who lives with her husband Paul Hunnings in a £2million house in Buckinghamshire, earns an estimated £200,000 annual salary for appearing on BBC1’s Bake Off, plus a further sum for presenting her solo show Mary Berry Cooks on BBC2. In the past eight years she is believed to have made £2.3million from sales of her cookbooks, while last year her sauces and chutneys earned her £1.2million. She reportedly has five-figure kitchenware deals with Lakeland and Sainsbury’s. The October edition of Glamour magazine is out on Monday.

"Watching her mother battle pancreatic cancer, Alison Steadman yesterday revealed she considered giving her a lethal injection of drugs. Opening up about the clearly painful memory of her mother Marjorie, the actress, 68, admitted she thought it would be ‘kind to let her go’ and end the agony she was in. The mother-of-three, who died at home at the age of 82, had advanced pancreatic cancer and doctors had told her there was nothing more that could be done. Watching her mother battle pancreatic cancer, Alison Steadman yesterday revealed she considered giving her a lethal injection of drugs . Under current guidelines had one of Mrs Steadman’s daughters chosen to help her end her life, they would have been committing a criminal offence. But giving an interview Miss Steadman, who is best known in recent years for starring in BBC comedy Gavin & Stacey, admitted the thought crossed her mind one night towards the end of her mother’s battle. She said: ‘I just felt one night in particular I could have given her an injection because it would have been kind to let her go. But then I don’t know, it’s terribly difficult. But I think there should be more and more discussion and I just think other countries do it better.’ Miss Steadman’s experience of watching her mother die has helped her prepare for her latest television role. She stars in The Secrets, which is a series of five dramas for the BBC that share the common theme of a dilemma. In her 30-minute episode Miss Steadman plays a cancer patient who asks her daughter – a pregnant veterinary surgeon played by Olivia Colman – to help her die. Miss Steadman, who is best known in recent years for starring in BBC comedy Gavin & Stacey, admitted the thought crossed her mind one night towards the end of her mother's battle to 'end it with an injection' Asked whether she could imagine asking her sons Toby, 35, or Leo, 33, or her partner, Welsh actor Michael Elwyn, 72, to help her die, Miss Steadman, who found fame in Z Cars and Abigail’s Party, said: ‘We never know what we might do until we’re faced with it. I’m a terrible coward of all things medical, if I had my way I’d never see a doctor, never have an anaesthetic. I’m a terrible coward of dentists, I’m ridiculously bad about it. 'So I can’t imagine myself doing that. But listen, if you knew you were going to be in agonising pain and have a nightmarish few months, or you could just quietly take a drink and hug your daughter and just quietly drift off… maybe one would choose that.’ Miss Steadman’s comments come as peers prepare to scrutinise the Assisted Dying Bill, promoted by Lord Falconer, in a House of Lords committee. It aims to legalise the practice for some terminally ill patients.

A cat or a dog, we don’t let them suffer, but we let human beings suffer. I think it’s a very dangerous area to go into if you just start saying “oh we’ll just give so and so an injection”. Of course it’s a very dangerous situation. But there are some situations where someone is so ill and suffering so much that if you allow one, two and three doctors to all give their separate opinion and then discuss it with the person who’s ill and their relatives, a lot of people would be put out of their misery and with dignity.’ The Secrets: The Dilemma begins on Sunday at 10.40pm on BBC1.

"It claims to be searching for ‘the next singing superstar’. But as viewers tuned in to watch The X Factor on Saturday, many were left thinking the programme was more interested in advertising. Just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing, during the 1 hour 25 minute programme. Scroll down for video . 'Advert Factor': Just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing, during the 1 hour 25 minute programme while adverts were given a larger chunk of the total time, taking up 21 minutes 35 seconds . Adverts were given a larger chunk of the total time, taking up 21 minutes 35 seconds, while the programme began five minutes behind schedule due to a lengthy string of commercials. The remaining 48 minutes was made up of chatter between judges, video clips of contestants and host Dermot O’Leary offering support backstage. And it amounted to a small amount of actual singing being screened during what is ITV’s flagship entertainment show. Among the commercials were several L’Oreal adverts, featuring judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, and after the programme had ended there was a Costa Bingo one featuring Mel B, 39. Taking to Twitter, one viewer wrote: ‘The X factor has more TV adverts than actual auditions what a joke,’ while another noted: ‘The worst thing about X factor is the 6,000,000 Advert breaks.’ ‘Look forward to seeing the next 3 auditions within the next 45 minutes... # xfactor,’ one quipped sarcastically. Some suggested the programme be renamed ‘The Advert Factor’. And others admitted deliberately missing the programme when it was broadcast at 8pm, so they could watch it on catch up later on and fast forward through the adverts. ‘Watching X factor on catch up, adverts destroy the programme,’ one wrote, while another posted: ‘Note to self: X factor must only ever be watched on catch up! [Fast forward through] adverts, judges, all the chit chat c*** and BOOM a tidy 30min show.’ However, while catch up services on televisions allow viewers to skip past advertisements, anyone trying to watch the first episode of series 11 on ITV Player would have been forced to watch the commercials. Online, the programme was divided into five sections, with viewers unable to move from one to the next without sitting through three or four adverts. The lack of viewer support will come as a blow for ITV bosses, who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of The X Factor . The lack of viewer support will come as a blow for ITV bosses, who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of The X Factor. Next week the programme will go head to head with Strictly Come Dancing, when the celebrity dance contest begins on BBC1. On Twitter viewers discussed which one they would choose to watch, with one writing: ‘Watch Strictly, record X factor, then you can fast forward all of the adverts.’ It is not the first time ITV has been hit with accusations of too many commercial breaks in its programmes. The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, and period drama Downton Abbey have all faced similar claims in the past. Earlier this year viewers complained that Britain’s Got Talent, which is Simon Cowell’s other talent show, was cutting to an advert break after almost every performance.

"They have never been the most conventional of couples. But even for Sam Taylor-Johnson, 47, and her husband Aaron, 24, alarming your neighbours with an M16 assault rifle takes some beating. A passer-by spotted the weapon through a basement window of the £15million London home owned by the artist-turned-director and her actor husband – triggering a full-scale raid by armed police. Scroll down for video . Shock raid: Armed police raided the £15.5 million home Sam Taylor-Johnson shares with her husband Aaron in  north London, after a passer-by spotted the deactivated rifle (right) on a desk through the window . It was only after a dozen heavily armed officers had stormed the property – detaining two innocent bystanders for an hour in the meantime – that the riddle of the high-powered weapon was explained. The couple’s agent revealed the M16 rifle was a ‘certified and fully decommissioned’ one given to Mrs Taylor-Johnson by, of all unlikely things, an international peace charity. According to a Metropolitan Police source, the couple now face being talked to by officers for wasting police time and resources. They will also be advised that leaving the rifle in full view of the street was ‘irresponsible’. Neither Mrs Taylor-Johnson, who is directing the film version of Fifty Shades Of Grey, nor her husband, best known for wielding an array of lethal weapons in the gory Kick-Ass films, was at home when the incident happened. The alarm was triggered shortly before midnight when a man claiming to be an ex-Iranian soldier spotted the M16 rifle on an office table in the basement window of their home in North London. A neighbour, Phil Cowan, 47, was passing at the time and saw armed officers swoop on the house. He said: ‘I was just walking my dog and saw an old man looking down into the couple’s basement window. ‘I looked down and was shocked at what I saw – a gun lying on a desk. ‘The older gentleman said he was an ex-Iranian soldier and said it was a machine gun. He called the police. Two minutes later we were bundled into the back of an unmarked police car. ‘Then a whole load of armed police came. I’ve never seen anything like it. They covered the area brandishing guns. Nobody appeared to be in to let them into the property so they deliberately let the alarm off. Artwork: The gun was given to Mrs Taylor-Johnson after she contributed to a charity anti-arms exhibition . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Local officers and officers from the Met’s Firearms Unit attended and were let into the property to examine the firearm. It was confirmed that the firearm was a deactivated M16 rifle.’ ‘They then had to wake up a magistrate judge to get a warrant to enter the property. I believe they broke in round the back. When I returned the next morning, the gun was gone from the desk.’ He added: ‘I think it’s shocking that so much police time and money was wasted. As a resident in the same street here for almost 20 years I am appalled that anyone should think it’s acceptable behaviour to possess guns of this type – much less leave them on public display. ‘The area is a family orientated one with low crime and a great sense of community.’ A police spokesman later said officers did not break into the property because they were let in by a friend with a key. Yesterday the couple’s spokesman said the gun had been given to Mrs Taylor-Johnson by the charity Peace One Day, which turns decommissioned rifles into works of art to promote non-violence, and was in her basement studio. Mrs Taylor-Johnson, formerly known as Sam Taylor-Wood, began working with Peace One Day in 2012 when she and a number of other artists agreed to transform an AK-47 assault rifle into a work of art. They are now working on a similar project involving M16 assault rifles.","Police raided £15.5m home Sam Taylor-Johnson shares with husband Aaron .

"LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes. Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes. A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy. Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968 . Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’ Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka. In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made. The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine. It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger. Sir Roger (pictured in 2013) was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes last year and can no longer drink martinis . In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said. Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live. He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’ Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year. He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup. Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition. Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’ In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted.","Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes .

"Corn Silk face powder is currently second on Amazon's list of best-selling face powders thanks to its selfie-friendly properties . When it first hit the shelves in the Sixties, it claimed to offer women a lasting glow without turning their faces ‘muddy’. Now Corn Silk face powder is making a comeback, supposedly because it leaves women with a ‘selfie-friendly’ finish. The old-fashioned product costs just £6.72, and is currently number two on Amazon’s list of best-selling face powders. According to make-up artist Aimee Adams, this is because it gives women a muted glow, similar to the flattering soft-focus filters on the photo-sharing website Instagram. Miss Adams, 47, has worked with celebrities such as Helen Mirren, Madonna, Elle Macpherson and Tess Daly. She also counts Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice and the Duchess of York among her clients. Yesterday the beauty expert said: ‘Back when I started doing make-up 26 years ago, I remember having this one particular photographer and he used to turn to me and say “why do you look in sort of soft focus?” ‘And it was the powder. It looks like you’ve been filtered. It’s the kind of look people now try to get by using filters on Instagram.’ Miss Adams discovered Corn Silk in a pharmacy in Texas, where she grew up, and has been using it ever since. At the beginning of her career she had to ship it over from America. But it is now sold in Boots – and is far cheaper than its high-end alternatives, which can cost more than £25. Beauty expert Aimee Adams says the powder produces the sort of soft-focus effect as filters on Instagram . Miss Adams said: ‘I don’t meet other make-up artists all that often but when I do they always ask me what’s your desert island product and I tell them it’s Corn Silk. And so many of them go “oh my God mine too”. ‘It takes all the oiliness off but it gives you a real glow. It never goes cakey. If someone’s really, really sweaty I can powder their nose 50 times and it never looks like they have powder on.’ When Corn Silk came out in the 1960s, there were few face powders on the market, and what was available would often leave skin feeling cakey and smothered. Back then the new product was considered revolutionary, claiming to ‘keep you looking great long after ordinary pressed powder lets your make-up go all melty and muddy’. Corn Silk costs just £6.72, a bargain compared with high-end alternatives that can cost more than £25 .","Corn Silk powder promised '60s women a lasting glow without going cakey .

"She has suffered the trauma of one miscarriage and one stillbirth. Now Amanda Holden has sworn never to try for more children because she doesn’t want to ‘put my family through that again.’ The Britain’s Got Talent presenter, 43, has two daughters - Lexi, eight, and Hollie, two, - with her husband Chris Hughes. Scroll down for video. I'm done: Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has told how she came close to death during the birth of her youngest child . But before her second birth she suffered years of heartbreak, having a miscarriage in 2010 and a stillborn son the following year. She said she ‘came close to death’ when Hollie was born in 2012 after suffering a huge loss of blood and spending three days in intensive care. Miss Holden told Essentials magazine: ‘If I could, I would have more kids, but I can’t put my family through that again. Chris and I were talking about this the other day, saying how if we’d met earlier we’d have had more kids, but that you end up with the ones you’re meant to have.

She added: ‘BGT gave me the financial freedom not to have to worry about working all the time – and I could do it around my kids.’ From September, Miss Holden will stand in for This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby while she is away on maternity leave. She said the breakfast show will fit perfectly around her family routine, adding: ‘I’ll be back to pick Lexi up from school, and Hollie’s at nursery a few days a week.’ Talking about her husband, who works as a record producer, she said: : ‘He says he’s last on the family list after the hamster. It’s not true. I love that man. I couldn’t do any of this without him because he’s my core. ‘We try for date nights, we really do, but usually we’re so tired we end up lying in front of a box set in our PJs. Actually, that’s pretty much my idea of bliss.’ Speaking about the pain of her stillbirth Miss Holden said last year: ‘From somewhere in the hospital, I could hear the most horrendous screams. I presumed it was from the labour ward until I realised I could hear my daughter’s name, ""Lexi, Lexi, Lexi!"" being shouted out animalistically. ‘It was me wailing and making the most horrific guttural noises.

"Series two of 'The Village', which begins next month, will have a far lighter tone and scenes of cocktail parties. Pictured is Harriet Kilmartin, played by Lucy Brown . It was so bleak it turned viewers off and was even dubbed a ‘rural EastEnders’. But those who tune in for the second series of The Village will be met with a far lighter tone and scenes of cocktail parties, outdoor sports and weddings. Series two, which begins next month, leaves the grim reality of World War I and moves into the roaring twenties where jazz and motor cars are making an appearance. There’s Harriet Kilmartin, played by Lucy Brown, behind the wheel in her leathers – a certain sign of changing times, for cars were a rarity back then and a female driver was almost unheard of. She is among the new characters for the second series, so too is a boxer named Ghana Jones – the first black character to appear. Then there’s Bert Middleton played by Tom Varey, whose family is at the centre of the period drama, laughing as his friends hoist him on their shoulders. And even stoic old John Middleton, the abusive drunk played by John Simms who beat his wife and sons, demonstrates a softer side as he gives a new-born calf mouth-to-mouth and tells Grace Middleton, played by Maxine Peake, ‘I love you’. Mr Middleton is now a dairy farmer, helped by his youngest – and only surviving – son, Bert, and while life remains hard it seems smiles are the order of the day. The bleak atmosphere of the first series was blamed in part on a particularly harsh winter experienced in the Peak District where the drama is filmed. But the second series saw much calmer weather as it was shot in the spring and summer. And it certainly makes for lighter viewing than series one, which was criticised for being too miserable and mocking ‘the Grim North’. Last year, episode one attracted 8.17 million viewers. But by the sixth and final instalment interest had dwindled and just 5.48 million tuned in to watch. The second season leaves the grim reality of World War I. Pictured, British soldiers firing a machine gun from behind a hedge in the snow in December 1914 . Scenes of grief, depression and violence and themes of alcoholism and canings in school amounted to a ‘miseryfest’ according to many commenting online. Taking to social networking site Twitter at the time one wrote: ‘The Village is depressing viewing for a Sunday evening. Not sure if I’ll tackle the next episode. It’ll all end in tears.’ Another posted: ‘Don’t think I can watch any more of The Village - want to end the week on a high not a low.’ And it seems the BBC has taken their comments on board. Highlights from the first episode of season two will include a jovial ‘man hunt’ in which Lord Kilmartin, played by Julian Sands, and his peers chase Bert Middleton over fields and through cobbled streets, offering him a prize of £5 if he can escape. And there is a boxing match in which men try to survive a round in the ring against boxer Ghana Jones, played by Daniel Ezra. Meanwhile the wealthy Allinghams, whose family represent the aristocracy, have moved to a grander house and episode one sees Edmund Allingham hosting a party for Lord Kilmartin, his political sponsor. Later on in the series viewers can expect to see some weddings. And gaggles of friends sharing beers and jokes in the local pub are not an uncommon sight. The Village is set in an unnamed Derbyshire village and was filmed in locations around the Peak District. Episodes are told through the eyes of Bert Middleton aged 100, looking back on his life. Speaking ahead of the series launch, writer Peter Moffat praised the rural landscape. He said: ‘The heartbreakingly beautiful countryside is the twenty ninth character in The Village and arguably it’s the biggest role. ‘The more time I spend up in Edale and around Hayfield and Glossop the more I love this rugged, beautiful, honest part of England and the more I understand how passionately people felt about it then and how much they care about it now.’ The Village is expected to be scheduled in a prime time Sunday night slot on BBC1. It will for six episodes, starting in August.","BBC drama 'The Village' was blasted for grim story lines by viewers .

"BBC One was accused yesterday of ‘playing it safe’ and urged to take ‘creative risks’ with its prime time schedule, which is dominated by long-running programmes. In a report into the channel’s output, the BBC Trust said peak viewing had been taken over by soaps and factual series – many of which were more than 10 years old – rather than new content. Following publication of the review yesterday, the BBC was urged to create more original content, which was one of its ‘core principles’. Dominated: The One Show, which launched in 2007, takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours . Long-running: EastEnders, which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights, takes up 14 per cent . Assessing the performance of all BBC channels, the trust’s report singled out prime time BBC One, noting that almost two thirds of its 7pm to 9pm slot is dominated by the same 10 programmes. All but one of the programmes are at least five years old. The One Show, which launched in 2007, takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours, while EastEnders, which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights, takes up 14 per cent. Antiques Roadshow, which has been running for 35 years, and Panorama, which began in 1953, were also among the ten most-broadcast programmes for the time slot. The others were Holby City, The Voice UK, Countryfile, Watchdog, A Question of Sport and Waterloo Road, which will end next year. About 5,000 people were surveyed for the review, which found that the average age for BBC One viewers is 59, up from 56 in 2010-2011. BBC Two has seen a similar rise, with an average age of 60 – up by two years. Both channels are losing viewers in the 16-34 age range. BBC trustee David Liddiment said the trust did not want to replace the dominant programmes in prime time, but to make additions. He added that BBC One ‘shouldn’t be a succession of high-risk shows just for the sake of it’ but admitted that the dominance of the ten shows meant that a ‘significant number of potential viewers’ were not being served by the channel. ‘BBC television is fulfilling its commitment to deliver a wide range of enjoyable and entertaining programmes and in the past few years there has been an increase in the perceptions of originality across all channels,’ he said. ‘However, the trust believes that BBC One should take more creative risks while serving wider audiences and has asked the executive to set out how it will increase the distinctiveness of schedules.’ The report by the trust states there are ‘wide audience perceptions of the channel being too reliant on familiar titles’ and tending to ‘play it safe’ with programming and scheduling. Same old shows: A Question of Sport (left) and Countryfile (right) also dominate the 7pm to 9pm slot . A much higher number of new programmes are broadcast after 9pm but Mr Liddiment said there was still a need for ‘greater innovation in factual programming’ and ‘a refreshment of entertainment’ in the nighttime slot. He added that the BBC needed to do more to appeal to younger viewers and minority ethnic groups. Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who serves on the Commons Media Select Committee, said he was not surprised by the trust’s findings and added to calls for more original content. ‘To some extent I would like the BBC to concentrate more on that,’ he said. ‘If it means fewer channels with more original content then that might well be a way forward. Providing new and original content is one of the core principles of the BBC. ‘There is plenty of programming from the past that people do want to see, but there are so many ways you can access that through commercial channels and through archives. I think people look to the BBC for new, original drama and comedy.’ Mr Liddiment said the biggest challenge for the BBC was ‘to keep as many people watching as possible’ and that there should be ‘something for everybody’. He also hinted there may be a rise in entertainment programmes such as The Voice UK. Dismay: Four Panorama reporters have lost their jobs . There were fears for the future of Panorama last night after its four reporters, who together have more than half a century of experience making the programme, lost their jobs. There were said to have been scenes of ‘dismay’ as they were told by new editor Ceri Thomas that their jobs no longer exist. Shelley Jofre, Paul Kenyon, Raphael Rowe and John Sweeney have won several awards but will now have to find alternative roles within the BBC or leave the corporation altogether. The programme will instead be staffed by news reporters and presenters such as Fiona Bruce. An insider claimed the Panorama team were assured that their jobs were safe. ‘There was a cold, icy silence when the news was announced,’ said the insider. ‘We had been told for weeks and weeks that our jobs would be safe and then last night [Wednesday] we got an email saying to come in in the morning and that’s when they told us. We have six months. ‘Ceri Thomas is the new editor and they have almost certainly brought him in just to do this. We’ve all got years of experience whereas he has been in the job less than a month. ‘How can he tell us that the way forward is to get rid of all the people who’ve made the most Panoramas? How can he justify that?’ Panorama is the world’s longest-running current affairs television programme, having first been shown in 1953. The cuts are part of a restructuring that will result in the BBC’s news operation shedding more than 200 jobs, including around 80 in the newsroom.","BBC One has been accused of 'playing it safe' with long-running programmes .

"TV personality Millie Mackintosh has attempted to defend her recent selfie which caused uproar after husband Professor Green joked she was a ‘thinspiration’. The former Made In Chelsea star claimed she was surprised that her rapper partner’s comments had been taken out of context and it wouldn’t stop her from posting nearly nude pictures again in the future. Speaking during a phone interview on Loose Women on Thursday she said of the picture which showed her looking slim in her underwear: ‘I am surprised that it’s been taken out of context. I think I look healthy in the picture. Defence: Millie Mackintosh defended her decision to post this image during a chat with the Loose Women on Thursday . picture which she posted online. Her husband quickly joked that she was a 'thinspiration' - a term favoured by followers of pro-anorexia websites . ‘I know that I look slim but I think you can see I’ve got muscle definition. I think if I was putting pictures up of my ribs sticking out and bones showing like I looked unhealthily thin, then I’d say of course I was being irresponsible.’ The Quality Street heiress insisted: ‘I think anyone that looked at that picture would not say I was anorexic or looked anorexic.’ Explaining to panellists Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore and Myleene Klass her reasons for posting the selfie, she said: ‘I was there for a photoshoot doing a swimwear shoot and I was feeling really proud of my body as I’ve been working out really hard to feel really good on the day and I don’t promote unhealthy dieting. Backlash: Millie Mackintosh with husband Professor Green. A spokesperson from eating disorders charity b-eat said celebrities have a responsibility to think about the body image messages they are sending out . ‘I’m really into the gym and a healthy lifestyle and I am always promoting that on my twitter and instagram. If you generally follow my instagram you’ll see that I am constantly hashtagging ‘strong not skinny’, posting loads of food pictures.’ Asked by the panel why husband Professor Green had used the term ‘thinspiration’ to comment on the picture, she insisted: ‘He was clearly taking the mickey out of me for posting the picture of myself nearly naked. I’m obviously not his thinspiration.’ And when asked if would think twice about posting bikini or underwear pictures in future, she defiantly answered:  ‘I will keep sharing my fitness and workout tips but I am still going to be spreading the message that this isn’t about being skinny, it’s about being strong and healthy and I’m actually going to put up a blog post today.’ Her husbands comment and the term ‘thinspiration’, which is favoured by followers of pro-anorexia websites, provoked a backlash from anorexia campaigners. Miss Mackintosh, who regularly shares images of herself training at a gym, replied ‘fitspiration!’ Experts on Wednesday accused the pair of encouraging young girls to starve themselves. Dozens of Twitter users immediately echoed Professor Green’s comments with one writing: ‘I need Millie Mackintosh’s figure #thinspiration,’ while another wrote: ‘Millie Mackintosh is my thinspiration, absolute worldie #girlcrush.’ Many said they were heading for the gym after seeing the image, or embarking on a diet, and begged Miss Mackintosh to share her slimming secrets. Miss Mackintosh, 24,  joins a growing number of celebrities including Victoria Beckham, model Miranda Kerr and TV presenter Alexa Chung who have become part of a trend dubbed ‘thin-stagram’ whereby they post pictures on Instagram in which they appear worryingly slender. Many of them have also been labelled ‘thinspiration’ by eating disorder sufferers in the past, who aspire to be just as slim. On Wednesday a spokesperson from eating disorders charity b-eat said celebrities have a responsibility to think about the body image messages they are sending out. The spokesperson said:  ‘With the growth of social media sites comes more pressure on individuals to aspire to often unhealthy and even dangerously underweight role models. Role model: One of the tweets sent in response to the Quality Street heiress' picture. Dozens of Twitter users immediately echoed Professor Green's comments with one writing: 'I need Millie Mackintosh's figure' Those in the public eye with the opportunity to encourage and influence should remember that they are icons for many young people and think responsibly about the messages they are conveying. ‘All too . often we hear of young people damaging their health by trying to emulate . celebrity role models with the added danger of the possibility of . developing an eating disorder causing future serious health . consequences.’ It is not the first time Miss Mackintosh has been dubbed a ‘thinspiration’. In 2012 Nicola Ross wrote on Twitter: . Fitness fanatic: The former Made In Chelsea star frequently posts photos of herself exercising on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. Young girls took to Twitter asking Mackintosh how they could be slim like her . ‘Heading to my first gym class again in weeks, please be kind to me. Millie Mackintosh you are my thinspiration.’ Lauren Kinsella posted: ‘I am going to print off pictures of Millie Mackintosh and put them in my room and on the fridge to stop me from eating #thinspiration.’ Miss Mackintosh married Professor Green, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, in September last year at Babington House in Somerset.","Millie Mackintosh spoke on Loose Women to defend bikini picture .

"Buy a bottle of Smirnoff and you will expect to get a high-quality vodka. But what’s in the bottle could cost you your life. Britain’s shops are awash with counterfeit spirits made from lethal chemicals including chloroform and methylated spirits, an investigation has found. The concoction is putting thousands of drinkers at risk of blindness, organ failure and even death. Scroll down for video . Black Market Britain: An undercover investigation by Channel 5 infiltrated the crime gangs behind the trade and found one factory in east London producing bottles of fake Smirnoff. Others sold rip-off designer goods . And because it is perfectly packaged, consumers have no way of telling the bottles from genuine brands. An undercover investigation by Channel 5 infiltrated the crime gangs behind the trade and found one factory in east London producing 7,000 fake bottles of Smirnoff vodka a day. The criminals use the latest machinery to repackage the bottles with perfect labels replicating leading brands. And the trade is the tip of a counterfeit iceberg that includes rip-off designer handbags and clothing, and counterfeit cigarettes. Paul Connolly, the journalist behind the investigation, managed to infiltrate some of the organised gangs behind the black market. ‘This is a huge and growing problem,’ he said yesterday. ‘And it is sinister, because the bottles are often filled with toxic chemicals. The bottles they make look so realistic they would be almost impossible to spot by an untrained eye. Fooling consumers: Criminal gangs make perfect replicas of labels from brands including Smirnoff . 'And given that the factory is producing on such a large scale, it’s almost certain they are being sold in supermarkets as well as smaller off-licences.’ Mr Connolly also found a thriving trade in counterfeit and smuggled cigarettes. The tobacco was packaged to look like leading brands such as Marlboro, but in some cases contained rat droppings and asbestos. In Manchester, he uncovered a network of shops selling rip-off designer goods, including fake Armani, Mulberry and Gucci handbags and purses, and clothing with fake Adidas, Nike and Ralph Lauren logos. Many of the clothes are imported from Pakistan, then have designer labels applied in warehouses guarded by bouncers and ‘spotters’ employed to watch for undercover policemen. Mr Connolly said: ‘We all love a bargain and you don’t really think of the consequences, but this is going all the way up to organised crime and groups of gangsters. ‘People don’t really understand the gravity and the size and the scale of the black market here.’ Last month, it was reported that seizures of counterfeit alcohol by trading standards authorities had soared fivefold in five years. Fake goods reportedly cost the UK economy £1.3billion a year in lost profits and tax.

"She has done the Six O' Clock News and is still famously poised presenting the Ten O’Clock. But Fiona Bruce has let slip a small guilty secret... she slips out for a snifter between bulletins. New Broadcasting House is directly opposite the Langham Hotel, and the presenter has confessed she likes to go for a cocktail during the evening. Secret: Newsreader Fiona Bruce has let slip a small guilty secret - that she slips out for a cocktail between the 6pm and 10pm bulletins . Today Miss Bruce, 50, who has worked for the BBC since 1989 presenting programmes including Crimewatch and Antiques Roadshow, reveals how she winds down in the hotel’s bar in an interview for Radio Times. By the time she has finished News at Six she has already spent several hours at work, with more still to come. She said: ‘if I’m doing the six o’clock and 10 o’clock bulletins, I can slip out in between to the Langham hotel bar across the road and have an evening cocktail. I only ever have the one.’ Location: New Broadcasting House is directly opposite the Langham Hotel (pictured), and the presenter has confessed she likes to go for a cocktail during the evening . It’s no wonder Langham’s Artesian bar is popular with Miss Bruce. It was crowned the World’s Best Bar 2013 by Drinks International. All cocktails cost £16.50 and range . from classics such as a mojito, daiquiri, Classic Champagne Cocktail to . more ‘innovative’ flavours and names available on the Butterfly Wheel . menu including Secrets & Lies (Glenmorangie Ealanta, Noilly Prat, . Pomegranate, Roase, Citrus) and  Beach Affairs (Martini Rosso, Campari, . Juniper, Mandarin & Froken). Speaking . to Radio Times, Miss Bruce also said she worries about her daughter . Mia, 12, growing up in a world where ‘hideously misogynistic stuff’ is . posted about women on social media. Fear: Speaking to Radio Times, Miss Bruce said she worries about her daughter Mia, 12, growing up in a world where 'hideously misogynistic stuff' is posted about women on social media . The presenter, who also has a son named Sam, 16, with her husband Nigel Sharrocks, said: ‘I’m astonished at the freedom with which a depressingly large number of men feel they can just say what they want and write the most hideously misogynistic stuff about women. ‘I look at my daughter and think, “God, I . didn’t think this was coming your way.” I really didn’t. The misogyny . on the internet is a whole area that you and I would never have thought . was coming.’ Miss Bruce went on to say it astounds her . when people stop her on the street to comment on the clothes she wears, . saying ‘you think, “I really don’t like what you’re wearing either”’. Speaking out: Miss Bruce revealed how she winds down in the hotel's bar in an interview for Radio Times . And the newsreader, who appeared in FHM’s Sexiest Women list five years ago, said the men she works with are not judged in the same way about how they dress. She said: ‘They’re all good-looking men - I can’t think of a male presenter who isn’t a good-looking bloke - but, you know, they’re not judged by their suits and ties.’ In the past Miss Bruce has admitted dying her hair to cover up any grey strands because she realised ‘age is an issue’ in television. A report last year found there are just 25 women aged over 50, out of 413 regular BBC presenters. Selina Scott, 63, and Anna Ford, 70, are among other high-profile female broadcasters to have complained about their treatment by television networks. But Miss Bruce said any fears she had about turning 50 were put into perspective when her close friend Nick Milligan and his eight-year-old daughter Emily were killed in a horrific motorboat accident last year. She said: ‘Because such a very, very good friend of mine died very young, far from being sad about the fact that I’m 50, I think: “Hurray, I’m 50 - and I’m still here,” ‘There’s nothing like that to put everything else into perspective. So there was no existential angst at all. It was all just a joy.’ If she does leave the BBC, Miss Bruce said she would like to become a magistrate. She said: ‘I’d very much like to become a magistrate. I’ve thought about doing it part-time while I’m working here, but I don’t have time.’","Presenter visits the Langham Hotel between evening bulletins for a cocktail .

"With their distinctive brown uniforms, prim manners and old-fashioned sewing skills, they may look like a throwback to a bygone age. But the graduates of elite nanny school Norland College have had to learn to adapt to our more violent times. The prestigious institution – which has supplied childcare to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Mick Jagger – now teaches its students skills that are more often associated with James Bond than with Mary Poppins. Scroll down for video . The graduates of Britain's Poshest Nannies are the subject of a new documentary on ITV tomorrow night . From evasive driving to help them escape from ambushes, to martial arts while pushing a pram, it is training a new generation of ninja nannies able protect the children of the rich and famous. A new ITV documentary has been granted exclusive access to the school in Bath, Somerset, and followed a class of prospective students as they went through their rigorous training. In March, Norland found itself in the . spotlight when it was announced one of its graduates – 43-year-old Maria . Teresa Turrion Borrallo – had been hired by Kensington Palace to look . after Prince George. The documentary followed a group of students, above, as . they completed the second of their three-year training at the . £13,000-a-year school. Part of the training involves learning to drive at high speed . Each student is also given a virtual baby to look after for two nights, which is . fitted with a computer chip to make it cry like a real-life child . The child must be soothed by the trainee nannies at all hours to prepare them for their future employment . Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training. Its alumni include Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, nanny to Prince George. Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates would be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition. The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'. Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood. Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education. It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals. Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi. In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi. She is the latest in a long line of Norland alumni to look after Royal Babies, with Princess Anne and the Duchess of York also among those who have used their services. Sir Mick and his ex-wife Jerry Hall also hired a Norland nanny to look after their children Lizzie, 30, and James, 29. Now viewers will be able to see just what makes them so well equipped to care for celebrity offspring. The documentary followed a group of students as they completed the second of their three years of training at the £13,000-a-year school. As well as learning traditional skills like sewing and cooking healthy children’s meals on an Aga, they are given classes in social science, psychology, child health, history and literature. Every student – the school has only had one male graduate – also has to look after a virtual baby for two nights. Fitted with a computer chip, each doll is programmed to cry like a real-life child and must be soothed at all hours. But it is the more extreme parts of the curriculum that will attract viewers’ attention. Each pupil is drilled in a brand of the Korean martial art Taekwondo that teaches them to fend off would-be kidnappers with a flurry of kicks and punches. The instructors teach them to put the assailant in a headlock while controlling a pram, and give more self-defence basic tips, such a keeping their keys at the ready as a potential weapon when walking at night. Another class sees the pupils learn extreme driving skills at a racing circuit in Wiltshire. Each pupil is drilled in a brand of the Korean martial art Taekwondo that teaches them to fend off would-be kidnappers . As well as first-aid training, the students are also taught life-guard skills in case they need to rescue a child during a beach holiday . They must learn to drive at high speed in . any weather condition, navigate slippery roads without losing control . and burst through road-blocks. As well as . being given basic first-aid training, they are also taught life-guard . skills in case they need to rescue one of their tiny charges from the . sea during a beach holiday. Norland’s . principal Liz Hunt told the Mail the skills are now a required part of . any elite nanny’s CV thanks to the ever-increasing demands of wealthy . parents. The school counts the nanny to Prince George, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, among its alumni . She said: ‘When you hire a nanny, you want to know she will protect your child to the best of her ability. We hope these skills won’t be used, but it is better to be safe than sorry. ‘They need all the traditional skills as well, but there are things they can do that Mary Poppins would probably have been a bit envious of, even if she could fly away on her magic umbrella.’ One of the students, Georgie Buntine, 20, said: ‘My friends think it is hilarious that I’ve become a Norland nanny, mainly because of the uniform. At the school we have to keep our hair in buns, and we have to maintain a certain standard. ‘I hope I never have to use the self-defence skills, but it is nice to know I could look after myself if I had to.’ Britain’s Poshest Nannies airs on ITV on July 17 at 9pm.","Elite nanny school Norland College opens its doors to documentary crew .

"BBC presenter Andrew Marr is far from being back to full health after suffering a stroke in January last year, his wife said . To viewers, he seems well on the way to an extraordinary recovery. But nearly 18 months on from a catastrophic stroke, Andrew Marr is far from being back to full health, his wife revealed yesterday. Jackie Ashley said the BBC presenter still has hardly any movement in his left arm, while he uses a stick to walk because his left leg is still weak. Speaking on ITV1’s Lorraine show, Miss Ashley said: ‘He’s fine but he’s a long way off being fully recovered. He can’t do a lot of the things he used to do, he can’t run, he can’t ride a bicycle.’ Marr, 54, suffered the stroke as he worked out on a rowing machine in his garden shed in East Sheen, West London, in January last year but did not call for an ambulance until the following day. Journalist Miss Ashley, who now campaigns on behalf of the Stroke Association, was warned that he was unlikely to survive. But after two months in hospital, Marr showed his determination by making a guest appearance on his BBC1 show weeks later. He returned as host in September. Mother-of-three Miss Ashley, 59, who married Marr in 1987, said he is frustrated at being unable to do some of his favourite things. ‘It’s very hard, he’s horrendously independent and will keep trying to do things,’ she said. ‘He’s even bought a tricycle now because he’s so determined to get back on a bike. ‘He’s very determined which is great. It . was quite an upward learning curve. There’s not a lot of help out there . for people suddenly in that situation.’ Earlier this year, Marr revealed doctors had told him he had suffered two previous ‘mini strokes’ – transient ischaemic attacks – which he dismissed as ‘funny turns’. Marr, 54, was left with seriously impaired mobility down his left side after tearing an artery in his neck. Journalist Jackie Ashley, pictured here with Mr Marr, said her husband cannot run or ride a bicycle and still has hardly any movement in his left arm . He suffered bleeding on the brain, causing a ‘blinding headache and flashes of light’ but did not call for an ambulance until the following day. He spent two months in hospital. Miss . Ashley said: ‘On one occasion he was trying to do a piece to camera for a . film he was making and he said he couldn’t get the words out which is . very unusual for him. ‘His mouth wouldn’t seem to work properly so . he just went to lie down, had the afternoon off [and] later in the day . he went back and did the piece to camera and thought “Oh well I was just . feeling off colour”.’","BBC journalist's wife said Andrew, 54, still uses stick to walk for weak left leg .

"Antonio Carluccio, pictured, has hit out at supermarkets for 'duping customers . For many people it is an everyday staple at family mealtimes: a packet of pasta and a jar of tomato sauce bought from a supermarket. But off-the-shelf Italian food is a ‘con’ and a ‘scam’, according to chef Antonio Carluccio. Yesterday Carluccio, 77, who is best known for his popular restaurant chain, accused supermarkets of duping customers into paying too much for poor quality products. He claimed the fresh pasta they sell is packaged in a way that will make it weigh more – and therefore cost more, while ready-to-go sauces are made from mediocre ingredients made flavoursome with too much sugar. And he said supermarkets are being run by clueless accountants, who favour cost cutting over quality. He revealed he ended his collaboration with a major food supplier to chain stores after being told the improved lasagne recipe he had created cost too much - despite being only 10p over the £1 budget set. And the feisty Italian also scolded those who pour oil into water to stop pasta sticking to the pan: ‘I don’t know which idiot chef came up with that, putting oil in the water. The only time you ever maybe use oil is when you cook sheets of pasta to make lasagne.’ Cream in pasta dishes also prompts a sour response from Carluccio. During an interview with the Daily Mail, he said: ‘I don’t believe very much in pre made sauces because you can make one so easily yourself. Quality is paramount to Italian food and you won’t get that from supermarket sauces. ‘Supermarkets have one task, to distribute in great quantities to everybody, it won’t necessarily be good quality. Even when it’s the best – Waitrose or something, it’s never going to be as good as if you make it yourself.’ Asked if it amounted to a scam Carluccio replied: ‘It is a little bit, yes.’ And he said: ‘What the industry offer as a fresh pasta is a bit of a con because they store it in a plastic bag to keep the moisture which means it weighs more. If it was left out it would go drier, but still be fresh, and therefore weigh less. So you would be getting more pasta.’ In Carluccio’s native Italy, fresh pasta is made by the tray-load in specialist shops. And even the pre-made sauces use only the freshest ingredients. Here in the UK, he claimed, supermarkets bulk buy their ingredients, meaning they are often not gathered at their ripest. Veteran chef Antonio Carluccio says supermarkets package fresh pasta in a way that will make it weigh more . He said: ‘When you do it yourself you know what you’re putting in it, you know it’s the best. Supermarkets will use tomatoes that aren’t completely ripe so they will add sugar which I would never use. If you use good quality ripe tomatoes, fresh or in a tin, they don’t need any adjustment.’ Carluccio has made only one collaboration with a supermarket chain, when Northern Foods, which produces most of the fresh food in Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, offered to pay him £30,000 if he could improve its lasagne. He did and they were happy. But it didn’t last long. Carluccio said: ‘Three days later they called me and said I’m sorry we are going back to the old recipe, because it cost £1.10 instead of £1. I was furious. They couldn’t allow a 10% increase on the cost for a much, much improved lasagne, using much better ingredients. They would rather use the cheaper one, the bad one. I have abandoned the idea of collaborating with a supermarket again. For me supermarkets represent mediocrity, never really good food, even in the higher end places.’ Carluccio, who has written 17 books about Italian food, opened his first food shop with his wife in 1991. Eight years later the first Carluccio’s Café popped up and the chef now has 70 UK restaurants, as well as franchises in Ireland and Dubai. In 2011 he and fellow chef Gennaro Contaldo travelled around Italy for a BBC series called Two Greedy Italians. And his latest cookbook, Antonio Carluccio’s Pasta, is now on sale.","Antonio Carluccio hits out at supermarkets for duping customers over Italian food .

"Hitler was a tax dodger who hid a vast fortune across several Swiss bank accounts, historians have discovered. Documents have emerged showing the dictator amassed hundreds of millions of pounds in today’s money, which he concealed from the German people. It appeared to vanish completely after his death, along with his substantial art collection. Scroll down for video . Hitler hid hundreds of millions of pounds across several Swiss banks, concealing his fortune from the German people . But historians have now managed to trace the money through tax documents and bank statements. They believe he was worth around 1.1billion Reichsmarks, the equivalent of £3.6billion today. During his lifetime the Nazi leader insisted his public speeches only made him a small amount of money and that he did not even have a bank account. But documentary The Hunt For Hitler’s Missing Millions, to be aired tomorrow on Channel 5, will explore how he secretly gained a huge fortune. He refused to pay taxes, dodging £1.75million before passing a law that made him exempt. The book he wrote in prison, . Mein Kampf, generated one million Reichs-marks-per-year after Hitler . decreed that a copy be given to every married couple – paid for by the . government. Experts also claim the dictator wrote a secret will on the morning of his death, hoping to trick the German people into believing his humble claims. Hitler was leader of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany and orchestrated the execution of more than 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust. His aggressive foreign policy is believed to be the primary cause of the Second World War. He invaded Poland in September 1939, and it led to France and England declaring war. But he was finally defeated by the Allies in 1945, following which he ended his life. Hitler was a dictator. And his radical ideology sought to create an Aryan race of superior beings and he was responsible for mass genocide in his concentration camps. He killed himself on April 30 1945 to avoid capture, after giving his deputies strict instructions on what to do with his body so it wouldn’t be found and humiliated by his enemies. And he also told them what he wanted done with his various assets, some of which still remains a mystery. In it he dedicated five pages to a political diatribe against the Jews and just three to his personal will. He presented himself as almost penniless, writing: ‘What I own belongs, as so far as it is of any value at all, to the party.’ There was no further mention of his . wealth, only that his relatives should be given enough ‘to sustain a . simple middle-class life’. It was to be administered . by Hitler’s private secretary and fellow Nazi, Martin Bormann, who was . witness to the will and named as Hitler’s sole executive. However . Bormann was shot dead not long after Hitler committed suicide. The . will was intercepted by Allied forces as a suspected Nazi tried to . smuggle it out of the country, hidden in the shoulder pad of his jacket. Historian Dr Chris Whetton said: ‘He loved money. He just wasn’t prepared to do much for it.’ The Nazi leader also copyrighted his image, meaning he even earned royalties every time a post-age stamp with his face on it was sold. Herman Rothman, a retired British Intelligence Officer was among those to discover and translate the will. He said: ‘We were absolutely shocked by what we found. I think the private will was also for consump-tion by the German people. He wanted to show in his private will he had very little. 'I always felt he thought about it very, very clearly, he wanted to show the people he had no benefits, that his life was purely devoted entirely to the wealth of the German people.’","The dictator amassed hundreds of millions of pounds in today's money .

"Injury-hit Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden has revealed how he refuses to consider hanging up his boots as he tackles a 'brutal' rehab regime. The 29-year-old American international has suffered a succession of serious injuries during the past four years. Stuart Holden has become a 'professional gym rat' during his latest recovery programme . Click here for the full version of his blog on ESPN.com . Holden underwent a knee operation after suffering ligament damage during an Under 21 match against Everton in March. He returned to the States for his latest recovery programme in the belief he can make another comeback. In a blog on ESPN, Holden wrote: 'The daily grind of rehab is brutal. I am constantly being tested, some days physically, some days mentally and some days both! By this point, I could wear the unenviable name tag of ""professional gym rat"" around my neck. 'If you talk to the physical therapists I've worked with over the last couple years, James Hashimoto and Holly Silvers, they would vouch for the fact that I now consider myself quite the expert in the subject of injury recovery. Holden has worked as a TV pundit covering football on American network NBC . 'The latest ACL tear, which I suffered playing for Bolton's reserves in March, has been my biggest test to date. When something you love -- and have worked so incredibly hard for your entire life -- is repeatedly taken away from you, it's disheartening, devastating and (insert every synonym for sucks so bad). 'People on the outside don't see the sweat, the frustration and, sometimes, the tears. The comments I read and hear are: ""You're injured, you can't help the team, and you need to get back on the field."" 'If only it were that simple.' Holden lies on the ground injured after a tackle from Manchester United's Jonathan Evans, right, . 'Not a day goes by where I'm not wishing I was out there, competing against the world's elite. It really hurts to watch my teammates run out on the field, score goals and celebrate in ecstasy. It cuts like a knife to know exactly what it would feel like to be in that moment and not be able to be a part of it.' Holden has suffered numerous injuries with the midfielder first breaking his leg while playing for the USA four years ago. Following his comeback, Holden then injured his left knee following a challenge from Manchester United defender Jonny Evans in March 2011 which kept him out for a further year.

"Space travel seems to have lost its magic after a Russian cosmonaut dramatically quit as a commander on a future mission - to become a gasman. Colonel Yury Lonchakov, 48, was today accused of 'betrayal' by opting for a 'more interesting job' and forgoing his chance to lead a flight to the International Space Station. He came under pressure from his wife, ex-airline stewardess Tatiana, 40, to get find a better paid job, say sources at Star City, home of cosmonauts' training, near Moscow. Dream team: Yury Lonchakov (second from left) poses with an international astronaut team ahead of a mission to the ISS in 2002 . It is understood he will earn more than double his £18,396 a year salary as commander of a flight to the ISS scheduled for May 2015. He has secured an unspecified job with Russian gas giant Gazprom, said a friend.  'Yury does not want any publicity. He told me he has already got a permanent job at Gazprom. Goodbye: Lonchakov, on the left in the second row from the front, waves to the crowd at Kennedy Space Center ahead of a 2001 space flight . 'He has a bank loan, and his wife was not happy with his income. 'Quitting the space industry was his personal decision. He thought he did enough in space. And he got an offer he could not turn down.' The move by one of Russia's most senior cosmonauts, a veteran of three earlier flights, though never as commander, has shocked and saddened his colleagues who remember the allure of the role in Soviet times when it was the ultimate job - and honour. 'He has betrayed the whole Cosmonaut Training Centre,' fumed spokeswoman Irina Rogova. 'He . was listed as a crew member for the space flight in March 2015. He . completed his training. The space crew is fixed two or three years prior . to the flight. We are talking about International Space Station after . all. 'It means we have partners. All was . negotiated and fixed. Lonchakov was approved at all levels. Now we are . urgently looking for a new commander. It is the first time we have such a . shocking situation.' She . insisted: 'People don't become cosmonauts for money. These are special . people. It is romantic, it's a dream, a goal. It has always been like . this.' No longer, it seems. One small step too far: Russia's Soyuz TMA-13 rocket takes off carrying Lonchakov from the Baikonur cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, on October 12, 2008 . Sergei Krikalev, head of the training centre which is named after Yuri Gagarin, said: 'Space in our country has became just one of many other jobs.' One poll found that modern Russian children would rather be doctors, teachers, and truck drivers than cosmonauts. Russia's first-ever open cosmonaut recruitment drive attracted a mere 300 applications last year, compared with 6,000 for NASA in 2011.","Yury Lonchakov, 48, accused of 'betrayal' for wanting 'more interesting job'

"Extra topping: Austin Symonds, 18, was caught 'rubbing his testicles' on a customer's pizza . A teenage restaurant worker who was caught rubbing his genitals on a customer’s pizza has said it was an act of vengeance. Austin Symonds was spotted by a customer ‘rubbing his testicles on the pizza he had ordered,’ a police statement read. The 18-year-old later told police he wanted revenge as the customer had called in the order just before closing time. Customer Brent Bradley arrived at Papa Murphy’s pizza in Georgetown, near Austin, Texas, to find that his family-sized stuffed pizza with bacon and extra cheese was being given additional topping. Mr Bradley confronted Symonds, who immediately apologised, a complaint filed with Georgetown Police Department obtained by The Smoking Gun, reads. A shocked Mr Bradley asked Symonds his age and after being told he was 18, he asked if Symonds was ‘old enough to know better than to put your balls on someone’s pizza.’ An apologetic Symonds acknowledged that this was the case. However, he later told police that he would have given Mr Bradley the pizza had he not been caught. During a police interview, Symonds told officers that he ‘did what he did because the customer had called in the order right before closing time,’ and admitted the crime. The teenager has been charged with tampering with a consumer product, and is currently released on a $10,000 bail. Symonds has, unsurprisingly, been fired from Papa Murphy’s.

"There are few things more difficult in this world than a parent having to bury their son or daughter. So when Freddy McConnel died of a heroin overdose in 2011, his parents James McConnel and Annie Tempest  went through months of hell. Freddie was a talented young man who gradually succumbed to a fatal drug addiction, believing that stars like Pete Doherty and Peaches Geldof were the epitome of glamour and idolising their tearaway lifestyles. Freddy McConnell died of a heroin overdose aged 18 . Towards the end of his life he had started to socialise in these circles. In fact, after the 18-year-old passed away, his parents found a copy of his diary where he had written: 'Peaches is coming over later and I am going to inject for the first time. Perhaps I will die. I hope I don’t.' But in the last three years after his death, Freddy's family have sought to make something positive out of his tragic tale. A TV programme called Addicts' Symphony  on Channel 4 tonight charts the paths of a group of drug or alcohol-addicted classical performers as they attempt to rebuild their careers and lives by performing together as an orchestra. In the last two weeks before he passed away, Freddy McConnel mentioned in his diary that Peaches Geldof would be coming to his house and that he would be injecting heroin for the first time . The show was the brainchild of Freddy's father James, who appeared on This Morning earlier today to talk about the reason behind it. A recovering alcoholic himself, James has an affinity with the members of the orchestra because of his own experience with addiction, but it is also poignant because of his son's troubles in that area. He said: 'As addicts we are uncomfortable in our own skins and therefore looking for ways to medicate. 'My son was a very good musician but also a fabulous writer. 'He was always very bright and gifted and if he didn’t want to do something he wouldn't, but if he wanted to do something he went after it like a terrier down a rabbit hole. 'Even in the way he gulped his orange juice as a child, I could see an addiction personality there. 'I was an alcoholic, so I recognise it myself. 'It caused a large amount of worry because I definitely recognised the trait in him - we tried to channel it into something positive. 'Unfortunately, at 13 he started trying lots of drugs and became obsessed with a certain pop star (Pete Doherty) and that started a downward journey that lasted for five years.' James McConnel has taken part in a new TV programme called Addicts' Symphony on Channel 4 to try and make a positive out of his son's death in 2011 . James goes on to explain that despite his own extensive experiences with addiction and his close relationship with his son, he still wasn't able to help cure his drug addiction. He said: 'We were particularly close towards the end of his life, particularly those last six to eight months. 'We spent a lot of the time talking in the kitchen because he mostly lived with me during that time. 'It wasn’t a surprise, I knew he was in a downhill spiral. 'I knew he was using heroin but it wasn’t like I sat there watching him smoke it - he went to various rehabs and I was always trying to cajole him to that next level when he admitted total defeat. 'I actually think he would have got there had he not taken that dodgy dose of heroin.' James McConnel (centre back)) pictured with the rest of the Addicts' Symphony orchestra . James spoke out against addiction extensively after his son's death, in the hope that it would help other people in the same situation. The exposure led to a TV company getting in contact asking if he would like to work alongside them on a drug-related show. He said: 'It was a really positive thing to come out of Freddie's death. 'I was approached by someone at TV company, asking if I wanted to do something about drugs and teenagers. 'But I decided to make it about something more than that, something about the road to recovery. 'Orchestral players have huge pressures to go up and perform every night, they take a pill or a drink but then the solution becomes the curse. 'I think all of the people who took part benefited hugely, but for a few of them it was a life changing thing. 'I absolutely want to go further with the group.'","James McConnel's son Freddy passed away in 2011 .

"A French man has been jailed after phoning and texting his ex-girlfriend 21,807 times to demand that she thanks him for fixing up their flat. The unnamed defendant admitted with hindsight that his actions 'were stupid'. The defendant, who comes from Rhone in southern France, had already accepted responsibility for the barrage of phone calls and text messages over a 10-month period, and had accepted an earlier demand to cease contact with his ex. Jailed: A man has been imprisoned for texting and phoning his ex girlfriend nearly 22,000 times . He had been hospitalised in the past for depression, and struggled to cope when his girlfriend broke off their relationship in 2011. He demanded compensation for work he had carried out in their apartment. 'At the time, my logic was that until she returns the money...  or at least says thank you, I would not stop the calls,' he told the court in Lyon. The calls kept coming - averaging more than 73 per day. 'She tried to block her line, but he phoned her parents instead and her workplace,' said Manuella Spee, lawyer for the victim, a 32-year-old teacher who was also not named. It was only when she finally said thank you, during a meeting organised by a mediator, that the harassment stopped. He has not contacted her since. 'I tell myself, with hindsight, that it was stupid,' he told the court on Thursday. Security firm Symantec recently left 50 fully charged handsets lying in the street, loaded with apps called Private Pix and Online Banking. The phones were left in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Ottawa in Canada. By tracking which apps were opened on each device, the researchers found that 96 per cent of finders rooted through a handset for details including social network accounts. More than 43 per cent of finders tried to access online bank accounts. And only half tried to return the device. He said he wanted to return to school to train to be a legal assistant, and added that he had a 'passion for writing'. He was given a 10-month sentence, six months of which was suspended, and a 1,000-euro (£800) fine. He will also have to undergo psychiatric treatment and is barred from all contact with the woman he harassed, lawyers in the case told AFP. It follows news that one in five men, and a quarter of women, in relationships admit to snooping through texts, apps and pictures on their partner’s devices. Although almost a quarter of male snoopers said they did so because they are nosy, 12 per cent admitted they were trying to catch their partner lying to them. But looking for evidence of cheating was the number one reason why men looked through their boyfriend or girlfriend’s phone on tablet. More than 40 per cent of women reported their partner’s device did not have a passcode, compared to 33 per cent of men. Both male and female respondents claimed to know their partner’s device passcode because their partner had shared it with them in the past, unknowingly setting themselves up to get caught .","A man flooded his ex girlfriend with calls to demand thanks for a DIY job .

But in the schools of gelama, there will be other fish. The gelama is the king of fish.’ Other fish listeners have passed away, retired or turned to modern fish-detection technology as the traditional practice has retreated in the face of dwindling catches and proliferating undersea noise. Studies show Malaysian waters lost 92 per cent of fishery resources between 1971 and 2007 due to overfishing. ‘You can't copy our technique. You must gain the skill and learn the lay of the waters,’ said Mr Muhammad. Distinct: Mr Muhammad says that all fish have 'a voice' ‘The wholesalers tell me “if you're gone, there will be no more gelama”, which fetches up to 10 times the price of similarly sized fish. ‘Pak Harun’, as he is known locally - ‘Pak’ is a Malay honorific similar to ‘Uncle’ - finds it hard to describe exactly how fish sound, but likens it to pebbles being dropped into water. ‘They have a voice. This sound is this fish, that sound is another. When someone is new, they can't tell one fish song from another.’ Mr Muhammad and his crew of a dozen can go nearly a week without hearing gelama - which invites scepticism about the claimed fish-listening ability. But experts in sonifery (fish sounds) say sailors have long heard sounds of whales and fish through boat hulls. Hunting: Mr Muhammad mainly hunts for schools of gelama . Dedicated: Mr Muhammad has fished the Setiu lagoons on Malaysia's rural east coast his whole life . ‘Scuba divers often do not hear anything because their breathing and bubble exhaust makes so much noise. However free divers, or divers using quiet re-breathers, can hear much better,’ said US-based marine ecologist Rodney Rountree. Former fish listeners describe a range of techniques. Some claim they can feel changes in water temperature. For Mr Muhammad, it is a multi-sensory experience requiring eyes wide open. ‘After a while, it is as if you can see. Even though the fish is very far, you can sense it in that direction and you go there. Only when you get close, you can hear the fish clearly,’ he said. Though he sports a slight paunch on his sun-darkened frame under a spiky white head of hair, Mr Muhammad remains sprightly despite his years, deftly clambering in and out of his boat in search of fish sounds. Once he pinpoints a school of gelama, his crew - who have hung back with engines off - motor forward, drop their nets and strike the sides of their boats to spook the fish into the mesh trap. ‘You think it's just stupid fish but they can see you coming. When they hear the sound of the boat, they run. The fish cry or shout and then their friends swim away,’ he said. Landing a rich catch was easy when stocks were abundant, Mr Muhammad said. But after decades of overfishing, he now ‘listens’ up to several dozen times under the scorching equatorial sun before catching a snippet of gelama song. Modernisation, including sand dredging, aquaculture, factories and fishing trawlers has transformed the Setiu wetlands, a rich but threatened coastal ecosystem centering on a nine-mile (14-kilometre) long lagoon along the South China Sea. The state of Terengganu is seeking to make it a protected park. Now Mr Muhammad's catch is increasingly unpredictable, averaging about $2,000 per week gross, leaving little left over after all crew are paid, and fuel, maintenance, and other costs are deducted. ‘Each year, the catch has reduced. But I'm not good at anything else, so I still have to do this,’ said his son and apprentice Zuraini. Malaysia ranks among the top consumers of seafood in the world. Intergovernmental industry researchers Infofish say Malaysians eat an average of 56.5 kilogrammes of seafood per person annually, more even than Japanese. The global average is 20 kilos. WWF-Malaysia chief Dionysius Sharma said overfishing threatens to leave Malaysian waters ‘vast and barren’. The organisation warns Malaysia's waters could run out of seafood by 2048. Despite the long odds, Zuraini, 44, said someday he will train one of his own sons. ‘I don't want to see this practice die off,’ he said.","Harun Muhammad 'listens' for fish sounds emanating from the depths .

"Public executions, amputations, lashings and mock crucifixion have become a regular Friday fixture in jihadist-controlled areas of Syria, according to a UN human rights investigation. A report by the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights also accused the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad of repeatedly using chemical weapons against civilians. The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic paints a bleak picture of life for people in Syria, whichever side of the civil war's frontline they are on.

'In areas of Syria under Isis control, particularly in the north and northeast of the country, Fridays are regularly marked by executions, amputations and lashings in public squares,' the report said. Jihadists from the group now calling itself the Islamic State are also pushing residents, including children, to attend public executions by beheading or a shot to the head, it said. 'Executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle on Fridays in Raqqa and in (Islamic State)-controlled areas of Aleppo governorate,' said the commission. 'Bodies of those killed are placed on display for several days, terrorising the local population.' Fanatics: Islamic State fighters parade with group's black flags. A UN human rights report says the militant group conducts a regular Friday ritual of executions, amputations and lashings in areas it controls .

Dead Syrian government forces are pictured on the ground in Raqqa. The report says Government forces have also imposed their own reign of terror, with accounts of torture, rape and deaths in custody . In the 45-page report on the situation in the war-ravaged country, the panel described beheadings of boys as young as 15, men flogged for things like smoking or accompanying an 'improperly dressed' female relative. Women have been publicly lashed for not following the group's strict dress code and stoned to death after allegations of infidelity. Islamic State, which declared a 'caliphate' across northern Iraq and eastern Syria, is also recruiting and training children as young as 10, with teens being used in active combat and suicide missions, the report said. The jihadists, who sparked outrage last week when they released a video showing the beheading of US journalist James Foley, are guilty of widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, the commission said. The groups was also contributing 'to a spillover of violence affecting international peace and stability,' it warned, stressing that 'risks of the conflict spreading further are palpable.'

Fighters from the Islamic State group firing a tank at the air base in Raqqa . The commission was created three years ago by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate abuses committed in the war, which is estimated to have killed nearly 200,000 people. It will present to the council next month its latest report covering a litany of war crimes and crimes against humanity it says were carried out by the Syrian government, Islamic State and other opposition groups. Many fighters from Syria's weakened rebel battalions are defecting to Islamic State 'owing to the latter’s superior financial and operational capabilities,' it warns. Meanwhile, even 'moderate' armed groups are 'closely coordinating with extremist groups, including the Al-Qaida-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.' And it is alleged that rebel groups of all stripes are guilty of targeting regime-controlled civilian areas, including some schools in Damascus. The Syrian government, which during the first years of the conflict was blamed for the lion share of abuses and deaths, had since January continued to kill hundreds of men, women and children every week due to the 'indiscriminate firing of missiles and barrel bombs into civilian areas', the report found. Government forces have also continued to impose their own reign of terror in areas they control, with accounts of torture, rape and deaths in custody 'indicating the existence of a State policy'. Horror: The chairman of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro of Brazil, during a press conference at United Nations offices in Geneva where the report was published . It also said forces loyal to Damascus appeared to have dropped barrel bombs containing the chemical agent chlorine on civilian areas in the north on eight different occasions last April. 'Reasonable grounds exist to believe that chemical agents, likely chlorine, were used on (northern Syrian villages) Kafr Zeita, al-Tamana and Tal Minnis in eight incidents within a 10-day period in April,' the report said. 'Witnesses saw helicopters drop barrel bombs and smelled a scent akin to domestic chlorine immediately following impact,' it pointed out. Victims, it said, had suffered 'symptoms compatible with exposure to chemical agents, namely vomiting, eye and skin irritation, choking and other respiratory problems.' The report also warned that some states continue to deliver 'arms, artillery and aircraft' to Damascus, while other states, organisations and individuals are supporting rebel groups. 'The weapons they transfer to the warring parties in Syria are used in the perpetration of war crimes and violations of human rights,' the report says, adding that the commission recommends an arms embargo. President Bashar al-Assad's regime and rebels have both accused the other of using chemical agents, including chlorine, in the bloody uprising that began in March 2011 and in spite of Damascus promising to hand over all its chemical arms. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) mission also said in June that Damascus appeared to be using chlorine 'in a systematic manner'.","Human rights report also says Syrian government using chemical weapons .

"'Two or three years': Pope Francis gave a startling admission of his own mortality to journalists at an in-flight press conference aboard his Papal jet as it flew back to Italy after his visit to South Korea . Pope Francis has said he might have only two or three years left to live. On a plane trip back from South Korea, he told journalists he believed he only had limited time left to complete his reforms of the Roman Catholic Church. Asked about how he copes with his popularity, he said: ‘I try to think of my sins, my mistakes, so as not to think that I am some- body important.’ He then added with a smile: ‘Because I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then… to the house of the Father.’ According to a Vatican source, the 77-year-old has previously told those close to him that he thought he only had a few years left. He also revealed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties. His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February last year. ‘If you asked me if, in the future, I felt I could not go forward, would I do the same? I would do the same. Benedict has opened a door,’ Francis said on board the papal plane. The conference marked the end of his trip to South Korea, which he had been touring since Thursday. He also admitted that his advisers have been encouraging him to rest more after he cancelled a series of engagements earlier in the year. In June he cancelled a visit to the Gemelli Hospital in Rome due to a ‘sudden ailment’. At the time he told Catholic television station TV2000: ‘We are not masters of our own lives, we cannot arrange things to suit us. We have to accept fragility.’ He also called off trips to a shrine in February and a seminary in May. ‘Those were very demanding days. And now I have to be a bit more sensible,’ he said, adding that he had been sleeping more over the past two months. But he said the last time he took a holiday away from home was ‘with the Jesuit community in 1975’. The Pope has kept up a whirlwind of activity since his election in March 2013. However he has some underlying health problems, including sciatica. He also had part of a lung removed in his youth. 'Then I'll be off to the Father's house': Francis also mentioned the possibility of retiring from the Papacy if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, like his predecessor Benedict XVI did last year . Some observers claim the pontiff has . gained weight and is having difficulty breathing, which could be signs . of a heart condition. He . instructed advisers to clear his schedule yesterday so he could . recuperate from his trip, calling off a visit to a shrine near Rome. He . also received the sad news that three members of his family had died in a . car crash in Argentina. His . two young great-nephews, aged two and eight months, and their . 39-year-old mother Valeria Carmona, were killed in a road accident on . Monday. Questions: Francis's admission may lead commentators to speculate as to whether the 77-year-old has any undisclosed health problems. He only admitted to having 'some nerve problems', which required treatment . Pope Francis leaves after talking to the media: He also addressed the issues surrounding the Catholic Church in China, which refuses to allow Catholics to officially recognise to Pope's spiritual leadership . Vatican spokesman . Federico Lombardi said the Pope’s nephew Emanuel Bergoglio, who was . driving, was in a serious condition. He added: ‘The Pope was informed . about the tragic accident. He is deeply pained.’ The family’s car reportedly collided with a lorry in the Cordoba region, north-east of Buenos Aires. Life after Pope: Benedict's quiet days of prayer as Pope Emeritus . Pope Benedict XVI's resignation last February made him the first Catholic leader to step down in nearly 600 years. He gave his age as his reason, but at the age of 85 and 318 days on the date of his retirement, he was only the fourth-oldest man to hold the office. The move was unexpected since in modern times all popes have stayed in office until death. He is regarded as the first pope to have resigned without any political pressure since Celestine V in 1294. 'A life dedicated to prayer': Benedict XVI, Pope Emeritus, is helped to a chair in his garden at the Vatican . Benedict said at the time he had chosen to step aside because the physical and mental demands of the Papacy were taking their toll on his deteriorating strength. According to a statement from the Vatican, the timing of the resignation was not caused by any specific illness but was to ""avoid that exhausting rush of Easter engagements"". Since stepping down Benedict, who decided not to revert back to his birth name Joseph Ratzinger, has held the title of Pope Emeritus and has continued living in the Vatican. He has continued to wear the white raiments of the Catholic Church's highest office, but has dispensed with the over-the-shoulder cape that cardinals and bishops wear. As he stepped down, Benedict declared he would continue to serve the church 'through a life dedicated to prayer'. Vatican officials have since revealed he does not live a cloistered life, but spends time writing and studying. On the eve of the first anniversary of his resignation, Benedict wrote to Italian paper La Stampa to deny speculation he had been forced to step down.","Frank comments may lead to speculation about Francis's health .
The 77-year-old's vigour and energy have been key to his popularity .
But he admits to having 'some nerve problems' which require treatment .
He also raises the possibility he might retire, like his predecessor ."
"An Indonesian couple who were reunited with their daughter 10 years after a tsunami snatched her from their arms claimed Tuesday to have found their son, who was also swept away in the disaster. Jamaliah and her husband Septi Rangkuti had an emotional reunion Monday with the teenager they believe is their long-lost son, bringing their whole family together for the first time in 10 years. Arif Pratama Rangkuti, now 17, was carried off with his younger sister when the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami slammed into Indonesia's westernmost Aceh province, killing more than 170,000 people there and tens of thousands in other countries. Scroll down for video . The whole family, reunited at last with missing son Arif Partama Rangkuti (bottom right) in the Payakumbuh town on Sumatra Island. First, mum Jamaliah and her husband Septi Rangkuti were reunited with their daughter Raudhatul Jannah (left panel, right) in June. Now the family claim to have found their long lost son Arif Pratama Rangkuti, 17, who was carried off with his younger sister when the Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh, Indonesia in 2004. The family had an emotional reunion with Raudhatul Jannah (second right), who is now aged 14. Here, she sits with mother Jamaliah (second from left), holding youngest son Jumadi Rangkuti (centre) and father Septi Rangkuti (far right), joined by Syarwani (left), the foster mother who has raised Jannah in the city of Meulaboh, Aceh province. Jamaliah shows reporters a picture of her daughter after being reunited in Meulaboh, Aceh, Indonesian on August 7, 2014. Arif's sister Raudhatul Jannah was reunited with the parents in June after a relative spotted a girl in an Aceh village who bore a striking resemblance to her. On Tuesday the couple said their son had now also been returned, thanks to this month's huge media coverage of their ""miracle"" reunion with their daughter. 'It's true, he's our son. We're now preparing to take him home,' Rangkuti told AFP, explaining that the boy had lived for years as a street kid on the island of Sumatra. Jamaliah, speaking in the town of Payakumbuh in West Sumatra province, wept as she clutched the teenager, who seemed shy and overwhelmed.

With her family: Raudhatul Jannah (second from left), joins her mother (left) and her father Septi Rangkuti (right), ten years after she went missing during the Indonesian tsunami. 'I prayed every night, because inside I believed that my child was still alive,' she told reporters. 'My husband has always been restless at home because of this. He would say that our son is still alive.' The family were reunited at the home of a couple who found the boy one night asleep outside the Internet cafe they run in Payakumbuh. The teenager has lived homeless for years, sleeping in outdoor markets and abandoned shops. Lana Bestari and Windu Fajri let the boy sleep at their Internet cafe for several months, giving him food and clothes on his regular visits. Bestari got in touch with the family after she saw a photograph of Arif as a child on television. Even after ten years, she said she instantly recognised the tsunami victim as the boy who had slept at her cafe. 'I was shocked - there was a photo of a boy I recognised very well. I recorded his image on my smartphone,' she said. Together at last: Jamaliah (left) holds her daughter Raudhatul Jannah (right). The boy had only told her he had come from Medan in North Sumatra province. If he is indeed the couple's son, it is unclear how he made the journey there from Aceh. After seeing the news, Bestari and her husband searched for the boy, whom they had named Ucok. The teenager spoke to Jamaliah and Septi Rangkuti on the phone and the couple immediately travelled to meet him, along with their youngest son and their newly-found daughter, now aged 14. When the tsunami hit their home in Aceh, Arif and his sister were swept away clinging to a board, according to their parents, who had long abandoned any hope of finding either child alive. The couple now believe the children were rescued together by fishermen who took them to the Banyak Islands off the coast of Aceh. The girl was taken in by a family in Aceh, who renamed her Wenni. A fisherman wanted to adopt both of them, but ended up taking just Jannah as he did not think his family could provide for two more children. Jannah was reunited with her parents in June after a relative spotted her as she walked home from school. 'God has given us a miracle,' Jamaliah said earlier this month after finding her daughter.","Jamaliah and Septi Rangkuti reunited with 17-year-old son .

"The federal government says it's disappointed by Russia's trade sanctions on Australia which block exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Russia has banned on agricultural products from Australia and other western countries after they imposed their own sanctions against Moscow over its policy in Ukraine following the MH17 disaster. The retaliatory ban covers all imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products and fruit and vegetables. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday the 'full embargo' would come into effect immediately and last for one year, unless 'our partners demonstrate a constructive approach' in regards to sanctioning Russia. Scroll down for video . People buy imported fruit in downtown Moscow as Russia puts a ban on food imports from Australia and other western countries that have imposed sanctions against Moscow following the MH17 disaster . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says it's disappointing that Russia has retaliated rather than adhere to international concern and stop the flow of weapons to Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. It's believed Russia supplied the weapon that was used to down flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people, including 38 Australians. 'The Australian government will do everything in its power to minimise the impact on Australian agricultural producers,' she told AAP in a statement. Australia had acted in line with others in the international community in imposing sanctions on Russia, she said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says it's disappointing that Russia has retaliated rather than adhere to international concern . Russia's sweeping move will cost western farmers billions of dollars but could also lead to empty supermarket shelves in Russian cities. 'Of course this is a serious decision for the suppliers of such foods from these countries,' Mr Medvedev said. The ban will not cover baby food and people will still be able to buy the banned products abroad if they want, but Mr Medvedev warned those who tried to profit from reselling them would be 'harshly punished'. The full list of banned products was published on the government's website as Mr Medvedev delivered his speech to a government meeting. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday the 'full embargo' would come into effect immediately and last for one year . Experts said that local producers would find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector had continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds. The damage to consumers inflicted by the ban would be felt particularly hard in big cities like Moscow, where imported food filled an estimated 60-70 percent of the market. Mr Medvedev said Russia could go further and ban western carriers from flying over Russia on flights to and from Asia - a move that would significantly swell costs and increase flight time. He said there has been no decision on that yet, and wouldn't specify when and under what conditions the move could be taken. The retaliatory ban covers all imports of meat, fish, milk and milk products and fruit and vegetables from Australia, the United States, the European Union, Canada and Norway . Experts said that local producers would find it hard to fill the gap left by the ban, as the nation's agricultural sector had continued to suffer from poor efficiency and shortage of funds . He made it clear that Russia hoped the sanctions would make the west revise its policy and stop trying to pressure Russia with sanctions. 'We hope our partners will put a pragmatic economic approach above bad policy considerations, and they will start thinking instead of trying to scare us,' he said. The decision shows that President Vladimir Putin has no intention of bowing to western pressure over Ukraine and will instead try to strike back at the west. The U.S. and the EU have accused Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March, of fomenting tensions in eastern Ukraine by supplying arms and expertise to a pro-Moscow insurgency, and have imposed asset freezes and loan bans on a score of individuals and companies.

"The Ebola virus, which has killed more than 1,200 people since the start of the year, seems to have spread from Guinea into Sierra Leone due to a healer's claims of special powers. The deadly disease need never have spread from Guinea, health officials revealed to AFP, except for a herbalist in the remote eastern border village of Sokoma. 'She was claiming to have powers to heal Ebola. Cases from Guinea were crossing into Sierra Leone for treatment,' Mohamed Vandi, the top medical official in the hard-hit district of Kenema, told AFP. Scroll down for video . A very sick 10-year-old boy, suspected to have Ebola, was pulled out of a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, when the facility was overrun by a mob on Saturday . 'She got infected and died. During her funeral, women around the other towns got infected.' Ebola has killed more than 1220 people since it emerged in southern Guinea at the start of the year, spreading first to Liberia and cutting a swathe through eastern Sierra Leone. The tropical pathogen attacks almost every section of tissue, reducing organs and flesh in the most aggressive infections to a pudding-like mush, which leaches or erupts from the body. The virus is highly infectious through exposure to bodily fluids, and its early rapid spread in west Africa was attributed in part to relatives touching victims during traditional funeral rites. The herbalist's mourners fanned out across the rolling hills of the Kissi tribal chiefdoms, starting a chain reaction of infections, deaths, funerals and more infections. A Liberian burial team, all wearing protective clothing, retrieves the body of a 60-year-old Ebola victim in his home on August 17, 2014 near Monrovia, Liberia . A Chinese doctor works at the ophthalmological clinic in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Methods to disinfect the hospital have been taken since it received an infected patient who later died from the virus . A worrying outbreak turned into a major epidemic when the virus finally hit Kenema city on June 17. An ethnically-diverse, Krio-speaking city of 190,000, Kenema already has the highest incidence of Lassa fever, another viral haemorrhagic disease, in the world. But the brutality and cold efficiency of the Ebola virus, described in medical literature as a 'molecular shark', caught the city's hospital off-guard. Crumpled photographs of dead nurses cover noticeboards on the flaking walls outside the maternity unit and in the administration block. Twelve nurses have been among 277 people to die since the first case showed up in Kenema hospital. A further ten have been infected with Ebola and survived. 'The nurses who lost their lives and those who got infected would never have gone in knowing that they would get infected,' Vandi, the district medical officer, told AFP. 'We are fighting a battle that is new. Ebola is new here and we are all learning as we go along.' The first case at the hospital was a woman who had partially miscarried, having probably passed the virus to her unborn child. The facility boasts the only Lassa fever isolation unit in the world, set apart from the main building, and a makeshift Ebola unit was quickly set up there. It was then that the nurses began dying. She was dead within days, along with fellow nurses Alex Moigboi and Iye Gborie, and ambulance driver Sahr Niokor. The deaths prompted a strike of 100 nurses, who complained of poor management of the Ebola centre. Residents of a slum in Monrovia, Liberia, receive food aid during the second day of the government's Ebola quarantine on Thursday . Gates are closed on the West Point slum in Liberia as part of the government's Ebola quarantine on the neighbourhood . 'Wherever the Ebola virus strikes for the first time, there is a heavy toll on healthcare workers because they don't have experience with it,' Vandi told AFP. 'The Ebola virus is deadly and unforgiving. The slightest mistake you make, you will get infected.' Umar Khan, a hugely admired doctor and the country's leading Ebola specialist, died after saving more than 100 lives, and at least nine nurses have died since. There are 80 beds in the hospital's Ebola centre, almost double its capacity. Shifts are voluntary, and many nurses have refused to work in the unit, while those who remain are overworked and exhausted. Some staff say they have gone weeks without a day off, and 12-hour shifts are par for the course. The hospital told AFP staff training had hugely improved in recent weeks, with the help of global aid agencies and the World Health Organisation. The Ebola outbreak has infected 848 people and claimed 365 lives in Sierra Leone since the herbalist began inviting clients across the border with promises of salvation. 'These figures tell us one thing: Ebola is here with us and its impact on us is real,' Maya Kaikai, the government minister for the eastern region, told a news conference in Kenema. 'It is a disease that spreads very fast, without regard for academic or economic status, political affiliation, age, ethnic grouping, gender or religion.'","Ebola virus spread from Guinea to Sierra Leone due to a herbalist who claimed to be able to cure disease .

"A Malaysia Airlines cabin crew member has been detained in France over allegations that he sexually assaulted an Australian passenger who was scared of flying with the disaster-prone airline. French police have questioned a crew member following allegations by a female passenger of 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur on August 4, the airline said in a statement on Thursday. The Australian passenger complained to authorities about the incident after touchdown at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, saying she had told crew at the beginning of the flight about her apprehension of flying with the airline in the wake of the two disasters. French police have questioned a crew member following allegations by a female passenger of 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur on August 4 . The steward sat beside her and sexually assaulted her under the pretext of 'comforting' her, she said, according to a source close to the French probe. Malaysia Airlines vowed to assist French authorities in their investigation, adding 'the safety, comfort and well-being of our passengers is always our highest priority'. 'Malaysia Airlines expects and accepts nothing short of the highest standards of conduct from its crew and takes any such allegations very seriously,' it said. The case, involving the chief steward of a Paris-bound flight, is the latest setback for the struggling national carrier, which was struck by twin tragedies this year when one of its passenger jets went missing and another was shot down over conflict-torn east Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. No trace has been found and the airline was widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. On July 17, MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, with 298 people killed. The airline stands on the financial brink after the disasters. State investment fund Khazanah Nasional, which has controlled the airline for years via a 70 percent ownership stake, said last week that it plans to buy all remaining shares and de-list the company before undertaking a 'complete overhaul'.","French police detained a Malaysia Airlines crew member following allegations by a female passenger of 'sexual behaviour'

The photographs were shot off the North Shore of Oahu and near several beaches on the South Shores of Oahu, Hawaii. ‘My photography is my art, it's how I communicate to the world,' Kenji explained. 'Watching a beautiful sunrise while getting to shoot in the waves is meditating for me. It's my sanctuary. ‘It took me months to get a good shot when I first started. Back then there was no GoPro camera so it was much more difficult to carry a bulky camera and housing and time it right to get a good shot. 'I still remember my first decent photo, I was so stoked to finally get a clear photo from inside the barrel looking out.’ In a spin: Some of the clever shots even manage to capture some of Kenji's fellow surfers and swimmers . Kenji says: ‘'Watching a beautiful sunrise while getting to shoot in the waves is meditating for me' Croman has travelled all over the world taking photographs and now teaches an underwater photography course at the University of Hawaii.

"If you thought your commute to work this morning was bad, take a look at the journey these children have to make each day to school. From riding a zip wire over the Rio Negro in Colombia to clinging to the remains of a collapsed rope bridge in Indonesia, students have to be wide awake to navigate these precarious routes. And if you moan about having to cram on to a packed train or bus each day, how about sharing a tiny horse cart with thirty five people, clinging to tyre tube while drifting down a river, or riding a donkey for five hours up a narrow mountain pass? These startling images will make that stuffy, over-crowded train carriage look like a walk in the park... Scroll down for video . On the edge: This young child and his grandfather have to negotiate a narrow, rocky mountain pass on the way to a primary school in Sichuan province, China. The Gulu village's school is located halfway up the mountain and is the most remote in the world . Rocky road: It takes Shen Qicai and his grandfather five hours to climb from the base of the mountain to the Gulu village primary school. Children must travel along a path that is just a couple of feet wide in some parts and has a sheer drop on one side down into the canyon below . Determined: Students in Indonesia cling to steel bars on a broken bridge as they cross Ciherang River near their village in Lebak Regency. A pillar supporting one side of the crossing collapsed, leaving the wooden planks that acted as a path tilted to one side . Mind the gap: A group of girls walk across a narrow plank on the walls of the 16th century Galle fort to reach their school in Sri Lanka . Don't look down! For most people, a zip wire is a novel thrill but for these villagers, it's part of their daily commute across the Rio Negro river in Colombia . Taking the shortcut: For the handful of families living in the area 40 miles southeast of Colombia's capital Bogota, the wire is their only access to the outside world. It is 1,300ft above the Rio Negro and whizzes travellers across the river at 40mph to the opposite bank, half a mile away . Clinging on for dear life: These two brave young boys have to use a tyre as a makeshift raft to travel to school along a river in Rizal Province in the Philippines . Children living in the Zhang Jiawan village, deep in the mountains in China's Hunan Province, have to climb unsecured ladders that are leaning against a 60-metre tall cliff face each day to get to school. The ladders are made by villagers and have to be replaced every three to five years. The alternative is a four-hour cross-country detour . Close to collapse: This bridge on the island of Sumatra was destroyed by heavy rain. The determined pupils from the Batu Busuk village who cross it every day then have to walk a further seven miles through dense forest to their school in the town of Padang . These students from Cilangkap village had to construct a bamboo raft to get to school after a bridge across the Ciherang river in Indonesia's Lebak Regency collapsed . Maximum capacity: A single horse cart ferries more than thirty-five children to school on the outskirts of New Delhi in India . Battling through a blizzard: A villager and her daughter attempt to cross a broken wooden bridge covered in snow in Sichuan Province, China. The bridge is the only connection to the outside world for people living in the Shawan village .","Villagers living in a remote region near Colombia's capital Bogota cross the Rio Negro river on a zip wire .

"Australia's medal tally has been extended with two gold, three silvers and one bronze added overnight in Glasgow. Laura Coles won in a gold-medal shoot-out against Elena Allen, from Wales, in the women's skeet shooting event. Jack Bobridge then won gold in the 4000m individual pursuit, beating compatriot Alex Edmondson, who claimed silver in an all-Australian final. More success on the cycling track also saw Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett take home silver in the men's 1000m para-cycling, just falling short of the home side by 0.15 seconds. Edmondson's win comes off her silver medal on Friday morning in the 3000m individual pursuit while compatriot Amy Cure won bronze. England's Joanna Rowsell took gold . Kieran Modra and Jason Nibblet riding to success on day two of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Another silver came from Annette Edmondson - Alex's sister - who lost out to England's Joanna Roswell, in the women's 3000m individual pursuit. Meanwhile Edmondson's team mate Amy Cure took out third place in the same event. These second-day triumphs come after a flying start for Australia's Commonwealth Games campaign, winning five gold medals on the first day of action. Flagbearer Anna Meares kicked off the medal spree, claiming gold in the women's 500m time trial in the velodrome. Meares' teammate in Glasgow, Stephanie Morton, won the silver in the same event on a great night for Australia. The men's cycling team then took gold in the 4000m team pursuit while Bradie O'Connor (sprint tandem) and the team sprint foursome both won bronze. Meares looks the picture of determination as she peddles towards a gold medal on the first night of competition . Anna Meares salutes the crowd after adding yet another medal to her tally on Friday . In the pool, Australia's swimmers started well with three gold medals. The 4x100m freestyle relay team consisting of Emma McKeon, Melanie Schlanger and sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell won gold, taking out Australian swimming's first world record since 2009 in the process. The world record is particularly impressive when you consider the time they beat was set by the Dutch in 2009, who were wearing the now banned 'super suits'. Earlier in the evening Emma McKeon got the job done without her teammates, winning gold in the 200m freestyle. The final Aussie gold came from 16-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Rowan Crothers, who won the men’s para 100m freestyle, breaking his own world record in the process. Anna Meares triumph in the velodrome means she has now won five gold medals in track cycling at the Commonwealth Games, equaling the record haul by compatriot Bradley McGee. It is a third successive victory in the event for Meares, who also equals Kathy Watt's Australia women's cycling record of seven Commonwealth Games medals and has become the first rider to win a medal at four Games. Meares has the chance to beat Watt's record on Friday when she will compete in the women's sprint final. Australia is currently coming second in the Commonwealth Games medal tally with six gold, five silver and eight bronze, a total of 19 medals. This comes after the nation's three silver medals were won by Stephanie Morton in the 500m track cycling, Matthew Cowdrey in the para-sport 100m Freestyle  and David Mckeon in the 400m Freestyle on the first day of the games. While the Australian teams in two cycling events, the women's para-sport Sprint B Tandem and the men's team sprint, took home bronze along with Chloe Rayner and Amy Meyer taking home third in the under-48kg judo events, and Brenden Hall, Bronte Barratt and Keryn Mcmaster winning bronze in their swimming events. 500m England is in the lead with 17 medals – six gold, seven silver and four bronze.","Medal tally now stands at 21 - with one gold from shooter Laura Coles .

"The man who helped make the bombs that killed 20 people - including four Australians - has refused to apologise for his role in the 2005 terror attacks. Convicted Bali bomb-maker Muhammad Cholili was released on parole on Wednesday after serving less than half of his 18-year sentence when he was found guilty of helping slain ringleaders Noordin Mohammad Top and Azahari Husin assemble the explosives in September 2006. 'I will not apologise to Australian [victims] because I didn't involve in second Bali bombing [sic],” he told Nine News. Scroll down for video . Convicted terrorist Mohammad Cholili was released from Lowokwaru Prison in Malang, East Java, Indonesia on Wednesday . 'My role was simply hiding Dr. Azahari [one of the Bali bombing masterminds], but I have never involved in second Bali bombing [sic].' The attacks on restaurants also injured more than 100 people on October 1, 2005. Corrections directorate-general Ika Yusanti said Cholili had been eligible for parole since April for his favourable record during his time in prison. 'My case is different with other cases,' Cholili told reporters. 'I’ve been released on parole for good behaviour. I’m happy I’m free.' Cholili served a eight-year sentence for his involvement in a bombing in Bali on October 1, 2005 . Sentenced to 18 years for his involvement in the bombing, his sentence was reduced for good behaviour . Cholili's associates Noordin and Azahari were key members of the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah extremist network blamed for a string of deadly attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali bombing which killed 202 people, mostly Western holidaymakers. 'Muhammad Cholili has been released on parole today after several remissions which he received for good behaviour. He has never broken any prison regulations,' Ms Yusanti told AFP. Sentences are routinely cut in Indonesia to mark major religious celebrations such as Eid al-Fitr Muslim holiday and the country's independence day on August 17. This meant that Cholili served less than half of his term, but Yusanti said the convicted bomb-maker's release had 'received the recommendation from the Detachment 88 and the National Anti-Terror Agency', which are responsible for tracking terror activities in the country. Cholili was sentenced in September 2006 for his part in assisting the ringleaders of the bombing . The bombings killed 20 people - including four Australians - and injured more than 100 . The blast went off in restaurants in Kuta, Bali, on October 1, 2005 . Ms Yusanti also added that the authorities would continue to monitor Cholili's activities and he will not be able to leave Indonesia without the justice minister's approval. 'If he commits any crime or creates any problems in the community, he will be sent back to prison,' she added. Indonesia's English daily The Jakarta Globe reported that Cholili was surprised to learn of his release from the Lowokwaru Prison in Malang, East Java, but was happy to leave prison. 'The most important thing is to go home and meet my family,' he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation, has long struggled with terrorism but a successful clampdown in recent years has prevented major deadly attacks. However, recent reports of Indonesians joining the procession of jihadists to Syria and Iraq have sparked fears that they will revive sophisticated militant networks.","Bali bomber Muhammad Cholili was released from jail on Wednesday .

Overjoyed: Khaled, a member of Syria's Civil Defence, kisses baby Mahmud Idilbi after pulling him from rubble . Miracle: This is the moment two-month-old Mahmud was pulled from beneath a crumbling building in Aleppo . The incredible moment was captured in a video that appeared and Twitter and shows tireless rescue workers shouting 'it's a miracle' as a small head is seen emerging from debris. A man is captured moving rocks with his hands to get to the tiny baby boy who can be heard wailing from behind the crumbled wall. He slowly tugs on Mahmud's babygro and as his bloodied and dusty head comes into view another man reaches into the hole and protects the baby's head from the sharp rubble. He is heard crying as his whole body, completely covered in dust, is carefully extracted. A smiling man then clutches the rescued child in his arms while his colleagues off-camera cry: 'God is great!'

"A chipped tooth is never pleasant, but when you spend 12 hours a day chewing bamboo it can begin to grind you down. So Giant Panda Bai Yun must have been very relieved to visit the dentist at San Diego Zoo - and she even got to sleep through the whole procedure. The 23-year-old panda was given an anaesthetic by the zoo’s veterinary team so that they could fill her lower canine with a dental composite. Painless procedure: Giant Panda Bai Yun was given an anaesthetic so she slept through the treatment . After the procedure, the tooth was cured with a light to seal the filling, then the teeth were cleaned and more x-rays taken while the panda dozed. 'The good news is the pulp canal hadn't been compromised, but it's very close to breaking into the pulp canal,' said Meg Sutherland-Smith, associate director of veterinary services at the San Diego Zoo. 'What we attempted to do was a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped to, hopefully, prevent any further chipping or deterioration.' The vets at the zoo carried out a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped . The Californian zoo, which was recently named one of the US's top ten zoos by USA Today, explained that, since Giant Pandas use their teeth to chew and break apart bamboo, they can get worn or damaged over time. Bamboo is a Giant Panda's primary source of food but, as it isn't particularly nutritious, the animals need to eat a lot of it to get the energy they need. Giant Pandas use their teeth to chew and break apart bamboo, so they can get worn or damaged over time . San Diego Zoo currently has three resident Giant Pandas, which are on loan from China as part of a program to study the endangered species and help with breeding. Bai Yun - which means 'White Cloud' - has already given birth to six cubs, five of which were conceived naturally. The panda and her partner Gao Gao - father to four of her cubs - have become known as the zoo's 'super couple', thanks to their breeding record. Bai Yun first became a mother in 1999 after being artificially inseminated with sperm from Shi Shi, the male panda at the zoo at that time. She gave birth to her first cub Hua Mei, which translates as 'China USA', which was the first giant panda born in the United States to survive to adulthood. Paws for thought: San Diego Zoo currently has three resident Giant Pandas, which are on loan from China as part of a program to study the endangered species and help with breeding . In 2003, Mei Sheng - which translates as 'Born in the USA' - came along, followed by Su Lin (A Little Bit of Something very Cute) in 2005, Zhen Zhen (Precious) in 2007 and Yun Zi (Son of Cloud) in 2009. Her youngest cub named Xiao Liwu (Little Gift) was born in 2012, making Bai Yun the second oldest panda on record to give birth. The oldest was two days older than Bai Yun at the time of birth of their respective cubs.","Bai Yun was treated by vets at the zoo after she chipped her canine .

"A former air stewardess flying to London for her honeymoon screamed at British Airways cabin crew: 'I'm going to shoot you in the face,' after barricading herself inside a business class toilet. American Brie Ann Johnson, 35, was flying to Heathrow to join her musician husband and had been drinking wine in the exclusive Club World upper deck on the 747 plane on top of her anti-anxiety Zanax medication. She received a suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty at Isleworth Crown Court on Thursday to being drunk on an aircraft and assaulting BA cabin crew staff Craig Stoner and David Shaw on August 3. Scroll down for video . 'Devastated and horrified': Brie Ann Johnson pictured with her husband who was not named in court . Prosecutor Miss Pamela Reiss told the court the trouble started ninety minutes into the New York to Heathrow flight and Mr Stoner, a member of the cabin crew, was called to the upper deck. Miss Reiss said: 'Miss Johnson was inside a toilet and there was groaning and banging noises coming from inside and when the staff knocked on the door she would not unlock it. 'Mr Stoner decided to take the door off its hinges, but Miss Johnson put her back against it to stop him.' Miss Johnson was travelling on board a flight from New York to Heathrow when the incident occurred . Other passengers were described as being noticeably upset as the door was eventually removed and Miss Johnson, whose eyes were glazed, shouted: 'F*** off. Get off me.' Miss Reiss explained: 'She would not walk and was carried back to the galley and wet herself. The crew detected the smell of alcohol on her breath and urine on her clothes. 'She threatened that she was going to shoot them in the face and put her hand into her jeans pocket and pulled out her passport. 'She then kicked down on Mr Stoner's right shin then used her fist and made contact with his right eyebrow and he felt blood trickling down his face. He was cut.' Regret: Miss Johnson's lawyer said the defendant had 'little, if any, memory of the incident', but was nervous and stressed when boarding and did not have anything to eat . Miss Reiss continued: 'She also kicked Mr Shaw, he was kicked on the shin and she did attempt to bite him and told him: 'I'm going to shoot you in the face.' 'At that point Mr Shaw said: 'Get the handcuffs.' 'Throughout the incident Miss Johnson was swearing all the time and upsetting her fellow passengers. 'When police officers arrived at Terminal Five to meet Miss Jonson she was clearly drunk.' Miss Johnson's lawyer Miss Laura Hucknell said: 'This was meant to be her honeymoon with her husband. She is in the country with him, he's a musician performing in a London concert and they have rented a flat. 'She is devastated and horrified at her behaviour, particularly as she is a former cabin staff employee herself. 'She has little, if any, memory of the incident, but was nervous and stressed when boarding and did not have anything to eat. 'She is terrified of the prospect of going into custody and has not slept since.' 'Alarming and violent behaviour': Miss Johnson was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months, at Isleworth Crown Court . Judge Robin Johnson said: 'This was alarming and violent behaviour and violence in an airplane inevitably carries immediate imprisonment. 'By the skin of your teeth I have decided not to send you to prison.' Johnson was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for eighteen months, ordered to pay £2,000 compensation to Mr Stoner, £1,000 to Mr Shaw, £650 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.","American Brie Ann Johnson, 35, was joining her husband in London .

"An historic pub in Scotland that offers one of the best views for tourists trying to spot the Loch Ness Monster has been put up for sale. The Dores Inn is located at the north end of the famous Loch, eight miles from Inverness, and overlooks one of the most iconic landscapes in the Highlands. Monster sale: The pub is located at the north end of the famous Loch Ness in Inverness-shire . The inn's current owners, Quintin and Michelle Stevens, have run the pub since 2008. But now the couple, who also own the Storehouse of Foulis - a farm shop and restaurant - in Easter Ross, are calling time on their association with Dores and have put the inn on the market for £750,000. In 2011, the Stevens revealed plans to close the inn and build a new tourist attraction in its place. It was intended to be in a similar vein as their Easter Ross venture but the plans never came to fruition. Listed in Lonely Planet earlier this year as one of 50 'undiscovered and overlooked' destinations in Europe, the pub has also proved popular with VIPs at the RockNess festival in previous years. Remote: The pub was listed in Lonely Planet as one of Europe's 50 'undiscovered and overlooked' destinations . Peaceful: The pub's customers can enjoy one of the most iconic views in the Scottish Highlands . The pub's net turnover for the year ending March 31, 2014, was £847,322. Selling agent Euan MacCrimmon, of Strutt & Parker, said: 'The sale of the Dores Inn provides a fantastic opportunity to purchase a successful bar and restaurant located on the shores of the iconic Loch Ness. 'The business has been trading extremely well over the past five years and there remains real potential to expand the business and take advantage of its highly scenic position with loch frontage and its close proximity to the popular city of Inverness.' The full Lonely Planet entry reads: 'While tour coaches pour down the west side of Loch Ness, the eastern shore is relatively peaceful.

"Ibiza and Tenerife are two of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists but many of them cannot pinpoint the Spanish islands on a map, according to new research. A holiday price comparison website compiled a list of the 20 most-visited resorts and asked people who had recently returned from a summer break to mark the holiday hot spots on a map. A huge 68.5 per cent of the 3,000 holidaymakers questioned by Icelolly.com were unable to pinpoint the country for all 20 of the resorts. Party island: 12 per cent of people thought Ibiza,  part of the Balearic Islands, was a separate country . Turning Japanese: Ten per cent of people thought Thailand’s capital Bangkok was in Japan . Tenerife in the Canary Islands fared the worst with nearly a fifth of people (19 per cent) placing it on the map incorrectly. This was followed by Cancun, Mexico (18 per cent), Prague, Czech Republic (16 per cent), Marrakesh, Morocco (16 per cent) and Jamaica in the Caribbean (15 per cent). Ten per cent of people thought Thailand’s capital Bangkok was in Japan while 12 per cent thought Ibiza, which is part of the Balearic Islands, was a separate country. Meanwhile, six per cent of people thought Jamaica was in Africa and five per cent thought it was possible to drive from London to Dublin, not realising that they would have to navigate across the Irish Sea. Tenerife is a  popular destination for British tourists but nearly a fifth placed it on the map incorrectly . 1. Ibiza (Balearic Islands, Spain) 2. Crete (Greece) 3. Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) 4. Marbella (Costa Del Sol, Spain) 5. Cancun (Mexico) 6. Zante (Greece) 7. Florida (USA) 8. Prague (Czech Republic) 9. Marmaris (Turkey) 10. San Francisco (USA) 11. Dubai (UAE) 12. Algarve (Portugal) 13. Marrakesh (Morocco) 14. Benidorm (Costa Blanca, Spain) 15. Paris (France) 16. Amsterdam (The Netherlands) 17. Bangkok (Thailand) 18. Venice (Italy) 19. Dublin (Ireland) 20. Jamaica (Caribbean) Embarrassingly for parents, children fared better than adults when it came to naming all 20 countries. Nearly six in ten (58 per cent) of those aged seven to 15 admitted to ignoring where the country of their most recent holiday featured on an atlas and less than a third (31 per cent) were able to accurately locate all 20 countries. Of the 16-25 year olds, 39 per cent accurately located all 20 countries however, only 24 per cent of people aged between 26 and 40 were able to replicate that feat. Wrong continent: Six per cent of people thought the Caribbean island of Jamaica was in Africa . Flooding the engine: The five per cent of people who thought it was possible to drive from London to Dublin (pictured) would come unstuck when they encountered the Irish Sea . Suniel Makh, Icelolly's Brand Director commented: ‘We're a nation of boomerang holidaymakers - we tend to return to the same holiday spots from one year to another. 'So although we holiday abroad the most frequently, we're actually one of the least well-travelled bunch when it comes to the breadth of countries we've visited, with the average Brit visiting only six different countries in their lifetime. ‘Although there is still a strong demand for the typical adolescent booze-fuelled getaways, more and more are opting to travel to long-haul destinations such as Thailand and Australia and see the world before settling down and getting a job. ‘These younger travellers are seeing more of the world and developing a sounder geographical knowledge than that of their parents and younger siblings.'","Many travellers failed to pinpoint resorts in Ibiza, Tenerife and Benidorm .

"Spread over 235,000 square metres, with space for 400 shops, a 20-screen cinema and 10,000 car parking spaces, you wouldn't want to get lost in Abu Dhabi's latest giant shopping centre.

Delay: The shopping centre is nearing completion, although it was originally due to open nine months ago . Yas Mall is being built on a man-made island and is set to become the second largest shopping centre in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The sprawling complex is predicted to attract 20 million shoppers per year and will cover a 235,000 square metre plot on Yas Island, which is also home to the Ferrari World theme park.

But Mohammed Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Aldar Properties, the developers behind Yas Mall, told CNN that the company is already planning an expansion before the mall has opened its doors. ‘We couldn't fit all the retailers we wanted to be here, so we're already starting to plan phase two,’ he said. ‘Abu Dhabi is a growing city. It's growing in its developments, it's growing in its demographics.

"Ryanair has found a new way to squeeze more cash out of its flights thanks to the purchase of 100 ‘game-changer’ Boeing aircrafts. The no-frills airline announced the £13.6bn deal at a press conference in New York today. The new Boeing 737 Max 200 has the capacity to hold 200 passengers but Ryanair plans to fit the planes with 197 seats, eight more than the airline’s current 189-seater Boeing fleet. Scroll down for video . New era: Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair (left) and Ray Conner, President and CEO of The Boeing Company, shake hands after signing a contract announcing the first sales of Boeing's new 737 Max 200 . Ryanair predicted that the additional seats would be worth £62,000 per plane a year. Having 197 seats instead of 200 will help the airline reduce costs further as one flight attendant is required for every 50 passengers. Boeing claims the aircraft will also reduce the company's normal fuel consumption by 18 per cent because it is so efficient, along with reducing noise emissions by 40 per cent. Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the company's operating costs would be around 20 per cent lower and said the savings would be passed on to its customers via lower fares. Speaking at a press conference in New York where he and Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner signed the deal, Mr O'Leary said the new aircraft would usher in a 'new era' of price wars in Europe. He said: 'I feel like a child who has woken up on Christmas morning unwrapping his presents and finding out that Santa Claus has given him exactly what he has asked for. ‘This is the aircraft we have been waiting for in Ryanair for probably 10 years now. It is going to mark a step change in improving Ryanair's efficiency. 'It means that we're going to expand and grow very strongly in Europe, both in new markets and in going in and taking traffic away from incumbent carriers. 'I hope it will hasten in an era of a new price war in Europe over the next 10 years, which like all the old price wars, Ryanair will win.' 'Gamechanger': Boeing claims its 737 Max 200 will reduce the company's normal fuel consumption by 18 per cent, along with reducing noise emissions by 40 per cent . Despite the increased capacity, passengers are being promised more leg room - growing from the current 29 inches to 30 inches. But, in return, the aircraft's toilets and galley will be smaller and the seats will be slimmer. The planes will also feature two additional doors and a Boeing Sky Interior, which features sculpted sidewalls, LED lighting that 'enhances the sense of spaciousness' and larger pivoting overhead stowage bins. Ryanair is the aircraft's first customer and has the option to buy another 100 planes. The airline will this week take delivery of the first of 180 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, set to take its fleet size from 304 to 420 by 2019. Expansion: Michael O'Leary said the deal would reduce Ryanair's operating costs by 20 per cent and would lead to cheaper air fares for passengers . Taking on the new Boeing 737 Max 200 will help Ryanair expand its fleet to 520 by 2024, nearly doubling its annual passengers from 82m to 150m. Ryanair already is the largest airline in Europe, and Mr O'Leary said the new Boeing planes will further cut Ryanair's operating costs, allowing it to take market share from legacy carriers such as Lufthansa, SAS, British Airways and Alitalia. It also hopes to increase the destinations it serves, expanding beyond Europe to North Africa, Israel and the Gulf States. Mr O’Leary said that he expects the company to create 3000 jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers across Europe as it expands. ‘As many of Europe’s flag carriers cut capacity on short haul routes, Ryanair looks forward to using these new Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft to grow at many more of Europe’s primary airports', he said. Mr Conner said: ‘The 737 MAX 200 is the perfect fit for Ryanair, providing improved efficiencies, 20 per cent lower emissions, increased revenues and a high level of passenger comfort.’","Airline announced the £13.6bn deal at a press conference in New York today .

"Ryanair has ordered a new fleet of aircraft and is promising more leg room for passengers despite squeezing in eight additional seats. The new Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft has a capacity of 200 but the budget airline plans to fit the planes with 197 seats – eight more than its current fleet of Boeing 737-800s. The aircraft have the same dimensions but controversial Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary promised passengers will be more comfortable in the 737 Max planes thanks to slimmer seats and smaller toilets and galleys in a redesigned fuselage that includes an additional emergency exit. Scroll down for video . This graphic shows the configuration of Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 aircraft and its Boeing 737 Max 200, which is the same size but will carry more passengers . New era: Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair (left), and Ray Conner, President and CEO of The Boeing Company, shake hands after signing a contract announcing the first sales of Boeing's new 737 Max 200 . There are currently 30 inches between the front of one seat and the front of the next, and the space is expected to increase slightly on the new jets, although they will have less cabin space. The details were part of the no-frills airline’s announcement that it has agreed to purchase up to 200 of the new ‘game-changer’ jets from Boeing. The deal will be worth as much as £22bn as Ryanair plans a massive expansion into existing and new markets with an eye on keeping costs low. Mr O’Leary, chief executive of Europe’s largest budget airline, said the 737 Max aircraft contain new features that will trim its operating costs by around 20 per cent. He said the savings will be passed on to customers via lower fares. With more efficient and quieter engines, the 737 Max will reduce the airline’s fuel consumption by up to 18 per cent and the eight additional seats will bring in extra cash. With an expanding fleet that can hold more people, Ryanair is expecting to grow from over 82million passengers in 2014 to over 150million by 2024 when all of the planes are in service. Ryanair predicted that the additional seats would be worth £62,000 per plane a year. Having 197 seats instead of 200 will help the airline keep its costs down as one flight attendant is required for every 50 passengers. By avoiding a configuration of 200 seats, the airline will not have to hire additional cabin crew members.

"The latest Doctor Who series kicks off tonight, with fans of the show holding their breath for Peter Capaldi’s debut as the twelfth incarnation of the eponymous hero. And a café in Bristol has decided to honour the popular BBC show in a very unique way. The Time Lord's famous blue box has been converted into a toilet for the café's customers, complete with flashing lights and Tardis sound effects. The cafe's owners bought the replica Tardis for £1,800 on eBay and paid to have it fitted out as a toilet . Owner Claire Hoggans says customers are constantly asking whether the 'Who Loo' is bigger on the inside . The café's owners Justin and Claire Hoggans picked up the replica for £1,800 on eBay and spent almost as much again getting it fitted out by a carpenter in York. And since installing the ‘Who Loo’, as they have called it, the Hoggans have had a steady stream of visitors to their Warmley Waiting Room Cafe on the Bristol & Bath Railway Path. The Tardis has been fitted with a Victorian-style toilet and sink, along with a hand dryer, tiled floor and walls and a new fibreglass roof. It also features Tardis sound effects, which are operated via a doorbell in the café, and flashing lights that are operated by a motion sensor as people go in and out to spend a penny. The Tardis has been fitted with a Victorian-style toilet and sink, tiled floor and walls and a new fibreglass roof . The toilet also features Tardis sound effects and flashing lights that are operated by a motion sensor . The Tardis is set to become a tourist attraction in the area, with customers lining up to have their photograph taken in front of the unique toilet. Claire, 47, said: ‘We enjoy Doctor Who but we are not crazy, Trekkie-type people.’ Justin, 41, added: ‘We've always loved Doctor Who and we went to a B&B that had a Tardis as a changing room for their hot tub, which our kids loved. ‘This gave me the idea. Lots of people, young and old seem to love it - it's a talking point and a bit of fun, but also functional. ‘We get asked numerous times a day 'is it bigger on the inside?’’ Jenna Coleman and Peter Capaldi posed in front of the official Tardis in London's Parliament Square yesterday . Debut: Peter Capaldi is set to star in his first full episode as the Time Lord in Deep Breath tonight, which will see him transported to Victorian London where a dinosaur is running rampant . Doctor Who returns to BBC One tonight at 7.50pm with Peter Capaldi as the twelfth Doctor. It was first screened in 1963 and has since gained cult status with 800 episodes produced. 'Tardis' stands for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space. The official BBC Tardis materialised in London's Parliament Square yesterday as the stars of the show posed for publicity photographs ahead of tonight’s launch. Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman, who plays the Doctor’s assistant Clara Oswald, perched on a rock side next to a giant dinosaur skull.

"Selfies, shots of legs on sun loungers, cocktails in the sunset ... social media users can be overwhelmed by a sense of 'déjà vu' while scrolling through other people's holiday photographs. And if your latest photo album contains 127 landscape shots, 45 selfies, five images of strangers and six stray cats, you've had the most run-of-the-mill summer break, according to new research. An online travel agency quizzed British holidaymakers about their latest photo collection to determine the most popular subject for their camera lens. 'Wish you were here?' If you can combine a selfie with a group shot and a landscape, you're on to a winner . The 'hotdog legs' trend of snapping your extremities while lying on the beach is very much a part of the modern holiday and is favourite with celebrities . Of the 2,176 people questioned by www.sunshine.co.uk, 89 per cent said they took photographs on their last holiday, using either a smartphone (66 per cent), camera (42 per cent) or a tablet device (27 per cent). The average photo collection contained 447 images, with just 216 of these images making it on to people's social media pages. The majority never get printed out: when asked whether their holiday photos ever made it into physical albums or photo frames, 76 per cent of people said ‘no, they stay in digital format forever’. In the frame: Most holidaymakers used a smartphone, with just 27 per cent opting to take photos on a tablet . The holidaymakers were then asked to analyse their latest photo collection and describe how many of each type of picture they’d taken. Landscape shots proved the most popular subject matter, accounting for a total of 127 images. In second place was images of the resort (62), followed by selfies (45) and portrait shots of fellow travellers (38). Snap happy: The ubiquitous 'selfie' accounted for 45 images in the average photo collection . The camera lens was also trained on the local wildlife (33), swimming pools (26) and local landmarks (21). Facebook friends were 'treated' to 27 images of food and drink, 16 shots of the hotel room and 10 photos of legs on a sun lounger. But 31 images were either blurred or blank. And the average photo collection also bizarrely contained five pictures of strangers and six of stray cats. Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk said: 'I think it’s really important to take holiday photos, because having those memories to look back on and share with friends and family is great. 'Holiday selfies are clearly very popular, as are landscape shots of beaches and scenery. 'People should just make sure that they don’t spend too much of their holiday stuck behind a camera lens, as it is better to actually be looking around and enjoying your surroundings! 'As for those photos of stray cats and strangers, perhaps those holidaymakers should point their cameras towards the sunset or their next cocktail instead!' Best foot forward: Many people couldn't resist sharing a shot of their tanned legs on a sun lounger . Press paws: The average photo collection also contained six images of stray cats .","The average British holidaymaker takes 447 images while abroad .

"The exterior of this abandoned aircraft hangar is unlikely to feature on any holiday postcards but appearances can be deceptive. Inside the giant dome is a water park the size of eight football pitches, boasting its own beaches, lagoons and tropical rainforest. Tropical Islands resort is housed within the largest free-standing hall in the world, which measures 66,000 square metres and is so tall the Statue of Liberty could fit inside it. Scroll down for video . Unlikely location: The resort is housed in an old aircraft hangar near Berlin and doesn't look particularly tropical from the outside . Sunny all year round: Inside, the hangar is home to pools, beaches, balmy lagoons and the world's largest indoor rainforest . Blue skies thinking: The resort has even erected a fake blue sky complete with fluffy white clouds, though it will never rain inside the dome . Making a splash: Tropical Islands is home to Germany's highest water slide tower which stands at a vertigo-inducing 27 metres tall . The water park is located in Krausnick, near Berlin and claims to offer tourists all the elements of a tropical holiday destination in the middle of Europe. The huge hangar once housed Zeppelins but its owners went bankrupt in 1992 and the building fell into disrepair. It was transformed 10 years ago into an indoor paradise by a Malaysian company. Inside, the temperature is always a pleasant 26C which means the attraction can host the world's largest indoor rainforest, along with pools, beaches and giant water slides. Among them is Germany's highest water slide tower which stands at a vertigo-inducing 27 metres tall. Up to 700 people an hour can zoom down a 21-metre undulating stainless steel slide before going on the 112-metre Crazy River steel tube slide and then reach a top speed of 70 kmph on the power turbo slide. Regeneration: The huge hangar once housed Zeppelins but its owners went bankrupt in 1992 and the building fell into disrepair until it was transformed 10 years ago . In a spin: The resort's multi-coloured slides tower over the dome and are one of the main attractions for families . Don't look up: Holidaymakers can pretend they are lounging on a tropical island, as long as they ignore the ugly grey dome above . Up to 700 people an hour can zoom down a 21-metre undulating stainless steel slide before going on the 112-metre Crazy River steel tube slide . The resort's indoor rainforest has a one-kilometre walkway and 50,000 plants, of which there are 600 different species. The complex also offers bars, saunas, lagoons and grottos to entertain a capacity of 6,000 visitors, along with 522 beds in various rooms and lodges, and hundreds of tents. There are 400 sunloungers to accommodate guests on the world's largest indoor beach and, although they won't be able to soak up real tropical rays, at least they can be sure that it will never rain. In the Bali Lagoon pool, swimmers can enjoy water temperatures of 32C while they are surrounded by palm trees, Balinese huts and even a waterfall. The park is also home to Europe's biggest tropical spa and sauna complex which is spread over 10,000 square metres. The six different treatment areas are modelled on various cultural sites, including the Elephanta Temple, which is a scale model of the original temple in India, and the Angkor Wat Temple based on the world-famous temple complex in Cambodia. Meanwhile, the Jungle Village sits on stilts five metres above the ground and houses a range of saunas and steam baths. Controlling the weather: The sun peeks through the dome's windows but it will never rain inside the tropical water park . World on your doorstep: One of the resort's zones features a Balinese-themed area complete with palm trees and Balinese huts . Huge project: The giant dome measures 66,000 square metres and is so tall the Statue of Liberty could fit inside it . Some visitors on TripAdvisor said the resort was great for winter trips and was the perfect place to entertain children, while others complained about high prices, long queues and a lack of sunbeds. Ravita wrote: 'The island is an amazing place - feels like a real tropical island and there are lots of things to do with tots', while HenrikKragh wrote: 'Lovely bathing, cool action, nice temperature, unique location and setting.' However, other customers were not so satisfied. Borszczuk wrote: 'Visited for one day during national holiday and the place was a bit overcrowded - forget about finding free sunbed, finding free spot on sand was quite hard too. In general, the place is great for kids. Adults will most likely find it OK but boring.' And Viswakumar A warned: 'The sauna area of the park has a nude dress code. So be prepared!' Soaking up the artificial rays: Tropical Islands has only 400 sunloungers to accommodate 6,000 visitors . Relaxation zone: The park is also home to Europe's biggest tropical spa and sauna complex which is spread over 10,000 square metres . Stay the night: The complex also offers visitors the choice of 522 beds in various rooms and lodges, along with hundreds of tents . Take a souvenir back with you: Tropical Islands' gift shop is well-stocked with family games and activities . Light fantastic: Bathers can chill out in different zones, several of which are modelled on other countries . Life's a beach: If you squint - and ignore all the screaming children - you can pretend that you are lounging on the beach in Bali . Home from home: Along with cheaper stays in tents and lodges, the resort offers families and couples more luxurious accommodation . Take the plunge: The resort's tropical spa and sauna complex is spread over 10,000 square metres and offers guests a range of treatments .

"The Milky Way, the Northern Lights and raging night storms illuminate the night sky in America's Midwest in this stunning timelapse video captured by South Dakota photographer and videographer Randy Halverson. The ever-changing canopy of clouds and constellations provides an ethereal backdrop to otherwise everyday scenes of fields, farms and tranquil lakes. One lake is bathed in a green, eerie glow while in another shot, the stars appear to spin in the sky behind silhouetted trees. Scroll down for video . Out of this world: Randy's impressive timelapse shots capture the sky over America's Midwest in all its glory . Purple haze: A satellite streaks across the night sky, which is bathed in the ethereal glow of the Northern Lights . Nature's light show: An ever-changing canopy of clouds and constellations provides an ethereal backdrop to otherwise ordinary scenes of fields and farms . Halverson captured the footage in some of the most isolated regions of the States, including South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah, between spring and autumn 2013. The 47-year-old spent 40 nights across eight-months using a wide-angle lens and long exposures to obtain the crystal-clear footage. Randy, from Kennebec, South Dakota, started up a stock footage company selling pictures of storms in the 1990s but decided to started shooting timelapse videos four years ago. ‘I just decided I was looking for something a little bit different other than storms so that’s how I got into the long exposure timelapse', he explains. Branching out:  Halverson used to photograph storms but decided to started shooting timelapse videos four years ago . Remote: Halverson captured the footage in some of the most isolated regions of the States, including South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah . Dedicated: The photographer spent 40 nights across eight-months using a wide-angle lens and long exposures to obtain the crystal-clear footage . Shock and awe: Halverson put his experience of shooting storms to good use, capturing this impressive shot of lightning in the night sky . The dedicated videographer battled with cloudy weather conditions to achieve the amazing footage of the dramatic Midwestern night sky. He said: 'I use DSLR [digital single-lens reflex] cameras to shoot long exposure timelapse at night with up to 30-seconds per frame. 'I then assembled the individual frames into the timelapse on my computer. I spent a lot of time with the hue settings and white balance during the month-and-a-half edit. 'The weather in 2013 made it difficult for me to get some of the shots I wanted. There were many times I planned to shoot the Milky Way or Aurora, and the clouds would roll in.' Seeing things with a new eye: Randy's images bring a whole new dimension to everyday landscapes . Back to nature: The photographer uses a DSLR camera on a 6ft metal rail, that is set up to move the camera smoothly in time with the sky . Crystal-clear: The dedicated videographer battled with all weather conditions to achieve the amazing footage of the dramatic Midwestern night sky . Red sky at night: Randy said there were many times when he planned to shoot the Milky Way or Aurora, and the clouds would roll in . Randy, who also owns a farm in South Dakota, takes hundreds of still photos over several hours and then ‘stitches’ them together to create amazing sequences. 'At a normal rate you don’t notice how the Earth is rotating and it looks like the stars are moving across the sky. 'It just speeds up everything so much more than you’re used to seeing', he said. Halverson said he got some of his best shots of the Milky Way in Wyoming but he was often hampered by cloud. He also captured several satellites and a couple of meteors in the shots: ‘The meteors are hard to see in time-lapse, but you may see a quick flash because they only last one frame. If you see a light moving across the sky, it is either an airplane or satellite, not a meteor.’ And he explained that capturing the stunning red or green glow of the Aurora was often not planned: 'Some of the Aurora I shot were unexpected with no advanced notice. Several nights I was setting up Milky Way shots, when I noticed the glow in the sky to the north.' A new direction: Randy used to photograph storms but decided to opt for a more serene subject matter four years ago . Labour of love: Halverson takes hundreds of still photos over several hours and then ‘stitches’ them together to create amazing sequences . Perfect timing: Randy said there were many times when it was difficult for him to get the shot he wanted but here he captures the night sky in all its glory . Most of Randy's footage is shot at night and, if you can see stars and it looks like the sun setting or rising, it is actually the moon: 'It will light up the landscape just like the sun with long exposures', he explains. He used a dolly, a 6ft metal rail, that is set up to move the camera smoothly in time with the sky and gives it what Halverson calls the ‘walking through it look’. Randy says: 'People love my pictures - some even say they are blown away. 'I do get the occasional comment from someone who thinks it is fake and it is a Hubble spaceship picture inserted into the background. 'But it would actually take more time to do that than shoot the real time-lapse.' Those who want to learn Randy’s techniques can join him for a photography workshop in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Students can learn the basics of timelapse photography, along with how to scout the best locations and deal with changing weather conditions.

"It's no doubt tiring work roaming the sun-drenched plains of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. Luckily for this lioness, nature provided the perfect spot to recharge her batteries. Russian photographer Petr Banny captured the amusing sight of the sleepy animal letting all four limbs hang down from a tree branch as she dozed in the afternoon sun. Do not disturb: Photographer Petr Banny got within 20 metres of the lioness but she didn't seem to notice . Branching out: Mr Banny said it was rare for lions to climb trees - at least while they were being watched . Mr Banny, who is an experienced safari travel guide for photographers, got within 20 metres of the animal to take the photograph and said he has never seen anything like it before. 'When I noticed her she was already lying on the tree', he explained. 'In my presence she was asleep for about 10 minutes, then she woke up and started changing poses. 'It was late in the day around 5.30pm and she was sleeping.' A brief paws: Mr Banny said 'if the tourists behave calmly, the animals do not pay attention to the people' Cat napping: The lioness eventually opened her eyes to find she was the centre of attention . Petr left Russia in 2002 to travel the world, embarking on photography tours in Japan, Zambia, Yemen and Colombia. He was on one such photo tour in Tanzania when he spotted the lioness. Petr, 42, added: 'In Tanzania wild animals get used to the tourists so if the tourists behave calmly, the animals do not pay attention to the people. 'Lions climbing the trees is a rare phenomenon - at least while they are being watched. 'Perhaps they do this because after seasonal rainfall, grass in the savannah is long so it could be easier for the lions to notice the prey when they are up on a tree. 'It means it can be a sort of observation point - and watching it made me smile.' Balancing act: Mr Banny said that lions sometimes use trees as an observation point when the grass is long . Sitting pretty: The lioness was asleep for 10 minutes before she changed her position .","The image was captured by Russian photographer Petr Banny .

"A man has been jailed for 15 months for subjecting crew on board an easyJet flight to a foul-mouthed rant and then attacking the police officer who tried to arrest him. Michael Warrilow was travelling on board a flight from Amsterdam to Liverpool John Lennon airport in October last year when the incident took place. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mr Warrilow began looking for food in the flight attendant’s trolley once the plane had taken off. When he was asked to stop he reportedly replied: ‘Drop the f***ing attitude.’ Mr Warrilow was travelling on a flight from Amsterdam to Liverpool last year when the incident took place . He was later asked to pick up some crisps that he had dropped on the floor and was reported to have replied: ‘I’m not a f***ing dog, especially not your f***ing dog.’ A male flight attendant also accused Mr Warrilow of making a homophobic comment, which the defendant denied, according to the Liverpool Echo. But when he was told that the captain was going to call the police he said: ‘I don’t give a ****. Get away you **** before I hit you.’ Police officers were waiting to arrest Mr Warrilow when the plane landed in Liverpool but he tried to resist arrest. He struggled so violently with the police officers that he broke the thumb and tore the ligament of one of the officers. Police officers were called to Liverpool John Lennon Airport to arrest the defendant when the plane landed . When Mr Warrilow was eventually escorted to the police van he began to butt his head against the cage inside the van. The injured police officer had to undergo surgery on his hand and take sick leave from his job to recover. But the day after the incident, Mr Warrilow insisted that he had not assaulted the officers. He also said he hadn’t taken any drugs while in Amsterdam and claimed to have only drunk water during his trip. Two weeks before the trial the defendant pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm, along with a public order offence and two further charges under the civil aviation act. He was jailed for 15 months. The court heard that Mr Warrilow, who is unemployed, had 65 previous convictions. These included burglary, battery, assault and affray, resisting arrest and disorderly behaviour. Mr Warrilow was sentenced to 15 months in prison at Liverpool Crown Court for the 'appalling' attack . Judge Andrew Menary, QC, called Mr Warrilow’s actions ‘appalling’ and said the defendant had ‘lost control’ causing a ‘nasty injury’. He said: ‘Your offences and the injury to the police constable were the culmination of a quite appalling episode of violent aggressive and intimidating behaviour displayed by you toward cabin crew of the easyJet flight. ‘It must have been intimidating and threatening not just to the cabin crew but other passengers nearby. 'Travelling on an aeroplane is stressful enough without passengers behaving as you were behaving.'","Michael Warrilow was travelling from Amsterdam to Liverpool .

"Prince Harry celebrated a marathon charity trek to the South Pole with a group of injured servicemen yesterday, declaring: ‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight!’ Sporting a fulsome ginger beard after his three gruelling weeks on the ice, the royal was full of praise for his teammates, all of whom have suffered terrible injuries fighting for their country, including one soldier who lost both his legs in Afghanistan. ‘It will just prove to everybody that there’s so much that can be made possible when you think that nothing is left,’ said the prince. Video of arrival below... Prince Harry and fellow adventurer Ivan touch . the South pole today: After more than three weeks pulling sleds across . the frozen wastes of Antarctica the group stood at the bottom of the . world at midday . Heroes: The adventurers include 12 servicemen . and women from the UK and other nations who have suffered terrible . injuries, including the loss of limbs . Achievement: Their trek took them more than 200 miles across the continent to the geographic South Pole . 'The feeling is incredible,' said Ed Parker, the . expedition's director and co-founder of the Walking With The Wounded . charity that organised the challenge . The . Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied challenge saw three teams of . servicemen – from Britain, the Commonwealth and the US – racing to . reach the bottom of the world. The . teams travelled a distance of 208 miles across some of the most . inhospitable conditions known to man, with temperatures of up to minus . 50 degrees and biting winds. Every . man and woman was also forced to carry a custom built arctic sledge . known as a pulk, weighing in excess of 11 stone, carrying their kit. The . terrain was so challenging that last weekend organisers were forced to . suspend the race element of the trek and group all the competitors . together for safety. Teamwork: Prince Harry with Heath Jamieson (left) during the expedition . Such . was the camaraderie, however, the men and women linked hands as they . walked the last few yards of the route to stand together at the bottom . of the world at 12.48pm.

All . twelve of them have different reasons for being here….but I’m so proud, . I’m so chuffed, I’m so privileged to be here with all these guys and . girls. What an amazing accomplishment. ‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight and then everyone’s looking forward to getting home. Mission success!’ He went on: '[The team] has dug out blind to get here, . Duncan you know, it’s just remarkable the fact that someone with no legs . has made it here, and to have done it in record breaking time, no . doubt. 'And Ivan as well, when I look across I . see him being guided around you know, totally blind, from America, and . absolutely hates the cold, and you know he’s not doing it for himself, . he’s doing it for his buddies back home, and that goes for everybody, . every single one here.

"Alan Shearer says he does not hold much hope for former club Newcastle United and fears a ‘long, hard season’ lies ahead. The Magpies are without a win this term and reside in the bottom three going into Saturday’s home game with Leicester City. Manager Alan Pardew has seen off intense speculation surrounding his future - at least in the short-term - and retains the support of owner Mike Ashley. Peter Crouch scores for Stoke in one of seven Premier League games Newcastle United have failed to win . Former Magpies striker Alan Shearer worries for his club this season, saying they 'haven't been good enough' Pardew looks unhappy as he watches his team draw 2-2 with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium . But Shearer has not been impressed by performances on the pitch. Indeed, his hometown team have collected just 20 points from a possible 78 since the turn of the year. He told the Chronicle: ‘It has been poor since January this year,’ said the club’s record goalscorer, who netted 206 times during 10 years on Tyneside. ‘I’m exactly the same as the fans at the minute - I’m one of them. ‘I pay for my ticket and I’m the same. I am entitled to my opinion. Shearer scored a club record 206 goals in 10 years on Tyneside but fears for his former side this year . Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke . ‘It hasn’t been pleasant watching to be honest. ‘I don’t hold too much hope for us this season. I think it could be a long, hard season for us.’ And Shearer says there are no mitigating circumstances for Pardew or the club to put forward as an excuse for results, admitting there is a real danger they could be dragged in to a relegation battle. ‘Nobody can make any excuses,’ added Shearer, speaking ahead of the 206 Dinner in Newcastle next month. ‘The simple fact is we haven’t been good enough. You can make whatever excuses you want. Injuries, too many games or confidence. Newcastle fans have reacted angrily to their side's start to the campaign, calling for Pardew's head . Newcastle have been denied the services of promising midfielder Siem de Jong (centre) through injury . ‘Put all of that to one side, the simple fact of the matter is we just have not been good enough. ‘We haven’t been unlucky. We haven’t been ravaged by injuries. We haven’t been done by dodgy decisions. ‘We just haven’t been good enough. It’s simple. That’s the harsh reality of it. ‘Things have to improve and they have to improve pretty quickly or we could find ourselves in a hole. ‘The quicker we can get out of it the better.’ Shearer is greeted by thousands of Newcastle fans after signing for the club for £15million in 1996 .","Former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer fears for his hometown club .

"Conservatives have considered limiting the number of times patients can visit their family doctor in a year, it emerged tonight. Documents examining health reforms ask Tory activists if they agree or disagree with an annual cap on the number of appointments patients can book. It is one of a number of options grassroots members were asked to look at in a consultation document, Local Health Discussion Brief, posted on the Conservative Policy Forum (CPF) website. Documents examining health reforms ask Tory activists if they agree or disagree with an annual cap on the number of appointments patients can book . Among them were whether GPs should take greater responsibility for out of hours care in their area - something Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt addressed earlier this week - and if seeing a GP for a routine appointment in the evening or at the weekend is a luxury the country cannot afford. The CPF describes itself as a national party group that gives members the opportunity to discuss the major policy challenges facing Britain and is chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin. Health experts reacted angrily to the suggestions, according to the Independent on Sunday. Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the newspaper: 'This was obviously written by someone who has never been unwell, or has never met people who work in the health service.' She added: 'People come because they are ill or because we are asking them to come because we are concerned about them. What we should do is fund general practice sufficiently so that we can offer flexible appointment times.' Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt addressed the issue of out-of-hours care earlier this week . Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed told the Independent on Sunday: 'This paper, hidden away on their website, reveals the Tories' true agenda for the NHS. After throwing the NHS open to ever more privatisation with a wasteful and damaging reorganisation, it seems the Tories want to go even further. 'It's shocking that they are considering limiting the number of times patients can see their GP - changing the fundamental principle in the NHS constitution that access to the NHS is based on clinical need. 'The Tories have already wasted £3bn on a top-down reorganisation of the NHS and overseen a crisis in A&E - now they are consulting their members on opening up the NHS to even more competition, and making it harder for patients to see GPs in the evenings and at weekends.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'This was simply a topic to provoke discussion and isn't Conservative Party policy.' Oliver Letwin chairs the Conservative Policy Forum website where the issue was posted for duscussion . It comes as government plans are to be unveiled that mean half of all medical students will be expected to become general practitioners. Independent training organisation Health Education England (HEE) will be told to meet the 50 per cent target by March 2015, health minister Dan Poulter will announce. Around 400 trainee medics a year become family doctors now, around 40 per cent, but ministers want to increase the rate so more patients can be treated locally rather than in hospital. Dr Poulter will also announce plans for at least 50 per cent of student nurses to carry out community placements as part of their training to ensure they understand the importance of community care.The plans, along with other training and education reforms, are expected to be unveiled in the HEE mandate, which is published on Tuesday. It comes at a time of tense relations between the Government and GPs. Earlier this week the Royal College of General Practitioners warned funding was being 'stretched to the limits', predicting that the money allocated to family doctors would fall by nearly £200 million over the next three years. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was also attacked for making childish claims about the role of GPs in exacerbating problems at overstretched accident and emergency departments. Chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee Dr Laurence Buckman said the Tory Cabinet minister 'keeps on tweeting and speaking a childishly superficial and misleading analysis of a very complex problem'. Mr Hunt, however, insisted problems seen in accident and emergency departments in recent months are partly the result of ageing demographics but also because out of hours care does not work properly under the 2004 GP contracts. The NHS staff training blueprint is part of the Government's strategy to ensure more people with long-term illnesses, such as diabetes and respiratory diseases, and disabilities can be treated at home or in the community. According to the Department of Health there is growing medical evidence that up to a third of older patients currently in hospitals do not need to be there. Dr Poulter said: 'We need a modern, caring NHS that puts patients first and offers them the most appropriate and effective treatment. 'For many conditions, particularly those linked to an ageing population with more long-term medical needs, this will mean less time in hospital and more time being treated at home. 'It is essential that we have the right staff to meet these changing needs, to ensure that we have set ambitious but achievable targets to make sure the NHS has a workforce fit for the future to deliver the highest quality of care to patients.'","Tory activists asked if they agree or disagree with an annual cap on the number of appointments patients can book .

"It's no secret that American viewers are as fascinated with the latest happenings among the Crawley clan of Downton Abbey as us Brits. And popular reality-based shows such as Come Dine With Me and Undercover Boss have spawned scores of regional variations across the globe. But sales of British television shows around the world rose to a staggering £1.22billion last year. Global popularity: Shows such as Downton Abbey have helped lift sales of UK television shows to £1.22billion . Much loved: The exploits of Lady Mary, Lady Cora and Lady Edith are watched in countries like France, Sweden and in the Middle East as well as in the UK and U.S . New figures from trade association Pact show the US remains the most lucrative market for British shows, with sales increasing by 11 per cent to £475 million in 2012. Sales to China are up by 90 per cent to £12 million and India by 42 per cent, according to the latest annual Television Exports Survey. Despite sales to Australasian countries dropping slightly, that market remained the second biggest for UK exports with sales totalling £103million. Overall sales of UK TV shows around the world were up 4 per cent from £1.178 billion in 2011. Exports of finished TV programmes - as opposed to formats - dropped slightly but still remained the largest source of television revenue. Big business: Midsomer Murders is apparently one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's favourite shows . Pact, which represents independent TV companies, said that dramas and reality-based factual programmes were key to the increase in UK TV exports. Downton Abbey is one of the UK's most popular exports, now airing in Sweden, Russia, South Korea and various Middle Eastern countries to name a few. Another popular period drama to spread from UK shores is Parade's End starring benedict Cumberbatch. Global export: Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, has proved popular abroad . The Wartime show was bought by French broadcaster ARTE before it even aired and 17 other European countries now show it. Popular crime drama Midsomer Murders is said to be a favourite of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has been sold to around 225 territories since it first aired on ITV. But it is not just scripted drama series that have proved a hit elsewhere. Local versions of shows such as Come Dine With Me are now produced all around the globe, with India the latest territory to produce its own version. Similarly, Undercover Boss is now broadcast in 200 territories and local variations of the format are shown in 20 countries including the U.S, Canada and France. But Pact said that the relatively low number of episodes in each season and 'overly domestic content' had prevented some programme sales. As well as boosting the UK entertainment industry's coffers, the popularity of British shows abroad has also seen the stock of some of our best loved actors and actresses rise across the globe. Former Doctor Who star David Tennant looks set for stardom in the US with American network Fox set to remake hit crime drama Broadchurch. According to the Independent, Tennant will put on an American accent for the remake. John McVay, Chief Executive at Pact, said: 'UK television productions are among the most sought-after in the world. 'International buyers seek out TV from Britain because they are looking for quality and originality. 'Year after year, our production companies lead the way creatively and our TV business goes from strength to strength. Popular: Parade's End, also starring Benedict Cumberbatch, is show in at least 17 European countries . 'The continued growth in exports to the USA is pleasing and the dramatic increase in sales to China is surely a sign of major developments to come. 'TV producers in the UK are innovative – they have established the sector among the most successful and influential of the UK's creative industries.' Paul Dempsey, President Global Markets, BBC Worldwide, added: 'Drama stands out as the most successful British export: shows like Parade's End, Sherlock and Downton Abbey have built a strong reputation for UK drama and made stars of British acting talent. 'Across the world we are seeing strong demand for British content. BBC Worldwide's export sales are up from £275m last year to £296m this year, on a like-for-like basis, and we continue to expect opportunities for growth across multiple territories. 'One particular example is Asia, where we are seeing strong demand for UK content in countries where we simply haven't experienced it before.' Remake: UK drama Broadchurch, starring former Doctor Who actor David Tennant, is to be remade for U.S Audiences by Fox .","Shows such as Downton Abbey and Midsomer Murders are proving increasingly popular abroad .

"Fully autonomous robots that decide for themselves when to kill could be developed within 20 to 30 years, or 'even sooner', a report has warned. Militaries across the world are said to be 'very excited' about machines that could deployed alone in battle, sparing human troops from dangerous situations. The U.S. is leading development in such 'killer robots', notably unmanned drones often used to attack suspected militants in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Rise Of The Machines: The third instalment of . the Terminator film franchise imagines the chain of events that leads to . death-dealing computers taking over the planet using robot soldiers . Drones are remotely controlled by human operators and unable to kill without authorisation, but weapons systems that require little human intervention already exist. Raytheon's Phalanx gun system, deployed on U.S. Navy ships, can search for enemy fire and destroy incoming projectiles by itself. The Northrop Grumman X47B is a plane-sized drone able to take off and land on aircraft carriers, carry out air combat without a pilot and even refuel in the air. But perhaps closest to the Terminator-type killing machine portrayed in Arnold Schwarzenegger's action films is a Samsung sentry robot already being used in South Korea. The machine is able to spot unusual activity, challenge intruders and, when authorised by a human controller, open fire. Automatic firing: Raytheon's Phalanx gun system, which searches for enemy missiles and automatically destroys incoming projectiles . Automatic death: Samsung's machine gun sentry robot, which is already in use in South Korea, can spot unusual activity, challenge intruders and, when authorised by a human controller, open fire . US researchers are working on a real-life Robocop who would patrol the streets to combat crime - just like in the film. Injured policemen or soldiers will be wired up to the ‘PatrolBot’, pictured below, which will effectively give them mechanical limbs that they have lost whilst in service. The plan is to make a basic version of Alex Murphy, the fictional policeman in the 1987 hit Robocop, who is turned into a cyber cop after being nearly killed in the line of duty. The new technology is based on advances in the US military in telerobotics, which is where users are wired up remotely to a robot and given physical feedback to simulate the feeling of being there. The warnings come from a new report by . Human Rights Watch, which insists that such Terminator-style robots are . banned before governments start deploying them. The . report, dubbed Losing Humanity and co-written by Harvard Law School's . International Human Rights Clinic, raises the alarm over the ethics of . the looming technology. Calling . them 'killer robots,' it urges 'an international treaty that would . absolutely prohibit the development, production, and use of fully . autonomous weapons.' Such . machines would mean that human soldiers could be spared from dangerous . situations, but the downside is that robots would then be left to make . highly nuanced decisions on their own, the most fraught being the need . to distinguish between civilians and combatants in a war zone. 'A number of governments, including the United States, are very excited about moving in this direction, very excited about taking the soldier off the battlefield and putting machines on the battlefield and thereby lowering casualties,' said Steve Goose, arms division director at Human Rights Watch. While Goose said 'killer robots' do . not exist as yet, he warned of precursors and added that the best way to . forestall an ethical nightmare is a 'preemptive, comprehensive . prohibition on the development or production of these systems.' The problem with handing over decision-making power to even the most sophisticated robots is that there would be no clear way of making anyone answer for the inevitable mistakes, said Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics at University of Sheffield. 'If a robot goes wrong, who's accountable? It certainly won't be the robot,' he said. 'The robot could take a bullet in its computer and go berserk. So there's no way of really determining who's accountable and that's very important for the laws of war.'","Militaries around the world 'very excited' about replacing soldiers with robots that can act independently .

"The heroic story of a humble librarian who became an all-action commando and was executed after a daring mission behind enemy lines has come to light 70 years after his death. Sergeant Thomas Handley was one of four commandos for the high-risk Special Operations Executive (SOE) - a secret espionage and sabotage force - caught by the Germans following an attempt to block the Corinth Canal in the Agean Sea by sinking a ship. The Nazis forced the trained wireless operator to send false messages back to his SOE base in Cairo, Egypt, so they would send back information about future operations. But brave Sgt Handley inserted 'tell tale' words into his messages so his superiors knew that he had been captured. Sergeant Thomas Handley was part of the  Special Operations Executive (SOE) - a secret espionage and sabotage force known as Churchill's Secret Army . Sgt Handley was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp when his Nazi captors realised he was duping them by sending fake messages to his superiors (file pic) With this knowledge, the British sent back fake messages in order to hoodwink the Germans and supply them with misleading information that would have disrupted their movements of troops. It took two months for the enemy to realise what Sgt Handley was up to, at which point he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in north-east Germany. In early 1945, just months before the end of the war, Sgt Handley and the three other commandos were rounded up and shot by the SS. Sgt Handley was awarded the Military Medal while he was a PoW for his brave actions but because of the nature of the SOE, dubbed Churchill's Secret Army, hardly anything was stated publicly about the award or what it was for. Even his family did not know about the details until 2000, when relatives started researching him and unearthed previously-sealed secret documents. An extract from the recommendation for the Military Medal reads: 'Without consideration of his personal safety, he took a grave risk the whole time in deliberately hoodwinking the enemy in a manner which has in other cases resulted in the immediate shooting of the operator.' The medals, along with poignant telegrams sent from the War Office to Sgt Handley's parents which confirm his death, are now set to sell for £20,000 pounds at auction tomorrow. A year after the end of the war, a solider looks on as a scuttled German ship lies across the Corinth Canal . Sgt Handley and three other commandos were captured when they were sent to the Corinth Canal, Greece, to attempt to blow up a ship and block the waterway . A letter, sent from the War Office to Sgt Handley's family, confirms his date of death as April 10, 1945 . Paul Laidlaw, of Laidlaw Auctioneers of Carlisle, Cumbria, said: 'It is the saddest of stories. What this man did and the bravery and sacrifice he made cannot be understated. 'If a soldier is killed in action then that is the nature of war but this was a crime. Sgt Handley was murdered by evil men. 'His actions were beyond Boy's Own and derring-do stuff. He was a true hero whose bravery has been hidden for 70 years. 'For like many such bravery awards, it was requested that no details should be made public, nor communicated to the press - leaving Handley's family firmly in the dark for a lifetime. 'They thought he was a lowly signaller and had no idea of his SOE activity, which was an incredibly risky organisation to be in considering Hitler gave the infamous order that commandos should be summarily executed as spies if caught.' Sgt Handley, from Sedbergh, Cumbria, worked in his local library until the outbreak of war in 1939, when he joined the Royal Signals. He was one of the first volunteers for the SOE, a covert organisation that carried out espionage and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. Along with the military medals and letter from the War Office, other records will be sold at auction tomorrow . Auctioneers estimate that the collection of fascinating artefacts will sell for around £20,000 in total tomorrow . Sgt Handley underwent special training which included parachute training and is likely to have taken part in a number of secret operations before the raid on the Corinth Canal in 1943. The four-man operation, led by Lieutenant Commander Michael Cumberlege, involved the team landing in uniform by submarine near Poros, Greece, with over two tons of munitions and explosives. Despite interventions by Italian and German forces, the team managed to deposit the mines on a ship in the canal, however the explosives failed to detonate. Although they got away following fire-fight, the Germans recovered one of their radios, complete with secret code books. Sgt Handley later received a radio message, almost certainly sent by the Germans using the captured wireless set, advising the team of a rendezvous with a Royal Navy submarine. The meeting was a trap which finally led to the capture of the men. They were brutally treated during their time in captivity. Following the war, an investigation was launched into the fate of the party and a former British inmate of the concentration camp revealed the men suffered poor health and were emaciated. They were last seen being transported out of the camp on April 10, 1945, to be shot. Sgt Handley was 30 years old at the time.","Sgt Thomas Handley was a part of 'Churchill's Secret Army' during WWII .

"New York is the United States' snobbiest city, reveals a new study, beating Miami into second place. The Big Apple was found to be the one place where people hold their head (and noses) up that little bit higher according to result of a questionnaire about America's Favourite Places by Travel and Leisure. But is it snobbery, or pride? And could 'confidence' somehow be misconstrued as snobbery? New York City topped the pile for snobbery; other categories included wine bars, museums, and cleanliness, in which voters evaluated 38 major metropolitan areas. New York, with its luxurious feel, was top of the list of the US's snobbiest cities . Showbiz capital Los Angeles is an unsurprising third on the list, but Washington DC lands fourth place not just due to its thousands of high-powered political types but its trendy art  scene. One NYC photographer believes the home of the White House should have toppled his home town. on the snobbery table. Travis Levius told Travel and Leisure said: 'In DC, it’s all about what you do. You can be among New York City's elite if you're an artist, but in DC, that might get you, at best, a look of ‘bless your little heart.' Here we take a look at the top 10 snobbiest cities, and explore some of the attractions that might make residents feel that little bit better about themselves. 1 New York City . The art scene, shopping and luxury are all too evident in New York. And many residents are certainly 'at the top of their game'. But the question is, why not show it? The bright lights of New York City; there are more billionaires here than any other city in the world . It ranks as the least affordable city in the US, so this could also point towards why people ranked it as the country's snobbiest city. Interestingly, New York is the number one city in the world when it comes to billionaire residents. 2 Miami . The well-sought after winner of America's 'Best Looking' category, it's little wonder these Floridians are confident with themselves. The cocktail bars in and around Miami Beach are where you will find residents keeping well within their style, and Browns Hotel's Steak House is listed by the magazine as highly respected. The Cuba Ocho Art & Research Center, an art gallery, offers live music, mojitos, and cigars for a memorable experience. Miami was named as the city with the best looking people and the second most snobby . LA, with its red carpet and all can either make you, or break you . 3 Los Angeles . It's perhaps surprising that LA was only in third spot in the snobby table, with its Hollywood red carpet set and all. Upscale department stores of West Hollywood's Robertson Avenue can either make you feel a million dollars, or like a pathetic pauper who wished you had a million dollars. The Ivy restaurant is the place to visit if you feel you fit in more with celebrities. But the city did rank in the top 10 for it's more everyman style of diners, burger stores and bakeries. 4 Washington DC . Home to the only Leonardo da Vinci painting in the US the National Gallery of Art is one of the main reasons to be proud in DC. As the capital, you would expect pride (does it border on snobbery?) to be at the forefront of residents here. With the Congress, the President and the Supreme Court all residing here, there's plenty to shout about. But attractions such as the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, which offers free daily musical performances, is a reminder that DC still has an egalitarian side. 5 Boston . The Harvard Book Store and Schoenhof's Foreign Books in Cambridge give this elite University city a real feeling of literacy. However, despite featuring high up the snobbery list, more annoyance may come with the fact that residents of Boston were discovered to be the worst drivers. Hanging in in Kendall Square with quizzers taking on clam pizzas, croissant-crumb-topped mac ’n’cheese, and appropriately named cocktails like the Last Word, made with gin, Chartreuse, and maraschino liquor may help you fit in here. Washington DC has enough to take pride in, and residents do just that . The Ivy is something rather different in Los Angeles and attracts an upper class crowd . Boston has a solid footing in the university sphere and this is reflected in the city's atmosphere . 6 Tampa . Tampa, a newcomer to the survey, made a dramatic entrance by ranking within the top 10 for snobbery, with the city's cleanliness making residents particularly proud. Every sophisticated city needs a SoHo, and in Tampa, it’s South of Howard, where people can watch dolphins along Bayshore Boulevard. Residents of Tampa are particularly proud of its city's cleanliness . It’s also where you’ll find the Epicurean Hotel, which has a wine shop and a cheeky dessert shop called Chocolate Pi, and faces local institution Bern's Steak House. 7 Dallas . World class museums and theatres, including the Rem Koolhaas-designed Wyly Theatremake Dallas an innovative and popular city to reside in. The Joule offers something a bit different in Dallas . Dallas has a rich history reflected in its art and museums . Locals are more 'coiffured' than quirky, and this helped Dallas into the top 10 after a few years out of the limelight. Staying at the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, the boutique hotel The Joule or shopping at NorthPark’s Neiman-Marcus have long been hallmarks of good Dallas living. 8 San Francisco . Methodically sourced food, coffee, and wine, means locals have high standards when it comes to dining. A rise in technology development in San Francisco has helped create a high standard of living . Technology is also prevalent throughout San Fran - you better make sure you have the latest gadget on your person. This sees the number of white-collar workers growing, as trade from the Silicon Valley develops. 9 Salt Lake City . The Italian-marble-laden Grand America Hotel and the strollable '15 and 15' neighbourhood, where you’ll find the King's English Bookshop and the Paris Bistro are symbols of a bit of class about Utah. Salt Lake City was ninth snobbiest - and yet second friendliest . A strange stat is that even though they made ninth in the list of snobbiest cities, they also ranked second in terms of friendliness. In 2007 Salt Lake City was ranked by as the most vain city in America, based on the number of plastic surgeons per 100,000 and their spending habits on cosmetics. 10 Providence . The city ranked near the top for its notable restaurants such as Federal Hill’s and Downtown’s farm-to-table, from James Beard nominee Ben Sukle. The city also scored well for its gourmet food shops. Providence, Rhode Island, is proud to be one of America's oldest cities . It's Ivy League affiliation with Brown is another reason for the Rhode Island Capital sneaking into the top ten. Being one of the oldest cities in the U.S. can also bring with it a spot of pride - as well as it being described as the 'creative capital' and a hive of arts and entertainment.","Luxury, art and shopping set the Big Apple apart but also make it 'snobby'
Miami apparently has the 'best looking people' and comes in second .
Los Angeles, red carpet and all, trails in third spot ahead of Washington DC ."
"A comic novel about Adolf Hitler falling asleep in 1945 and waking up in Berlin in 2011 has stormed to the top of the bestseller lists in Germany. Some 250,000 copies of Timur Vermes’ Er Ist Wieder Da, translated as He’s Back, have been sold, along with 75,000 audiobooks. An English language version is expected to be released in British shops soon. Chart: Timur Vermes' Er Ist Wieder Da has sold 250,000 copies, making it Germany's bestseller . A former journalist with a German mother and Hungarian father, Vermes has helped to stoke a debate over rising neo-Nazism, disillusion with a failing currency and fears of inflation – the same toxic mix which enabled Hitler to come to power in the 1930s. Some have seen its success as proof that the guilt-ridden postwar generation has given way to one able to laugh at the monster who still haunts them. The book hit the hardcover number one slot in fiction, beating Ken Follet’s Winter Of The World into second place, after being released in September. Reviewers are divided between whether readers are laughing at Hitler, with him - or at themselves. So far 17 foreign licences for it have been issued and Vermes is likely to become a millionaire out of his parody on a subject unthinkable for Germans just a few short years ago; treating the architect of WW2 and the Jewish Holocaust as a figure of fun. Farcical: The novel follows Hitler in 2011 when he expects to find Berlin swarming with Russian soldiers . The plot is farcical. The once mighty Fuehrer does not die in the Berlin bunker at the end of WW2 but wakes after a long sleep on a plot of wasteland in a capital he expects to find swarming with occupying Russian soldiers. He wanders the streets until a newsagent takes pity on him and lets him sleep in his kiosk and, while people obviously recognise Hitler, they assume he is a comedian playing a role. His unintentionally hilarious monologues spark amusement and he is given a guest slot on the show of a Turkish-born comedy star, Ali Wizgür, and instantly drives ups the ratings. There follows stardom on YouTube and, after winning the backing of a tabloid newspaper, he goes into politics, whipping up hatred against speeding drivers and dog-fouled pavements. The cover of the book has a blank white space showing Hitler’s familiar haircut with the book title condensed to form his toothbrush moustache. The author said he wanted to use a comic theme to portray the 'real Hitler - certainly megalomaniacal and deeply disturbed, but also charming, polite and flexible. 'There are people who would like a comfortable monster so they can shift the blame.' On the rise: The novel has helped stoke a debate over rising neo-Nazism and Germany's economic problems .","250,000 copies and 75,000 audiobooks of He’s Back have been sold .

"Dashcam video shows the moment a South Carolina police officer shot an elderly man who reached for his cane in the back of his pickup truck during a routine traffic stop Tuesday night. Luckily, 70-year-old Bobby Canipe is expected to survive. The video shows York County Sheriff's Deputy Terrance Knox, 24, stop Canipe over an expired registration. After he pulls to the side of the road, Canipe is seen getting out of the driver's side of the truck, reaching into the truck bed and pulling out what Knox believed to be a weapon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Expired: Bobby Canipe was stopped Tuesday for driving with expired license plates . Routine: Rather than wait in the car, Canipe got out and reached for his cane during a routine traffic stop . Warning: After warning Canipe several times, Knox fired several rounds at him thinking his cane was a weapon . Knox can be heard yelling 'sir' several times before opening fire. But Canipe continued to reach in the back of the truck. When he pulled out his cane, Knox fired several live rounds in Canipe's direction, striking him once in the stomach area. Almost immediately following the shooting, Knox appears to have realized that he shot an unarmed man and rushed to give him aid. A spokesman for the Sheriff's Office said Knox simply reacted to what he thought was a real threat. 'It does appear at this time that Deputy Knox's actions were an . appropriate response to what he reasonably believed to be an imminent . threat to his life,' spokesman Trent Faris told WSOCTV. Friends of Canipe tell the station that he is a disabled Vietnam veteran and is very active with his local VFW. Help: Immediately after shooting Canipe, Knox rushed to help him as he hunched over next to his truck . Veteran: Bobby Canipe, a disabled Vietnam War veteran, was shot by a police officer when he reached in the back of his truck for his cane . One friend said it would be typical of Canipe to get out and meet with an officer who was pulling him over, rather than wait in his vehicle. Faris says the Sheriff's Office already has reached out to Canipe's family and is told he is expected to recover. A man who drove by after the shooting says Deputy Knox was doing everything he could to help Canipe after realizing he'd made a mistake. 'The officer that had to do the shooting, he was really freaked out . about it. He was screaming on the radio about needing help,' witness Joe Ashwell . said. According to the station, this is the ninth officer-involved shooting so far this year in South Carolina. Knox is on administrative leave from the Sheriff's Office as authorities investigate the shooting.

In the wake of the incident, Bou Bou's mom Alecia Phonesavanh has spoken out about abuse of power by police officers. The incident had occurred while she was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta after their Wisconsin home burnt down.

"Ayoze Perez was Newcastle’s match-winner with his first goal for the club on what was his full Premier League debut. But who is rookie Spaniard? Sportsmail brings you more… . Where did he come from? Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring the winner for Newcastle against Tottenham on his first start for the club . Newcastle moved quickly to beat off interest from a host of Spanish clubs and signed the 21-year-old from Tenerife for £1.5m in June. Why was there so much interest? Well, 16 goals in Spain’s second tier alerted the Magpies and many others but the player preferred to test himself in the Premier League. He left White Hart Lane and headed straight back to his homeland for an awards ceremony, where he is up for the best breakthrough player prize for last season. He has also now broken into Spain’s Under-21 side. How has he done at Newcastle? After seven substitute appearances he had yet to break his duck before his headed winner at Spurs. He did, however, score a sublime solo effort for the Under-21s, weaving his way between four defenders before slotting home. Striker Perez, 21, signed in June from Spanish club Tenerife, scoring 16 goals in the Spanish second tier . And that won him a start? Not really, although it did put him to the front of the queue should Papiss Cisse have got injured. And that is exactly what happened, the Senegal striker failing a fitness test just two hours before the game. Alan Pardew must have been delighted with him? He was, and here’s what he said: ‘He’s a really great individual talent. He hasn’t quite got the strength and power that you associate with the Premier League but that will come to him. He has worked really, really hard. The players love him so they were really made up that he scored the winner.’ Does he speak any English then? Sportsmail tried to grab a few words with him outside of the ground, and this is what we got. ‘I am very happy. I hope I can play good for Newcastle and score many goals.’ The Toon Army will certainly be hoping he is good to his word.","Ayoze Perez rewarded Alan Pardew for starting him with a winning goal .

"Sitting on the bench is never something any footballer relishes.

"Football fans tend to love one or the other. They constantly ask who is better... 'Messi, his goalscoring record is unbeatable and his effortless demeanour is sumptuous to watch'. Or: 'No, Ronaldo, he works harder for the team, scores better goals and has shined in a less successful side over the past few years.' But on Saturday evening, in the most important game of the season so far, for once eyes weren't solely cast on them. Lionel Messi (right) looks frustrated during the El Clasico match as Cristiano Ronaldo (left) lurks . Ronaldo looks frustrated after Real Madrid go 1-0 down but the former United player soon got his goal . Luis Suarez's return to football took most of the headlines pre-game, and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could shine when only half the attention was on them. In terms of direct impact on the game, in the first-half Ronaldo scored from the spot and Messi missed from just seven yards with most of the goal to aim at - Real had Iker Casillas to thank. Otherwise, the Portuguese superstar was quiet. Our expectations are sky high, but he was not hugely involved with the other goals in the 3-1 win at the Bernabeu. This wasn't the Ronaldo of the Champions League final in 2014. 3-1 up against Atletico Madrid, Ronaldo was desperate to star in Lisbon, and scored the penalty in extra-time before ripping off his shirt and producing every back page the next day. Messi's effort is brilliantly saved by Casillas in the Real Madrid net, with Barcelona 1-0 up . Barcelona held the lead until the 35th minute after Neymar's early goal in the El Clasico tie against Real Madrid . On Saturday night he was uncharacteristically unselfish. Some passes went astray in the final third and Real's other stars shone. Three or four times he got himself in dangerous positions with the ball on the counter attack, passing without looking only to find a Barca man. On Saturday night, it was the Real Madrid show, not the CR9 show. His performance looked a 7/10 at the very, very most. Ronaldo takes his penalty in the 35th minute to bring Real level in the El Clasico tie against Barcelona . At the other end, as Barcelona chased the game, Messi tried his trademark runs with the ball several times, each time legally halted by the Real defence. A passage of play on the right byline for Messi, summed up Messi's night. He twisted, turned and gained a couple yards on Marcelo beautifully, but his cross was deflected into the grateful hands of Casillas. He was a 6/10. For the Argentine it was frustrating night, but his rival didn't steal the headlines either. Ronaldo goes to his usual celebration after scoring against Barcelona to bring the teams level before half-time .","All eyes were on Luis Suarez, but the world's two best players collided .

"Alex Goode has backed the latest measures introduced to improve concussion management in rugby union and warned that failure to implement them could have serious consequences for a player’s health. The Saracens and England full back — speaking on Wednesday at a Rugby Players’ Association event to promote their Restart charity — has personal experience of concussion, having been knocked out several times in the early part of his career, and had an aerial collision in last season’s European Cup quarter-final which left him unconscious for several minutes. The RPA, along with the RFU and Premier Rugby, recently launched an online education module which all players, coaches and referees must sit, and Goode says the more awareness that can be raised the better. Saracens full back Alex Goode is man-handled by Clermont players during their Champions Cup match . The England squad member for the Autumn Internationals has backed new concussion measures . Goode takes a high ball for Saracens on October 18 . ‘Concussion is a subject that people are now talking about across the world but we still don’t know enough about it,’ he said. ‘We do know that just shrugging it off and playing on can have a very detrimental effect on your body in the long run. That’s what we need to highlight to everyone in order to stop people saying, “Just get on with it” or “Stop being soft”. ‘People need to understand that when someone’s had a serious head knock they need to be looked after. They don’t want to be visiting someone in hospital in a wheelchair or a vegetative state. ‘It took me having a few knocks and having the symptoms — which are horrible; like feeling distant from people, feeling sick, head rushes, feeling asleep all the time, aversion to loud music — to really read up and learn more about it. Now if I take a few jibes from people I don’t care. Your health is the most important thing. I didn’t want to finish my rugby career at 24-25.’ The RFU say their motivation for introducing the new measures is based on a determination to improve player welfare — not a reaction to a multi-million dollar settlement in the NFL paid out to retired stars with dementia — and coaches insist they would never interfere with decisions made by club medics. The full back, in action during Sarries win over Clermont, was knocked out in last year's European Cup . ‘Even the top scientists don’t know about this so until we do we do need to err on the side of caution,’ said Goode, 26, who is in the England squad for the QBE autumn series. ‘If parents and kids see someone knocked out and carrying on it sends a terrible message. ‘But what’s happened in the media has made a big impact. We’re getting a better understanding. ‘The coaches understand it too. They are ex-players who used to go back on but they understand now if someone is knocked out they stay off. That’s important.’","The Rugby Players Association, RFU and Premier Rugby recently launched a compulsory online course on concussion for all people in the game .

"The Premier League have been urged by one of their own clubs to take the lead on slashing ticket prices for hard-up supporters by encouraging every top-flight team to reduce admission fees. Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen said he would like to cut huge amounts off all ticket prices for City’s fans, including season tickets, and believes other clubs could do the same due to the £5.5billion of TV riches pouring into the Premier League in the current three-year TV deal ‘cycle’. But he says if Swansea - a family-friendly club co-owned by fans - go it alone on price reductions, they would put themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen has said he would like to cut huge amounts off all ticket prices for fans . Dineen said: ‘We’d love to substantially decrease ticket prices for all of our fans but we’d be less competitive. It could only happen if all Premier League clubs agreed to the same reductions. The German model with low ticket prices is great and something we could look towards in our league.’ He said the Premier League should have taken a lead on the issue when the TV deal was announced. ‘The Premier League missed a trick on this issue,’ he said. ‘They could have announced that all clubs would be required to make reductions for away fans carte blanche. Instead, it’s been left to the clubs to try to strike reciprocal deals. Liverpool supporters protested against the cost of Premier League match tickets at Anfield on Saturday . 'We approached all the clubs last year and got nowhere. Since then we’ve managed to strike reciprocal deals with six or seven clubs including Newcastle, Sunderland, Aston Villa and West Brom, with others coming forward. But if the Premier League had taken the lead, we wouldn’t have had to spend so much time trying to generate interest for the benefit of our fans.’ Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation suggested Premier League crowds could soon ‘die out’ if ticket prices continued to rise because young fans were being priced out. This year, supporters will pay an average of £526 for their club’s lowest priced adult season ticket, a rise of 6.5 per cent.","Swansea vice-chairman keen to cut huge amounts off all ticket prices .

"A man claiming to be Egypt's official executioner has spoken of how much he loves his job in a sinister interview. Hajj Abd Al-Nabi, who claims he has hanged some 800 people convicted of crimes ranging from adultery to murder, said: 'In all honesty, I love my work. I just love it! 'I never say ""no"" when they need me at work. This is my work and my livelihood.' 'People love me': A clip from the video which is purportedly an interview with Egypt's chief executioner . But Mr Al-Nabi's exuberant commentary on his macabre profession takes an even more chilling turn as he explains how strangulation had been his 'hobby' since he was a teenage boy. 'When I was young – about 13 or 14 years old – the dry Ismailiya Canal in Shubra Al-Kheima still had water in it,' he reminisces. 'My hobby was to catch a cat, to place a rope around its neck, to strangle it, and throw it into the water. I would get hold of any animal – even dogs. 'I would strangle these animals and throw them into the water – even dogs.' He adds: 'Strangulation was my hobby. When I applied for the job and did well on the tests – proving that I . could take the psychological pressure and so on – they said: . ""Congratulations. Now, grow a moustache"". 'The . truth is that my heart is dead, because executing comes from the heart, . not the moustache. Only if you have a heart of stone can you be content . in this line of work.' The original provenance of the video, and its authenticity, is unclear. It was translated and reposted last week by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), which says it originally emerged online in early September. Certainly, while elements of the interview seem satirical, other statements by Mr Al-Nabi appear to be deadly serious. 'I am the executioner of the Arab Republic of Egypt. I hold the rank of chief warrant officer in the police and the prison authority,' he says. 'I am Egypt's executioner, responsible for carrying out the death penalty.' Dedicated: Hajj Abd Al-Nabi, who claims he has hanged some 800 people convicted of crimes ranging from adultery to murder, speaks in the video, which is translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute . Chilling: But the original provenance of the video, and its authenticity, is unclear. MEMRI have previously been accused of mistranslating and disseminating video to back up an anti-Arab agenda . Despite claiming responsibility for the deaths of hundreds, it appears he believes all were justified as 'carrying out the work of Allah'. 'When it comes to carrying out my job, I am tough. The murderer has done an abominable thing, and I cannot be soft with him,' says Mr Al-Nabi. 'If I were soft towards this criminal, I wouldn't be able to execute him, but when I'm at home, with my kids, I am as calm as can be.' He goes on: 'I have placed [the noose] around some 800 heads – tough people, big people, young people... All the despicable crimes – killing, adultery, premeditated murder, and so on... I carry out all the death sentences.' Family man: The man in the video admits he has been obsessed with death since he was a teenager . MEMRI, the organisation which has translated and spread the clip, has often been accused of attempting to portray the Arab world in a negative light. Founded in 1998 by a former Israeli military intelligence officer and an Israeli-American political scientists, MEMRI claims its goal is to 'bridge the language gap that exists between the Middle East and the West'. However, critics have accused the group of producing and disseminating inaccurate translations and selectively translating views of extremists while down playing or ignoring mainstream Arab opinions. MEMRI defended its work. In a statement, the institute’s director, Stephen Stalinsky, said: ‘MEMRI’s flagship is our Reform Project. This project monitors advocates of reform in the Arab and Muslim world, and the obstacles that they face in advancing their cause. 'The goal of this project is to provide reformists with a platform from which they can reach out to their societies and to religious, political, and educational leaders while also providing Western policy makers with a solid basis for long-term strategic plans aimed at supporting this effort. 'MEMRI focused on this issue a decade before anyone even comprehended the Arab Spring.' Mr Stalinsky added: ‘Note that many Middle Eastern states have official executioners, including Saudi Arabia which employs one in Mecca, the holiest Muslim city. 'We have done many reports/videos on this.’","Hajj Abd Al-Nabi tells of his satisfaction at 'carrying out the work of Allah'

"A U.S. aircraft carrier travelled through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf yesterday, ignoring threats from Iran to shut down the strategic shipping lane. The USS Abraham Lincoln went through the strait without incident in what American government officials claimed was a routine changeover. However, it was accompanied by British and French ships, a highly unusual joint exercise in the militarily sensitive region. And a spokesman from the UK's Ministry of Defence said the flotilla was intended to 'underline the unwavering international commitment to maintaining rights of passage under international law'. Provocative? The USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the controversial Strait of Hormuz on Sunday . This appears to be a direct challenge to Iran, which has been increasingly belligerent over the strait in response to the threat of new economic sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme. When the carrier USS John Stennis departed the Gulf in late December, Iranian officials warned the U.S. not to return. A top Iranian naval official boasted that closing the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil shipping gateway, would be 'easier than drinking a glass of water'. The threat led to a round of escalating rhetoric between the two sides that spooked oil markets and raised the possibility of a military showdown - the only way Iran would be able to control the strait. Flotilla: The Lincoln was accompanied by USS John Stennis, right, and ships from Britain and France . But on Saturday a senior figure in the powerful Revolutionary Guards struck a more conciliatory tone, claiming that Iran did not mind the West resuming operation in the Gulf. 'U.S. warships and military forces have been in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East region for many years and their decision in relation to the dispatch of a new warship is not a new issue and it should be interpreted as part of their permanent presence,' he said. A spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain, said the Lincoln's passage through the strait was 'regular and routine' and that it had been 'previously scheduled'. On his own: Iran's increasingly isolated president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went to Latin America to search for allies in his anti-American fight . Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have been escalating in recent weeks as Barack Obama prepares to implement new sanctions over the country's nuclear enrichment programme, which Tehran says is for energy production but which the West believes is aimed at producing atomic weapons. Notable developments have included the trial of an Iranian-American man sentenced to death for spying for the U.S., and the assassination of another Iranian nuclear scientist, which the U.S. has condemned. Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went on a tour of Latin America looking for allies in left-wing leaders such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Last week saw both sides tone down their rhetoric, as Mr Obama was reported to have sent a letter to Mr Ahmadinejad offering more back-channel talks.","USS Abraham Lincoln was accompanied by ships from British and France in unusual move .

"Deranged: In his latest command from a prison cell he will never leave, paedophile Warren Jeffs gave the names of 15 men chosen to father all children of the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church . Polygamous leader Warren Jeffs has issued a new command to his sect from his jail cell - the names of 15 men he has chosen to father all future children of his church. The Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church leader is serving a 130-year sentence at Powledge Unit near Palestine, Texas, for systematic child sex assault and marrying underage girls. Jeffs, 56, still has around 10,000 believers in the towns of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona. Former FLDS member Isaac Wyler told Deseret News that the rules were explained to the congregation at a Sunday service two weeks ago. He said: 'They said there had been 15 men delegated or designated by God to sire the new, special children.' According to other reports, men who are not among the chosen few will have to remain under a 'no sex ban' that Jeffs demanded last year. He declared that all marriages are void until he can return and 'seal' them. The response from his congregation has been polarizing. For many, the ban on sex was the last straw. Families have begun fleeing the church - and after the latest command, it has been rumored that many more were planning to escape. Husbands were said to be extremely unhappy that their wives will be made available to the 'chosen 15' with their roles essentially reduced to caretakers and financial providers, Deseret News reported. Calls made to Rod Parker, a lawyer who has represented the FLDS Church in the past, were not returned to MailOnline. The new directive seemed to counter another of Jeffs' revelations last month when the prison inmate said that abusing women was wrong. Harem: Dozens of the 56-year-old's 78 brides, . some of whom were as young as 12, with Jeffs fathering a child by a wife . who was only 15 . He wrote: 'Let women be free, to be educated, to have full protection from abuse, ye nations. 'Let this truth awaken all to have life, yea, individual lives, in . order, a holy Way of living my law of love for all, through pure way . living on World.' His sect practices polygamy in arranged marriages . that have sometimes involved underage girls. Jeffs was convicted last year of . sexually assaulting two of his many underage brides when they were 12 . and 15 in the notorious case. He was said to have at least 78 plural wives, according to court documents. The further mandates by Jeffs came as voters in a tiny Utah town threw out a measure that would have dissolved their town government - amid fears that polygamists could seize an opportunity to widen their municipal borders and 'swallow us up'. Apple Valley residents voting 167 to 115 against disbanding the town government. It had been suggested that neighboring Hildale - a town controlled by Jeffs - could stage a municipal takeover if the town were to . abolish itself. Deep believer: Jeffs led the temple of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Eldorado, Texas .","All wives at the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church to be made available to 'chosen ones'

"Luis Suarez has said that his biting is an ‘impulse’ which he is getting help to control. The Barcelona forward has bitten three opponents during his career, most recently Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. ‘I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me,’ he told the Guardian Weekend magazine. ‘It is like an impulse, like a reaction. VIDEO Scroll down as Luis Suarez trains ahead of his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid . Suarez is set to make his competitive debut against Real Madrid on Saturday night after a four-month ban . Luis Suarez says biting is 'like an impulse' and that he is in now on the 'right path' after seeking help . Giorgio Chiellini shows off bite marks after Suarez sunk his teeth into the Italian's shoulder at the World Cup . ‘Everyone has different ways of defending themselves. In my case, the pressure and tension came out that way. There are other players who react by breaking someone’s leg, or smashing someone’s nose. What happened with Chiellini is seen as worse. I understand why biting is seen so badly.’ And in extracts taken from his upcoming autobiography Crossing The Line: My Story, Suarez  questions the double standards in English football following his second biting incident with Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. He said: 'After my 10-match ban in 2013 for biting Branislav Ivanovic, I had questioned the double standards and how the fact that no one actually gets hurt is never taken into consideration. The damage to the player is incomparable with that suffered by a horrendous challenge. Suarez  was banned for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic . 'Sometimes English football takes pride in having the lowest yellow-card count in Europe, but of course it will have if you can take someone’s leg off and still not be booked. When they can say it is the league with the fewest career-threatening tackles, then it will be something to be proud of. 'I know biting appalls a lot of people, but it’s relatively harmless. Or at least it was in the incidents I was involved in. When Ivanovic rolled up his sleeve to show the referee the mark at Anfield, there was virtually nothing there. None of the bites has been like Mike Tyson on Evander Holyfield’s ear. But none of this makes it right.' Suarez’s four-month man for biting the Italian defender has now ended, but Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is still undecided over whether to throw the Uruguayan straight into the starting line-up against Real Madrid. 'Suarez will get minutes but I can't say how many,' said Enrique. 'This is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team. How many minutes he will get I can't say.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique (pictured, behind) confirmed Suarez is set to make his competitive debut . Suarez was allowed to train and play friendlies with his Barcelona team-mates during his four-month ban . Suarez has said biting is 'like an impulse' and that 'everyone has different ways of defending themselves' Chiellini became the third victim in Suarez's  career after the controversial striker served previous bans for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in 2013.

An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, however, ruled that last season's Premier League top goalscorer was allowed to train with his new team-mates and play in Barcelona friendlies. The game against Real will be Suarez's first competitive match since Uruguay's 1-0 defeat against Italy on June 24.

"One of the most popular cats on an internet rife with felines has died. Colonel Meow, a Persian-Himalayan mix named for his authoritarian demeanor, was dubbed the 'World's Angriest Cat,' but was beloved nonetheless. Colonel Meow was just two years old and died in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The cause of his death was not immediately released. Scroll down for video . RIP: Colonel Meow, dubbed the 'World's Angriest Cat,' but an internet sensation nonetheless, died on Wednesday . 'Colonel Meow passed away yesterday evening,' Meow's owner wrote on the cat's official Facebook account. 'I will post more about the details when I've had a few days to grieve. Thank you so much for your understanding, Minions. Your love and support has meant the world to us both. -Slave Beast' Followers of Colonel Meow, whose Facebook page had gained some 350,000 likes, were jokingly referred to as his 'minions.' His owner Anne Marie Avey called herself 'slave-beast.' Avey had only just reached out to Meow's minions in November, when the cat suddenly fell ill and required expensive treatment. Somber: Colonel Meow's owner made the somber announcement Wednesday, but asked for some time to grieve before going into detail as to the cause . Esteemed: In addition to being the 'World's Angriest Cat,' Meow held the distinction of being the world's longest haired cat, according to the Guinness Book of World Records . Popular: Colonel Meow's social media accounts were liked, viewed and followed by millions and ranked him among the internet's favorite cat alongside Lil' Bub and Grumpy Cat . 'Colonel needs YOU,' Avey wrote. 'He has been in the hospital and the doctors don't really understand what's wrong with him, . 'He has already survived a 50/50 chance surgery, a blood transfusion that they THOUGHT would send him into heart failure and now we need YOU to get him out of the woods. Spread that frown and send your recovery and healing vibes ASAP. He told me it was an order.' Apparently good vibes and the astonishing $20,000 that was raised to cover medical care weren't enough. Colonel Meow was adopted as a rescue cat after Avey found him on the side of the road in Seattle. 'I will post more about the details when I've had a few days to grieve.

"Cardiff City have confirmed the loan signing of controversial West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison. The talented but troubled 21-year-old has signed until December 26, though his reputation as a difficult player to manage makes the move perplexing, considering Cardiff are struggling to appoint a permanent replacement for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. That situation appears no closer to being resolved after Leyton Orient blocked multiple Cardiff moves for their manager Russell Slade. West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison has joined Cardiff City on loan until December 26 . But Cardiff have pressed ahead regardless with their efforts to sign Morrison, who was initially a summer target for Solskjaer and will in January face trial over allegations he threatened to throw acid in his former girlfriend's face and have her killed. He is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house and is alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27. A Cardiff statement on Wednesday said: ‘An England Under 21 international, Ravel will be eligible to play in up to 15 Championship fixtures during that time, including our game at Charlton Athletic on Boxing Day.’ The 21-year-old spent part of last season out on loan at Queens Park Rangers in the Championship . Morrison had initially announced his transfer on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon: 'Happy to get a 3 month loan @CardiffCityFC time to start playing some football again.' He added in another tweet about West Ham, which he later deleted: 'I got no ratings off people in the club not the club it's self (sic) just people in it.' The move marks Morrison's third loan spell away from West Ham, who he joined for £650,000 from Manchester United in 2012.

"Everton have received a boost in their hopes of re-signing Gerard Deulofeu as the attacking midfielder has failed to settle in at Sevilla. Deulofeu, who impressed Roberto Martinez during his season-long stay at Goodison Park, is yet to win over Sevilla boss Unai Emery. Emery has refused to play the on-loan Spaniard until he changes his attitude and improves on his performances at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. Unai Emery has not been pleased with the performances of Barcelona starlet Gerard Deulofeu . Deulofeu has been told he will not play for Sevilla again until he changes his attitude . The former Everton loanee, pictured celebrating against Sunderland with Seamus Coleman, is said to be attracting interest from Roberto Martinez . Deulofeu enjoyed his time under Martinez, pictured, and said he would welcome his compatriot at Barcelona . Barcelona could subsequently end Deulofeu's stay at Sevilla before loaning him back out to another side if they feel the 20-year-old is not benefiting from his spell away from the Nou Camp. The experienced La Liga boss, speaking to talkSPORT, said: 'Regardless of the contract, I only select my top XI. If for now he's playing a little less, it does not mean that next month he will play more. 'The club does not obligate me to do anything, all players are equal. His selection will come with the process of improvement. I hope he does, because it is a challenge we have set. 'We want him to improve his overall game - his team play and defensive actions.' Deulofeu scored three goals in 25 Premier League games  before returning to Spain at the end of last season.","Gerard Deulofeu has failed to settle in at Sevilla following a season-long loan move from Barcelona .

"The Maricopa County animal shelter in Arizona took in their fattest cat yet this week, a massive 36-pound feline appropriately named Meatball. The morbidly obese cat was surrendered at the shelter in Mesa on Tuesday after being shuffled from home to home over the years. Shelter spokesman Melissa Gable says Meatball is 'the biggest cat I have ever seen' and that he 'doesn't move too quickly'. Fat cat: Meatball weighs in four times heavier than an average cat . Heavy load: A shelter employee holds Meatball, the 36-pound cat recently dropped off at the Maricopa County animal shelter . Meatball's last owners took him in from someone else and had cared for the cat for about six months before he started 'having accidents around the house' so they gave him up. They said he was that size when they got him and they didn't know why he was so fat since they had only been feeding him cat food. But Ms Gable says she doesn't know how accurate that is 'because cat food isn't typically going to make a cat this large'. Immobile: Meatball has problems moving as a result of his weight . New diet: The pet has been put on a special diet to help him lose weight . What he eats now: Meatball is currently on a restricted diet of wet food in the morning and at night . She says eating human table scraps, or being left food out all day can make a cat that fat but Meatball's weight could be a result of an underlying condition like a thyroid problem. She doesn't know if that's the case with Meatball since they haven't done any blood work yet. To take off the pounds, the shelter has now put Meatball on a restricted, low calorie diet - feeding him a little bit of wet food in the morning and at night. Meatball isn't too interested in the food however, further proving Ms Gable's theory that he hasn't been on a regulated diet. Diet: Shelter spokesman Melissa Gable says feeding a cat table scraps or letting them eat cat food all day can result in obesity . 'Most cats, if you give them canned food - that's heaven. So when I opened [a can] I thought he'd some right over,' she said. Instead Meatball picks at the wet food, eating a little now and coming back to eat some more later - never eating the full portion in one sitting. Because of Meatball's size, he can't stay in any of the normal cat kennels so he hangs out in the administrative offices at the shelter's Phoenix location. While Meatball is extremely friendly, due to his health the shelter will not be putting him up adoption. Healthy loss: The shelter is hoping to secure Meatball a place at a sanctuary that would be able to monitor his weight loss . His weight puts him at risk for serious medical problems and he already has glaucoma in one eye. Instead they are looking to find Meatball a spot at a rescue organization that specializes in overweight cats. The sanctuary they are currently looking at would carefully monitor Meatball's weight loss, and since he should be 12 pounds it's going to take some time. This isn't the first hefty car that the shelter has brought in. Last year the shelter took in a 28-pound stray. Meatball also happens to be the name of the famouly-fat cat in the film Anger Management, starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.","The last owners had Meatball for about six months before he started having accidents around the house .

"Luke Guttridge controlled Michael Harriman’s incisive pass, rolled his marker and, with the calmest of side-foot finishes sent Luton Town top of the league. The ecstatic roar that followed was deafening, the main stand of their 109-year-old Kenilworth Road home literally shaking in the excitement. Once again, their defiant chant went up: ‘F*** the FA and the Football League, we are the famous Luton Town/They tried to kill us off, but we’re not so soft, we are the famous Luton Town!’ Luton's Luke Guttridge scores his sides winning goal against Northampton Town at Kenilworth Road . Several agonising moments later, when referee Darren Sheldrake blew the final whistle, it was replaced by another song, Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust, blasting over the PA system. It was an apt choice. This was Luton’s seventh league win in succession, enough to take them above Wycombe and Burton to the League Two summit. Luton played in the Championship as recently as 2007. Then everything started to go wrong. Broke and beaten down by the authorities, they suffered three successive relegations and spent five seasons in the wilderness of non-League. Alex Lawless helped Luton beat Northampton as John Still's side went to the top of League Two . The team that graced the First Division through the Eighties, and stunned Arsenal to win the League Cup at Wembley in 1988, were in danger of being forgotten, even erased. But here, on a sunny Bedfordshire afternoon, before a sell-out crowd of more than 10,000, their restoration to the famous Luton Town of old was well on course. Little wonder the fans were singing that song. Beaming chairman Nick Owen said: ‘We’ve been through eight difficult years. Three relegations, a total of 40 points deducted (for being in administration). Mark Cullen has a shot at goal under pressure from Gregor Robertson of Northampton . ‘Down in the Conference for five years, two very frustrating play-off finals (they lost to Wimbledon in 2011 and York in 2012). But finally we’re back in League Two and top of the league. I’m so thrilled.’ It was a moment of personal redemption for Guttridge (below) too. After a frustrating season in which his time on the pitch has been restricted by a niggling foot injury, he came off the bench to haunt his former club and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the travelling fans. He was eager to stress it was nothing personal, saying: ‘I do sincerely apologise but I play for Luton now. I have been in a lot of pain with my foot. It’s been there such a long time and in the back of your mind you do think: “Is the pain ever going to go away?” Michael Harriman and Guttridge both played key roles in Luton's win over Northampton . ‘It’s just been such a big disappointment and the celebration was all that coming out.’ Guttridge’s intervention settled a thoroughly mediocre game. Chances for either team had been a rare commodity and it looked as though Luton would be frustrated by Northampton’s second-half spoiling tactics. But their manager John Still had other ideas, as his assistant Terry Harris revealed. Look no further than Bournemouth’s eight-goal spree at Birmingham. At the end of a week in which Lee Clark was sacked, the misery around St Andrew’s was compounded by Eddie Howe’s rampant side, who recorded their biggest ever league win. You have to fear for the Blues, who have won just one of their last 25 home league games and are anchored in the Championship relegation zone. ‘It was what dreams are made of here for the Luton fans,’ he said. ‘The momentum was there and as John said, “it’s made for Gutts to grab the winner” - and so it happened. Well done, John.’ Still arrived at Kenilworth Road in February 2013, after the club had got through four managers in four seasons. Slowly but surely, he has turned them around. ‘He is just an amazing guy,’ said Owen. ‘He’s got everyone onside in a club where there had been quite a lot of disaffection and things have gone so badly wrong for so long and people were disenchanted with everything.’ As Luton’s long-suffering faithful toast their ascent to the top of League Two, that disenchantment has been long forgotten.

"Milos Raonic remains in contention as the race for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals hots up after he made it through to the second round of the Swiss Indoors in Basle.

He will face American Donald Young next and he remains on course for a potential quarter-final meeting with Rafael Nadal if they both win their next two matches. Swiss third seed Stan Wawrinka suffered his third successive first-round defeat in front of his home fans in Basel as he was beaten 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3 by Mikhail Kukushkin.

Thoughts that Kukushkin may fold at that point were dashed when he took a 3-0 lead in the decider and, although Wawrinka came back into it, he managed to claim the victory in two hours and 15 minutes.

"Andrew Flintoff's Twenty20 comeback is gathering pace after Brisbane Heat coach Stuart Law revealed he expects to sign him for this winter's Big Bash League. After five years in retirement the larger-than-life all-rounder made a surprise return to competitive action during this season's NatWest T20 Blast. It looked as though it would be a damp squib as injury hit after just two outings for Lancashire, but in typical Flintoff style he picked the perfect moment to grab the limelight. Andrew Flintoff made his Twenty20 comeback for Lancashire this summer and could play in Australia . Former Lancashire team-mate Stuart Law is head coach of Brisbane Heat and expects Flintoff to sign . An injury to Kabir Ali saw him drafted in for T20 finals day, where a first-ball dismissal of Ian Bell and a couple of mighty sixes reminded everyone of his natural talent. And his former Red Rose team-mate Law was clearly paying attention. 'We've had discussions with Freddie,' Law told the Manchester Evening News. 'If things go well, hopefully we will be able to confirm next week that he will play some part in the Big Bash for us. 'I am really excited by the idea. We get on really well and have had plenty of good times down the years during my time with Lancashire. 'He will be the biggest signing Brisbane Heat has made.' Flintoff won the Ashes with England in 2005 and was a hugely popular all-rounder on the international scene . Flintoff could only realistically be termed the franchise's biggest draw in celebrity terms, but Law has made it clear he will not be coming merely as a gimmick. 'I have spoken to Fred and made it clear that this is not a holiday, but he told me cricket is number one for him, and that it is not about collecting cash, it's about winning trophies,' said Law. 'I am sure Fred will do the right thing for this team. 'He is a proud man. He is not after the cash, he wants to contribute to the team. 'We know we will not be getting Freddie at his best from 2005, but if he is anywhere close then he will be great for us. The 36-year-old celebrates with Lancashire team-mates after taking a wicket during Natwest T20 blast final . 'The Australian fans will love him. They won't get on his back. He will create a following here and will love it in Brisbane.' After spending most of his retirement years flitting between television studios, charity engagements and, improbably, the boxing ring, 36-year-old Flintoff is understood to have missed the challenge of top-flight sport. He trained alone for long spells to prove to Lancashire he was serious about a comeback and competed in the second XI before progressing to the first team. Now he is eager to maximise his final stint in the game and could even enter the Indian Premier League auction if his mooted move to Australia is a success. Flintoff would be available to play in Australia this winter during their Twenty20 Big Bash for Brisbane Heat .","Andrew Flintoff made return to Twenty20s with Lancashire this summer .

"The latest triumph for British engineering – Mercedes’ clinching of the Formula One world constructors’ championship – will earn each of the team’s 700 staff a bonus of at least £10,000 each. Everyone from the cleaners up to the superstar drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, will be rewarded after Mercedes’ blitz to glory at last Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix. It is the first time Mercedes have won the constructors’ title, and they did it in great style with nine one-two finishes and victories in 13 of the 16 grands prix, just shy of McLaren’s 1988 record. Mercedes trio Lewis Hamilton (right), executive director Paddy Lowe (centre) and  Nico Rosberg (left) All of Mercedes' staff will receive a bonus fee believed to be in the region of £10,000 . Hamilton is currently top of the drivers' world championship standings ahead of his Mercedes team-mate . 1. Mercedes - 565 . 2. Red Bull - 342 . 3. Williams - 216 . 4. Ferrari - 188 . 5. McLaren - 143 . 6. Force India - 123 . 7. Toro Rosso - 29 . 8. Lotus - 8 . 9. Marussia - 2 . 10. Sauber - 0 . 11. Caterham - 0 . Their nearest challengers Red Bull, who also paid their staff £10,000 when they won the championship, are out of contention with three races remaining. Although the base rate for the Mercedes staff is £10,000, it is understood that figure could be even greater for some of the workforce. Exactly how much more they pocket will be determined at an annual review in the new year. The total prize fund for winning the title is a massive £40million. Much of the total amount will be ploughed into the budget for future years. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda addressed the team's employees at their Brackley headquarters on Monday with Hamilton and Rosberg, who are in direct competition for the drivers' prize, expected to visit the factory on Tuesday for a breakfast of champions - a bacon sandwich. Mercedes’ win is another example of Britain’s engineering hegemony in Formula One. Most of the teams are based in the ‘motorsport valley’ in the Midlands. So the Mercedes bonuses represent a near annual boom time for the area's bathroom, kitchen and carpet fitters. As well as the design of the winning car being carried out at Brackley, their supreme engine is manufactured at Brixworth under the direction of Englishman Andy Cowell. The team was put together by Ross Brawn before he left as part of an ugly coup d’etat at the end of last season. The debt they owe Brawn is considerable. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) has lavished praise on former team principal Ross Brawn . No wonder Wolff paid a fulsome tribute to him. ‘I have to pinch myself sometimes that we are part of the Mercedes history. We won the first constructors' title for Mercedes-Benz, ever,' he said. ‘I feel proud and honoured to be part of the team. The foundations of the team were built by Ross, he played such an important role in the team. 'The steps that were done in 2012, the people that joined in 2012, we're important, and since then we were on an upward slope.’ However, Wolff’s words could be thought slightly hollow. It was he who controversially forced Brawn out, having bought his way into the team. Technical chief Paddy Lowe was also drafted in behind Brawn's back. Brawn left Mercedes at the end of the 2013 Formula One season but his influence is still evident . Brawn, who turns 60 next month, is lost to Formula One, and indulging his love of fishing, though he has been invited to the team's Christmas party. The focus in the final rounds in America, Brazil and Abu Dhabi is now on a straight fight between Hamilton and Rosberg. Just 17 points separate the pair – next to nothing with the points at the last race on November 23 counting double. Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who was seventh in Russia, is 92 points behind Hamilton. So big a gulf is that that his boss Christian Horner has conceded his chances are close to zero. 'Daniel would have to win all three remaining grands prix and the Mercedes drivers not finish,’ said Horner. ‘It is just between Lewis and Nico now.’","Mercedes clinched Formula One world constructors' championship on Sunday .

"Wigan prop Ben Flower has been hit with a six-month ban for his vicious attack on St Helens’ Lance Hohaia in Saturday’s Grand Final. Flower, who was also fined £300, was said to be ‘devastated’ when he left RFL headquarters following his hearing in Leeds. The ban is a Super League record for a single offence and he will miss 13 matches — 10 league fixtures, the World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos and two pre-season trial games. Hohaia, 31, accepted a one-match ban for his role. Wigan's Ben Flower has been given a six month ban after his sending off in the Super League Grand Final .

Flower, 26 will be eligible to play 11 days after Wigan and Saints are due to meet in their traditional Good Friday fixture in April. He was sent off after two minutes for retaliating to a forearm in the face from Hohaia by felling the Kiwi international with a right hook and then punching his opponent again as he lay motionless on the Old Trafford turf. A statement read: ‘The tribunal panel accepted that Flower had been provoked by a challenge from his opponent but took the view that his actions were malicious, intentional and had the potential for serious injury.’ There is no suggestion that Flower’s future at Wigan is under threat. He stood solemnly alongside Wigan’s football manager Kris Radlinski, who read out a club statement after the hearing. ‘Wigan Warriors would like to go on record as saying that the Rugby Football League disciplinary commission handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity. 'We fully support their assessment of Saturday night’s incident involving our player Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal. ‘We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and his family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens’ win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong. Refeere Phil Bentham shows the red card to Wigan prop Flower during Saturday's Grand Final .

We hope our respect and healthy rivalry can remain intact and that both clubs can return to Old Trafford in the near future and showcase properly the exciting spectacle that rugby league is. ‘Ben has issued an apology and is full of remorse for his actions. We will work hard to repair any damage caused to the reputation of rugby league.’ Saints chairman Eamonn McManus called on the sport to rally round Flower. ‘His rehabilitation is now paramount,’ he said. ‘During the period of his ban he will be no more than a 26-year-old boy who will be extremely vulnerable emotionally. ‘We must assist him in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.’ Terry Newton (Wigan, 2005) SEVEN MONTHS: Knocked out St Helen's Lee Gilmour and broke Sean Long's cheekbone.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger remains confident his side can reach boiling point over the next 10 games and force their way back into the  Premier League title race. The Gunners head to Sunderland on Saturday in seventh place after five draws have left them eleven points behind leaders Chelsea, who are away to Manchester United on Sunday. Only a dramatic late recovery, with two goals in the final two minutes, secured victory in the Champions League at Anderlecht on Wednesday night. Arsene Wenger talks to Theo Walcott in Friday's training session ahead of the trip to Sunderland . The French manager believes his side will hit top form in the coming weeks after a slow start to the season . Wenger accepts his side need to add an efficiency to their game at both ends of the pitch, but feels it will all come together over the next few weeks. 'The main thing is there, the attitude and the quality, but water boils at 100 Degrees and not at 99, so we have to add that degree,' said Wenger. 'I look at how we can be more efficient, that is my only worry. Only a late equaliser from Danny Welbeck salvaged a point against Hull  in the Gunners' last League game . 'We dominate our games. It is just that when we have a weaker moment we pay for it, which is why we have to produce more effort defensively as a team. 'If we are more efficient in 10 games time then we will be in a much better position, so let's start on Saturday (at Sunderland).' Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is set to return having served a one-match European ban in midweek. Wenger feels the 24-year-old has continued his improvement but warns the Pole faces a 'big fight' to stay number one ahead of Colombian David Ospina, who is currently sidelined by injury, and Emiliano Martinez, the 22-year-old Argentinian who did not look out of place when standing in against Anderlecht. The Gunners were poor against Anderlecht but won the game with a 90th minute winner from Lukas Podolski . 'One of the problems he had recently (was coming out of his goal), but I don't think it is a deep problem,' Wenger said of Szczesny. 'I want him to come out, I encourage him to come out, but overall he is doing well and is improving always. 'Wojciech is (an) important (player), but he is in a big fight with Ospina and Martinez, I think that will keep him on his toes. 'At the moment I think he is doing alright, but he is in a big fight.' Arsenal will be looking to put a few more goals past their former keeper Vito Mannone, who shipped eight at Southampton last weekend. The Italian, who left last summer, wants the Sunderland players to repay the ticket and travel expenses of their 2,500 fans who made the 653-mile round trip from Wearside. It is a gesture which comes as no surprise to Wenger. Wojciech Szczesny (left) will likely return against Sunderland at the expense of Emiliano Martinez (right) 'Vito is from a normal background like we all are. His gesture was spontaneous and not calculated because it was quite an expensive one, so I think he shows that he cares,' said the Arsenal manager. 'He did well (here), but was in the position of Martinez, a number three. 'Mannone had the quality, but didn't play the games and after a certain age you have to let them go. 'So he went to Sunderland, where he was not first choice at the start, but he gained his place and I was not surprised because he is quick, confident and overall he has done extremely well there.'","Arsenal are seventh in the Premier League, eleven points behind Chelsea .

"A dog caught by the Taliban could win the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. The dog, named DaGarwal, the Pashto for Colonel, was seized on a failed SAS raid in Afghanistan in December, during which Captain Richard Holloway, 29, was killed. The Belgian shepherd is ‘fit and healthy’ and living on chicken and beef kebabs, his captors claimed yesterday. Prisoner: Belgian shepherd DaGarwal is shown here in footage released by the Taliban . Award: DaGarwal could be awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery . Film footage posted online showed the bearded gunmen parading the small dog as a trophy. The video shows Colonel wearing a specially adapted protective jacket fitted with a GPS tracking device, a torch and camera to beam back footage as the animals move around the battlefield. The insurgents said the dog was captured during an SAS operation alongside the Afghan National Army in Laghman province, east of the capital Kabul, on December 23. That was the day Capt Holloway, 29, a member of the Royal Engineers who was serving with the elite Who Dares Wins unit, was killed by enemy fire in the same area. Despite calls for military chiefs to plot a rescue mission, British Army sources said this scenario was ‘unlikely’. ‘We all recognise what a vital role our dogs play on the frontline but there would be an outcry if a soldier was killed during a raid behind enemy lives to snatch back the dog,’ said the source. Last night it was revealed that Colonel could be in line for a Dickin Medal to mark his life-saving bravery on the frontline. The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) charity, which awards the medal, said that the dog was ‘worthy of consideration’ for an honour. Captors: The Taliban captors claimed that the dog was being treated well . To receive a medal, Colonel must be nominated formally by his regiment or the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. A PDSA spokesman said: ‘The Dickin Medal is awarded to animals for gallantry in armed conflict and from the information gathered about this particular dog, it would appear to potentially have met the criteria.’ The Ministry of Defence has not commented on the reports, but a spokesman for the ISAF confirmed a military working dog went missing during an operation late last year. The Nato-led mission would not confirm whether the animal belonged to British forces, but the Pentagon admitted it in a briefing. There have been no demands for the release or ransom of the dog, which is said to be being held by a notoriously brutal commander known as Abu Zarqawi. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said Colonel was being kept ‘in a safe place’ and was in good health. He said: ‘Right now we are keeping the dog and trying to look after him. It is not like the local dogs which will eat anything and sleep anywhere. ‘We have to prepare him proper food and make sure he has somewhere to sleep properly. ‘We haven’t decided what to do with it yet. Maybe we will keep it and use it ourselves because it has been trained.’ Military working dogs are used by troops in Afghanistan both for protection and sniffing out drugs, firearms and roadside bombs. Dogs can be strapped to their handlers’ chests and parachuted into combat zones. The Ministry of Defence said last year that four dogs have been killed in service in Helmand Province since March 2011 - two labradors, a German shepherd and a springer spaniel cross. One of the four was apparently shot by the Taliban on a mission. But while concerns have been raised for the Taliban’s latest prisoner, an Australian dog captured in Afghanistan had a lucky escape. After being adopted by a Taliban leader, black labrador Sabi was eventually rescued by an American soldier. Since the Dickin Medal was introduced in 1943, the PDSA has awarded it to 64 animals who displayed conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty. It has been awarded to 28 dogs, 32 World War II messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat. The most recent was awarded in October 2012 to Theo, a record-breaking Army sniffer dog, who was killed along with his handler Lance Corporal Liam Tasker in Afghanistan. The 22-month-old pooch died of a seizure shortly after his master was shot dead in 2011. A Dickin Medal has previously been awarded to a dog who was a prisoner of war. In 1942, Royal Navy mascot Judy was captured by the Japanese when HMS Grasshopper was hit by torpedoes. In an attempt to secure official protection for Judy, Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams persuaded the camp commandant to officially register Judy as history’s only canine prisoner of war - officially POW 81A Medan. Judy protected the British service personnel by distracting the camp guards when they were administering punishment to the prisoners. She survived to witness the Japanese surrender in August 1945 and returned to the UK a national hero.","The animal, named DaGarwal, was captured in failed SAS raid last year .

"An hour delay seems like nothing compared to a wait of more than two-and-a-half years for a Gabriel Obertan league goal – but it was the forgotten Frenchman who passed his St James’ Park screen test on a day where everything threatened to go wrong for Alan Pardew. The game was in serious doubt when the canvas surrounding the club’s new giant screen – making its debut – became dislodged by high winds at 1pm. It took two hours to resolve the issue and, with thousands of supporters held at the turnstiles amid safety concerns, kick-off was delayed to 4pm. Gabriel Obertan scored the winner for Newcastle as they beat Leicester 1-0 at St James' Park . Newcastle: Krul, Janmaat,  Steven Taylor, Coloccini, Dummett (Haidara 72), Anita (Perez 59), Colback, Obertan, Sissoko, Gouffran (Cabella 90), Cisse. Subs Not Used: Ferreyra, Elliot, Abeid, Armstrong. Goals: Obertan 71. Leicester: Schmeichel, De Laet, Morgan, Moore, Konchesky, Schlupp (Nugent 56), Ulloa. Subs Not Used: Hammond, King, Hamer, Wasilewski. Booked: Moore, De Laet, Ulloa. Att: 51,886 . Ref: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). But that wasn’t before influential midfielder Cheick Tiote hobbled from the warm-up in obvious discomfort and declared himself unfit to play. At this point, Pardew could have been forgiven for wishing for another gust to come along and postpone the fixture. Come full-time, though, the Newcastle boss was puffing his cheeks in relief at a first league win, avoiding the ignominy of a club record of eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season. The identity of his match-winner was equally satisfying. Obertan – a player signed on the say-so of Pardew – had become a figure of fun on Tyneside after three ineffective seasons. But it was the 25-year-old who had the last laugh as his 71st-minute strike – his first since February, 2012 – settled the contest and gave his manager a much-needed three points. Pardew’s team had started well. With an extra hour of ale inside them, the home fans were right behind their side from the off with no hint of any protest against the boss or regime, despite the earlier farce. And Newcastle should have been two up inside 10 minutes. First Moussa Sissoko whipped enticingly through the six-yard area but there were no takers. Then, having outmuscled Richie De Laat deep inside his own half, Obertan charged fully 50 yards before feeding Papiss Cisse who drew back for the unmarked Fabricio Coloccini, the defender somehow populating Leicester’s penalty area. But he failed to climax the swift break and stabbed wide from just eight yards. The French midfielder cut inside from the left wing and fired a right-foot shot into the bottom corner with 20 minutes to play . Obertan's goal earned Newcastle their first victory of the Premier League campaign but kept them in the bottom three . Obertan celebrates his winner at St James' Park after scoring the only goal of the game in the 71st minute . Home left back Paul Dummett then slammed down the throat of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from range having seized upon some slack passing in Leicester’s midfield. But for all of that early promise, Newcastle should have fallen behind when Vurnon Anita – dozing in possession midway inside his own half – was robbed and Leonardo Ulloa teed up Matty James who prodded tamely at Tim Krul from 12 yards. With Leicester finishing the half much the stronger, Krul lost flight of Marc Albrighton’s cross-cum-shot and the ball cracked the upright, the goalkeeper’s blushes spared.

The half expired goalless with home fans booing their side’s performance, but they were soon cheering when their jazzy new screen relayed news of Sunderland’s 8-0 thrashing at Southampton. Kicking towards the ‘screen end’ after the break, the hosts came within a few inches of breaking the deadlock when Sissoko, sizing a shot from 20 yards, saw his effort deflected just wide by the boot of a sliding Liam Moore. Buoyed by that near miss, Newcastle pressed for an opener and should have had it when Paul Konchesky gifted a chance to Cisse. The left back, perhaps blinded by his own team-mates, failed to notice Cisse lurking on the shoulder of the defence when he rolled a ball back towards Schmeichel. The Senegal striker pounced and rounded the keeper only to wedge into the side-netting from a narrow angle – not narrow enough to mitigate what was a glaring miss, however. Pardew, spinning on his heels, shot a despairing look towards his dugout, for he knew the screen should have been replaying its first goal. Colback stung the palms of Schmeichel with a dipping free-kick soon after. But there was nothing the Foxes custodian could do to keep out Obertan’s blast. Cutting infield from the left, his low drill flew beyond Schmeichel with the aid of a slight deflection, Pardew responding with a trademark fist-pump not sighted in a long while. On a day of delays, the winning feeling was worth the wait. The game was delayed by an hour after a problem with the new electrical scoreboard at St James' Park .

"Gus Poyet has asked for more time to stamp his own identity on the Sunderland side after insisting he was not to blame for the transfer strategy which left them short of defenders. The Uruguayan is grateful not to have been fired in the wake of last weekend’s 8-0 drubbing at Southampton and the Black Cats take on Arsenal just one point outside of the bottom three. Poyet marked one year in the job earlier this month but believes he is still some way from making the team his own. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was embarrassed by his side's 8-0 defeat against Southampton . ‘It takes time, no doubt,’ he said. ‘Managers love to have time but it’s also unrealistic. We can’t always be asking for time. ‘Do I need time to change things? Yes, I do. The most difficult thing to change is mentality. A player at 27 or 28 isn’t going to improve his ability, but he might have been in a certain mental situation because every season involved in relegation. It takes time to change that and results. The two coming together, I hope I’ve got the time.’ Poyet says the loss at Southampton – which equalled a club record – was not helped by only having four fit defenders. And the Sunderland boss does not take responsibility for the club’s failure to bring in the personnel he asked for during the summer. ‘I wanted seven defenders and we started the season with six,’ said Poyet, having this week signed former France defender Anthony Reveillere on a free transfer. ‘That’s true, but now we have seven. I didn’t make the decision to have six, but that’s life. Poyet - reacting to the defeat last weekend - has pleaded for more time at the Stadium of Light . Poyet has brought in France defender Anthony Reveillere in hope that the 34-year-old can bolster his defence . ‘I accept it and I get on with it. Which means I’m not going to tell you I’m happy or not happy. Don’t say that. I’m okay. I get on with it because that is where we are. ‘We were looking for certain players, we were looking for Fabio Borini but he didn’t come. We signed Ricky Alvarez. But I’m not going to lie, we didn’t sign a replacement for Borini.’ Meanwhile, midfielder Lee Cattermole has revealed the desperation of the squad to put right the humiliation of last weekend. ‘I said to my girlfriend on Sunday morning, “I wish we had a game this afternoon to put it right”,’ he said. ‘You just need another game and we need everyone to pull together as a club. We know the supporters will back us. We let them down on Saturday but we are looking to bounce back and start repairing that damage. ‘What happened last week we’d like to think was a one-off. A lot of people are hurting. There has been a lot of discussion since then and this week has been difficult. ‘We finished the game on Saturday and didn’t meet up again until Monday. That 24 hours felt like a few days for most of us. We came back and had time to think about it, we put our point across where we thought we could improve.’","Sunderland have struggled for wins this season in the league .

"Rangers director Philip Nash has resigned from the Ibrox board, the club has announced to the Stock Exchange. The former Liverpool and Arsenal financial chief was brought in by Light Blues chief executive Graham Wallace in January to help solve the club's ongoing cash crisis. But he has now decided to quit before Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley - who holds a 8.92 per cent stake in the club - forced him out.

"Ryan Taylor has spent the past two years on treatment tables, in swimming pools, on weights and running machines, even in the stands scouting. The one place he hasn’t been is a Premier League football pitch. In fact, not since August 25, 2012, has his name appeared on a top-flight teamsheet. Later that week, in a Europa League match, Taylor suffered a cruciate ligament injury. It happens. He did his rehabilitation and returned towards the end of the season. Newcastle United's Ryan Taylor, pictured in training on Friday, could return to action on Sunday . Taylor has lifted Newcastle's camp on his return to first team training, according to Pardew . Taylor will be jumping with joy if he can make his first appearance of the season against Tottenham . But before his anticipated comeback match, Taylor was struck down in training with exactly the same injury. This time, though, the prognosis was not good – a year minimum on the sidelines. On Sunday, some 26 months on from the initial damage, Taylor is expected to take his place on the Newcastle bench at Spurs. His return is said to have provided even more of a boost to the squad than their first win of the season against Leicester last weekend. For Taylor, a cheeky Scouser who scored the decisive goal in a Tyne-Wear derby in 2011, is a popular character. His team-mates have worn ‘Ryan Taylor – Over the Wall’ t-shirts in support of their stricken comrade, the design referencing the song dedicated to his free-kick winner against Sunderland. And his manager, Alan Pardew, says the 30-year-old’s return has lifted his camp. ‘Ryan’s return is the story to come out of our training ground this week in my opinion,’ he said. ‘I think it’s an inspirational story to everybody here and everybody in football, because this is a guy who has had terrible, terrible luck with cruciate injuries and he has come back again. ‘It was so pleasing to put his name on the teamsheet this week to travel. That's good news for us, because he is a very, very liked guy here. Pardew is pleased to have Taylor back in and around his squad following his return to fitness . ‘He commands great respect, not just with our fans, but within the training ground, his place of work. ‘For our coaches and our players, we know how unfortunate he has been but he still comes in with a positive smile on his face and does his rehab - can you imagine doing that three times?’ That third occasion mentioned by Pardew was a horrific double leg break which Taylor suffered playing for Wigan’s reserves – ironically, at Newcastle – in 2006. Those injuries have limited the 30-year-old to just 103 Premier League appearances since signing for the Latics from Tranmere in 2005. But Taylor has tried to earn his keep at Newcastle during the past couple of years by scouting opposition teams. Indeed, his detailed dossiers boasted an unbeaten run when he first took on the role of super scout, and Pardew was more than happy to let Taylor offer guidance to individual players. Taylor, pictured being carried off on a stretcher in February 2012, will be hoping he is over his injury nightmare . And the United boss added: ‘He's just a good person to have at the training ground. There's been a lot of talk this week about professionalism at training grounds and what people bring. ‘What Ryan brings is a real good knowledge and a good understanding, and also professionalism that can inspire others.’ Meanwhile, owner Mike Ashley was spotted at White Hart Lane during Spurs’ 5-1 victory over Asteras in the Europa League on Thursday. Could he, then, be about to take on Taylor’s duty of opposition scout? ‘Yes, maybe he is,’ laughed Pardew. ‘I hope so.’","Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has confirmed Ryan Taylor will travel to London this weekend .

"Foreign aid funds must be diverted to help flood-stricken areas, MPs said last night. With appalling weather set to deepen the crisis in the West Country, politicians of all stripes called for a raid on the £11billion overseas development budget. They said instead of sending the money to increasingly rich countries such as China and India, charity should begin at home. ‘We send money all over the world, now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need,’ said Ian Liddell-Grainger, Tory MP for flood-hit Bridgwater in Somerset. David Cameron visited the flooded areas with Bridgwater and West Somerset  MP Ian Liddell-Grainger (right) during a visit to Goodings Farm in Fordgate, Somerset . The Prime Minister vowed today that the Government will do 'everything that can be done' to help those affected by the floods . Mr Cameron, who arrived by helicopter, said the flooding was 'biblical' as he surveyed knee-deep water surrounding the farm . David Cameron and farmer Tony Davy surveyed the damage to Goodings Farm in Fordgate, Somerset, as he said people in the area faced a very difficult time . Speaking from the flood-affected village of . Stoke St Gregory, Lord Smith (left) said he had no intention of . resigning. Mr Liddell-Grainger (right) said Lord Smith visited the area a . year ago and 'promised he would have this sorted within six months' ‘We should divert some of it down here. We don’t have to divert it for ever, but we need it now.’ The calls came as: . The floodwater surrounding Tewksbury continues to remain following heavy rainfall in the area . Severe flooding in Essex yesterday meant ten people two dogs had to be rescued by Essex Fire by boat in Saffron Walden . Soldiers from Carver Barracks  had to put out sandbags to try and protect buildings in Saffron Walden, Essex, from the severe floods . There's more on the way: Winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the Atlantic tomorrow, in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter . Vehicles tackle a flooded road in Great Dunmow, Essex: Flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more . Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has poured abroad to help those affected by flooding. The Government has set up the International Climate Fund, which will give £3.87billion over five years to help developing countries ‘mitigate and adapt to climate change’. In contrast, dredging the Somerset Levels would cost £4.5million. Britain has given nearly £1.2million to the World Bank’s flood prevention and control scheme, and spent £941,000 on its ‘site preservation’ work.British taxpayers contributed a further £986,000 on protecting the biosphere in developing countries. A further £115million has been spent on preventing floods and other disasters in developing countries. The Government has also donated millions for disaster recovery following particular floods abroad, including £42.5million to aid agencies in Pakistan following floods in 2011. The Department for International Development earmarked £75million for the Bangladesh climate change programme in 2008. When Mozambique was hit by floods in 2000, the Labour government gave £12million extra in aid and dispatched Royal Navy Sea-King helicopters to deliver aid in relief camps. A C-17 military plane was sent to Colombia when it was hit by floods in 2011, carrying 400 aid boxes. The International Climate Fund has spent nearly £80million helping Indonesia, Ghana and others tackle deforestation problems. It has also sent £4.3million to countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Niger to help them study weather forecasts better and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Prime Minister has pledged Britain will spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid –  a promise that means the money funnelled abroad will rise from £8billion to £12billion between 2010 and 2015. By contrast, dredging the Somerset Levels, which might have prevented the disaster, would cost only £4.5million. But while the Environment Agency let drainage channels fall into disrepair, Britain has funnelled £1.2million into the World Bank’s flood prevention programme. It has also sent another £115million to disaster prevention schemes in poor countries. Millions more have also been spent in the cases of individual countries hit by flooding. This includes £42.5million for  Pakistan in 2011, £12million to Mozambique in 2000 and £75million in Bangladesh in 2008. The Department for the Environment has also given £140million to an international climate fund destined for developing countries, which also aims in part to prevent flooding.

Surrounded: The flooded Somerset Levels, where hamlets have been turned into 'ghost villages' after homes were evacuated due to rising flood waters, is expecting a new deluge of torrential rain . Neil Parish, Tory MP for Tiverton and . Honiton in Devon, said: ‘We’ve got to make sure we look after our own at . this stage.  Foreign aid is good, but it  is wasted. ‘We . need to make sure that money comes straight to the West Country. We’ve . got to rebuild coastal defences and railways.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, Tory MP . for North East Somerset, said: ‘Overseas aid should be a matter for . private charity, rather than taxpayers’ money. ‘The failure of the Environment Agency to dredge the Somerset levels means there is a lot of work to do.’ Labour and Lib Dem MPs also suggested the aid budget should be reconsidered in the light of the crisis. Former . Labour minister Frank Field said the Government should examine what . flood prevention schemes it funded abroad, look at ‘which ones worked, . and divert some of that money to flood prevention and relief at home’. He added: ‘We could then ensure our money is better spent abroad and at home, creating two virtuous circles.’ Drafted in: Royal Marines who had been in the region building sandbag defences were drafted in to assist with the evacuation of residents in the village of Moorland this morning . Building defences: Royal Marines  build flood defences in Moorland on the Somerset Levels following serious flooding . Worked through the night: Lieutenant Brendan Ford, of the Royal Navy 40 Commando Royal Marines, said two units had worked through the night to boost flood defences . And . Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming said: ‘If we are not capable of . properly dealing with domestic natural disasters, we should rethink our . financial strategy – including questioning increasing the aid budget.’ Mr Liddell-Grainger said that if the British Government didn’t help out, . locals would have to ask foreign countries for assistance from their . aid budgets. He said: ‘We . need to go and ask Abyssinia for some cash. I’m sure they’ll be happy to . help us because this money is not made available to our own people. ‘It’s . really bad down here. We’ve got people doing amazing things to clean . up. But we need pumps and sluice gates and we’ve got to rebuild railway . lines.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage first suggested that aid money should . be diverted to the West Country. He . said: ‘Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that a government’s . primary duty is to the well-being of its own citizens. Charity begins at . home and it is not mean-spirited to say that, it is just basic common . sense.’ Damage caused: Flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more.

Rescue: A vehicle drives through the flooded village of Moorland after it was evacuated following severe flooding over night . Help at hand: Emergency services and Marines move in to help people evacuate in Moorland, Somerset, after flood waters rose dramatically over night . During his visit the Prime Minister disputed the idea that more money would help. ‘The . resources are there, the money is there,’ he told residents at a . flooded farm near Bridgwater. ‘It’s a biblical scene. People here have . faced a very tough time and continue to face a tough time and that’s why . we have got to do everything we can to help. ‘We . brought in more pumps, more help from the emergency services, money to . help Somerset get back on its feet, the money is there. ‘I’ve . said when the water levels come down and it’s safe to dredge, we will . be dredging to make sure these rivers can carry a better capacity of . water – there are lessons to be learned.’ Transport: Flood-hit travellers in south west England are to get more flights and coach services and special rail fare offers to help them cope with transport difficulties.

On Tuesday night he looked as if he could handle the job, following Saturday’s defeat of former Championship leaders Forest by ending Ipswich’s eight game unbeaten run. Slade masterminded a comeback after Darryl Murphy’s brilliant first half goal had put Mick McCarthy’s side in front. Slade admitted: ‘I am a football manager, I have done 650 games, but I know that Cardiff’s supporters perhaps didn’t know much about me. ‘It is up to myself and the team to go out and win them over, and I think we are starting to achieve that.’ For good measure he has also helped Peter Whittingham find his shooting boots - the 30-year-old former captain who helped give Slade his first win on Saturday came up with another cracker. The 30-year-old former captain, who helped give Slade his first win on Saturday, came up with another cracker. It was a great response to an equally spectacular goal by Murphy. And it set the scene for goals by Federico Macheda and Adam Le Fondre that have pushed the Welsh club back closer to the play-off places. Slade had called for more consistency in his efforts to turn round a season that had begun so poorly following relegation from the Premier League. But until Whittingham, who now has 70 league goals in his eight seasons at Cardiff, suddenly exploded into the game it had seemed more likely that canny McCarthy would come out on top. Former Sunderland and Celtic striker Murphy has been catching the eye of Republic boss Martin O’Neill again – and little wonder. Ipswich player Daryl Murphy shoots to open the scoring in the Championship clash in Cardiff . Murphy (left) celebrates with team-mate Tyrone Mings after putting the visitors ahead . Cardiff's Adam Le Fondre (right) shoots to score the third goal for his side in front of the home crowd . The 31-year-old didn’t seem to have many options as he picked up a loose ball just beyond the corner of the penalty box after 29 minutes. The one he took was to smash the ball with his left foot into the far bottom corner of David Marshall’s goal. It was hard to argue Ipswich weren’t worth the lead at that stage. With the tiny figure of Jonny Williams – all 5ft 6ins of him – dominating the midfield as if he were a giant they had created the most danger. The on-loan Crystal Palace star picked his way through a series of tackles to make a chance that Conor Sammon put wide, and then tried a long range effort that whistled within an inch of the post.

Then out of the blue – or should that be red – came Cardiff’s response and it was every bit as spectacular as Murphy’s effort. Whittingham was 25 yards out when he retrieved a ball that had been headed clear, and took a touch to set himself before smashing a shot that rose into the roof of the net. It changed the game, and within two minutes of Slade finishing his half time team talk Cardiff were on the attack again, with Anthony Pilkington’s volley falling for Macheda to divert it home from a few yards. And the game was as good as over when with 69 minutes gone Craig Noone twisted full back Tyrone Mings inside out and put over a cross that fell for Le Fondre to volley home. ‘Where the second half came from I don’t know,’ admitted McCarthy. ‘If they had played circus music over some of our mistakes it would have been about right.’","Cardiff City come back from a goal down to beat Ipswich 3-1 in the Championship clash .

Leeds also started the season reasonably well after Neal Redfearn took over from David Hockaday but have gone south since Darko Milanic was handed the head coach job last month. Despite a powerful attack, and handing Brazilian under-20s international Adryan his first start after signing on loan from Flamengo, United seemed happy to defend deep with numbers and not lose the game, rather than show any real ambition. The Canaries had two penalty appeals waved away late on by an unmoved Clattenburg to compound their frustration.

"Russell Slade enjoyed a dream debut as Cardiff manager as his side ended Nottingham Forest's unbeaten record in the Sky Bet Championship with a 2-1 win at the Cardiff City Stadium. The former Leyton Orient manager has had to wait a long time to lead his new side, due to legal wranglings and the international break, but it proved to be worth it. Federico Macheda's first league goal in Cardiff colours gave them a 22nd-minute lead, with Peter Whttingham firing home the second five minutes later. Russell Slade acknowledges the Cardiff faithful before his first game in charge against Nottingham Forest . Slade and his coaching staff react with delight after Cardiff take the lead against Nottingham Forest . Cardiff City: Marshall, Brayford, Fabio, S Morrison, Manga, Whittingham, Noone, Gunnarsson (Adeyemi 66; Daehli 70), Pilkington, Le Fondre, Macheda (Jones 62). Subs not used: Moore, Gabbidon, Ralls, Maynard. Goals scored: Macheda 22, Whittingham 27 . Nottingham Forest: Darlow, Hunt (Veldwijk 77), Mancienne(C), Wilson, Lichaj (Harding 45), Lansbury (Vaughan 57), Tesche, Burke, Antonio, Assombalonga, Fryatt . Subs not used:  De Vries,  Lascelles, Blackstock, Osborn. Goals scored:  Assombalonga 89 . Forest did pull one back through Britt Assombalonga, but it was not enough to prevent Stuart Pearce's side suffering their first defeat of the season. Slade had demanded a quick start from his new charges and he got one, with Anthony Pilkington making two powerful surging runs, the latter of which ended with the former Norwich man working Karl Darlow with a low shot. But Cardiff's bright opening did not come without cause for alarm. Captain and goalkeeper David Marshall made a sharp stop to keep out Matty Fryatt's curling strike, and Craig Noone made a critical goal-line clearance after Chris Burke had bamboozled makeshift full-back Joe Ralls. Within 60 seconds of Noone's intervention, Cardiff led. Aron Gunnarsson led the break and Macheda arrived on to his pass to work his way beyond Fryatt and slot low beyond Darlow, who got a hand to the strike but could not keep it out. Federico Macheda makes no mistake from close range as the gave Cardiff the lead against Forest . Macheda celebrates with his team-mates after netting his first goal of the season . Having been punished once for poor defending on the edge of their box, Forest failed to heed the lesson and fell further behind in the 27th minute. A loose ball fell to Whittingham, who was given plenty of time to pick his spot and dispatch a left-footed shot into the bottom corner. The Cardiff midfielder nearly repeated the dose a few minutes later as Pearce made his frustrations clear to his players. The Forest manager sent his side back out very early for the second half and withdrew Eric Lichaj in favour of Dan Harding. But it did not bring about any real improvement from the visitors and only a fine save from Darlow prevented Sean Morrison's header putting Cardiff three goals to the good, after a Whittingham free-kick had been allowed to travel through to the far post. Whittingham celebrates putting the Bluebirds 2-0 up inside the first half hour at the Cardiff City Stadium . The former Manchester United striker escapes the challenge of Kelvin Wilson and Eric Lichaj in the first half . Britt Assombalonga netted a late consolation for Stuart Pearce's side at Cardiff on Saturday . But Forest slowly began to exert sustained pressure on their hosts and they thought they had pulled a goal back just after the hour. The Cardiff rearguard allowed Michail Antonio to weave his way towards goal and get a shot away that Marshall could only parry. Assombalonga was on hand to tap in the rebound, but the flag was up for offside. Slade had spoken of his concerns over the fitness levels of some of his players and, as they began to flag, so Forest pressed. They gave themselves hope of salvaging a point when Assombalonga turned in Antonio's cross with two minutes to go. Antonio had a last-gasp chance to grab an equaliser, but Marshall was equal to his low drive.","Federico Macheda and Peter Whittingham were on target as Cardiff won .

"Sam Peters exclusively reveals how Stuart Lancaster's refusal to guartantee Steffon Armitage a place in his EPS was a factor in his move to Bath breaking down . Steffon Armitage showed just what Bath and England will be missing with the try that sealed a 12th successive win in Europe for Toulon on Sunday. Armitage’s proposed move to Bath that would have opened the door to him getting a place in England’s World Cup squad collapsed last week. But the Toulon No 8 showed no sign of being distracted by all the speculation aas Toulon began their defence of the Champions Cup at Stade Felix Mayol . Toulon's flanker Steffon Armitage celebrates after scoring in the 28-18 victory in France . Armitage's proposed move to Bath broke down earlier in the week, and he'll remain at the French side . European Rugby Champions Cup Pool 3 . Toulon (18) 28. Tries: Giteau, Mermoz, S. Armitage. Cons: Halfpenny 2. Pens: Halfpenny 3. Scarlets (13) 18. Tries: Barclay, K. Phillips. Cons: Priestland. Pens: Priestland 2. Att: 15,300 . With nine minutes left, he scored his side’s decisive third try after being set up by a good break from Aussie Matt Gituea. But Toulon were made to battle hard by Scarlets, who were reduced to 14 men after just six minutes when Rory Pitman saw yellow for a high tackle on wing David Smith, allowing Leigh Halfpenny to kick the home side in front. Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland brought the visitors level with a penalty before Giteau lit the contest up with a wonderful individual try. Halfpenny bizarrely failed to add the simple conversion after the ball fell off its tee halfway through his run-up and the Scarlets picked the ball up. The visitors hit back with a converted try from flanker John Barclay after good work by Scott Williams and Liam Williams. Toulon's Australian fly-half Matt Giteau celebrates after scoring for the defending champions . Giteau goes over, with last year's Heineken Cup winners 18-13 up at half-time at the Stade Felix Mayol . But straight from the restart Scarlets skipper Scott Williams took too long over a clearance and Maxime Mermoz charged his kick down and went under the posts, with Halfpenny adding the extras. Wales internationals Priestland and Halfpenny exchanged penalties before the interval to give Toulon a slender 18-13 lead at the break. Toulon put the Scarlets under pressure at the beginning of the second period but were finding it difficult to break through the visitors’ defence. Toulon's winger David Smith (L) challenges Llanelli Scarlets' Welsh flanker Aaron Shingler with a hand-off . Hooker Emyr Phillips became the second Scarlets player sent to the bin for using his hands on the floor after Smith had made a dangerous break for Toulon. But after going to touch with the penalty, Toulon lost the line-out and the Scarlets were able to clear. Halfpenny added a long-range penalty with 15 minutes remaining to settle home nerves but they had to wait for the third try from Armitage. With Toulon chasing the bonus point the Scarlets were able to end on a high with a Kristian Phillips try in the final minute.","The defending European champions beat Scarlets at the Stade Felix Mayol .

"Stuart Lancaster's refusal to guarantee Steffon Armitage a place in his Elite Player Squad (EPS) was a significant factor in Bath’s failed bid to sign the Toulon star ahead of next year’s World Cup. Bath head coach Mike Ford admitted on Thursday the deal was ‘dead in the water’ with RFU unwilling to help fund the £240,000 transfer fee demanded by the French giants. But it has emerged that Lancaster told Armitage’s advisors that the depth of back-row talent available to him in England meant he was unable to provide assurances the 29-year-old would be included in the 33-man EPS squad which he announces this Wednesday. Steffon Armitage's move to Bath is dead in the water meaning he will not be in the England squad . Stuart Lancaster did not give Armitage any guarantees . 'Steffon wanted to firm assurance that he would be named in the EPS but there was no way Stuart could give that,' an England insider told Sportsmail. Northampton flanker Calum Clark is expected to be named alongside captain Chris Robshaw, Tom Wood and James Haskell on Wednesday – with strict RFU selection criterion meaning only English-based players can be selected - with Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees’ place in serious doubt. Bath’s uncapped Fijian-born winger Semesa Rockoduguni – who only signed professional papers two years ago and still a serving soldier in the British Army – is also in line to be named in Lancaster’s 33-man squad. Clark’s inclusion would raise most eyebrows, two years after he was banned for 32 weeks for breaking the arm of Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins. Lancaster – who coached Clark as a youngster at the Leeds Academy - has made several attempts to blood the uncapped 25-year-old, only to be thwarted by suspension and injuries, but MailSport understands he is in line to be named this Wednesday. Saracens flanker Will Fraser is understood to have edged ahead of Gloucester’s Matt Kvesic and is being seriously considered, while Haskell – who this week signed a lucrative new contract at Wasps – will also be included alongside No 8s Billy Vunipola and Ben Morgan. Twelvetrees' Aviva Premiership form has been patchy so far this season and with Bath No12 Kyle Eastmond in sensational form and highly-rated Saracens inside centre Brad Barritt fit again and apparently certain to be included, the 25-year-old Gloucester centre faces an anxious wait. Lancaster has yet to settle on his favoured wing combination and Rockoduguni – a tank driver with the Scot Dragoon Guards who completed a six-month tour of the notorious Helmand province in Afghanistan as an infantryman in 2007 – has made an irresistible case for inclusion. Saracens flanker Will Fraser looks set to be named in the England Elite Player Squad . ‘The way I see it, I want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way,’ the 27-year-old told Mailsport this week. ‘When you experience something like (Afghanistan) that it teaches you a lesson in life. That’s how I’m looking at my professional rugby career. I have one go at this and I don’t intend to mess it up.’ Marland Yarde is certain to be included as one winger – despite taking time to settle at his new club Harlequins this season – but with Exeter’s Jack Nowell not fully fit and Jonny May yet to convince at the highest level, Lancaster’s wing options remain relatively thin. Saracens experienced flyer Chris Ashton could yet make the final cut. Danny Care has established himself as England’s first-choice scrum half ahead of next year’s World Cup and will be one of three scrum-halves named along with Ben Youngs and Lee Dickson. Danny Care looks set to be England's first choice scrum half in the build up to the World Cup . Fly half Danny Cipriani looks set to be among the most unfortunate to miss out. The 26-year-old made his first England appearance in almost six years this summer and has been in superb form for Sale this season. But with Owen Farrell and George Ford assured of inclusion, and Stephen Myler’s consistency admired by the England management, it would take a significant about-turn for the in-form Cipriani to be included. Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood will be three of the locks with Geoff Parling set to be named in the EPS but unlikely to feature this autumn after a string of concussions for Leicester. Northampton’s Christian Day, Saracens George Kruis and Leicester’s Graham Kitchener are vying for the final second-row spots. Dave Wilson, Matt Mullan, Henry Thomas and Joe Marler will be the props with Dylan Hartley and Rob Webber at certain to be named as hooker with David Paice favourite to be named as the third No 2. Saracens Richard Wigglesworth and Northampton's Lee Dickson are battling for the third scrum-half spot. Long-term injured Dan Cole (neck), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Geoff Parling (concussion), Alex Corbisero (shoulder) and Tom Croft (knee) are expected to be named in the EPS but will not feature any of the four QBE internationals this November.","Steffon Armitage's move to Bath collapsed after lack of England guarantees from Stuart Lancaster .

"Jose Mourinho is refusing to rule Diego Costa out of Sunday's crunch clash against Manchester United. The Spain centre forward has missed the last two games with a hamstring problem and was even admitted to hospital this week with a virus. But Mourinho, who confirmed Loic Remy would miss the next three weeks with a groin problem, says his star striker has a chance of making the visit to Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say Costa has a 'little chance' to play . Diego Costa has a 'chance' of facing Manchester United at Old Trafford, insists Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . Loic Remy scored the opener against Maribor on Tuesday night but will not be fit for the trip to United . Chelsea boss Mourinho is confident that his side will be ready to face up to the challenge at Old Trafford . Remy limped off after injuring his groin and his injury will keep him out for two to three weeks . When asked on Friday if Costa would play, Mourinho said: 'There is a chance, he has a little chance. Diego has a little chance, the same as Ramires and (John Obi) Mikel. 'But Remy is out - he will not play. He has no chance. 'Everything happened (to Costa). He was obviously injured - that was hamstring. He had to go to hospital with a viral situation that we didn't manage to resolve without being in hospital over one night - that was before Maribor. 'Against Maribor he wouldn't have been ready from the injury, no chance. But being ill didn't help the recovery process because we didn't have him at Cobham (training ground). Medical staff had to go to his house because we didn't want to bring him here with a viral situation. 'He trained individually, not yet with us.' Didier Drogba, meanwhile, has had no reaction to his 75 minutes against Maribor in the Champions League and could play. Mourinho also confirmed that Thibaut Courtois will get the nod in goal. Didier Drogba, in action against Maribor on Tuesday, is operating at less than 100 per cent right now . Oscar (right) gave Chelsea an early lead against Crystal Palace last week by scoring a wonderful free-kick . Fabregas doubled Chelsea's lead at Selhurst Park early in the second half last weekend . The Blues are unbeaten in the Premier League - having won seven and drawn one of their eight matches so far - and the Portuguese believes his squad are confident heading up to the North West for Sunday's tie. He was quick, however, to insist his team 'share nothing' with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal Invincibles side of 2003-04 despite comparisons. 'We are playing well, we are confident, top of the league and in a good position to qualify for the Champions League. The camp is happy and we are ready for the game,' he continued. 'I only have positive news!' Mourinho says his side are focused ahead of trip to Old Trafford but will give United the respect they deserve . Mourinho will go head-to-head with his former boss Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford but he is concentrating on picking up the three points. He said: 'I like to go to Old Trafford and I like to play there. I've been there with Porto, Inter (Milan), Real Madrid and Chelsea and I like to go there and play there.. 'Louis van Gaal was important. He gave me a good opportunity to work at a high level, as a young coach to be working four consecutive years, one with Mr (Bobby) Robson and three with Louis in a club like Barcelona is very important. 'If I had to choose important people in my career for sure he's one. Cesar Azpilicueta (bottom) will not feature for Chelsea after being sent off against Crystal Palace last week . Oscar (far left) is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates for his brilliant dead ball strike against Palace . And Mourinho believes his side will show United the respect they deserve, but they will not go there scared. Chelsea's wonderful start to the season gives them some momentum. He said: 'We will respect one of the best and most difficult opponents in the league, but we're confident and in a good moment and situation. There's no reason to change our positive feeling. 'We play a big team, yes, but we're in a good moment and going to discuss the points and try the best result. 'But we are not going to Old Trafford to get a point - we are heading there to win. 'I want to fight for three points but sometimes during a game a point is a positive result.' Mourinho (right) and Warnock before last week's game - but the latter was not happy with some decisions . Interestingly, Mourinho also claimed he does not see former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata as a 'special player'. Mata was sold to United in January by Mourinho and he believes although the Spaniard did a 'good job' for Chelsea, he was not a 'special player'. 'For me Juan is a very good player and I look at him as a very good player. I don't look at him as a special player because of certain circumstances. 'Because if I did there would have been 20, 30, 40 players who we sold or decided to leave. It happens. For me not a problem. 'He a very good player and very good players are dangerous. Relations are good.'

"For a Manchester United manager, there is never really a honeymoon period. Louis van Gaal probably realised that as soon as his team lost their opening game of the Barclays Premier League season to Swansea at Old Trafford. As United prepare to return to action at West Brom on Monday, however, it is hard to escape the feeling that their season, to all intents and purposes, starts now. The first thing Van Gaal did when he arrived at Old Trafford was to ask for time and that was reasonable. The squad he inherited from David Moyes lacked balance, he stressed, and he was right. This was a dressing room, for example, that had more No 10s than Trafford bus depot. VIDEO Scroll down to watch West Brom vs Manchester United Premier League preview . Louis van Gaal (right) chats to his assistant Ryan Giggs during his first game in charge against Swansea . United are fourth in the Premier League . Several weeks on, however, and the Premier League landscape is a little clearer. United have been patchy and scratchy. Their last two home wins in the league – 2-1 against West Ham and Everton – could easily have been draws. However, there has been improvement from early season struggles and as Premier League football returns again this weekend United sit fourth, back in the Champions League positions for the first time in a long time. Certainly there is opportunity for Van Gaal's United as they look forwards. A tilt at the Premier League title is maybe beyond them – that already looks like a two-horse race – but with expected top four rivals such as Liverpool, Arsenal, Everton and Tottenham already experiencing problems of their own there is no reason why a fit and functioning United team should not do enough to ensure they are back in Europe’s blue riband competition next season. Perhaps we will learn much over the next two-and-half weeks. By the time the next international break begins United will have faced West Brom, Chelsea, Manchester City. Former United captain Gary Neville said this week: 'We'll find out about United in the next few weeks as the West Brom, Chelsea and City games are all massive ones. 'We'll find out exactly the level where the team is at this season. 'We've not really played anybody really strong yet. 'I know Everton at home could be classed as being a tough game but, in terms of really tough matches, Chelsea and City will provide a real measure of where this team is at.'

The attacking players Van Gaal has at his disposal could have been taken straight from somebody’s fantasy football team. Further to that, Van Gaal should now  see the defensive injury crisis that has plagued his early season efforts begin to ease and with midfielder Michael Carrick closer to a first-team return after ankle trouble there is every reason why the Dutch coach should see improvement. 'We've shown glimpses over the last few weeks and hopefully we'll have a lot of players coming back for these next games,' confirmed United assistant manager Ryan Giggs on Thursday.

'We feel that we do belong up there but we perhaps haven't shown it consistently this season. 'The form has slowly begun to get better and better and we want to hit form going into those matches.' As anyone who watches them knows, United’s season has been categorised by two stark opposites. Their attacking play has been excellent at times while their defending has been modest at best. As Van Gaal has pointed out himself, the responsibility for defending lies with the whole team and, by extension, the coach himself. Angel Di Maria has been a revelation since moving to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in a £60million move . United continue to have problems keeping the ball and in the absence of Carrick and Marouane Fellaini – also fit again now – there has been no midfield shield to protect Van Gaal’s back four when his team lose the ball. If this aspect of United’s play does not improve against the two favourites for the league title in the coming weeks then it is hard to see them taking anything from the games. Equally, United need to find a way to improve in the last half an hour of matches. Startling statistics reveal that they have not scored a goal beyond the 62nd minute of any game this season but have conceded eight in that time. Van Gaal knows he still has plenty to do before United return to their glory days . Van Gaal may dismiss that as a co-incidence and would certainly rail against any notion that his team isn’t fit enough. However, it’s a statistic that has damaged United hugely so far this season. If they can put that right against West Brom, Chelsea and Manchester City over the next 16 days then the winter will begin to look rather less dark.

"For many years now, a tiny corner of rural Greater Manchester has been purely football. Past the Trafford Centre, throw a right at the roundabout, through the lights and you get to Carrington, home – among other things – to the training grounds of Manchester's two football clubs. Take a five-iron and strike it well from United's northerly pitches and the chances are those picking the ball up will be wearing City blue. So close they could hardly escape each other even if they wanted to. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City vs Tottenham Premier League preview: Essential stats you need to know . Manchester City have built a new £200million training complex which includes 16 pitches called the Etihad Campus . City have hailed their new training base as one of the best sporting facilities in the world . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was one of the first players to take a peek at the new training base . Spain playmaker David Silva visits the new complex walking past a poster featuring images from City's trophy successes . When United manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked of his club's 'noisy neighbours' this is what he meant. Today, however, it changes. Today City's players are turning their sports cars and their SUVs east towards the previously neglected Manchester suburbs of Gorton and Beswick. Here, opposite their own Etihad Stadium, lies their new training ground. Hailed – admittedly by City themselves – as one of the best sporting facilities in the world, the Etihad Campus has cost in the region of £200million to build, has 16 pitches, its own 7,000-seater reserve stadium, an accommodation block and even a sixth-form College to serve its local community. And those are just the things they have told us about. Carrington, it must be said, was somewhat different. City's home for more than a decade - they previously trained at the rather iconic Platt Lane centre in Manchester's inner-city – it didn't even have a security barrier for many years. Instead it had a rather fierce looking Scot named 'Michael' who spent his days peering at you from inside a one-man sentry booth decorated with City calendars, posters and gifts from the players. If he knew you, Michael would tell you his latest joke. If he didn't, he would probably scare the life out of you. City boss Manuel Pellegrini (right) has already taken training at the new base ahead Saturday's Premier League visit of Tottenham . Scott Sinclair, Fernando, Jesus Navas, Frank Lampard and Dedryck Boyata (left to right) are put through their paces at the complex . England and City No 1 Joe Hart gets acquainted with the newly-laid turf during goalkeeping practice at the £200m training base . This was City pre-Abu Dhabi, though. Things were different, then. The first manager I encountered there was Kevin Keegan. 'Nice to meet you, I hate your paper,' were his first words to me in the winter of 2001. Back then the media used to walk round the back of the main building, up some rather fragile-looking stairs that always needed painting and in to a room that doubled up as an analysis 'suite' – it had a round table and some chairs – when we weren't there. On a shelf on the side was a never ending supply of footballs and black marker pens. Once a week the players would file past and sign. Keegan was often late, usually because he had been playing head tennis with his coaches out the back. 'Don't say I admitted that,' he once said. 'It will invalidate my medical insurance on my back.' In the late Sixties, the days of City stars like Mike Summerbee, left, players were put through their paces on an athletics track at Longford Park. Here, the former England international is given tips by ex-Great Britain one-mile runner Stan Taylor . After the Christmas break in 1969, City players were sent on a 30-minute run at Wythenshawe Park to shed off any excess pounds . City's former first-team training ground Platt Lane is now used by the club's academy for matches . In those days, players such as Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman ruled the roost at Carrington, waiting round the corner to fire footballs at team-mates emerging in to the complex's wide open spaces from a changing block that looked rather like something out of the film Kes. It was all very high school. Joey Barton, meanwhile, used to use that area as his own private driving range, golf balls pinging high in to the distance from his driver. A very good golfer, maybe Joey was aiming at Sir Alex across the other side of the hedge. Keegan once made his exit from Carrington under a blanket on the back seat of a car. His crime? To make a joke about Liverpudlians and hub caps as he signed Fowler. The Sun newspaper sent reporters dressed in black curly wigs to ambush him. 'Michael' on security would have eaten them for his breakfast. As time passed, things changed. The essence of Carrington never did, though. Even to this day – when City had to erect a big, cold tent to host Champions League press conferences – the throwback feel of the place remains. Stuart Pearce liked to hold press conferences at 8am. I think it was a macho thing. The problem was that, as results faded, the media just stopped turning up. Maybe that was the plan all along. The club's younger ranks are put through their paces ahead of their friendly against Barnsley in September 2013 . City entered a new era when Sven-Goran Eriksson introduced a table to sit behind when he spoke to journalists at press conferences . Sven made sure he knew everybody's name at Carrington during his time at City, and when he was sacked there were tears from some . Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, finally introduced a table to sit behind for press conferences. For City, that was progress. They loved Sven at Carrington, especially the women. He knew everybody's name. When it emerged that he paid for the £2,000-a-night top-floor suite at Manchester's Radisson Edwardian out of his own pocket every night, the Swede's legend only grew. City weren't bad on the field under Eriksson, either. When he was sacked – unjustly – they cried at Carrington. On his arrival, Mark Hughes did his best to tart things up a bit. He thought Carrington was 'unfit for purpose' and he was probably right. Given that he had come from Blackburn, though, it said everything. Mark Hughes was unhappy with City's Carrington training ground facilities upon his arrival from Blackburn . Hughes disliked the media getting too close so they built us a pre-fabricated hut just inside the entrance while money was spent on the dressing rooms, too. Pretty soon, Michael on security was no more. Someone didn't like his tattoos apparently. With the Arab money that soon arrived, Carrington got new signage and some trees lining the driveway that were rumoured to cost £1,000 each. The training ground soon got Roberto Mancini and Mario Balotelli, too. Mancini often used to cycle to work – with his faithful aide 'Jose' driving behind him in case of 'emergencies' – while the photographers that lined the public footpath nearby feasted on the punch-ups that, for a while, became part of the City story. I once suggested to one of Mancini's coaches that the club just erect a big fence to protect the sessions from the lenses. 'The council won't let us,' he replied. 'Anyway, it would be cheaper if the players just stopped fighting.'

Roberto Mancini (left) tries to laugh off the feud between Balotelli and Richards (right) after their fight . Former Manchester City boss  Mancini (left) came to blows with Balotelli (right) during a training session in January 2013 . For a while the bad publicity was a problem for City but, on the whole, they were impressively sanguine. Across the fence, Ferguson was paranoid about the secrecy of his training sessions, as indeed is Louis van Gaal now. City, though, took a different view. On learning that one geeky fan was climbing a tree to view sessions through binoculaurs, they didn't set the dogs on him. Instead they invited him inside for a guided tour and a meet-and-greet session. At the 'Etihad Complex' I suspect things may be a little different. That's what they call progress. If you want to spy on training this week, you may wish to hire a drone. Manuel Pellegrini and his players will want for nothing, that's for sure. The Premier League is a different place now. They will still moan, though. Players always do. For a start – from their homes in the Cheshire enclaves of Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury – the new place is a lot more difficult to get to.

"The Premier League is back and with it comes the usual array of compelling sub-plots and unanswered questions. Will Radamel Falcao come good? What next for Newcastle? Is Roberto Martinez able to build a defence as well as an attack? Are Diego Costa’s hamstrings an accident waiting to happen and what would that do to Chelsea, the runaway leaders? Sportsmail considers 10 reasons why we can’t wait for the Premier League to return… . So, is Sterling still tired? We may be just seven games into the new season, but Raheem Sterling is already complaining of being fatigued. So much so, he asked Roy Hodgson to leave him out of the starting XI for England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia on Sunday. The Three Lions manager is expected to meet up with Sterling when Liverpool travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Reports he has bought Sterling a pillow for the long journey back to Anfield are said to be wide of the mark. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training for Liverpool on Wednesday, is expected to face QPR this weekend . Falcao finding his feet . We’ve had the revelation that he’s part Yorkshireman but what Manchester United fans would far prefer is a reminder of Radamel Falcao’s striking ability. His pre-United goals-to-games ratio of 200:305 is simply incredible and he is arguably the best finisher in football. But he only has one goal in four for United and that is not good enough. Is he over that terrible knee injury he suffered last season? Is he still adapting to the Premier League? Answers to these questions ought to reveal themselves over the next couple of months, starting with Monday’s trip to West Brom. Radamel Falcao celebrating his only goal so far for Manchester United following his loan move from Monaco . Can Man City close the gap at the top in early kick-off? Giving Jose Mourinho an early advantage does not seem like the smartest idea. But that is what Manchester City have done, falling five points behind after seven games. Their inferior goal difference (+7 versus Chelsea’s +14) effectively makes that a six-point gap and also highlights that they need more goals. City need to address that gap quickly and start with a tricky home fixture against Tottenham on Saturday. Spurs’ dire record against top-four sides however, will count in the champions' favour. Sergio Aguero celebrates his strike against Aston Villa in Man City's 2-0 victory before the international break . Can Palace repeat last season’s shock by beating Chelsea? March 29 – Palace 1 Chelsea 0. It was one of the most stunning results of the season, playing a huge role in Palace’s survival and Chelsea’s failure to win the title. Palace are not facing the same struggles in the early part of this season as last, but it would be a monumental upset if Chelsea lost on Saturday. John Terry put through his own net to hand Crystal Palace a shock win against Chelsea last season . What will happen to Costa’s mysterious hamstrings? He has been the missing link. Jose Mourinho did plenty of moaning last season about his striking options and Costa has proven just how useful an in-form predator can be. His tally for the season is a stunning nine in seven Premier League games, which goes a fair distance to explaining their early dominance. But he is operating under a cloud, with Mourinho frequently citing the fragility of his hamstrings. They have been problematic for him in the past, though Arsene Wenger recently smirked when asked if he thought Mourinho’s regular mentions of problems were a smokescreen. If they are an issue, it would surely have a drastic effect on Chelsea’s season. Diego Costa ended his 515-minute barren run for Spain when he scored against Luxembourg on Sunday . Life after Luis . It’s lost on very few that Liverpool have 10 points and sit ninth compared with 16 points and top spot at this time last season. One worrying truth is that Liverpool’s fast start last season owed little to Luis Suarez, who was serving another of his biting bans. His impact was felt from roughly this time of year and onwards, so it will be fascinating to see how they go from here on in. They play at QPR on Sunday. Sack race – who will go next? So far only Neil Warnock has come in during the campaign, which is fairly standard as historically this unsavoury aspect of a season doesn’t tend to get going until November. There are suggestions that Harry Redknapp’s position is under threat, with Tim Sherwood reportedly lined up to step into his role. And Alan Pardew is the subject of near constant speculation, either from the stands or smoking porches of Soho pubs. Sam Allardyce is forever considered to be in range of a boot to the backside, but West Ham’s fine start ought to have allayed those suspicions. Alan Pardew's Newcastle have endured a difficult start to the season. His position is the subject of speculation . Martinez has to prove he can build a defence . Roberto Martinez has often faced questions on his ability to build a defence as capable as his attacks. It is often cited that his exciting team at Wigan had the firepower to continue defying the odds by staying up, but were undermined too much by a leaky backline. Now his Everton side are sitting 17th with the worst record for goals conceded in the division – 16. To make the issue even more clear, they have scored 13, which is bettered only by Chelsea and Manchester City. So it is obvious where the problem lies. And it is down to Martinez to prove what he can do at both ends of the pitch. Steven Naismith on target in Everton's defeat at Manchester United, but their problems lie in defence . Pardew and the Newcastle situation . Will he walk away? Will Mike Ashley swallow the cost of paying off the remainder of his contract and sack him? Will he get the best out of these players and end the discussion? Certainly, there is trouble in the north. Hefty chunks of the support are neither behind the board nor the manager and the team sit in the bottom three. Something needs to change. The Koeman effect . It turns out that reports of Southampton’s demise were greatly exaggerated, to adapt a cliche. Ronald Koeman has had a stunning effect since taking over, with this club continuing to prove its survival skills. It was expected to perish after Nigel Adkins left, when Nicola Cortese left, when Mauricio Pochettino left… But still Southampton are going strong. Their squad acknowledge that Christmas was a tricky patch for them last season, but they have a good run of fixtures coming up and will need to build up steam ahead of another tough festive schedule. Southampton are third in the table having lost just one of their opening seven matches of the new campaign .","Man City face Spurs in the game of the weekend on Saturday afternoon .

"Frank Lampard admits to a sense of disbelief at his sensational start to his loan spell at Manchester City which saw the former England midfielder voted as the club's player of the month. Lampard, who could start against Tottenham in the Saturday lunchtime match with Yaya Toure returning late to City from international duty, scored a vital equaliser against his old club Chelsea, two more in the Capital One Cup against Sheffield Wednesday and a further goal in the win at Hull. Lampard told City's official website: 'If somebody had said I would be voted player of the month by the fans in my first full month playing I would have had difficulty believing them. Frank Lampard has impressed for Manchester City since he joined the club on loan from New York City FC . Lampard scored a late equaliser against his old club Chelsea in September to salvage a point for City . 'To beat James Milner and David Silva is really flattering and especially James, who has had a fantastic start to the season and is someone who doesn't always get the plaudits he deserves - though I've found that's not the case with City fans who are very appreciative of him and what he brings to the team. 'I think my goals probably edged it but Milly deserves a big shout out as well.' Lampard, 36, is likely to be given a hostile reception by Spurs fans but will be looking to build on an impressive record against the White Hart Lane club. Lampard (second from right) in training for City, is in line to start against Tottenham at the Etihad on Saturday . He added: 'I've done all right against Spurs over the years and playing them was always a big game at Chelsea. 'I think they'll be up and around the top six this season. They may go through a slight transitional period but I was very impressed with their manager when he was at Southampton and if he can bring the same imprint on Tottenham, who arguably have more quality within their squad, they'll do really well. 'I'm sure their aim is to get into the Champions League, but it won't be easy and there is a lot of competition and there are a lot of teams all trying to achieve the same goal.'","Manchester City fans voted Frank Lampard September player of the month .

"Former England midfielder Frank Lampard has been 'upset' by some of the criticism aimed at Raheem Sterling this week. Sterling did not start England's Euro 2016 qualifying win in Estonia on Sunday after telling manager Roy Hodgson that he felt tired. Hodgson's decision to make this conversation public has prompted a huge debate, with the player himself having both his fitness and commitment questioned in some quarters. Frank Lampard  says criticism of Raheem Sterling (in action here against Estonia) has been unfair . Manchester City star Lampard says he is 'upset' at the backlash against Sterling after the teenager and his World Cup team-mate told England boss Roy Hodgson he was tired ahead of the match against Estonia . Lampard feels it is unfair to turn on the 19-year-old, who is still early in his career and still to develop physically. Lampard, a team-mate of Sterling's at the World Cup last summer, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I think he is actually quite a brave boy to say, ""You know what I am not quite at my best here"". 'I am actually quite upset, not with the manager as such, but that the aftermath has been a lot of people criticising Raheem Sterling - who is probably in the top two or three players in our country and we need him to be at his best - for making quite a brave decision. 'I think we need to get behind him. Whether it is right or wrong, I don't know, but we are all individuals and he made that call.' One accusation thrown at Liverpool forward Sterling, who has become a key player for club and country over the past year, is that he is a well-paid professional, and therefore should be fit. Lampard does not see how that argument is relevant. The veteran midfielder said: 'I would take the money out of it. That is easily said and I hate it when money gets drawn into things, in terms of ""because he is getting paid (this) he should act like this"". It happens too much. Sterling (right) didn't start the Euro 2016 qualifier but earned the free-kicked that led to the winning goal . Lampard commended 19-year-old Sterling's bravery in telling Hodgson he was tired . 'The fact is, when that's is your job, when you are doing it regularly, you have to make calls. I think Raheem made a judgement call on that game alone. 'Hopefully he will get 100 caps and be very successful for England.' But Lampard, who was invited to speak to a live audience as part of a BBC report into the price of football, does think the game has an issue in terms of the wages being paid to unproven youngsters. Sterling may now be established at elite level and worthy of reward, but Lampard feels many others in their teens are not. The 36-year-old said: 'It is one of my pet hates in football at the minute, the wages we are giving out to boys who haven't quite made it, who haven't got to the top level where they are performing and entertaining at the top level. Sterling (left) speaks with Hodgson (right) at A Le Coq Arena in Tallinn ahead of the Estonia clash . Lampard says of Sterling: 'Hopefully he will get 100 caps and be very successful for England' 'I think we are maybe giving very big wages to young players who maybe aren't quite ready for it, and who can't handle it.' Lampard himself is currently on loan at Manchester City from their sister club New York City after being released by Chelsea last summer. He is due to move to the United States early next year to begin preparations for the 2015 Major League Soccer season, but his form at the Etihad Stadium has led to suggestions his loan could be extended. Lampard insists there is nothing to report on that front. He said: 'I am contracted here until January. I am enjoying every minute of training at this level and being able to get game time. That is as far as it goes at the moment. 'Speculation has come because of a couple of goals, but at the moment there is nothing to be said.'","Frank Lampard said he was 'upset' by criticism of Raheem Sterling .

"Liverpool fans are about to find out if it's mere coincidence that Daniel Sturridge's injury has triggered a run of poor form, or whether the 25-year-old striker really is the most important player at Anfield, ahead of Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard. Sturridge is due back on Sunday against QPR after a thigh injury controversially picked up on England duty at the start of September, with Liverpool facing Real Madrid three days later. And the facts are these. Before Sturridge's injury, Liverpool had won two of their three matches and scored six goals. A win ratio of 66 per cent and goal average of two per game. Daniel Sturridge is set to return from injury for Liverpool at QPR this weekend . Sturridge has been out of action since sustaining an injury while on England duty in September . The striker scored Liverpool's winner in their opening-game victory against Southampton at Anfield . Since his lay-off, Liverpool have won two of seven games and scored only eight goals despite signing Mario Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million. A win percentage of 28.57 per cent and goal average of 1.14 per game. No wonder Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is so looking forward to his England striker's return. 'Daniel is obviously a top talent whatever part of the game he comes into. And it helps to have his pace especially when you are 1-0 up and the opposition has to come at you,' says Rodgers, whose unhappiness with the way England handled his player's recovery time is well-documented and opened a sore between club and country that shows no sign of healing. The exploits of Luis Suarez last season and the hype surrounding Sterling since the World Cup has helped people forget it could be Sturridge who is the key man at Liverpool. Raheem Sterling scored on the opening day (left) but has struggled to recapture his form of last year . Mario Balotelli has struggled since his £16m move to Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer . He scored 21 times in 26 Premier League starts last season and his influence didn't stop there. A shooting accuracy of 49.41 per cent underlines his composure in front of goal in addition to his undoubted pace, movement and dribbling skills. Half of those shots on target resulted in goals. Particularly impressive is the number of opportunities he creates. Last season, he made 29 chances in league games. In the three matches he played this season, he scored once, had five other shots and created three chances. Without him, the form of Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Balotelli and Rickie Lambert has diminished with Jordan Henderson having to work overtime to be a creator as well as a midfield general. Balotelli has scored just one goal for Liverpool, in the Champions League against Ludogorets and missed this chance against Everton . Rickie Lambert has started just two games for Liverpool since his £4m move from Southampton . He is integral to Rodgers staying true to Liverpool's pass-and-move philosophy. Around 75 per cent of Sturridge's passes in the opposition half are accurate, impressive given the close marking he receives. Gerrard, who has played with a few decent strikers in his time, has said of Sturridge: 'His movement is fantastic. As a midfielder when you look up, you want to see one of your forwards coming in to feet for the easy option and you want to see one on the shoulder of the defence and in between the two centre halves.' Is it too simplistic to say Sturridge's imminent return will spark Liverpool into a revival and recapture last season's form when they nearly won the league? It is a lot to rest on one player's shoulders but the Kop will hope Sturridge will show straight away just how badly he's been missed.

"Liverpool's understudy keeper Brad Jones has hit back at Gary Neville's criticism of his team-mate Simon Mignolet as speculation continues to linger about Victor Valdes signing for the club. Neville gave a damning analysis of the Belgian's performance in Liverpool's 1-1 draw with rivals Everton on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show last month. But 32-year-old Jones, who is yet to feature for Brendan Rodgers' side this season, found criticism from the former Manchester United right-back and Sky Sports pundit excessive, especially considering he has no experience of playing between the sticks. Brad Jones, (second left) pictured in pre-season training  with fellow Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet . Mignolet was singled out by Gary Neville after Liverpool's 1-1 draw with Merseyside rivals Everton . He told the Liverpool Echo: 'I've never seen Gary Neville play in goal but he seemed to have a good opinion of it. 'Everyone has an opinion. What we work on in training is very match-specific and match-related. It's just one of those things and there are too many opinions knocking about nowadays. 'There are not too many people who speak highly of goalkeepers. They tend to want to put them down.' Mignolet, 26, has been unable to replicate the kind of form he showed last season, managing only one clean sheet in 10 league and cup games for the club so far this campaign. However, Jones has backed the Belgian to return to his best as Liverpool look to get back on track after a frustrating start to the season.

It is a shame that it happens because last season he produced some massive saves that helped us win games and people tend to forget them. 'Then the press jump on it and want to criticise him and say someone else is coming into the club and this and that.

The accuracy of their headline, 'When The National Team Helps Stewardess', is up for debate with their antics including mocking the flight attendant during her demonstration of safety procedures before take off and loud celebratory singing in aisle during food service.

The arms of some Slovak players are raised as they mock the blonde flight attendant as she does her job . But while some supporters weren't pleased with the behaviour, the vast majority commenting on the Facebook post were right behind their team as they continued their stellar wind-up to France 2016. Jan Kozak's side has plenty to cheer after two massive wins in the last international window, first the 2-1 win over Spain and then the convincing 3-1 result in Belarus on Sunday. A double from Napoli midfielder Marek Hamsik and another from Turkish club Bursaspor's Stanislaw Sestak put Belarus away for a valuable victory to capitalise on their upset over the 2010 World Cup winners.

Marjan Kovacic, a Bratislava-based Liverpool fan, is quoted in the Mirror voicing her disappointment with the national team: 'I understand that they are happy and have a right to celebrate, but they shouldn't be behaving in such a manner on board a flight?' But 'Super guys' is a more common cry among those commenting on the video. However,  Facebook user Karol Mar-ko Jurík has sympathy for the airline staff saying: 'The flight attendants should get extra pay for difficult working conditions.' With seven matches still to come in qualifying and plenty of chances for their fortunes to change, Slovak fan Robert Siran is looking ahead: 'Now I'm going to slowly buy tickets for Euro [2016].'","Slovakia beat Belarus 3-1 in the Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday .

"After suffering relegation with Doncaster Rovers last season, David Cotterill was desperate to escape playing in Sky Bet League One. Birmingham came to his rescue and the Welshman showed Championship class as he guided them to victory at Millwall. Cotterill set up Clayton Donaldson for the opener, scored a memorable free-kick and then crossed for Wes Thomas to add a match-killing third late on after Millwall had threatened a comeback. Birmingham's Koby Arthur moves forward with the ball for the visitors against Millwall . Birmingham veteran defender Paul Robinson battles for the ball with Millwall's Lee Gregory . Clayton Donaldon races through on goal as Millwall midfielder Edward Upson looks to catch up with him .

Man of the Match: David Cotterill . Attendance: 9,086 . ‘David has been our player of the season so far,’ said Birmingham manager Lee Clark. ‘Making chances for people, scoring and making chances for himself.’ Birmingham’s first win in nine lifted them to 19th and Clark’s relief was clear. They were second best in the first half but took the lead when Cotterill squared for Donaldson to tap in from a yard out after 32 minutes. And the winger excelled himself when his 35-yard free-kick looped and bounced to deceive goalkeeper David Forde. Two free headers squandered at the climax of this attacking spell cost Millwall the game. Chaplow again delivered well from the right and Gregory directed his straight at the keeper. And moments later, a Shaun Williams free-kick found Mark Beevers totally unchallenged, only for the defender to head straight at Randolph. Birmingham weathered the storm and rediscovered their attacking verve in the final 10 minutes. There was a massive let-off when Cotterill’s shot was spilt by Forde to Donaldson, who sent the rebound over the bar. But they weren’t so lucky on 84 minutes when Cotterill, capping a fine personal performance, crossed from the left for substitute Thomas to sew up the points. It was the cue for a boos and a mass exodus from the home faithful who, like their manager, have plenty to be fretting over at the moment. ‘I was lower than a snake’s belly on Saturday night (after losing to Fulham),’ Clark added. ‘But if we play like we can play, we’ll soon feel better about ourselves.’ Donaldson celebrates putting Birmingham ahead against Millwall at the New Den .

"Russell Slade watched from the stands as Cardiff ended their victory drought with a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Sean Morrison had put the Bluebirds ahead only to bring the visitors level by putting through his own net early in the second half. But Anthony Pilkington's excellent control and right-foot finish gave the Welsh club the spoils for the first time in seven games. Cardiff caretaker duo Danny Gabbidon and Scott Young led Cardiff to victory for the first time in six games . Josh Murphy celebrates with Nathan Redmond as Norwich make it 3-1 at Blackpool on Saturday . Two goals in a minute from Lewis Grabban and Josh Murphy ensured Norwich came from behind to beat Blackpool 3-1 at Bloomfield Road and move to the top of the Championship table. The hosts took the lead through Nathan Delfouneso's close range finish on 46 minutes, but a Donervon Daniels own goal levelled, before Grabban notched on 80 minutes and Murphy sealed the win 60 seconds later. And Norwich replaced Nottingham Forest on top of the Championship after Brighton held them to a goalless draw at the City Ground. The Reds have beaten Brighton only once in the last eight meetings between the two sides - and Stuart Pearce's side rarely looked like adding to that tally on Saturday. With Norwich's win at Blackpool, Forest slipped down into second place in the table, following a game in which they rarely found their attacking threat.

Matej Vydra and Daniel Tozser put the Hornets 2-0 up at the break but Rudy Gestede and Ryan Tunnicliffe responded in the second half for the hosts to earn a point. Wigan's abject away form continued as they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Bournemouth - their fourth defeat in five league games on the road this campaign. Chris Martin bagged a brace as Derby recorded a second successive away win, beating Bolton 2-0, while two goals in the opening six minutes helped Ipswich beat Rotherham by the same scoreline as they recorded a fourth league win in a row.","Russell Slade watched on as Cardiff won for the first time in six games as they saw off Sheffield Wednesday at home .

"Nottingham Forest failed to score for the first time this season after being held to a goalless draw against Millwall, but remain top of the Championship. Forest had been on fire this season with 20 goals in nine games – including five against Fulham midweek – but Millwall finally put an end to their goal-scoring run. In the end the league leaders were fortunate to come away with a point from this feisty encounter. Millwall's Nadjim Abdou (left) vies for the ball with Nottingham Forest's Michael Antonio .

Millwall's Martyn Woolford shot wide from just six yards out and Mathias Ranegie saw a first-time shot, which he reached at a stretch, saved by Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow's out-stretched leg from point-blank range. The closest the away side came to scoring was when Michaeil Antonio swung in a cross from the left on 31 minutes which caught out David Forde in Millwall's goal and was creeping in under the bar, only for the keeper to claw the ball out. Hot-shot Forest forward Britt Assombalonga could've won it late on, too, but his header from close range lacked power and Forde was able to just keep the ball from crossing the line. It took until the 51st minute for the first booking to arrive, which was a miracle considering the two sides had mainly been kicking lumps out each other until that point. Another followed two minutes later, then another two more after that. Henri Lansbury, Michael Mancienne and Mark Beevers all went into the book. The game finished with five bookings in total, but not a single goal. Forest still remain unbeaten this season, with three draws and six wins in all competitions, as they set the early Championship pace.

"Tragedy: Graham Smith was driven to suicide after he was falsely accused of child abuse, his inquest heard . A distraught father leapt to his death after he was falsely accused of child abuse, an inquest heard today. Graham Smith, 56, became depressed in November last year after he was accused of sexually assaulting a young girl more than 20 years ago. Even after a police investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing, Mr Smith, who had already tried to kill himself twice after the accusations were made, never recovered mentally from the trauma. He was driven to suicide in June this year, jumping from the Humber Bridge in Hull - and it was five days before his body was found, washed up on the sandbanks on the river. An inquest at Hull Coroner's Court heard how Graham wrote a suicide note, before cycling to the Humber Bridge from the city centre home he shared with his teenage daughter. His brother Michael, who last saw Graham on the Sunday before his death at a family barbecue celebrating Father's Day, said: 'After the allegations, he became a hermit. He wouldn't go out, he thought people were looking at him and pointing. 'He said he was scared of the daylight, that he liked it when it was night and no one could see him. 'We didn't expect him to turn up, because he had, we thought he might have turned a corner, but now I think he came to say bye when the whole family was together.' Graham, of Hull, East Yorkshire, had twice gone to the accident and emergency department of Hull Royal Infirmary, saying he had suicidal thoughts and was in need of help. On both occasions, he was seen by the mental health team but his reluctance to give details made him difficult to assess. It was decided that he should contact his GP to discuss receiving treatment for depression. The second time he went to the hospital, he asked to be sectioned. However, when a social worker later visited his home, Graham said he was much calmer and no further action was taken. Upset: Mr Smith had wrote a suicide note before cycling from the home he shared with his daughter to the Humber Bridge (pictured) and killed himself . His former girlfriend, and the mother of his child, Marie Burgess, said he had tried to deal with his depression. She said: 'He did try to get back into the swing of things but it would only last a day or two and then he would go downhill again.' His daughter, Kirsty, told the court how his mental state had deteriorated. She said: 'I remember Christmas was not like it usually was. He would normally buy all the Christmas presents early, but he left it right until the last minute. All his motivation was gone.' The coroner, Dr Paul Marks, recorded the cause of death as severe chest injuries caused by the fall from the bridge into the water. As he had been in the water for so long, Graham had to be identified using his dental records. Dr Marks reached a conclusion of suicide and said: 'It is particularly tragic that a grave and unfounded accusation of sexual misconduct was brought against him. 'His conduct remains unblemished but, sadly, despite being exonerated, his mood failed to improve and he took his own life.'

"Author Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during the 2013-14 season, Pep Guardiola's first in charge of the Bundesliga giants. In his new book Pep Confidential, Perarnau uses his behind-the-scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into Guardiola's debut campaign in Germany. In this extract he writes about Bayern's dramatic Super Cup victory against Chelsea in Prague, a win which Guardiola credits as being hugely important to his side's progression. Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery (centre) lifts the 2013 Super Cup after a penalty shootout win against Chelsea . How Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich took Manchester City apart at the Etihad with all the style of Barcelona . Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid was the 'biggest f***-up' of his life as a coach . Pep Guardiola admits that he could see himself managing Manchester United one day (and he turned down Manchester City and Chelsea for the Bayern Munich job!) It's a feverish, tense, agonising final. Bayern equalise 51 seconds after the official 120 minutes have been played. Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson has added one minute for stoppages, and there are nine seconds to go when Javi Martinez, a player who only three days ago was booked in for surgery, only for Guardiola to cancel those plans, scores for Bayern. Once again, they're going head-to-head with Chelsea in a penalty shootout, and everyone's thoughts turn to the Allianz Arena, one year ago. That day the English team beat Bayern in the Champions League final, in a penalty shootout. This could be payback time but, given the option, Guardiola wouldn't have wished for penalties. In the last four weeks the men from Munich have scored only three of the five penalties they have taken. In the middle of all the euphoria Pep steps up to the plate, emotional but icily calm. He calls his people together in one big huddle. Everyone is there: doctors, physios, assistant coaches, players, substitutes and even the injured men, like (Bastian) Schweinsteiger. This is Pep at his brilliant best. The guy who rises to the big occasions and dazzles his men. Just as everyone is expecting him to mobilise his players with a call to arms of epic proportions, Pep tells them a simple story. Javi Martinez (right) scores a late equaliser in extra-time against Chelsea to force a penalty shootout . Spanish midfielder Martinez celebrates his goal in front of the Bayern fans at the Stadion Eden in Prague . Pep Guardiola takes a low stance to watch his Bayern side attempt to beat Premier League side Chelsea . The front cover of new book Pep Confidential . Relaxed and smiling, he pays no heed to the thousands of frenzied supporters around them. Apparently unaffected by the tension, he issues no battle cry, opting instead for an anecdote. About water polo. 'Lads, I don't know how to take penalties myself. I've never taken one in my life. But here's the best penalty taker in the whole world.' And he points to a figure half hidden, right at the back of the huddle. 'I'm talking about Manel [Estiarte]. He was the best water polo player in the world. He took penalties better than anyone. Hundreds of them. Water polo is like football. Only four out of every five penalty kicks hit the target, but Manel put them all away! He is the world expert on penalties.' Pep hasn't just managed to get the players' attention. He has completely changed the expressions on their faces. They had been waiting for war cries and motivational oratory, an adrenaline boost. What they receive, standing here in the midst of the clamouring, heaving mass of humanity that rocks the stadium, is a simple tale. (Daniel) Van Buyten and (Tom) Starke stand just behind Pep in their tracksuits, hugging each other; Doctor (Hans) Muller-Wohlfhart is beside them. (Toni) Kroos, (Philipp) Lahm and (Franck) Ribery are right at the front. (David) Alaba is leaning his elbow on (Thomas) Muller, also wearing a tracksuit, like (Arjen) Robben.

Matthias Sammer and Bastian Schweinsteiger are slightly separated from the main group and Manuel Neuer isn't here. He's off getting Toni Tapalovic's advice about the Chelsea penalty takers. Estiarte, too, has stepped back a few metres. The players are smiling. Silent but relaxed. They're enjoying the tone of this team talk. 'I've learned two things from Manel and his penalties, so listen up. These are the only two things you need to do now. 'Firstly, make up your mind immediately as to where you're going to put the ball and stick with that decision. I'll say it again. Decide now, and don't change your mind no matter what happens. Secondly, keep telling yourselves that you're going to score. Repeat it a thousand times and don't stop until after you've taken the penalty. Don't worry and don't change your minds.'

Hazard (right) is congratulated by team-mate Frank Lampard (left) after scoring for Jose Mourinho's side . Ribery (left) runs to celebrate scoring Bayern's first equaliser with a delighted Guardiola (right) 'What a team talk. Incredible!' Sammer says later. But Pep hasn't finished. He gives them his advice and then says: 'Lads, there's no list. You can choose whether or not to take one. You choose. You're all going to score anyway, so you decide who's taking them. Who's up for it?' Alaba is the first to step forward, Kroos lifts his left hand next, followed quickly by Lahm. Pep gives his captain one of his little taps on the cheek. Next, Ribery adds his name to the list and the coach slaps him encouragingly on the chest. It's Shaqiri's turn after that and he's rewarded with a 'Bravo, Shaq!' The players have come up with the list themselves, but what about the order they'll take them in? 'You sort that out. Take them in any order you want. Whatever you're comfortable with. It doesn't matter anyway, because they're all going in.' Romelu Lukaku (left) misses the decisive penalty as Neuer gets down low to keep the ball out of his net . The Belgium striker is left with his hands on his head after failing to beat Germany's No 1 from 12 yards . They decide to take them in the same order they volunteered. The referee indicates that it's time and they all turn away. Pep grabs Ribery and Lahm, stopping the whole group in their tracks. 'Just one last thing. Don't forget. You've decided where you're putting the ball. Go and do it. And from now until you shoot keep telling yourself, ""It's going in"". With every step you take, say it, ""Goal, goal, goal...""' Of the seven players who had practised on Monday scoring 42 out of 42, only Kroos and Shaqiri are penalty takers today. Muller and Robben have both been substituted. Pizarro started on the substitutes bench and of course Schweinsteiger is injured. Of the players who had not taken part in the practice session, Alaba, Lahm and Ribery have been happy to volunteer. All five score. Neuer saves Chelsea's fifth penalty, taken by Romelu Lukaku, and Bayern have won the title that has so far eluded them. Neuer is congratulated by his team-mates after keepig out Lukaku's spot-kick to win the Super Cup . Ribery lifts the trophy as his team-mates are covered in confetti following their victory in Prague . Pep has his first trophy with Bayern and his third European Super Cup. Voted man of the match, Ribery dedicates the honour to his boss. 'I know how much this means to him, his first title. I also know about his old rivalry with Mourinho.' The Portuguese coach has left the pitch without congratulating Guardiola, in stark contrast to the obvious warmth between the two teams. An hour later,in a corner of the press room in Prague's Eden Stadion, Guardiola and Estiarte chat to a couple of Catalan journalists, Isaac Lluch, of Ara and Ramon Besa of El Pais. Pep is absolutely radiant. His eyes are shining with happiness, but above all there is a sense of enormous relief. 'The team needed this win. If we hadn't won, I don't know how we would have moved forward.'

The centre has taken more than three years - and the work of more than 1,000 people - to plan and build and City hope to have their first team established in the new base over the coming months. They trained there for the first time on Wednesday, with manager Manuel Pellegrini overseeing a session with some of the club's returning international players.

In his new book Pep Confidential, Perarnau uses his behind-the-scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into Guardiola's debut campaign in Germany. In this extract he covers Bayern's memorable performance against Manchester City in the Champions League, a night where Guardiola's men played like Barcelona to leave the Etihad with a 3-1 victory. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola (centre) watches his side take apart Manchester City in October 2013 . How Pep Guardiola told his Bayern Munich players a story about water polo to inspire them to Super Cup victory against Chelsea . Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid was the 'biggest f***-up' of his life as a coach . Pep Guardiola admits that he could see himself managing Manchester United one day (and he turned down Manchester City and Chelsea for the Bayern Munich job!) A grand total of 94 consecutive passes across three minutes and 27 seconds was emblematic of the 'taking of Manchester' – a night when Bayern conquered the Etihad Stadium and Pep Guardiola was finally able to smile in satisfaction. Inevitably, Bayern's play in this 3-1 win at the home of Manchester City drew to mind that of Barca on that remarkable night in 2010 when they hammered Mourinho's Real Madrid 5-0 at the Camp Nou. Those 94 passes marked a special moment in European football. The reigning champions were in an intimidating and formidable football stadium, City had bought notable reinforcements during the close season and their coach was the excellent Manuel Pellegrini – unbeaten at home until that point. Everything went right for Bayern for 80 sweet minutes. They were almost perfect – it was the game in which Pep proved to himself that he could get a team to play with the agility and quality of Barcelona without actually having those 'Azulgrana' players. All along, everyone, including Guardiola, had strenuously attempted to be clear that this wasn't supposed to be Barca 2.0. Franck Ribery (right) shouts with delight after scoring after just seven minutes to give Bayern the lead . Thomas Muller puts Bayern 2-0 ahead after rounding goalkeeper Joe Hart (left) at the Etihad Stadium . Muller celebrates his goal against Manuel Pellegrini's side during the group stage of the Champions League . The front cover of new book Pep Confidential . Arjen Robben summed up the feelings of the dressing room: 'We have produced 80 fantastic minutes but we aren't Barcelona MkII. I understand the comparisons but we don't have players like Xavi or Messi and we are, basically, different. We just want to dominate games by dominating possession.' Before speaking to the media, Guardiola is in the dressing room and takes time to phone a friend: 'Calm, and feet on the ground kiddo, but... what an exhibition! What an exhibition!' The Bayern goals come from their three forward players. (Franck) Ribery repeats his jink into space and fierce shot which squared the score against Chelsea in the Super Cup. (Thomas) Müller is terrific in losing Gael Clichy, who is over-run, in order to hit the second, after which Bayern string together a succession of passes over 40 seconds which leaves their rival in tatters. After (Toni) Kroos robs the ball back in the centre circle, Robben zig-zags around so much that he leaves Matija Nastasic sea-sick and scores with a right-foot shot. Pellegrini's side has just whipped Manchester United 4-1, but for a while it's like Bayern are making them dance. The shielding players, the formidable Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, are tied up by Ribery, Muller, Robben and (Bastian) Schweinsteiger over and over again. Along with Kroos, they give a recital in how to control possession, so disorientating the home players that the Spanish TV commentator, Gaby Ruiz, a specialist in German football, says: 'For the City players, what we are seeing is a little embarrassing. In fact, City are hauling up the white flag of surrender.' Nationality: Spanish Age: 43 . Clubs played for: Barcelona (1990-2001), Brescia (2001-2002), Roma (2002-2003), Brescia (2003), Al-Ahli (2003-2005), Dorados (2005-06) Major honours: 6 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 1 European Cup, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, 2 UEFA Super Cups, 1 Olympic Gold medal .

Then, in the 65th minute, Bayern lay on a gigantic rondo – a succession of passes which astonishes the world of football for its precision, speed and duration. During nearly three-and-a-half minutes, Bayern put together 94 passes involving all 10 outfield players. The team pass the ball for more than 200 seconds during which time the Etihad Stadium goes silent and the City players pretty much surrender. During this succession of passes the ball bounces off the English defenders twice, it is deflected by Clichy once and Jesus Navas wins it back once, but manages to keep it in City's possession for only seven seconds before (Philipp) Lahm robs it back with a brilliant tackle. All in all it's so spectacular that that very night various YouTube users put all three minutes 27 seconds up on the internet – sometimes with accelerated motion and accompanied by the theme tune from The Benny Hill Show. The giant rondo sums up what Pep has been asking his players to learn. The stats tell the story: Kroos passes the ball 18 times in this one action, then Robben (14), Schweinsteiger (13), Ribery (12), Rafinha (11) and Lahm (10). The defenders and centre forward have been involved slightly less – (Jerome) Boateng (7 passes), (David) Alaba (6), Muller (2), Dante (1). Dutchman Arjen Robben (left) puts the result beyond doubt with Bayern Munich's third and final goal . Bayern defender Jerome Boateng (sat down) is shown a red card after a professional foul on Yaya Toure . If the performances of the midfielders have been memorable (Kroos and Schweinsteiger both boast 95 per cent pass accuracy), the exhibition laid on by Muller leaves Pep speechless. Even more than fulfilling the essence of the false nine, he has given a fluid forward display, flitting in and out of all the attacking positions and popping up where he is least expected. Bayern's display unleashes a stream of praise. Michael Owen talks about his amazement at 'this great exhibition'. Franco Baresi, the former Milan and Italy captain, talks about 'a great level of super-positive football with everyone participating, and which is great fun to watch'. Rio Ferdinand says: 'It was hard to imagine the Bayern which won the treble improving but Pep is achieving just that.' The then Bayern president, Uli Hoeness, glows: 'For 80 minutes we played perfect football – the best football I've seen in my life.' During the post-match dinner which Bayern always lays on for players, coaches, sponsors and media, whether they win or lose, Kalle Rummenigge sums it all up in just a few words: 'A fiesta for the eyes.' Guardiola gives instructions to his players during Bayern's convincing win in Manchester . City striker Alvaro Negredo (second from right) scores a consolation goal for the hosts . From this point, Bayern begin to play the football their new coach wants. 'For everything to come off for us, the players need to run their legs off but to use the ball like they did when they were kids,' Pep explains. His players are bubbling with excitement. Ribery: 'They are little details but really important. Pep has boosted my confidence.' Schweinsteiger: 'He's got incredible ideas.' Robben: 'His arrival has been refreshing, a great stimulus. I'm 29 but under Pep I'm learning tactical concepts I'd never heard of before.' Right now we can't be absolutely certain if the Etihad is the turning point of Bayern's entire season, but it is unquestionable that October 2, 2013 will forever be a red letter day for Guardiola. When they land back in Munich the coach reads a quote from Lothar Matthaus in a newspaper: 'Tiki-taka has reached Bavaria.' Pep throws it in the bin.

"Northern Ireland's dreams of a first European Championship appearance are one step closer to reality after goals from Jamie Ward and Kyle Lafferty against Greece gave them a third successive Group F victory. That is the country's best ever start to any World Cup or European qualifying series and a table-topping nine points would surely have been beyond the most fanciful expectations of manager Michael O'Neill following a fifth-placed finish in his maiden campaign. But Northern Ireland are a different beast now, exemplified by Lafferty's hot streak of three goals in as many games - the latest a powerful run and finish from a predatory counter-attack. Jamie Ward (centre) celebrates Northern Ireland's opening goal in their win over Greece at Karaiskakis stadium in Piraeus . Northern Ireland players engulf Kyle Lafferty after the striker scored his third goal in their first three Euro 2016 qualifiers . Greece: Karnezis, Torosidis, Papastathopoulos, Manolas, Vyntra (Stafylidis 16'), Karelis, Tachtsidis, Maniatis, Samaras (Salpingidis 67'), Athanasiadis (Samaris 45'), Mitroglou. Subs: Glykos, Moras, Tziolis, Mantalos, Fortounis,  Mavrias, Giannoulis, Skondras, Kapino. Booked: . Northern Ireland: Carroll, Conor McLaughlin, McAuley, Hughes, Ferguson (Reeves 78'), Evans, Davis, Baird, Norwood, Ward (McGivern 59'), Lafferty (Magennis 73'). Subs: Mannus, McCullough, McGinn, McKay, Clingan, McCourt, Grigg, Ryan McLaughlin, McGovern. Goals: Ward, Lafferty . Referee: Stephane Lannoy (France) The name of record scorer David Healy is not taken lightly in Northern Irish circles, but having led the line superbly and found the net against each of Hungary, the Faroe Islands and now Greece, Norwich man Lafferty is making a persuasive case to be compared favourably. Ward also deserves immense credit, opening the scoring with a deflected effort in the eighth minute and setting up Lafferty's second with a tigerish interception that turned defence into attack in an instant. Greece, though, put in a ragged impression of a top seed and former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri is already fighting for his job, jeered from the field after taking a solitary point in his first three matches. Ranieri had been afforded a muted reception in the build-up, less indeed than former Olympiacos goalkeeper Roy Carroll on his return to Athens. There were also large swathes of empty seats in the stands, meaning a far cry from the white hot reception Northern Ireland had been promised. And they capitalised by applying early pressure, pushing the hosts back into their own half almost immediately. Lafferty had a sight of goal as early as the sixth minute when he went toe to toe with goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis in pursuit of Oliver Norwood's free-kick, eventually settling for a corner. Norwood's first corner delivery came to nothing but a fortuitous touch from a white shirt gave him a second chance. This time the ball skipped through the area to Ward, whose scuffed connection hit Loukas Vyntra and squirmed in at the far post with Karnezis appearing to react slowly. Ward's volley from a corner took a massive deflection to sneak inside the fast post after a corner . Michael O'Neill's men in green show their elation as they take the lead against Greece . The Northern Ireland fans were in fine voice, and didn't hold back with their costumes, as they turned out in force in Piraeus . Greece's Giannis Maniatis (front) holds off Northern Ireland's Steven Davis during their Group F Euro 2016 qualifier . It was the perfect start for O'Neill's men and the home response was initially untidy, overhit passes and snatched shots betraying frayed nerves. A wonderful ball over the top from Giannis Maniatis finally caught Shane Ferguson out but a heavy touch from Stefanos Athanasiadis and a covering challenge from Aaron Hughes removed the danger. With confidence renewed, Greece sprung a high defensive line in the 33rd minute, Giorgios Samaras breaking and playing in Nikos Karelis. Carroll charged out of his area to meet the forward who lifted the ball over the Notts County goalkeeper but comfortably wide. Lafferty finishes emphatically after a slick counter-attack under pressure from to double Northern Ireland's lead over Greece . The big No 10 (right) was a handful all night for Greece's defenders and got a deserved goal after 51 minutes . When a ball was released quickly from his defence, Lafferty beat Kostas Stafylidis (right) with ease before burying his shot . Northern Ireland almost burgled a second moments before the half-time whistle when Chris Baird's incisive pass freed Lafferty. He did brilliantly to ghost past last man Kostas Manolas and surprised Karnezis with a powerful strike that crashed against the woodwork. They did not have long to wait to establish that crucial two-goal buffer though, a predatory counter-attack finished in style by Lafferty six minutes into the second period. Greece had committed men forward having won a promising free-kick, but in the aftermath of the set-piece Ward gave Lafferty the chance to sprint on goal, hurling himself at a loose ball and somehow managing to pick out his team-mate 30 yards ahead. Lafferty had only to beat Kostas Stafylidis for a one-on-one chance and he negotiated the task with aplomb, turning inside and shrugging off his man before slotting calmly into the bottom corner. Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill is embraced by Norwich striker Lafferty after he scores his side's second goal . O'Neill celebrates with his players after they confirm their best start to a Euro qualifying campaign with three wins from three attempts . The finish was coolness itself but an adrenaline-fuelled celebration showed how much it meant to the Norwich striker. Lafferty, having now scored in all three of the qualifiers to date, was felled soon after by a rough tackle but returned to action after treatment. Greece were tepid when they needed to lift their performance, spraying the ball out of play on several occasions and producing a succession of wild attempts on goal. Panagiotis Tachtsidis looked likeliest to fashion a response but could not keep the ball down when he addressed two inviting free-kicks. Northern Ireland sent on three lots of fresh legs, Josh Magennis relieving a battered Lafferty from his duties in attack, Ryan McGivern shoring up the left flank and Ben Reeves handed a high-pressure debut in midfield. But by the end of the match those occupying the away end were still comfortably out-singing their hosts, who only turned up the volume to boo their side - and a rattled Ranieri - off the pitch.","Northern Ireland are undefeated after their first three Euro 2016 qualifiers .

"Martin O’Neill hailed his ‘never say die’ players after the Republic of Ireland pulled off their second successive Euro 2016 escape act. ‘It’s a precious point and it might be vital at the end of the campaign,’ said O’Neill after John O’Shea’s 94th minute equaliser in Gelsenkirchen clinched a 1-1 draw and rocked world champions Germany. A month after Aiden McGeady’s last gasp winner in Tbilisi, O’Shea, wearing the captains’ armband after Robbie Keane was substituted, gave his 100th appearance a gold-embossed crown. Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill was delighted with John O'Shea's late goal against the Germans . O'Shea scored in the closing stages of the match to hand his side a point against the Germans . Sunderland defender O'Shea was mobbed after he scored on his 100th appearance for his country . Click here to read Ian Ladyman's match report from Tuesday night's Euro 2016 qualifier at the Veltins-Arena . ‘To see John scoring, wearing the armband too, and it so late in the game, well it had everything,’ grinned O’Neill who has overseen an unbeaten start to Group D. ‘We’ve had two tough away games and we’ve got seven points. This result tonight keeps us going to next month when we play Scotland in Glasgow.’ ‘It was a great point for us, in the context of coming to the home of the world champions and getting something from the game,’ said O’Neill. ‘I still feel Germany are the strongest team in the group,’ he added. O’Neill felt his players deserved immense credit for their application, courage and deep reserves of self-belief as they climbed off the canvass to cancel out Toni Kroos’ opening goal in the 71st minute. O'Neill believes his players were worthy of a point against Joachim Low's Germany side . ‘We never gave up. It was a bit like Georgia. I never felt that we were out of the game despite their goal, which we should have done better with,' said O'Neill. ‘We were missing a couple of players too. And with respect, our injury blows would cause more problems than the German game.’ The result extended O’Neill’s remarkable career record against German opposition. As a player, he captained Northern Ireland to victory, home and away, against West Germany in the 1984 European Championships. He also won the European Cup twice, the first time on German soil, and the second against a German team, Hamburg. On Tuesday night, he penned another chapter in his 35-year Germanic success story. Joachim Low, the German coach, was clearly shook up by the dramatic ending which saw Germany, so long the hunters of world football, become the hunted. Low was disappointed at his side's lack of concentration in the final stages of the Euro 2016 qualifier . Nov 14: Scotland (A) Mar 29, 2015: Poland (H) Jun 13: Scotland (H) Sep 4: Gibraltar (A) Sep 7: Georgia (H) Oct 8: Germany (H) Oct 11: Poland (A) ‘It is extremely annoying for us not to have won the game,’ he sniffed. ‘Ireland basically had one single chance and in the final second of the game managed to equalise. ‘On the other hand if there’s anyone to blame, the blame has to be on us. ‘Something like that shouldn’t have happened in the dying seconds of the game. ‘We lost possession too easily, we misplaced passes, we passed too often back to (Manuel) Neuer. ‘Despite being 1-0 up we showed a lot of nervousness in the game, we stopped controlling the game and gave too many chances to the opponents. ‘We let them (Ireland) rise again,’ he stressed. ‘It was hellishly difficult against a team as defensively minded as Ireland. We created fewer chances than we did against Poland but we did at least score.’ The result has left Germany in a perilous position in Group D and Low needs to get the whip out. ‘We had hoped for more points getting out of October,’ he admitted. ‘Somehow it was we expected we would fall into a World Cup hole,’ he said. ‘You can see it in the players’ eyes; they are a little exhausted after long season, the World Cup, then a short pre-season. ‘There is a little bit missing from some of them but next year we will be better,’ he vowed. With Poland and Scotland sharing four goals, O’Neill is where he wants to be for his emotive Glasgow reunion on November 14. The stakes couldn’t he higher but the Irish squad have a wet sail at their back, and a manager whom they believe in at the helm.","John O'Shea scored in the 94th minute to hand his side a point .

"On a night when the Home Nations exceeded expectations, Northern Ireland’s 2-0 win in Greece stood out as the most impressive result of the lot. It sees them top Group F with nine points from nine having emerged successful from trips to two of the toughest destinations, including Hungary. A visit to Romania, two points behind in second, comes next month, but given their performances so far that should not mean any trepidation. It is little more than a year since Luxembourg embarrassed Michael O’Neill’s side to burst the bubble created by victory over Russia and a draw with Portugal.

Here Sportsmail details the country causing the biggest surprise in qualifying for Euro 2016 and the man behind it all. Roy Carroll – A familiar name between the sticks, the 37-year-old is enjoying a renaissance for club and country. The former Manchester United goalkeeper left Olympiacos in the summer to join Notts County in League One and had kept five clean sheets as they sit a point outside the play-offs. Conor McLaughlin – Everyone at Fleetwood Town knows who he is; a key reason the club gained promotion from League Two last season. Full back, 23, made his national debut in October 2011 but was only winning his sixth cap against Greece. Started out at Preston. Gareth McAuley – One of the dressing room leaders at West Bromwich Albion, but has lost his place to Craig Dawson this term. A late bloomer, he was at Lincoln City until 2006, before eventually getting his Premier League chance at The Hawthorns three years ago. Aaron Hughes – Veteran of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers, and now Brighton, the 34-year-old centre back is a dependable figure in the Northern Irish team. He has 93 caps and is one half of a defensive duo aged 68. Experience, is the word. Shane Ferguson – The left back has been at Newcastle since signing from Derry City in 2007 and has a smattering of Premier League appearances. On loan at Birmingham last season, he has yet to play a club game this campaign, leaving him fresh for national exploits. Northern Ireland's Corry Evans wins the ball from Greece's Kostas Stafylidis in their Group F match . Kyle Lafferty celebrates scoring Northern Ireland's second goal against Greece . Chris Baird – Now operating in a holding midfield role having played across the backline during a career spent largely at Southampton and Fulham. He signed for West Brom in the summer on a free having only made 16 appearances for Reading and Burnley last season. Yet to break into Alan Irvine’s side. Corry Evans – Younger brother to Jonny, the midfielder added grit in Greece. He was at Manchester United for six years but moved to Hull in 2011, before joining Blackburn last summer. During his time at Old Trafford, was nominated for reserve player of the year by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer alongside Tom Cleverley but was beaten by James Chester. Steven Davis – A buzzing, attacking midfielder perhaps in the form of his career having been given a freer reign at Southampton with the departure of Adam Lallana. Born in Ballymena, he joined Aston Villa aged 17 but is best remembered in Glasgow playing for Rangers. Oliver Norwood – Another from the Manchester United school of education, the player born in Burnley originally turned out for England at Under 16 and 17 levels. He switched to the Northern Ireland youth set-up in 2010, qualifying through family heritage, and now has 20 caps. Norwood plays for Championship club Reading. The Northern Ireland fans who made the trip to Greece were rewarded with an important win . Goalscorers Ward (left) and Lafferty (right) celebrate their goals and three points after the game . Jamie Ward – Another born this side of the Irish Sea, the 28-year-old travelled far before finding his feet at Derby, where he is an important player offering dynamism on the wings. Beginning at hometown club Aston Villa, he spent time at Stockport, Torquay, Chesterfield, and Sheffield United. Qualifying through his grandfather, he has always played for Northern Ireland internationally. Kyle Lafferty – The totemic striker is on a mean scoring streak for his country. He strong finish after a slick breakaway against Greece brought him a third goal in three qualifying games. He has yet to find the net for Norwich however, having signed from Palermo in the summer. When Rangers were demoted to the bottom rung of Scottish football he went to FC Sion in Switzerland, then to Italy. Manager - Michael O’Neill – Not to be confused with another M O’Neill who brought Northern Ireland cheer but is now doing his stuff south of the border, this 45-year-old is a relative coaching unknown. His playing career saw him at clubs such as Newcastle, Coventry, Reading and Wigan – as well as Portland Timbers across the Atlantic – but managing at Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers, where he won back-to-back titles, preceded his chance at the national job.","Michael O'Neill's side top group after a third win, this time over Greece .

"After Italy  struggled to see off lowly Malta on Monday night, the Italian papers have been scathing in their reviews of Antonio Conte's flops - with the exception of Southampton striker Graziano Pelle. Pelle, who earned his call-up after four goals in his first six Premier League games, scored the only goal of the game on debut to spare his side's blushes. And the Italian press hailed their new hero, with the Saints star dominating the front pages alongside criticism of the rest of the team. Graziano Pelle scores his first Italian goal on debut to rescue his side against 10-man Malta in Valletta . The Southampton star was clearly delighted with his impact, and was hailed as the hero in Italy . Graziano Pelle has made a brilliant start to life in England, scoring six times in ten appearances for club and country since leaving Feyenoord: . v Millwall  (Capital One Cup) v West Ham  (Premier League) v Newcastle x2 (Premier League) v QPR (Premier League) v Malta (Euro 2016 qualifiers) La Gazzetta dello Sport claim 'Pelle is there, Italy aren't', while Corriere dello Sport says it was 'Pelle, and that's it' for Italy. Even Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli congratulated the man who was picked ahead of him, posting a picture of Pelle to his Instagram with the message 'Well done Italy! Very well done Pelle, keep it up!' However, the rest of the Azzurri were treated less kindly, with Corriere describing the display as 'poor' and 'disappointing', and saved only by the debutant. Gazzetta point out that Malta were down to ten men for most of the game, yet Conte's side could only score one, but does concede that the points are the most important thing. Tuttosport is more complementary towards the national team, leading on the fact that, since he took over, Conte has picked up four wins from four. Mario Balotelli congratulated the man who has replaced him in Italy's squad saying 'keep it up' Pelle's goal, and the poor performance of the rest of the team, dominated the sports pages in Italy on Tuesday .","Graziano Pelle scores on debut as Italy scrape past Malta 1-0 .

"Southampton star Graziano Pelle could be the latest Italian striker to get the nod over the misfiring Mario Balotelli.

Mario Balotelli has endured a frustrating start to his Liverpool career and did not make the Italy squad . Azzurri boss Antonio Conte said Balotelli, like all Italians playing abroad, is being monitored closely . The former Juventus manager also defended his decision to drop Balotelli at the start of the international break. He said: 'Mario has started a new path. It's not an easy one and I believe he must be given the necessary time to adapt at Liverpool. 'We are following him just as we monitor all Italians that play abroad.

"Unsurprisingly, the Spanish press only has one thing on its mind this Saturday - the highly anticipated 'El Clasico' between Real Madrid and Barcelona. There are so many questions to be asked ahead of the global showpiece at the Bernabeu. Will Cristiano Ronaldo continue to eclipse Lionel Messi as the world's best player this season? Can Barcelona keep a ninth consecutive clean sheet? And, of course, will Luis Suarez make his debut? Marca simply lead with the headline 'Colossal' with claims that the ground will shake when these 'two giants of world football head-to-head in the greatest game on the planet'. Spain is gearing up for a ground shaking clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona in 'El Clasico' Luis Suarez, pictured in training with Neymar (L), is set to make his Barcelona debut at the Bernabeu .

There is also a quote from Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti saying 'I’m thinking of causing a surprise in the line-up' while his counterpart Luis Enrique warns 'The Clasicos should be heated... and enjoyable'. El Clasico is expected to attract a global audience of over 400 million fans . Clockwise (L-R) World stars Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi are expected to feature in what could be football's first £1billion game .

It has also been calculated that around 400 million people will watch the match from all around the world, with even Enrique's claim that 'We won’t be going there to take risks' failing to dampen expectation. In Italy, all of the leading sports papers are caught up in the re-opened row between Juventus and Inter Milan.

"Louis van Gaal’s start to his career at Manchester United may not have been as smooth as he had wished – but one Dutchman has thrived since arriving in England this summer. Ronaldo Koeman’s Southampton are flying high in the Premier League and are third in the table and go into Saturday’s clash with Stoke on the back of the 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland. The two Dutchmen have history having worked together at both Barcelona and Ajax and have been known to have had a frosty relationship.

The pair will meet for first time in December at St Mary’s and Koeman says it will be a special occasion. Speaking to The Mirror, he said: ‘We have worked together, first when I was his assistant at Barcelona and he was the head coach. ‘Then, during my period with Ajax as the coach, he came in after two seasons as technical director and we had some fights about the coaching structure, the way of doing things and that was a problem at the time. Koeman worked as Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona back in the late 1990s . ‘But it’s not like that anymore – it’s in the past. I have my job to do at Southampton, he has his job to do at Manchester United and, of course, it will be a little bit special when we play against them. ‘It will be two Dutch coaches facing each other in the Premier League and I hope the best for him and for United.

"Tottenham are edging closer to agreeing a groundshare with MK Dons while work is carried out on their new stadium and are also considering the prospect of playing up to three Premier League games at Wembley. Spurs have held formal talks with the League One outfit about the possibility of fulfilling their 2017-18 season fixtures in Milton Keynes. The stadium is almost 50 miles away from White Hart Lane but has good road and rail links from London.

AC Milan and Inter: Both called the San Siro home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two Milan teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them. West Ham made it clear they would not enter into negotiations with their rivals over the use of the Olympic Stadium, and backlash from supporters surrounding a move to Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium would prove to be too great. Any deal struck with Wembley would be dependent on the limitations imposed by Brent Council, with a maximum of 37 events per year currently allowed. Tottenham would have to seek permission from the Premier League if they were to seal a contract with MK Dons and the national stadium but there are no rules preventing clubs from playing in two separate locations during a campaign.

"Englsh football fans are choosing to watch football abroad due to the rising cost of a Premier League match day. Season-ticket holders at clubs like Borussia Dortmund are paying an average of just £9 a match compared to some English fans who regularly have to part at least four or five times that amount to see their favourite team. Alarmingly, the cheapest match-day ticket price across the top four divisions of English football has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last 12 months - nearly three times the rate of inflation - the BBC Price of Football survey revealed. English football fans are flocking to places like  Dortmund due to the increase in Premier League tickets .

Add the price of food and travel to the initial cost of the matchday ticket and the overall total of following a Premier League team can easily reach three figures for many supporters. Astonishingly, fans can fly out and enjoy a weekend trip to watch one of Europe's powerhouses for roughly the same price it costs to purchase a ticket to a Premier League game. 'We jump on the Channel Tunnel train,' one fan told the BBC. 'We make a weekend of it. With tickets, accommodation, transport, this trip will cost £65. When you think it cost me £51 to see the Arsenal game last season, you can see the benefits.' Some fans can travel abroad - paying for flights, accomodation and a match ticket - for the same price it costs to watch a Premier League match . Dortmund are keen to keep their prices down for fans and even refused PUMA's request to increase the price of the club's replica shirts. While prices continue to rise, Dortmund would prefer to ask sponsors for an injection of cash rather than their loyal followers. The Bundesliga side's marketing director Carsten Cramer said: 'Why are tickets cheap? Football is part of people's lives and we want to open the doors for all of society. We need the people, they spend their hearts, their emotions with us. They are the club's most important asset.' 'What is the economic sense for the club to increase the price by 10 cents? For the overall economic success of the club it is not important to increase the price of a litre of a beer. It is still money, but not a lot to the club. But it does affect our fans, if they are spending their money match after match.'

"Premier League and Football League ticket prices rise at THREE TIMES the rate of inflation as the staggering cost of following your team is revealed . Sports Minister Helen Grant has warned that clubs must not take fans for granted with their ticket prices, which a new survey shows have risen at twice the rate of inflation since 2011. Fans of Premier League clubs are also paying almost four times the amount for a season ticket compared with supporters in Germany, according to the BBC Sport Price of Football study. Arsenal topped the list for the most expensive matchday ticket at £97 and dearest season ticket at £2,013 . The average Premier League season ticket costs £508 compared to £138 in the Bundesliga - Bayern Munich fans can pay as little as £109.65, and in Spain Barcelona fans can get a season ticket for just £103.38. Arsenal is the most expensive club in Europe to watch via a season ticket, ranging from £1,014 to £2,013. The survey shows that the average price of the cheapest match-day ticket across all four divisions is £21.49, up 13 per cent since 2011, compared to a 6.8 per cent increase in the cost of living. Grant told BBC News: 'I can see why fans are cross. I'm cross, and I feel that clubs really must not take their fans for granted. Bayern Munich fans can pay as little as £109.65 for a season ticket to watch the German champions . 'To take a family of four to a Premier League match now, you're talking about £130. That is just not affordable for most families, so clubs really do need to look at this.' Manchester City have the cheapest season ticket in the Premier League, starting at £299. The cheapest match-day ticket in the Premier League has risen by 15.8 per cent, 31.7 per cent in League One and 19 per cent in League Two. Only in the Championship has it dropped - by 3.2 per cent. Chelsea have the highest-priced cheapest match-day ticket of all Premier League clubs . Arsenal have dropped their most expensive match-day ticket from £126 last year to £97. Chelsea have the highest-priced cheapest match-day ticket of all Premier League clubs - prices at Stamford Bridge begin at £50. At QPR, where adult tickets can cost as much as £70 for Category A matches, chief executive Philip Beard said his club's priority lay in filling their ground and their prices were fixed accordingly. Rangers also offer tickets to Category C matches from as little as £25 at Loftus Road - whose capacity of 18,100 is the smallest in the Premier League, leading to plans to relocate to a new stadium in the nearby Old Oak area. Sports Minister Helen Grant has warned that clubs must not take fans for granted . Beard told BBC London: 'We liaise with fans on pretty much everything and when it comes to ticket prices, we want to be fair. 'The most important thing is that every single seat at Loftus Road is filled for every single game.' Derby and Sheffield Wednesday both boast £10 match-day tickets - the cheapest in English football and only matched by Southport in the Conference. The study also shows the average price of the cheapest match-day ticket in Scotland's football's top flight has increased by almost eight per cent since 2011 - from £18.92 to £20.42.","Helen Grant says government is 'cross' about ticket prices .

"Rugby bosses will on Thursday unveil a plan to tackle the threat posed by concussion. Players, support staff and referees in the professional game will have to complete an online course or face fines or suspensions, in what is another victory for the Mail On Sunday’s concussion campaign. ‘There will be a process of fining in place for non-completion,’ said Corin Palmer, Premier Rugby head of operations. All people involved in professional rugby, including players, coaches and referees, must do a new online course on concussion so everyone is on the same page for incidents such as this with Saracens' Charlie Hodgson . ‘After 14 days if it is still not completed the fine will be doubled. Then the right to coach, play or indeed officiate will be taken away until they have completed it.’ Campaigners have called for medical staff to be allowed to make decisions without being pressured by coaches. ‘In the old days concussion was a badge of honour and you played on without knowing really what was wrong,’ said Harlequins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘Those days are gone.’ The deadline for the online course to be completed is December 11, after which sanctions will be imposed.

"Brian Moore and Gary Neville this week became the latest high-profile former international sports stars to back the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign. Former England rugby international Moore, now a highly respected television and radio commentator, praised the work done by the paper in promoting head-injury awareness and called for fellow commentators to stop trivialising incidences of concussion. Speaking at a concussion forum held by the British Association of Sports Lawyers at Chelsea’s football ground Stamford Bridge, former solicitor Moore said: ‘There have been a number of factors which have seen the issue of concussion gain so much attention but, when it comes to UK sport, the Mail on Sunday’s campaign has been the driving force. Former England rugby star and commentator Brian Moore (left, with referee Nigel Owens and Michael Lynagh) has joined Gary Neville in throwing his support behind the Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign . Moore, here in his heyday for England taking on the Soviet Union, says commentators must take concussion seriously and not trivialise head injuries as 'just a bang' ‘As we learn more, it’s vital that commentators take this issue seriously and stop saying silly things like ""it’s only a bang"" when someone suffers a concussion.’ While Moore hailed the Mail on Sunday’s campaign, former Manchester United star Neville has thrown his support behind the ‘Justice for Jeff’ campaign, which began in April after this newspaper revealed potentially life-saving research promised by football’s authorities following Jeff Astle’s death was never completed. Astle died aged 59 in 2002 suffering early on-set dementia – which has since been diagnosed as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy also found in American Footballers, rugby players and boxers – and last week Neville attended a meeting with the former West Bromwich Albion’s striker’s family and Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor to urge further action. FA chairman Greg Dyke recently committed to carry out research into the link between head injuries and early onset dementia in football and the PFA has now followed suit.

"Rugby bosses will this week unveil wide-reaching measures to tackle head injuries, with the introduction of compulsory concussion education for all players, coaches and referees. The initiative, prompted by the Mail on Sunday’s long-running concussion campaign and backed by the Rugby Football Union, Rugby Players’ Association and Premier Rugby, will be unveiled at the Twickenham Stoop on Wednesday and brings concussion education in line with other serious issues in the game such as doping and illegal gambling. Concussions are common in rugby, thanks in part to moments like this, in the Super League final . It's been a long time coming but British sports associations are finally taking the issue of concussion seriously . Chris Ashton concussed on the field while playing for England . The Mail on Sunday launched the concussion campaign in September 2013 and has already had a strong impact .

"Graeme Souness insists there is no way back for Mario Balotelli at Liverpool and that this has been his last chance at a top club. The striker has been lambasted for swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time when Liverpool were being thrashed 3-0. But it is not the first time he has made himself the target of stinging criticism in only two months since he made a £16million switch from AC Milan. Souness is adamant that Balotelli will not be handed another chance at a top European club . The Italian striker has yet to score a Premier League goal since his £16million move to Merseyside . Balotelli defied manager Brendan Rodgers' orders to applaud away fans after their shock 1-0 defeat at Basle in the Champions League and supporters' patience is starting to wear thin with his work-rate and lack of commitment on the field. Asked if Balotelli can recover from this latest mistake, former Liverpool captain Souness said: 'I don't think so. You have to look at the quality of the people who've tried before and failed and held their hands up and said they can't do it. 'Roberto Mancini twice had a go at it, with Inter Milan and Manchester City. Jose Mourinho quickly made his mind up that he wouldn't want to work with him again while he was at Inter. Balotelli chats to Real Madrid centre back Pepe as the two sides walk off the Anfield turf at half-time . Balotelli swaps shirts with opponent Pepe as he wanders down the tunnel before being replaced at the break . 'Cesare Prandelli said after the World Cup he got it wrong, he said he made a mistake and shouldn't have taken him with Italy. 'There has been a criticism from day one. It was a very brave move by Rodgers. He obviously felt his managerial skills could stop the problem. It's not worked for him and it's not worked for the football club.' Souness is adamant that Balotelli, still only 24, will not be handed another chance at one of the big clubs in Europe's top four leagues. Balotelli has played for some of world football's heavyweights - Inter, Manchester City, AC Milan and now Liverpool - and has won three Serie A titles, one Premier League title, a Champions League medal and numerous other trophies. But Souness added: 'This is his last chance at a big club in one of the big leagues. He could go to Russia or somewhere like that. That's what he's looking at, he's looking down the barrel of that right now.'

"What you are about to read is not about the naivety of swapping shirts, the departure of a world class forward or injury problems. Though Mario Balotelli, Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge are all themes impacting on Liverpool’s season, one issue dominates more than anything and simply must be addressed if the progress they had made is not going to be halted completely. It is their porous defence. Whichever way Brendan Rodgers looks at it, he cannot fail to see that the numbers are casting his team in a bad light: one clean sheet in 18 games, none since August 31, 48 goals shipped in 34 matches in all competitions since New Year’s Day. Liverpool players look dejected after they go 1-0 down at home to Real Madrid on Wednesday . Real  striker Karim Benzema (centre) rises high to head the ball into the net as the visitors go two goals up . Cristiano Ronaldo (right) fires the ball into the Liverpool net past diving Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet . Real Madrid became the seventh team since the turn of the year to breach Liverpool’s rearguard three times in a match but, for all the wonderful attacking talent they have, the Champions League holders did not have to engage overdrive to do it. When you have spent more than £60million on defenders and a goalkeeper since May 2013, without including wages, the results should be better, of that there can be no dispute. Here Sportsmail looks at the men in the firing line and their respective shortcomings. SIMON MIGNOLET . The Belgian has increasingly looked like his confidence is in tatters. He may be a good shot-stopper but shouldn’t that be a prerequisite of any No 1 in the Premier League? Goalkeepers need to be big, domineering characters who command their area but every time a high ball is hoisted into Liverpool’s box, he looks vulnerable. Top keepers, according to Roy Keane, are worth '12 points a season'. Is Mignolet making that difference? In a word, no. Simon Mignolet's confidence has been in tatters recently and he could not prevent this goal against QPR . Mignolet is a good shot-stopper but that should be a pre-requisite for a Premier League No 1 goalkeeper . GLEN JOHNSON . When he is in top form, Johnson is a fine player and makes a big difference to Liverpool’s team but he is not yet in top gear after an injury-enforced lay off. He gave Cristiano Ronaldo too much freedom last night and there must be a doubt on how long he will remain a fixture in the starting line-up. He is free to talk to clubs about signing a pre-contract deal in January and Javier Manquillo is pushing for a place. Glen Johnson is a fine player on top form but his performances this season have not been up to scratch . The England full back's place in the side is coming under threat from Javier Manquillo this season . MARTIN SKRTEL . He is the best defender at the club and was excellent last season but this year he has not reached similar heights. If you asked 100 people to pick Liverpool’s best back four, he would probably feature in 90 per cent of the selections but he is finding it difficult at the moment as the way the team are set up to play means the defence can be overexposed. Needs to exert his authority more at set pieces. Martin Skrtel is the best defender at Liverpool but he is struggling so far this season to reach his heights . The partnership of Skrtel (left) and new signing Dejan Lovren is just not working so far and must improve . DEJAN LOVREN . If ever there was a conundrum, it surrounds Lovren. Ask his current team-mates and those he played with at Southampton and they will tell you he is an outstanding defender, one who will not let anything past. Rodgers labelled him the successor to Jamie Carragher and leader of Liverpool’s defence when he arrived for £20m in August but he has been culpable for a number of goals conceded and looks to be trying too hard. The jury is most certainly out. Dejan Lovren (left) struggled to deal with Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team-mates on Wednesday . The Croat signed for £20m this summer but he is struggling to impose himself and seems to be trying too hard . ALBERTO MORENO . One outstanding performance apart at Tottenham, it has been a bumpy introduction for the young Spaniard to English football as he has tried to find his feet. Looks to have all the tools going forward – speed, skill and good use of the ball – but defenders, first and foremost, are there to prevent the opposition from scoring and he needs to recognise when he should stick and when it is right to twist. Alberto Moreno (right) has endured a difficult start to his life as left back at Liverpool football club . The defender enjoyed a wonderful game against Tottenham Hotspur but has struggled regularly since . AND THE REST . It is not just about that five. MAMADOU SAKHO, for instance, is clearly not in favour and has not justified his £18m move from Paris Saint-Germain. Similarly, KOLO TOURE is nothing other than back-up. JOSE ENRIQUE’S form has dipped and dipped ever since a bright first season. JAVIER MANQUILLO, to his credit, has been dependable, while it should be noted that JON FLANAGAN has been a big miss during his spell out injured. He is a proper defender. Kolo Toure (left) and Mamadou Sakho have also failed to show they can be the permanent answer either . Jon Flanagan (right) has been injured this season and has proved to be a huge miss for Liverpool . BUT REMEMBER . While it is clear the individuals in Liverpool’s defence are perform poorly, the team as a whole are too open. Rodgers might want to play a fluent brand of football but even the most stylish sides have been built on rock-solid foundations, attacking as a team and defending as one. If Liverpool’s season is not going to lurch from one setback to another, Rodgers has to find the answers as a matter of urgency. Too much is at stake. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers must get his defence right before the season as a whole disintegrates .","Liverpool conceded three goals for the seventh time in 2014 on Wednesday .

"Nestled in the heart of a dwarf galaxy 54 million light years from Earth is a black hole so big it makes up 15% of the star cluster’s total mass. The supermassive black hole, discovered at the centre of galaxy M60-UCD1, is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns. By comparison, the galaxy is 500 times smaller than the Milky Way, which itself has a black hole at its heart with a mass of just four million suns. an artist's impression of the supermassive black hole, discovered at the centre of galaxy M60-UCD1. It is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns. The finding suggests that huge black holes may be more common than previously thought, and other ultracompact dwarf galaxies are likely to also contain similar supermassive black holes. A black hole is a region where matter has become so densely squeezed that not even light can escape its gravitational pull. Scientists believe M60-UCD1 may be the remnant of a larger galaxy that had its outer regions torn away after approaching too close to the monster-sized M60 galaxy, which it now orbits. A similar story could be behind the formation of other dwarf galaxies, which may also harbour super-massive black holes. Astronomers used the Gemini North eight-metre telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to investigate M60-UCD1. The dwarf galaxy orbits M60, a colossal galaxy containing a 4.5 billion solar mass black hole. M60-UCD1 is about 54 million light years from Earth, but just 22,000 light years from the centre of M60. The astronomers estimated the mass of the dwarf galaxy's supermassive black hole by measuring the speed and motion of stars in orbit around it. They found that the galaxy contains more mass than would be expected by the amount of starlight it emits. The stars at the centre of M60-UCD1 move at about 230,000 mph - faster than stars would be expected to move without the black hole. An alternate theory is that M60-UCD1 doesn't have a supermassive black hole, but instead is populated by a lot of massive, dim stars. But Dr Seth said the research team's observations with the Gemini North telescope, and analysis of archival photos by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealed that mass was concentrated in the galaxy's centre, indicating the presence of the supermassive black hole. 'We don’t know of any other way you could make a black hole so big in an object this small,' said lead scientist Dr Anil Seth, from the University of Utah. 'There are a lot of similar ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, and together they may contain as many super-massive black holes as there are at the centres of normal galaxies.’ Astronomers used the Gemini North eight-metre telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to investigate M60-UCD1. The dwarf galaxy orbits M60, a colossal galaxy containing a 4.5 billion solar mass black hole. M60-UCD1 is about 54 million light years from Earth, but just 22,000 light years from the centre of M60. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are less than a few hundred light years across compared with the Milky Way’s 100,000 light years. '[The finding] is pretty amazing, given that the Milky Way is 500 times larger and more than 1,000 times heavier than the dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1,' Dr Seth said. 'We believe this once was a very big galaxy with maybe 10 billion stars in it, but then it passed very close to the center of an even larger galaxy, M60, and in that process all the stars and dark matter in the outer part of the galaxy got torn away and became part of M60.' Dr Seth added, however, that the dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 may be doomed, although he cannot say when because its orbit around M60 isn't known. M60 is among the largest galaxies in what astronomers refer to as 'the local universe.' 'Eventually, [M60-UCD1] may merge with the centre of M60, which has a monster black hole in it, with 4.5 billion solar masses - more than 1,000 times bigger than the supermassive black hole in our galaxy. 'When that happens, the black hole we found in M60-UCD1 will merge with that monster black hole.' The supermassive black hole, (pictured) discovered at the centre of galaxy M60-UCD1, is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns. Scientists believe M60-UCD1 may be the remnant of a larger galaxy that had its outer regions torn away after approaching too close to another monster-sized galaxy, which it now orbits . The study – conducted by Dr Seth and 13 other astronomers – was funded by the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the German Research Foundation and the Gemini Observatory partnership, which includes the NSF and scientific agencies in Canada, Chile, Australia, Brazil and Argentina. The Gemini Observatory is an astronomical observatory made up of two 8.19-metre telescopes at sites in Hawaii and Chile. Together, the twin telescopes provide almost complete coverage of both the northern and southern skies. One telescope, called Gemini North, is located on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. This location was picked because it has a stable, dry, and rarely cloudy atmosphere above the 4,200-metre-high dormant volcano. The other telescope, Gemini South, is located at around 2,700 metres high on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachon. There are only two small regions neither telescope can capture near the celestial poles: Gemini North cannot point north of declination +89 degrees which Gemini South can't point south of -89 degrees. Ultracompact dwarf galaxies are among the densest star systems in the universe. M60-UCD1 is the most massive of these systems now known, with a total of 140 million solar masses. Astronomers have debated whether these dwarf galaxies are the stripped centers or nuclei of larger galaxies that were ripped away during collisions with other galaxies, or whether they formed like globular clusters - groups of perhaps 100,000 stars, all born together. There are about 200 globular clusters in our Milky Way, and some galaxies have thousands, Dr Seth continued. The astronomers estimated the mass of the dwarf galaxy's supermassive black hole by measuring the speed and motion of stars in orbit around it. They found that the galaxy contains more mass than would be expected by the amount of starlight it emits. The stars at the centre of M60-UCD1 move at about 230,000 mph – faster than stars would be expected to move without the black hole. An alternate theory is that M60-UCD1 doesn't have a supermassive black hole, but instead is populated by a lot of massive, dim stars. The astronomers estimated the mass of the dwarf galaxy's supermassive black hole by using the Gemini North telescope (pictured) to measure the speed and motion of stars in orbit around it. They found that the galaxy contains more mass than would be expected by the amount of starlight it emits . But Seth said the research team's observations with the Gemini North telescope, and analysis of archival photos by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealed that mass was concentrated in the galaxy's centre, indicating the presence of a supermassive black hole. The astronomers studied M60-UCD1 because they had published a paper last year showing the galaxy was an X-ray source and was extremely dense. The X-ray emissions suggest gas is being sucked into the black hole at a rate typical of supermassive black holes in much larger galaxies. The new research is published in the journal Nature.","M60-UCD1 is smallest galaxy known to contain a supermassive black hole .
It is said to have a mass equivalent to 21 million suns .
By comparison, Milky Way's black hole has a mass of four million suns .
M60-UCD1’s black hole accounts for 15% of the small galaxy’s total mass .
Finding suggests huge black holes may be more common than first thought ."
"Rory McIlroy promised to take nothing for granted after opening an enormous six-shot lead with another brilliant performance at The Open. The Northern Irishman shot a third-round 68 at Royal Liverpool and is closing in on a momentous piece of European golf history. Victory today would make him the first European to win three different majors since the Masters was founded in 1934 — and at the age of just 25.

"Joachim Low, the coach of Germany, took a leaf out of Sir Alex Ferguson’s book of football management when he appealed for Marco Rodriguez to referee strongly and 'clamp down on things' in the World Cup semi-final with Brazil. Low claimed that the refereeing standards in European football are better in a clear attempt to influence the Mexican referee. Rodriguez is another referee who was known as a strict disciplinarian before this competition, but he has opted for a liberal approach at the finals. VIDEO Scroll down for Brazil will raise their game - Loew . Poor: Germany coach Joachim Low believes the level of officiating at the World Cup has been sub-standard . Critical: Low has not been impressed with the brutality of some of the tackles at the World Cup . Attack: Low believes some of the tackles at the World Cup would not have been tolerated in Europe . VIDEO Brazil will raise their game - Loew . Low, whilst understandably concerned for the welfare of his technical German side, should make his appeal to the FIFA referees committee rather than make swinging statements intended to pressurise a match official already under pressure preparing to referee the biggest game of his career. However, Low, like the majority of observers, will have thought that appeal fruitless to a committee who deny having instructed the officials to take a low-key approach and to let the players take centre stage. Perhaps the wording is inaccurate as FIFA cannot 'instruct' on application of law but they can suggest and guide – and inference plays a huge part in such finals competitions. It is impossible to conclude otherwise when the strictest of referees currently on the world circuit, Carlos Velasco Carballo, waits for 40 free-kicks before he issues a single yellow card. Appointment: Marco Rodriguez missed Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini but will take charge of semi-final . Seeing red: Rodriguez sent off Italy's Claudio Marchisio in the same match . Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was quoted as saying that he wanted Brazil to 'toughen up' and rough-up opponents, and their performances against both Chile and Colombia have delivered on his wishes. These two powerhouses in world football have only faced each other once before in this tournament, the 2002 final which was refereed by the peerless Italian Pierluigi Collina. Rodriguez really doesn’t bear comparison to the superb Collina and will be well aware of the issues of handling such a huge game. However, Rodriguez does not lack confidence and was understandably absolved of any blame when missing Luis Suarez’ bite on in Italy’s Chiellini. The big question before the match is: will FIFA continue with their desire to allow players to commit almost countless fouls before being cautioned or will they expect the referees to afford the skilful players the protection they deserve? Rodriguez will know he cannot win as Low’s statement makes it clear that Germany want a change in approach whilst Brazil are benefiting from the leniency afforded them through the tournament so far. FIFA, in attempting to make this a tournament in which the match officials are unnoticed, have failed and run the risk of allowing the dark arts to win out. In the last final they were fortunate that Spain had enough skill to defeat the Netherlands despite their over-physical approach. This time they might not be so lucky and more of the World’s top players could just get hurt.

"Mario Balotelli was slammed after swapping shirts with Pepe at half-time during Liverpool's Champions League humbling by Real Madrid on Wednesday night. The striker, knowing he was about to be taken off by manager Brendan Rodgers following a poor 45 minutes, decided to grab himself a wearable souvenir a little earlier than is custom.

"As he walked through the tunnel en route to the first tee Justin Rose gave a fist bump to the mural that showed Seve Ballesteros striking a similar pose. After hitting a miraculous shot out of the bushes on the 13th to within two feet of the flag the 34-year-old Englishman turned to the accompanying camera and remarked ‘A bit of Seve for ya!’ These evocations of the great Spaniard might have been out of character for a normally undemonstrative man but Rose’s performances over the past three days seemed to be infused by the spirit of Ballesteros, a man so famously enthused by the Ryder Cup. Justin Rose was Europe's MVP over the weekend, picking up four points from five matches . VIDEO Ryder Cup highlights . By the end of it all last year’s US Open champion had contributed almost 25 per cent of Europe’s points to become, in the phraseology of their opponents, the MVP: most valuable player of the event. On the final day others made more eyecatching contributions than the hard-earned half he managed against Hunter Mahan, who he finally clawed back having gone four down after the sixth. That he outmatched the American’s seven birdies with eight of his own told of the quality of the match. Later he acknowledged the debt owed to Ballesteros but also cited as an inspiration the more unlikely figure of Sweden’s Peter Hanson, who played on the team in Medinah. Rose kisses the trophy he worked so hard to help win, with European captain Paul McGinley watching on . Rose said he was inspired by Peter Hanson who fought hard on the final day of the singles in 2012 . ‘On the front nine I was basically trying to be Peter Hanson,’ said Rose. ‘He was six down to Jason Dufner on the Sunday two years ago but ended up taking him all the way up the 18th. ‘That sent an important message to the rest of the team that day, that we were still in there fighting, and I wanted to send the same message.’ The mild-mannered Rose does not have the flamboyance of Ballesteros or the in-your-face quality of Ian Poulter but this team format sees him transformed into fist-pumper in chief, and he is quietly assembling a Ryder Cup record to stand with any of them. Today it reads nine wins, two halves and three losses after his four points that will go down as one of the finest European performances in the competition over the past 30 years. Hanson (right) and Rose (second right) celebrate in Medinah after the remarkable comeback win . The Englishman produced one of the finest displays by a European, complete with uncharacteristic emotions . Had he not been paired with Martin Kaymer on Saturday afternoon, or Mahan not been so impressive yesterday, then his tally might have been of more historic proportions. His high-water mark came on Saturday morning when, in completing three wins out of three with Henrik Stenson, he was sinking putts with the ease of a man placing litter in the bin. He could have been excused feeling weary yesterday, especially going so far behind, but instead responded with a run of five straight birdies. And then there was the amazing save at the 13th, which was where Ballesteros especially came in. ‘When I walked up to my ball it was in the gorse bush and I thought, “I’m dead here”, and all I could do was try to punch out an eight-iron. 'Seve was at his best when he was trying to make something out nothing, I’ve been watching footage of him doing that my whole life so that’s why I thought of him. Rose channeled the spirit of Seve when playing from difficult positions as he led Europe to glory . ‘It just felt so Ryder Cup, and how he used to battle away and never give up. He is still fresh in our memory and has a big impact on us. Here his was the last image you would see before walking onto the first tee, and we had a big picture of him in our team room as well.’ What eternally fascinates about a competition that wraps up an essentially individual pursuit into a team format is that it can make some grow beyond their stature and diminish others. While Rose’s collegiate temperament makes him a natural fit, there were fears beforehand that the more introverted Victor Dubuisson might struggle with all that it entails. Yet Dubuisson emerged with two-and-a-half points from three, and looked like he and Graeme McDowell had been playing together since childhood. Others, such as Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson, showed that veering from their norm of merely looking after their own games is not conducive to producing their best. Stephen Gallacher found the experience overwhelming on the front nine of his first outing, although he fared better yesterday and was unlucky to be drawn against a determined Phil Mickelson. Bubba Watson looks glum after the world No 2 lost all three of his matches at Gleneagles . Rickie Fowler has still never won a match at the Ryder Cup after losing heavily to Rory McIlroy . Fowler has now played for eight points in the Ryder Cup and failed to win any of them, becoming only the fifth man in the last 10 editions not to register a full point from five matches, although he did manage three halves. Watson is a more striking example, and in going 0-3 at Gleneagles has now lost eight of his 11 matches, despite having won two of the last three Masters. ‘I guess I’m too nice,’ he said. That was once the label attached to the charming Rose, although it is now well and truly defunct.","Justin Rose fought back from behind to pick up vital half point on Sunday .

"Session 1: Europe 1½ USA 2½ . Pivotal moment: Ian Poulter’s missed putt from two feet on the first green signified that it was not going to be an easy morning for Europe. Match of session: Rickie Fowler and the previously unsung Jimmy Walker bravely clung on after being down for the first 17 holes to get a last-ditch birdie and halve their match against Thomas Bjorn and the struggling Martin Kaymer. Stat of the session: At 21 and 24 years old respectively Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed became the youngest ever pairing at a Ryder Cup — and they won. American captain Tom Watson congratulates Patrick Reed after his and Jordan Spieth's win on Friday . Rookies Spieth and Reed were the USA's best players at Gleneagles, as well as the youngest pairing . Shot of the session: Walker’s chip in from off the green on the 16th that brought the Americans back to within a single hole. Quote of the session: Ian Poulter: ‘Obviously my record has been pretty good and that has taken a dent. But this is a team game, it’s not just about singling one or two guys out.’ Session 2: Europe 5 USA 3 . Pivotal moment: Rory McIlory holing his 40-foot putt on the 17th to make birdie to give him and Sergio Garcia a chance of levelling it on the 18th. Match of the session: McIlroy and Garcia were behind from the 11th, but by winning the last two holes to gain a half landed a major psychological blow on the Americans in the last game of the day. Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia share a high five as they came back to win a vital half point in the foursomes . McIlory and Rickie Fowler shake hands after the Northern Irishman and Garcia staged a pivotal comeback . Stat of the session: Every single pairing bogeyed at least one hole at a stage of the match when the greens were arguably at their most difficult. Rory McIlroy has played in 14 straight Ryder Cup sessions since his debut in 2010. Shot of the session: Garcia’s powerful recovery from the rough on the 18th after McIlroy had driven into the trees, landing it on the far side of the green to set up the birdie chance. Quote of the session: Graeme McDowell on his partner Victor Dubuisson: ‘Victor and I were fired up, and I’m telling you — he is Europe’s next superstar.’ Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson formed a formidable pairing for Europe during this Ryder Cup . Session 3: Europe 6½ USA 5½ . Pivotal moment: Henrik Stenson holing his downhill seven-foot putt on the seventh that brought him and Justin Rose back to one down and sparked their remarkable birdie spree. Match of the session: Stenson and Rose’s 3&2 win over Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar rewrote some of the record books. The Americans played outstandingly but the Europeans were irresistible. Stat of the session: In the Stenson/Rose match on quicker greens an all-time high total of 21 birdies were made over 16 holes with the European duo reeling off 10 consecutive birdies from the seventh hole onwards. Justin Rose, unbeaten throughout the weekend, was simply magnificent on Saturday morning for Europe . Shot of the session: Poulter finally found his traditional Ryder Cup form and celebrated appropriately on the 16th when he chipped in from behind the greenside bunker to bring him and McIlroy back all square. Quote of the session: On being told Stenson supposedly had a bad back, Watson: ‘What? I didn’t see it. He beat me pretty good two days in a row.’ Session 4: Europe 10 USA 6 . Pivotal moment: Reed missing an 18-inch tiddler on the 16th when only a five was needed to go one up. The cost was dear as Europe halved the match eventually on the 18th. Match of the session: The dynamic duo of Reed and Spieth led Kaymer and Rose most of the way before Rose (who else?) holed his eight-foot putt on the last to gain a half. Rose and Kaymer celebrate as they came back to pick up a crucial half point for Europe in session four . Stat of the session: A measure of the potency that McDowell and Dubuisson found in their partnership was that they had the only bogey-free round of the eight pairs in action. Paul McGinley has a perfect Ryder Cup record, winning three times as a player (2002, 2004, 2006), twice as a vice-captain (2010, 2012) and once as captain (2014). Shot of the session: The impressive Dubuisson’s beautifully flighted tee shot on the sixth to within five feet, allowing McDowell to put them a commanding four up against Walker and Fowler. Quote of the session: Tom Watson on Phil Mickelson’s angst at being left out of the afternoon foursomes: ‘He lobbied again. He texted me and said “Give us a chance”. I had to tell him no.’ Session 5: Europe 16½ USA 11½ . Pivotal moment: McDowell’s stirring comeback against Spieth was symbolically and motivationally huge, and his brilliant birdie on the 11th encapsulated it. Graeme McDowell splashes out of a bunker during a remarkable comeback win against Spieth . McDowell's win, from a difficult situation, gave Europe the momentum they needed on the final day . Match of the session: McIlroy v Fowler. It wasn’t close, but it set the tone of the day and the event as the world No 1 blitzed the USA star challenger. Stat of the session: Four eagles in the 12 singles equalled the four in the 16 previous matches combined. Three were by Europeans; all the eagle scorers won their matches. Shot of the session: With due respect to Jamie Donaldson’s historic hit to seal the winning point for Europe, Kuchar’s eagle on the eighth from the fairway was stunning.

'We have an image in our team room and it shows how much red, white and blue is still on it,' said the 25-year-old. 'If you look at the honours board of the Ryder Cup, America have still won a lot more than Europe and that's what we're going towards. 'Okay, we have won eight of the last 10 or seven of the last eight or whatever it is, but we are still very much behind the US in terms of Ryder Cups won. 'That is our goal and our main objective to catch them up and overtake them as quickly as we can. 'I don't think this (their recent record) diminishes the competitive aspect of the Ryder Cup at all. 'Even though we've won the majority of the last 10, a lot of them have been very competitive. The last two Ryder Cups previous to this one Europe only won two of the sessions. Rory McIlroy (right) and Ian Poulter celebrate after the Ryder Cup victory . The world no.1 is lifted up on the green after Europe thrashed USA in the Ryder Cup . 'At Celtic Manor we had to combine two sessions and have all players out on the course and we won that session 5½ to ½, and then everyone saw what we did in the singles at Medinah. 'Those were very tight matches. I have no doubt that come Hazeltine in a couple years' time it will be a tight match again. 'The Ryder Cup will go on long past the years we are living. It's a great spectacle of sport between two very competitive teams: Europe have just been getting the better of the US the last few years, but that's not to mean that the US won't bounce back and win a few over the next five or six."" In terms of personal satisfaction McIlroy said the Ryder Cup victory provided the icing on the cake after adding two majors to his growing collection earlier in the year. Coincidentally the last man to achieve such a feat was Tom Watson, the defeated United States captain, in 1977. Rory McIlroy holds up a Northern Irish flag with compatriot Graeme McDowell . The victor offers his hand to the vanquished Rickie Fowler, a close friend off the course . McIlroy said: 'It's obviously a nice honour to have. It's the icing on the cake of what has been a very special summer for me, to win back-to-back majors, the Open Championship and then the PGA, and then to be a part of this fantastic team led by a wonderful captain. 'I couldn't have asked for the summer to end any better. I didn't know that it had not been done since 1977 but, you know, if it's not me in a couple years' time again, I hope it's one of these guys (his team-mates) that gets two majors and gets a Ryder Cup.' McIlroy revealed he approached his singles match against good friend Rickie Fowler with more focus than the final rounds of the Open and US PGA, which he won this year, and that resulted in a comfortable 5&4 victory which helped Europe to an overall . 'I personally am just really proud of how I played,' said the Northern Irishman. 'I was probably up for this match more than I was the final two rounds of the majors I won this year. 'It just meant so much to be to be a part of this team and to win.'","Europe's 16½-11½ victory means they have now won eight of the last 10 Ryder Cup .

"Europe sealed a third consecutive Ryder Cup win on Sunday, turning a comfortable lead into a convincing victory by shading the singles matches. But how did the two sides match up across the three days? Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson rates the twenty-four players. Europe: . Thomas Bjorn — P3 W0 L2 H1 . First Cup for 12 years; he came up against some inspired play from his opponents. 5 . Jamie Donaldson — P4 W3 L1 . Does it get much better than partnering Lee Westwood and clinching the winning point? 9 . VIDEO Donaldson hits Ryder Cup winner . European captain Paul McGinley congratulates Jamie Donaldson after he hits the crucial shot . Donaldson enjoyed the perfect Ryder Cup debut, picking up three points, including the winning one . Victor Dubisson — P3 W2 L0 H1 . Can you imagine the Frenchman’s status by the time the Cup is played in his country in 2018? 8 . Stephen Gallacher — P2 W0 L2 . Unluckily paired with Ian Poulter in opening fourballs during a rare off-day for Englishman. 5 . Sergio Garcia — P4 W2 L1 H1 . Great to see the Spaniard so happy off the course and playing with such fire and passion. 7 . Martin Kaymer — P4 W1 L1 H2 . Found team aspect tricky early on but showed class of a US Open champion yesterday. 6 . Graeme McDowell — P3 W3 L0 . Should have played four matches. Inspired with Dubuisson and indomitable in the singles. 8 . Sergio Garcia (right) looked happy both on and off the course as Europe's big men performed . Debutant Victor Dubuisson formed a superb partnership with Graeme McDowell on Friday and Saturday . McDowell's comeback on Sunday turned the tide for Europe and was a crucial part of their victory . Rory McIlroy — P5 W2 L1 H2 . Showed how much he cared over first two days and then why he is world’s best on Sunday. 8 . Ian Poulter — P3 W0 L1 H2 . Curiously peripheral, apart from a couple of great shots. Hope we haven’t seen best of him. 5 . Rory McIlroy showed on Sunday why he is the best, and the passion shone through all weekend . Poulter made one superb shot, but wasn't at his best at a competition that usually brings out his best . Justin Rose — P5 W3 L0 H2 . Hard to imagine what more he could do. Dug deep when he had to and some play was inspired. 9 . Henrik Stenson — P4 W3 L1 . Cruel he lost singles by missing a four-foot putt. But a fantastic partnership with Rose. 7 . Lee Westwood — P4 W2 L2 . A fine job instilling belief in Jamie Donaldson and wonderful he passed Seve’s points total. 7 . Justin Rose was Europe's best player, winning four points over the three days and inspiring his team . Captain: Paul McGinley . His only error was pairing Gallacher with Poulter. Every bit the superb captain we had hoped for. 9 . United States . Keegan Bradley — P3 W1 L2 . Didn’t unpack his suitcase after Medinah and might need to buy another after this. 4 . Rickie Fowler — P5 W0 L3 H2 . Unlucky to run into Rory in three of his matches and clearly overplayed by Watson. 5 . Jim Furyk — P4 W1 L3 . Ninth Ryder Cup and seven defeats. Hasn’t won a singles for 10 years. He’s just not up to it. 4 . Jim Furyk lost three of his four matches as his dismal Ryder Cup record only got worse . Zach Johnson — P3 W0 L2 H1 . Like Poulter a rock at previous Ryder Cups and like him stuck on the sidelines this time. 4 . Matt Kuchar — P4 W1 L3 . Actually played well but terribly unlucky to run into three hot European partnerships. 6 . Hunter Mahan — P4 W1 L2 H1 . Showed a lot of heart in team aspect but then came another terrible chip yesterday. 6 . Phil Mickelson — P3 W2 L1 . Stupid of Watson to bench him for foursomes on Saturday. Good singles win against local hero. 6 . Patrick Reed — P4 W2 L0 H2 . Brilliant Cup debut. Joint best American on view with Walker and a man to build team around. 8 . Patrick Reed was a rare bright spot for a USA team that was constantly outplayed by Europe . Reed is congratulated by vice captain Andy North and the young American finished unbeaten in four matches . Webb Simpson — P2 W0 L1 H1 . Hard to see why he was ever chosen as a wildcard. Just not got enough game at this level. 4 . Jordan Spieth — P4 W2 L1 H1 . Great partnership with Reed that we will see in future but defeat by McDowell will hurt. 7 . Jordan Spieth lost his singles match but his partnership with Reed was excellent throughout . Jimmy Walker — P5 W1 L1 H3 . Surprise package in US team. Quiet and undemonstrative but showed he is a real player. 8 . Bubba Watson — P3 W0 L3 . Great fun on the first tee but that was the extent of his impact. Hopeless on Sunday. 5 . Captain: Tom Watson . This was a Ryder Cup way too far for the great man. Out of touch and it showed. 4 . American captain Tom Watson had no answer to Europe and this may have been a Ryder Cup too far .","Justin Rose unbeaten in five matches for Europe .
Webb Simpson didn't justify selection as one of Tom Watson's wildcards .

"Arsenal fans have been pinching themselves ever since their club announced the signing of Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez for a fee of £35million. The 25-year-old has the pace, strength and skill to light up the Premier League this season, but what are his key attributes? Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives you the lowdown on Arsenal's new star... VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Sanchez and Sanogo link up for incredibly crafted training goal' Main man: Arsenal's star signing of the summer Alexis Sanchez has the talent to light up the Premier League . INTELLIGENCE . When Alexis Sanchez played for Barcelona, he’d start out wide but make clever runs inside at the last minute to latch on to balls from Xavi and Iniesta. He swooped inside like a Red Arrows plane. He has real footballing intelligence and is even more effective when he starts down the middle. SPEED . Sanchez has electric pace but most impressive is how many high-intensity sprints he can manage over 90 minutes. He repeats them again and again. I watched him training this week and he already looks up to speed, amazing considering he returned later than most of the rest of the squad because of the World Cup. In the match against Brazil at the World Cup, he made 68 sprints, well above average of the rest of his team. He regularly hits 18mph and FIFA ranked him the world’s 10th fastest player. Moving up a gear: The Chilean star will add speed and intelligence to the Arsenal attack . WORK-RATE . This is what makes him stand out. He dictates the pace the team plays at because he works so hard out of possession. I’ve rarely seen that level of tenacity and intensity. He gets through so much work, closing down the opposition defenders. That attitude turned an ordinary team in Chile into an excellent one at the World Cup. He is not like so many forwards, who only come alive when they have the ball. He will set a new benchmark of what’s required from a Premier League striker. Rapid: Sanchez regularly hits 18mph and FIFA ranked him the world’s 10th fastest player . Leader: The 25-year-old played a starring role for Chile during the World Cup in Brazil . STRENGTH . He’s only 5ft 7in but Sanchez is brave and strong. At the Emirates Cup you saw him going up for challenges others would have ducked. He’s fearless. FINISHING . Only Lionel Messi scored more for Barca than Sanchez’s 21 last season. Alexis scored or assisted in 63 goals during his 88 La Liga appearances. He will score more as he grows in confidence. He was forever playing second fiddle to Messi. As the main man at Arsenal, he can really thrive. Tally: Only Lionel Messi scored more for Barca than Sanchez’s 21 last season .","Alexis Sanchez has the speed and intelligence to thrive in the Premier League .

"Asked what he would bring to the role of England captain, Wayne Rooney kept it simple. ‘I’ll be myself,’ he said. That’s his first problem. There are a lot of people out there who want Rooney to be anyone but himself when he leads England out against Norway. Frankly, they would want the captain to be anyone bar Rooney. This is a pity. Rooney is the obvious choice for the job now, head and shoulders above any other available candidate. Yet in reality he is a divisive figure these days. He polarises opinion. Half the country thinks England’s fortunes still revolve around finding the best use for him; many of the others would not have him in the squad, let alone the team. Time to be a leader: Wayne Rooney will captain England against Norway in the friendly on Wednesday night . Skipper: Rooney was the obvious choice for the job, but in reality these days he is a divisive figure . Pressure: Rooney does not deserve the stick, he must lead an inexperienced team with an uninspiring coach . Usually, the captain unites the country behind him — that was certainly the case when Steven Gerrard had the job, and David Beckham. Rooney does not have that blessing. Wembley will be half shut on Wednesday night and half empty, such is the paucity of interest in England’s first match after Brazil, and the unveiling of Rooney as captain did not provoke the hoped-for spike in ticket sales. It is not his fault. This is an England team mired in mediocrity and disappointment left over from the World Cup. The manager is seen as uninspiring, only remaining in the job because nobody else was available, the players are viewed as flawed, failed or just raw. Rooney is pushing 100 caps; the next most experienced outfield player in Roy Hodgson’s starting line-up is barely halfway to 50. In these circumstances, Rooney needs support. This is a young squad he will be marshalling towards the European Championship finals in 2016 — it is unthinkable that England do not qualify, when even third place out of six is likely to lead to a play-off — and he needs to be an inspirational figure. That will be hard if he is to first concentrate on winning the supporters over. Is the attitude to Rooney fair? Not really. His recent tournament performances have been disappointing — and the 2010 World Cup in particular was poor — but his arrival on the scene in 2004 was perhaps the most exhilarating moment for the national team in almost 20 years, and it would be hard for any player to live up to expectations beyond that. Tough: It has been difficult for Rooney to live up to the expectations he set as a teenager . Get behind him: Rooney needs support with England fast approaching the Euro 2016 qualifiers . Glory: The striker scored for England in the unfortunate 2-1 defeat to Uruguay at the World Cup in Brazil . Watching on: Roy Hodgson observes as Danny Welbeck and Rooney train at London Colney . Gary Neville was right when he said last week that 2004 was the closest England have come to winning a tournament in recent years, and it might have happened had Rooney stayed fit. Instead, injury early on in a quarter-final with Portugal — and a poor choice of replacement by Sven Goran Eriksson — denied England. Rooney, and the group, have never been the same since. So, amid the gloom, the shrugs, the wide-open spaces on Wembley’s top tier, is there hope that England could recapture the energy from a decade ago? Well, yes, a sliver of light can be found in Raheem Sterling. Rooney may have the ultimate honour as captain but he is no longer the most significant player in the England team. Sterling is the individual who can make the thought of travelling to Wembley exciting again, Sterling is the player who could one day make a similar impact to Rooney in 2004. New star: Raheem Sterling is England's new shining light, Sterling can make going to Wembley exciting again . Impact: Sterling could have a similar say on things internationally as Rooney did at Euro 2004 as a youngster . Time will tell: The Liverpool winger, 19, constant influence is perhaps in advance of a young Cristiano Ronaldo . Sterling is 19, the same age as Cristiano Ronaldo when he had his breakthrough game for Manchester United, the 2004 FA Cup final win over Millwall. Ronaldo would become a monster in front of goal, while Sterling’s ‘Ricky Gervais’ finish against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday suggests he has a road to travel as a match-winner, but his consistent influence on Premier League matches is perhaps in advance of the teenage Ronaldo. Certainly, on his present trajectory, it is not unimaginable that Sterling could one day replicate the move Gareth Bale made to Real Madrid — or at least attract the attention of Spain’s super elite. It is Sterling, not Rooney, who should grow to be the key player in this team, and if that takes the pressure off the captain, so much the better. It certainly places additional pressure on Hodgson, though, now charged with getting the level of performance from Sterling that he shows for his club. Key player: Sterling was fantastic for England at the World Cup, especially in the opener against Italy . Different philosophy: Hodgson must look to get the best out of England's Liverpool players . Hodgson escaped serious criticism from many quarters after the World Cup — not least the Football Association, who acted with complacent haste in guaranteeing his job — but at White Hart Lane on Sunday, questions were unavoidable. Liverpool looked superb — Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson among their best players — yet Hodgson rarely inspires them to reproduce that form for England. Nor can it be said they are flattered by their foreign clubmates any more. Liverpool maintain an English core and for the first goal, the trio combined successfully in a way they never seem to do for their country. Rooney may be a lightning rod on the message boards and phone-ins, but it is Hodgson’s duty to get the best out of Sterling from here. This is far from the golden generation, but it is not without its gems.","Wayne Rooney divides opinion but was the obvious candidate to be skipper .

"The man who reportedly shot dead at least 85 people at a youth camp and killed another seven with a car bomb in the Norwegian capital of Oslo, released a YouTube video calling for conservatives to 'embrace martyrdom' six hours before the attacks, it has emerged. Anders Behring Breivik posted the video promoting a fight against Islam, which shows pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon, hours before he set out on the devastating killing spree. In a text with the video he detailed his plans for the attacks, writing that he would 'dress up as a police officer', adding that it would 'be awesome as people will be astonished'. Manifesto of terror: Anders Behring Breivik poses in a wetsuit holding an automatic weapon in a YouTube video posted six hours before the deadly attacks . Attacks: Breivik set out how to make bombs from fertilisers and how to receive them in large quantities by setting up an agricultural company . In the disturbing 1,500-page dossier, he wrote that 'there are situations where cruelty is necessary' and that it is better to kill too many than not enough'. Police sources told Norwegian media that . Breivik had confessed to posting the video setting out his extremist . views before the attacks. Breivik was a member of the Masonic lodge in Oslo and had links to the English Defence League. In one post online, he wrote: 'I have on some occasions discussed with... the EDL and recommended them to use conscious strategies. 'The tactics of the EDL is to ''entice'' an overreaction from jihad youth/extreme Marxists, something they have succeeded [in] several times already.' Police chief Roger Andersen said: 'What we know is that he is right wing and a Christian . fundamentalist.' The 12-minute video, called 'Knights Templar 2083', also reportedly appeared on Breivik's now-closed Facebook page. The page cites philosophers like Machiavelli, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill. He listed Kafka among his favourite authors and George Orwell's 1984 as one of his favourite books. In the accompanying document, which he set out as a manifesto for 'conservative revolution', he described how to make bombs from fertilisers and how to receive them in large quantities by setting up an agricultural company. In May, he had six tonnes of fertiliser delivered to the remote farm he owned, 80 miles north of Oslo. The manifesto describes his experiments with explosives and his first successful test detonation of a bomb in a . remote location on June 13. The account of bomb-making is also dotted with details about what he watched on TV including the Eurovision song contest and American police drama The Shield. The author said that he had sent the text and YouTube video in which he attacked multiculturalism and Muslim immigration to his '7,000 patriotic Facebook friends'. In the text, titled 'A European Declaration of Independence', he wrote how he wanted to rid Europe of Islam and Marxism. 'There are situations in which . cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a . betrayal of the people whom you wish to protect,' he wrote. 'The preferred method is to attack in a violent and deceptive form (shock attack). Plan of attack: The manifesto includes detail plans of the horrific killings . Final words: Breivik signed off the document hours before the bomb went off in Oslo . Cruelty is necessary: Breivik wrote that it is better to 'kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike' Poses: Breivik wore military style uniforms in photos included in the 12-minute YouTube video . 'It is better to kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike,' he added. 'Do not apologise, make excuses or express regret for you are acting in self-defence or in a preemptive manner.' Writing under the name Andrew . Berwick, an anglicised version of his name, the suspect said that it had . taken him nine years and cost 300,000 euros to write the manifesto. He said: 'The first drop of rain . marks the coming of a great and unstoppable cultural conservative tidal . wave. The tidal wave will cleanse Western Europe of cultural Marxism and . will result in the banishment of Islam for the third time. 'The . European tree of liberty will be refreshed by the blood of our patriots . and of the Marxist tyrrants. This civil war will last several decades . but we will succeed. 'Never . forget that we fight so that you and your children can remain free. For . a future Europe safe from the tyrany of cultural-Marxism and of Islam. A . Europe worth dying for.' Breivik . said that he wanted to see Europe more similar to countries such as . Japan and South Korea, which he said are 'not far from cultural . conservatism and nationalism at its best'. He declared: 'Celebrate us, the martyrs of the conservative revolution, for we will soon dine in the Kingdom of Heaven.' Last . night the YouTube video posted under the name 'AndrewBerwick' was taken . down from the site because 'its content violated YouTube's terms of . service'. Breivik kept a daily diary in the months leading up to the attacks, filled with detailed plans. He predicted that his actions would . kill or injure more than a million people, saying: 'The time for . dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance . has come.' Profile: Breivik wrote that he his hobbies included Free Masonry, political analysis and travelling . Tolerant: Breivik wrote that he is not a racist and has never been . Instructions: Breivik wrote that it was sometimes necessary to wear make up to look your best . The document also described a secret meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar - skilled fighters endorsed by the Church who fought during the Crusades in the Middle Ages. They are sometimes revered by white supremacists. It said the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European countries with another three members unable to attend, including a 'European-American'. The document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of Breivik’s planned attacks. It is thought that investigators will now try to determine if these people exist and what their connection is to Breivik. Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism expert at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears a resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden although from a Christian standpoint. Mr Hegghammer told the New York Times: 'It seems to be an attempt to mirror Al Qaeda, exactly in reverse.' Police said that unexploded bombs had been located in some other buildings in Oslo and they had not ruled out the possibility that Breivik had accomplices.Police refuse to speculate on motives for the attack but the bomb in Oslo targeted buildings connected to Norway's governing Labour Party, and the youth camp on Utoeya island was also run by the party. Police chief Sveinung Sponheim said: 'He has had a dialogue with the police the whole time, but he is a very demanding suspect.' Officials say Breivik has said he acted alone and admits the attack but denies he has broken the law. He had previously been a youth member of the right-wing Progress Party between 1999 and 2004, which has been vocal in its anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim view points. Joran Kallmyr, a party member who is now Oslo’s vice mayor for transportation, said he met Breivik several times in 2002 and 2003 at meetings. Mr Kallmyr said: 'He was very quiet, almost a little bit shy. But he was a normal person with good behavior. He never shared any extreme thoughts or speech with us. There was absolutely no reason to expect that he could do something like this. We’re very shocked.' Breivik reportedly left the party in 2006 as he was disappointed as it moved towards the centre. His Internet posts also indicated contempt for the Conservative Party, which he accused of having given up the battle against multiculturalism. Despite the hatred displayed in his blogs, it is unlikely that authorities would have noticed Breivik. He did not belong to any violent neo-Nazi groups. A friend told the Norwegian newspaper VG that Breivik had been aligned to the far right since his late twenties when he began posting opinions online, including the site Document.no. According to a fellow user of the anti-Islamic site, Breivik began posting there in 2009 and over the course of just two months wrote 75 pieces. He has written about Somali immigrants with 'full Norwegian passports sitting at home on benefits'. Members of the website and his Masonic lodge were also approached Breivik who he wanted to help him start up an ultra-conservative newspaper. Breivik was raised in Oslo and is alleged to have attended the same primary school as Norway's crown prince. A defining moment perhaps was choosing to be baptised into the Protestant church at the age of 15. However more recently, he wrote of his disgust at 'priests in jeans who march for Palestine and churches that look like minimalist shopping centres'. He was a fan of violent video games including World of Warcraft and Call of Duty and regularly wore 'military-style' clothing. Although having a degree and attending business school, his businesses ventures mostly failed until he set up his farm two years ago. In one blog posting, he says that the only purpose of having a successful business was to fund his political agenda.","Sent 12-minute YouTube video to 7,000 Facebook friends .

"Walter Dauny, who was presumed dead, is to have his name removed from a memorial after it emerged he lived until 1988 . A prisoner-of-war thought to have died at the hands of the Germans during World War Two will have his name erased from a memorial after it emerged he actually lived until 1989, and died of natural causes. Walter Dauny, born in St Peter parish, Jersey in April 1926, was presumed dead when he failed to return to the Channel island after he was sentenced to eight months in a Prisoner of War camp in Normandy, France, for stealing a German soldier's boots. The former shop assistant, who was also . known as John, is still one of 22 names on the Lighthouse Memorial in St . Helier which was erected in 1996 to remember Islanders who lost their . lives in prisons or camps during the conflict. The mistake was only spotted this year, by Walter's nephew, Paul Dauny, during a visit to the island. Mr Dauny, . 39, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, revealed that his uncle had found his way to . London after being rescued and repatriated to Paris when his camp was . taken over by allied troops. Jersey was invaded by the Germans in June 1940, along with the rest of the Channel Islands. They were the only part of British territory to be under Nazi occupation during the war. Mr Dauny said: 'He needs to be remembered as he was deeply affected by what happened, but out of respect to those who died in the camps, it would not be right to keep his name on the memorial. 'Dauny is an unusual surname on the island and I thought it was strange there was one on the memorial when I saw it and wanted to know more about it. 'I never met Walter so can't say a great deal about him. I think he kept himself to himself. 'It is a unique and amazing story and I hope he is remembered in the right way. There is a difference between being a thief in peace time and doing whatever you can to annoy the Germans during war time.' Walter, whose mother died when he was one, is described by his half-brother Trevor, 67, of Lewisham, London, as 'a one-man resistance against the Germans'. Walter was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in 1944 in Normandy, France, aged 18 when the Germans took over occupation of his homeland, Jersey. His name is pictured on the memorial in Jersey under the wrong name of John Dauny . The youngster took exception to the invasion and turned to crime to irritate the Nazis. He even served a five month jail term in 1943 for stealing a bottle of Cognac. His luck ended in January 1944 when his landlord found a pair of military boots and handed him into the Germans. He was tried by the German occupiers in February of that year and sentenced to nine months imprisonment at tough jail Villeneuve St George's on the outskirts of Paris. The court verdict said: 'It must be clear to the local population that German property must not be touched. Those who offend against this principle must be severely punished.'Trevor, who confirmed that Walter died of natural causes in May 1989, aged 63, said: 'He gave them hell during the war. He hated the Germans and was uncontrollable in his youth. 'He would make as much misery for them as possible as he had Germans living in his house. He stole shoes from them, let cows out of fields and didn't have any care for the curfews. 'They sent him away in the end. I feel sorry for him really. He was very unfortunate and got the wrong end of the stick all of his life. The former shop assistant, who was also known as John, is still one of 22 names on the Lighthouse Memorial in St Helier which was erected in 1996 to remember Islanders who lost their lives in prisons or camps during the conflict . 'As for our relationship the first time I ever saw him was in Peckham after he was liberated by the Red Cross. I barely ever saw him again. 'Police came and informed me that he had died. I went to his funeral. There was no one else to bury him so we did it. 'It would not be fair if he was on the memorial and I wouldn't be happy for it as he didn't die under the Nazis. But we all remember him fondly even though we weren't close.' After being liberated by the Red Cross in October 1944, Walter was sent first Paris and then onto London as Jersey was still under control of Nazi troops. He never returned to the island. Walter Dauny's life after the war remains a mystery beyond his death. The family never knew if he married, had a family of his own or what he did for a living. A Jersey Heritage statement said: 'New documents only made available this year and testimony of a surviving relative has proved that Walter Dauny did not die in captivity as presumed. 'The memorial was dedicated in 1996 following information brought to light by historian Joe Mihre. 'No one questioned the information about Dauny or his inclusion on the memorial, and both were based on material available at the time. 'Until the recent visit the Dauny family were not aware of the memorial or the mistake on it. We are convinced Walter and John Dauny are one and the same man. 'We have verified that beyond any doubt Walter Dauny did survive. His name will be temporarily obscured so it will not be visible for the 2014 Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony in January. 'Once further historical research has established there are no more names to be added or removed from the memorial, the panel engraved with Dauny's name will be renovated to remove his name permanently.'","Walter Dauny, of Jersey, presumed dead when he didn't return after war .

"Twenty-two artworks belonging to the brother-in-law of Cornelius Gurlitt, whose Munich flat was filled with a £1 billion Nazi art haul, are being checked by police and art experts. The works, four of which are believed to have come from Gurlitt's collection, may also have been looted by the Nazi. They were removed from a flat in Kornwestheim, near Stuttgart, after the man informed police that they were in his possession. Gurlitt's collection revealed: Maennliches Bildnis by Ludwig Godenschweg (left) Moench (1921) by Christoph Voll (right) The Schwabing art trove: Sinnende Frau (1922) by Fritz Maskos (left) and Paar in Landschaft (1924) by Conrad Felixmueller . He had apparently wanted advice on storing them safely. The man is not suspected of any crimes, according to regional broadcaster SWR. Meanwhile, German authorities have begun publishing an online list of works that were discovered in  Gurlitt's flat. The government has been heavily criticised for keeping silent for 21 months about the trove. Pictured is Couple (1924) by Hans Christoph . Discovered: Two Riders on a Beach' (1901) by Max Liebermann . A statement from the national and Bavarian regional governments said 25 of the works would initially be displayed on an existing website created to help establish the provenance of works seized by the Nazis, mostly from Jews during the persecution of the Holocaust. The government has been heavily criticised for keeping silent for 21 months about the trove of 1,406 European art works, notably by families whose relatives were robbed by the Nazis. The hoard's legal status is likely to be contested. Customs officials stumbled on it during a routine inspection in Munich's smart Schwabing district in February 2012. Man and Woman in the Window (1923) by Wilhelm Lachnit . Sa.Giustina in Pra della Vale (1751/1800) by Antonio Canaletto . ‘The origins of the so-called ""Schwabing art trove"" will be traced as quickly and transparently as possible,’ the federal and state governments said late on Monday - over a week after news of the find was reported by the Munich magazine Focus. ‘To establish transparency and to further expedite research into provenance, the first 25 works that are suspected to have been taken under Nazi persecution will be displayed on the www.lostart.de platform, and that will be continuously updated.’ The paintings, sketches and sculptures . hoarded by the war-era art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, put in charge of . selling confiscated ‘degenerate’ art by Adolf Hitler, were found in the . apartment of his reclusive 79-year-old son, Cornelius. Theodore Rousseau's Vue de la vallee de la Seine (undated) was also in Gurlitt's possession . The legal status of the artworks is ambiguous. Pictured is Christoph Voll's Sprengmeister Hantsch ('Demolition Expert Hantsch', 1922) Erich Fraass' Mother and Child (1922). According to authorities, there are clear grounds to suspect that these works of art were confiscated by the Nazi regime . Made public: Bernhard Kretschmar's Strassenbahn . But their legal status is ambiguous, . nearly 70 years after a war in which the Nazis plundered hundreds of . thousands of art works from museums and from individuals, most of them . Jews. The government's . coordination centre for lost art said on the website that around 970 of . the works were believed to have been confiscated, stolen or looted by . the Nazis. Some legal . experts say Gurlitt may get to keep the art, but others say Germany . could nullify his ownership under the 1998 Washington Declaration, a set . of principles for dealing with looted art. The governments said they . had set up a team of six experts to examine the provenance of the works. Unveiled: Conversation mauresque sur une terrasse by Eugene Delacroix . Some legal experts say Gurlitt may get to keep the art. Pictured is Otto Dix's Dame in der Loge . Missing: Gurlitt's whereabouts are not clear. Pictured is Otto Dix's Dompteuse ('Animal Trainer', 1922) Bonaventura Genelli's Male Nude (undated) was among the first batch of paintings that German authorities posted online . The U.S pressured the Germany government into publishing the paintings. Pictured is Wilhelm Lachnit's Maedchen am Tisch (Girl at the Table, 1923) Gurlitt's whereabouts are not clear. He is under investigation for tax evasion and concealment but has not been charged. The . federal government, which ordinarily leaves such cases to regional . justice officials, stepped up its involvement after the United States . asked it to publish a list of the art works. The . move by the German authorities to publish the artworks follows the . revelation that U.S authorities had the chance to seize the artworks . from Hildebrandt Gurlitt at the end of the war. Even though investigators were suspicious, they let him go. Gurlitt is is under investigation for tax evasion and concealment, but has not been charged. Pictured is Honore Daumier's Don Quichote and Sancho Panza (about 1865) The works were first discovered in 2012. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Child at the Table .

Previously unknown: Marc Chagall's Allegorical Scene (undated) Displayed: Auguste Rodin's 'Etude de femme nue debout, les bras releves, les mains croisees au-dessus de la tite' (undated) Nine hundred and seventy of the works were believed to have been confiscated, stolen or looted by the Nazis. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Die Verschleierte ('The Veiled', 1926) American investigators . at the time expressed doubts about Gurlitt's claims to the works, but . they eventually decided that in most cases he was the rightful owner.

"In a move that could spell the end of high-speed car chases, joyriding, and even terrorist attacks, a UK company has created a system that can stop vehicles at the press of a button. The RF Safe-Stop system uses blasts of electromagnetic pulses to remotely shut off any car engines that targeted by the device. The system was created by Chelmsford-based e2v Technologies and could also be used to stop the engines in boats because it can be triggered up to 165ft away. The RF Safe-Stop system, demonstrated in this graphic, fires electronic pulses towards a targeted car. The pulses immobilise the engine. It can be triggered at a distance of up to 165ft and police, as well as governments, have already expressed an interest in using the system . RF Safe-Stop works because the targeted . radio frequency pulses ‘confuse’ the electronics within the car, and . this causes the engine to cut out as a safety measure. The pulses travel through a wiring loom, or cable, which acts like an aerial to target where the pulses are fired. When a car enters the field of these pulses, the engine is cut off and rolls to a halt. As long as the car stays in this field range, the engine can't be restarted. RF Safe-Stop works because the targeted radio frequency pulses ‘confuse’ the electronics within the car, and this causes the engine to cut out as a safety measure. The radio frequencies used are from L and S parts of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum. These frequencies are used in weather radar equipment, for example, as well as Nasa’s Space Shuttle and International Space Station communication satellites. The pulses travel through a wiring loom, or cable, which acts like an aerial that targets where the pulses are fired. When a car enters the field of these pulses, the engine is cut off and rolls to a halt. E2v's current prototype, pictured, weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto 4x4 vehicles. Future models could be designed to fit onto helicopters. The system can stop joyriders, for example, or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings . Product manager Andy Wood said as long as the car stays in this field range, the engine can't be restarted. According to Wood, the system has already received interest from various governments and police forces and could be used as a ‘non-lethal’ weapon. It could be used to stop joyriders, for example, or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings. The RF Safe-Stop system could also be fitted at harbour and sea checkpoints to stop boats from entering restricted areas. E2V’s current prototype weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto Nissan Nevara and Toyota Land Cruisers. Future models may be designed to fit onto helicopters.","The RF Safe-Stop uses a blast of electromagnetic waves to stop engines .

"The 35-year-old woman who slept openly with her brother in the filthy bush camp where 30 members of an incest clan were discovered two years ago has been blocked by police from having any contact with two of her young children. Disturbing new details have emerged about the incest cult in which Martha Colt slept with brother Charlie in a 'marital' bed inside a tent on the squalid farm, where open buckets of faeces and urine lay about and where their children - brothers and sisters - had sex with each other. Police successfully took out a two year Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) in Parramatta Local Court on Monday against Ms Colt having any contact with the youngest of her five children, Ruth, 10, and Nadia, 8. Three of the four mothers from whom police and welfare authorities have taken a total of twelve children into care. Seven of the children were fathered by the women's brother, their father or their nephew . Dark tale: It was inside this shed (pictured) where Martha Colt slept openly with her brother Charlie. Charlie has fathered four of Martha's children, who suffered cognitive and developmental delays . Genetic nightmare: Martha Col's family can be sen on the left of the diagram, which shows that four of her children, Albert, Jed, Nadia and Ruth were fathered by a close relative, and Karl by a near relative. It can now be revealed that Charlie, Martha's brother, is the father of her children . Magistrate Margaret McGlynn told the court that although it was important for the Colt children to continue with the court-appointed pseudonyms, 'it is important the public be made aware of situations of this kind in which these children unfortunately found themselves ... children whose birth parents being siblings and many of their relatives being of incestuous relationships of some kind'. Ms McGlynn also cited the allegations of sexual activity between the children. Details included Nadia, who was just six years old when the family commune was uncovered, having sex with her brothers, having sticks inserted into her by her maternal uncle Charlie - who is actually her father - and both her father and mother taking photographs of her vagina. Martha has five children - the two girls, Nadia and Ruth, and three boys, Karl, 13, Jed, 15 and Albert, 16. Betty Colt, 48, and her eldest of her 13 children, Raylene, 31, who also had a child removed from her care during the police raid on the squalid bush block where 28 adults lived communally among open buckets of faeces and urine . Betty and Raylene (pictured) outside Parramatta Court, where magistrate heard their objections in June against being DNA tested to determine thee interrelations between the extended Colt family . It was on this bush block (pictured) outside a quiet country town where the Colt family lived in squalor and children were allowed to run rampant and sexually abuse each other . Following a police raid of the farm, during which officers and welfare workers were horrified at the filthy conditions and the state of the children, all five were removed from Martha Colt's care. They were unable to speak intelligibly, did not understand basic hygiene, had gone to school for the very first time just two weeks earlier and were engaged in sexual activity with each other. Ruth, then aged nine years old, was 'drastically underweight', 'was unable to bathe herself, did not know how to use a toilet or what toilet paper was'. Ruth required urgent dental attention, 'her speech was fragmented and stunted, her features were dysmorphic, she could not read or write'. Betty Colt (pictured) will learn her fate in November, whenMagistrate Mary Ryan, will sentence her in Moss Vale Local Court on recruiting her son, Bobby, 16, to kidnap his younger brother from foster care . Nadia, then aged just six years old, was 'neglected and malnourished, unable to bathe' her hygiene skills were 'primitive'. She 'didn't know how to use a toilet, what toilet paper was, had not seen a toothbrush before. Her teeth were decayed. She had speech delay ... was delayed educationally'. Of the 12 Colt children from the whole Colt clan who were later proven by genetic testing to have 'homozygosity', or identical gene patterns in both parents, seven were found to have closely related parents. Four of those seven children were Martha's. After the twelve children were removed from the farm and taken into care, the remaining members of the Colt family fled. Interviewed by caseworkers, Martha's children told horrific tales of sexual abuse by brothers, uncles and fathers. Nadia told her foster carers that her mother and father took photos of her vagina, that her brothers had licked her vagina and that her maternal uncle Charlie inserted sticks into her. She said her mother Martha slept with Charlie in a bed each night, and that her father's name was Charlie. She said she had watched her mother having sex with Charlie in the tent. The family lived in two dirty caravans and tents inside the large shed, which was the domain of Martha, Charlie and their children. In a clearing on the property were tents, including one called 'the black tent' where most of the sexual offences occurred. Ruth told caseworkers that Albert, then 15 years old, had put his penis 'in her bottom' and that it 'makes her hurt'. Nadia told police child care officers that her brothers had touched her private parts with theirs. Two year ban: The solicitor representing Martha Colt leaves Parramatta Court after NSW Police successfully brought a two-year Apprehended Violence Order against the 35-year-old on behalf  of the youngest of her five children, four of whom were fathered by her brother Charlie . Bother Nadia and Ruth disclosed that while their brother lined up to take turns 'hurting their bottoms' their parents Martha and Charlie had been' watching and laughing'. The living area of the farm 'smelt of urine and faces' and was also populated by about 20 dogs. Since the two young girls were taken into care, they have gained weight, improved in their speech and hygiene and are 'attending the local primary school which they love'. According to court documents, when Martha visited the two girls she was heard to tell them not to speak to 'outsiders' and 'if thy were asked about their family to say ""it's none of your business"".' Magistrate McGlynn said it was necessary Nadia and Ruth Colt's identities be protected as they made friends at school and remained free from being judged. 'They not only have the obvious emotional scars, but physical ones as well ... being in new schools, having to make friends and to meet the approval of parents of those children.'

"Charged: David Renz allegedly stabbed a mother to death as she tried to attack him after he raped her 10-year-old daughter . An Upstate New York man who admitted to raping a 10-year-old girl before murdering her mother has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing more than 11,000 images of child pornography, as well as roughly 1,100 videos in a case unrelated to the murders. Federal sentencing guidelines recommend that 30-year-old David Renz be sentenced to 19 to 24 years in prison for the child pornography convictions. However, U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue went beyond the recommendation by imposing the 30-year sentence for crimes prosecutors described as 'pure evil.' The murder of Lori Breshnahan - and the rape of her young daughter - occurred while Renz was awaiting trial for the child pornography charges, and was confined to his home and required to wear a monitoring device. On March 14, 2013 - just six weeks after he'd been arrested for possessing child pornography - Renz removed his required electronic monitoring device and drove to the Great Northern Mann in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse. Once at the mall, Renz parked his car and walked around the parking lot, where he found Breshnahan - a school librarian - and her daughter getting into their vehicle. Renz then forced his way into Breshahan's car using an air pistol he claimed was a real gun and forced her to drive to a remote area of the mall's parking lot where he bound both of his victims and - using a knife to cut a hole in her clothes - raped the young girl. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Monster: Renz pleaded guilty in 2013 to the murder of school librarian Lori Breshnahan and the rape of her 10-year-old daughter . Prosecutors say Renz was trying to . use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she . fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle. As the girl ran off and was rescued . by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed . in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police . shortly after. Weeks after the attack, a report by a . federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on . Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal . probation officers in Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or . demoted. Perp walk: The attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot . Renz pleaded guilty to the murder and rape charges last year. Authorities say that several of the child pornography videos depicted acts similar to the rape and murder for which Renz pleaded guilty. 'Let the defendant's other victims not . be forgotten,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Fletcher said during Renz's sentencing hearing, according to Syracuse.com. 'Each and every child in each and every one of . the defendant's 11,000 images and 1,100 videos for which he stands . convicted, every single one of those children was used by David Renz to . fuel his twisted interest in the exploitation of children. Every one of . them is also his victim.' Renz, whose hands and feet were shackled during the hearing, declined to comment when the judge offered him a chance to speak. Fletcher asked for a sentence of 30 to 70 years, and asked that any sentence the judge imposed would run consecutively with whatever sentence Renz gets for Breshahan's murder.

Her older sister Lauryn, aka 12-year-old Pumpkin, on the other hand, fails to see the joy. 'Personally, I don't like couponing because of the fact my mama takes too long in the stores,' she says. Although the six-year-old pageant star is supposed to be the star of TLC's new show, her outrageous family are no doubt stealing the limelight. Last week's episode followed them as they visited their local Redneck Games where Pumpkin went bobbing for pigs' feet and Alana's other sister 'Chubbs' tried out mud belly flop diving. Classy: Pumpkin (above) was seen bobbing for pigs trotters at a local redneck party in last week's episode . Good clean fun: The pageant star's sister 'Chubbs' went mud belly flop diving, as did Alana herself . Meanwhile, June, who has been hoarding a lot of camera attention over the show, was spotted grinding against a man in the previous episode. During another scene, she was seen discount shopping at a local auction house. She eyed off loads of discounted food including what looks . to be multiple packets of sugary donuts in what she described as a . 'thrifty' way to shop - even though the entire family are supposed to be on a diet. June explained that she shops this way in order to save money because her daughter's pageant . dresses are 'so expensive'. She was seen . narrowing her eyes towards bargain-hunting competitors at the auction who were also keen to secure the sweets. It seems that donuts are certainly an object of desire in this neck of the woods. The mother told the camera: 'It [auction items] can be like half off of what you'd normally buy'. Appropriate? The coupon queen (above) stole the show when she began grinding on a man at the party . Cute: The youngster's new pig, Glitzy, is the latest addition to the redneck clan who live in McIntrye, Georgia . She added: 'Pageants are very, very expensive. It is not a cheap sport by any means. Sometimes he has what I'm looking for, sometimes he don't.' Alana then bought a pet pig which she named Glitzy and plans to take along to pageants with her. The youngster's unruly antics helped her become the break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras. She and her mother even appeared on CNN last week as part of . the series' extensive promotional run ahead of its debut. June addressed the . child pageant industry as a whole, claiming that it never aims to . sexualise children, which is a common accusation among critics. 'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent,' she said.

Child star: Honey Boo Boo told the show's hosts that she prefers 'hair and make-up' to being a 'normal person' The show's hosts also quizzed the star of the show but Alana simply reiterated her love of child pageants. 'It's fun, I like it,' she said. 'I feel like a pageant queen... I like hair and make-up more [than looking like a] normal person.' 'We are a redneck,' she exclaimed suddenly before regurgitating her catch cry: 'You better redneck-onise!' Alana is almost incoherent as her speaking manner is so bizarre. Big personality: The attention-seeking break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras, is seen getting up to even more mischief in her new reality show. The endearing youngster is seen in a promotional shoot above . Other family members featured in the show include her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Pumpkin, Jessica, aka 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'. The clan were seen in an early trailer for the show squishing their flabby bellies around in one particularly charming scene. One of the girls was seen telling the camera: 'We're not red-necks... we all have our teeth, don't we?' Snippet from Alana's debut on Toddlers . & Tiaras were also included in Here Comes Honey Boo Boo early on, including Alana's now famous exclamation: . 'A dollar makes me holler, Honey Boo Boo'. Charming: The smiling clan are seen poking at their bellies at one stage. Her dad admits they are rednecks . A January episode of Toddlers & Tiaras saw June tell of how . she created a 'Go Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant . crack' - failed . to boost her daughter's energy. Beauty pageant Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in . right now!' Describing how . the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair. Energy boost: June was accused of 'doping' her daughter with the high-caffeine mixture . Hyper: Moments after having her 'special drink' Alana was filmed spinning on her stomach . But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She was seen telling the cameras: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.' June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes . to the stage, she was filmed yelling encouragement and instructing . dance moves. When she is not . accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends . her time collecting those money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of . household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.","Alana, six, aka Honey Boo Boo, shot to fame on the controversial reality TV series Toddlers & Tiaras earlier this year .

"You know the moment all too well — and dread it. Just as you’re getting a modicum of comfort on a flight, the seat in front suddenly pushes back, depriving you of valuable inches of legroom. All you can do is to glower in a silent rage at the head of the other passenger, who has decided that by reclining his seat, his comfort is more important than ours. However, some passengers have decided to get even rather than mad, by investing £13 in a gizmo called a Knee Defender, which its manufacturer claims is as ‘devious as it is ingenious’. Scroll down for video . The Knee defender, pictured, consists of two small plastic clips which prevent the seat in front reclining . The Knee Defender consists of two small pieces of plastic which clip the arms of your fold-down table, and prevent the passenger in front from pushing his seat back. The device is adjustable — the closer the plastic clips are placed to the back of the seat, the less the seat will be able to move. It was invented by one Ira Goldman from Washington who, at 6ft 4in, was fed up with being ‘bashed in the knees over and over again’ when flying. To keep tempers from fraying, the gadget comes with a ‘courtesy card’, which you hand to the passenger in front explaining why you are using the clips, and how many inches you are willing to allow him to recline. The card instructs him to address any complaints to the airline in a bid to convince them to ‘provide enough space between rows so that people can recline without banging into other passengers’. Unsurprisingly, the Knee Defender has become the cause of a few inflight rows. Just this week, a United Airlines flight from Newark to Denver had to be diverted because of a barnstorming contretemps between two passengers. During the flight, a woman in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she summoned a cabin attendant who asked the man to remove it. The gadget clips over the arm of the seat tray, circled,  and physically prevents the seat in front from reclining . He refused, and stated that if the woman reclined, then he would no longer be able to work on his laptop. After that, the situation escalated. The woman then threw a glass of water in the man’s face, and an all-out fight nearly ensued. Fearing for the safety of the aircraft, the captain diverted to Chicago, where the two passengers were hoofed off. Reclining has long been one of the most contentious issues regarding inflight etiquette. Surveys have found that 60 per cent of cabin crew have witnessed arguments sparked by the lowering of a seat-back — and nine out of ten passengers think reclining seats should be banned on shorter flights. On the business networking site LinkedIn there has been a campaign to make airlines remove reclinable seats on short-haul journeys, so that passengers can get on with their work on laptops and make the most of the small amount of space they do have. One businessman even writes to say that he always offers the person in front of him $20 not to recline, and thereby guarantees that his space won’t be invaded. Earlier this summer, Luton-based Monarch airlines, which flies to holiday destinations around Europe and the Mediterranean — its longest flight is to Egypt, five hours away — bowed to popular demand. It said it was scrapping reclining seats throughout its entire fleet. Six of its Airbuses now have seats which cannot be reclined, and another 11 are due to be ‘upgraded’ by the end of the summer. Other budget airlines have ditched reclining seats in recent years, but this is unlikely to happen on long-haul flights because passengers accept that most of us need them to rest or sleep during a ten-hour stretch. The device is not currently outlawed by airline authorities but its use is controversial as it causes rows . It is those who recline on short hops who are considered the real pariahs of the air, which is where the Knee Defender comes in. Although the device is not outlawed by aviation authorities, many airlines are now banning it — not least because it causes so many arguments. But there are many other ways of getting the room you want on an aeroplane. Obviously, for those of us with deep wallets, flying in anything above economy class is the best way to stretch out, but that can cost many hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. However, there are plenty of seats in economy that do offer almost as much space as business class. The key is learning how to find them. The place where legroom aficionados look are websites such as seatguru.com and seatexpert.com, which show diagrams of all the cabins of the planes operated by the world’s major airlines. On seatguru seats are graded with colours — green for desirable, grey for standard, yellow for beware and red for poor. So, if you are flying in Europe on a British Airways Airbus A319, you will see that the best seats in Euro Traveller (the airline’s euphemism for economy) are in Row 9, because they all offer more legroom owing to their position at the bulkhead — the wall or partition that separates different seat classes in the aircraft. Flying on a Virgin Atlantic 747-400 from Gatwick or Manchester? Seatexpert advises you to sit in 61A or K, 62A or K, 63A or K, as these seats are wider and you get more storage space. Most of the seats in Rows 64 and 65 are graded as ‘beware’ — their proximity to the lavatories means that you will be bumped into throughout the night as you try to nod off on your way to Tampa. These websites are also great places to find which airlines offer the most space. Some of the results are surprising. Did you know that the Airbus A330s operated by Russia’s Aeroflot airline — long the recipient of digs for its supposedly utilitarian design — have seats in long-haul economy which, at 20.6in, are just over 3in wider than those on the almost fabled Cathay Pacific? The best way to get hold of the good seats is to check in online as soon as you can — which is normally 24 hours before departure. However, many airlines are wise to this trick, and now charge passengers a premium for bagging the best seats early. If you do manage to secure good seats, then you should enjoy them while you can. Last month, manufacturer Airbus filed a patent for a new kind of economy seat altogether — akin to a bicycle saddle, which certainly wouldn’t recline but would allow airlines to cram even more passengers into their planes.","The £13 gadget is described by its maker as 'devious as it is ingenious'

"Professor Alan Thorton, who claims to be a 10th Dan Red Belt in a form of karate . Having just been awarded an MBE for services to martial arts you would think Alan Thornton would be the toast of his fellow karate experts. But yesterday leading figures in British martial arts were instead angered and perplexed by the gong for a man they have never heard of. The award in the Queen’s birthday honours list was given to a ‘Professor Alan Stanley Thornton’ who describes himself as a 10th Dan Red Belt in a form of karate called ‘Senai Seisshinryu Shihandokai’. However, last night former karate champions were lining up to criticise the Honours Committee as they had heard of neither Mr Thornton nor his branch of their sport. ‘I have no idea who he is,’ said David ‘Ticky’ Donovan, who was awarded an OBE for coaching the English and British karate teams for more than 20 years. ‘If he’s a 10th Dan, then I certainly would have heard of him.’ Wayne Otto, also an OBE and the winner of five World Championship gold medals, added: ‘I can honestly say that I have never heard of him. A 10th Dan is pretty rare – there are only very few in this country and I’m pretty sure I know who they are.’ A 10th Dan is, indeed, exceptionally rare as it is the highest rank in many martial arts. Despite their legendary status in karate, not even Mr Donovan or Mr Otto have achieved it. British martial arts organisations were last night also similarly mystified. ‘I’ve never heard of him,’ said a spokesman for the English Karate Federation. Bob Weatherall, secretary of the British Council of Chinese Martial Arts, added: ‘I don’t know who he is.’ Investigations by the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that Mr Thornton, 53, who lives in Brentford, west London, is a man who claims to hold many distinctions. Although he . styles himself as a professor – and the award of the MBE uses that form . of address – Mr Thornton last night claimed it was not an academic . title but awarded by a Japanese martial arts organisation called . ‘Juko-kai’ – an organisation Mr Otto has not heard of. Mr . Thornton also claims to hold a BSc and a doctorate in ‘naturopathic . studies’. When asked by the Mail where he had obtained these degrees, Mr . Thornton was at first forgetful as it ‘was a long time ago’. He then . said they were from the ‘Institute of Natural Therapy’ in India, the . existence of which could not last night be easily verified. On one website, it is also claimed that Mr Thornton holds the inheritable title of ¿The Most Noble the Duke of Clermont de Tornesse¿ . On one website, it is also claimed that Mr Thornton holds the inheritable title of ‘The Most Noble the Duke of Clermont de Tornesse’. ‘This was given to me by a friend supposedly because of what I had done,’ said Mr Thornton. Once again, last night it proved hard to verify the existence of such a title. Mr Thornton denied nominating himself for the award and said he was put forward by a friend and former associate, Kantilal Chavda. ‘He has been a friend for many years but is not a martial artist himself,’ Mr Thornton said. ‘I have not put myself forward, I don’t think that’s allowed and its very insulting for anyone to suggest that. I feel like I’m being treated as a rogue, all my ranks can be traced back to my teachers in Japan.’ According to Mr Otto ‘anyone can invent an organisation or a martial art and label themselves a 10th Dan’. Investigations by the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that Mr Thornton, 53, who lives in Brentford, West London, is a man who claims to hold many distinctions . Mr Thornton said he had been unable to teach his form of karate for a number of years because of an injury. But he said: ‘My work is recognised by many organisations around the world. I don’t know why other people in this country don’t know me – I’m certainly known within my circles, and I feel the award is deserved.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The nomination for Professor Alan Stanley Thornton, like any other, was considered on merit by the relevant independent committee, in this case the Sport Committee. ‘There are four criteria the committee particularly look at: sporting excellence; what they give back to the community and/or their sport; their length of service and career achievements; and what honours they already hold.’","Leading figures in martial arts baffled by MBE awarded to Alan Thornton .

"'Ready to die for my cause': Michael Piggin, 18, is accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre . The schoolboy accused of plotting a ‘Columbine-style’ massacre described on Facebook how he wanted to open fire at a nursery, the Old Bailey heard today. Michael Piggin, who allegedly planned to bomb a school, a university and a mosque, wrote a message to one of his friends claiming he hit his mother after fighting the urge to shoot pre-school children in Loughborough. 'After picking up my pistol I was walking past a nursery and felt the urge to shoot,' the 18-year-old said in December 2012. 'I nearly gave in but I fought it and I hit my mum. 'We had an argument and she said some real mean stuff and I just flipped.' Piggin also wanted to shoot Muslims at a Mosque in the Leicestershire town, the jury heard. In a text message he said: 'When you have got your new air pistol we will meet up and will both bring pistols and go for a bit of a shooting session down at the Mosque.' 'I'm sick of being the outcast when there are some scum that enjoy a better life than me.'Piggin said he 'felt sorry' for Seung-Hui Cho who shot and killed 32 people in the Virgina Tech massacre in 2007. The neo-Nazi teenager planned the . widespread attack when he was 17, compiling a ‘hit list’ of pupils and . teachers he wanted to eliminate, the court heard. He said: 'I am going to be a martyr and become famous so people will look up to me.' The schoolboy is also alleged to have made videos of himself creating Molotov Cocktails out of wine bottles and throwing them against a wall. Piggin, who was named for the first time this week after turning 18 in January, stockpiled an arsenal in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, partially assembled petrol bombs and air rifles. Teenager: Piggin, who can be named for the first time after turning 18 in January, stockpiled an arsenal in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, partially assembled petrol bombs and air rifles . In the first video, shot on February . 16, 2012, the defendant tells the camera: ‘This is the URA’s second . attempt at a petrol bomb.’ His . friend, also covering his face with a balaclava, then prepares the . homemade bomb before throwing it at a wall where it explodes into . flames. Jurors heard . the bomb tests were filmed at the back of a leisure centre in . Loughborough, which is also home to a creche, between February and April . 2012. Nine partially completed petrol bombs were found in Piggins’ bedroom together with a jerry can full of petrol, the court heard. Prosecutor Max Hill QC said: ‘Some of the bombs were loaded with ball-bearings or other forms of shrapnel. ‘These items are clearly dangerous and explode. You will have to consider if they are merely play or something more dangerous. ‘Some or all of those clips are intended for some kind of audience. Inspired . by the infamous Columbine high school massacre, he compiled a list of . six potential targets, including his former school in Loughborough, the . town’s university, council offices, a mosque and cinema, it is alleged. Piggin was arrested in February last . year. Police found several notebooks and recordings detailing his . alleged plans in his bedroom, as well as a variety of weapons, including . IEDs, a crossbow and pyrotechnic fuse cords. There . was also a stab-proof vest, gas mask, blank firing pistols, three . ball-bearing guns, a military belt and an illegal terror manual, . Mujahideen Poisons Handbook. Inspiration: Piggin allegedly scrawled 'the new Columbine' in a notebook, referring to the American high school massacre, carried out by pupils Dylan Klebold (pictured) and Eric Harris . Also . found was a Che Guevara notebook decorated with a Nazi swastika and SS . runes in which Piggin ranted about his sinister plans. He had written . ‘EDL no surrender British and proud’ on its cover, the court heard. A . self-proclaimed member of the English Defence League, he wrote rambling . notes about the need for ‘Britain and Europe to rise up and fight’ against Islam and warned ‘when order fails, violence prevails’. And in a chilling dictaphone message played to the court, Piggin spoke in an impassioned voice about the need ‘to hit back at the scum, the powerful’. He said he hoped his ‘operation’ will ‘inspire the intelligent people to start some sort of revolution against the current system’. The teenager, who at the time was living at home with his mother, adds: ‘People are living in a world of delusion. I’m ready to die for my cause.’ ‘How the f*** could anyone treat a fellow person like people’s (sic) treated me. That’s a question you want to be asking, that’s what drives people to do this. Look at all the f****** things in the past. 'Columbine, Virginia Tech, numbers of others. All because of bullying and how people are treated.’ The Old Bailey heard that two of the teenager’s friends, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have pleaded guilty to possessing either petrol bombs or pipe bombs. But Piggin, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, was set apart from his friends and driven by a paranoia of ‘Islamic invasion of Europe’. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the jury that the teenager’s plot and his haul of weaponry was not ‘child’s play’ but a deadly threat. He said: ‘For an average young man in an average house in Loughborough or any town you care to name in England and Wales, you may think that is startling. ‘That is what this case is about. Plans: One of Piggins' alleged targets was Loughborough University . ‘The final item is a notebook containing information about the planning of attacks and study of explosive devices. He said of the 1999 mass shooting: ‘That’s something that you’ll want to assess in this case given that this defendant, not in Colorado USA but in Loughborough England, was writing ""the new Columbine"" in his notebook. Klebold and Harris, the mass killers in Columbine, were aged 17 and 19 at the time of those atrocities. What you have in this case is a 17-year-old.’ Piggin denies possessing items for terrorism and a terror manual, but admitted possession of petrol and pipe bombs and components of IEDs. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Piggin fought urge to shoot pre-school children in Loughborough .

"Putting the first man on the moon may have seemed like a giant leap at the time, but it will soon seem like a tiny step if Stephen Hawking's plans for space exploration come to pass. During last night’s Live from Space programme, the renowned astrophysicist said we will have settlements on the moon ‘within 50 years’, and believes there will be people living on Mars by 2100. And if we fail to colonise new planets, . Professor Hawking believes the human race faces imminent extinction . because there will be too many of us for the Earth to support. Scroll down for video... Professor Stephen Hawking, pictured, believes we will have settlements on the moon 'within 50 years', and said there will be people living on Mars by 2100 . The 72-year-old said: ‘Our planet is an old world, threatened with an ever-expanding population and finite resources. We must anticipate these threats and have a plan B. ‘If our species is to survive the next hundred years, let alone a thousand, it is imperative we voyage out into the blackness of space to colonise new worlds across the cosmos.’ ‘If we follow this path, I have no doubt that this century will go down, in the history of humankind, as the true Space Age.’ Last night, the ISS travelled over the Atlantic, before it passed over land above Cape Town. The ISS then headed in a north-easterly direction, and crossed the Indian Ocean. The sun had set and it was night by the time it approached Malaysia and Vietnam . Cady Coleman posted this image of mission control in Houston during the live programme. Coleman was  one of the first people to use a robotic arm to capture a free-flying supply ship from the space station, and last night she served as the CAPCOM (capsule communicator) to Rick Mastracchio (right) and Koichi Wakata (left) The route of the ISS would make Phileas Fogg green with envy - and perhaps with more than a little motion sickness. Travelling at 17,500mph (28,100km/h), the ISS can go around the word 16 times per day - that’s once every ninety minutes. Last night, Channel 4 made contact with the space station as it passed over Los Angeles while Californians were enjoying a mid morning coffee. The ISS then proceeded down the west coast of the United States and Mexico. In Latin America, it saw mountains and jungle as it passes over the north of the Andes, and cut across the south of Brazil. This was followed by a long haul over the Atlantic, before it made landfall again around Cape Town.The ISS then headed in a north-easterly direction, and crossed the Indian Ocean. It was night when it approached Malaysia and Vietnam. The last land spotted by the space station was part of Japan, after which the ISS rocketed over the Pacific, to once more fly over the west coast of the United States – by which time Californians were sitting down for lunch. Professor Hawking made the comments during Channel 4’s Live from Space: Lap of the Planet programme, during which astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS) were broadcast live from orbit. The ISS is the third brightest object in the night sky, after the sun and the moon, and can be seen as a tiny light on a clear night. The show provided a clearer view of just what goes on, onboard the ISS including what they get up to all day in their celestial home and office. In one scene, astronaut Rick Mastracchio revealed he has regular contact with home: ‘I spend more time talking to my kids up here than I do down there,’ he joked. And there were plenty of stunning sights of planet as the ISS made an entire lap of the Earth in just 90 minutes. However, images from Nasa archives also revealed a darker side to Earth. During one poignant moment, American astronaut Frank Culbertson, recalled how he saw smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers while onboard the ISS. The haunting photos and video, first revealed earlier this month by MailOnline, were shot by Culbertson as he looked down helplessly on New York on September 11, 2001. British astronaut Major Tim Peake is one of the stars of a two-and-a-half-hour pioneering live broadcast from the ISS and Mission Control in Houston on Sunday on Channel 4. Video grab from the show is pictured . During the show, American astronaut Frank Culbertson, recalled how he saw smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers while onboard the ISS in 2001. This image from the Landsat satellite shows smoke still rising at 11.30am on September 12 . He said his first instinct was to grab a camera - and hours later he would discover a close friend, a pilot at the controls of one of the hijacked planes, was one of the dead. Like all live TV, the programme had its technical challenges, with Nasa losing signal from the ISS a number of times. Helping to make sense of what we will be seeing is Britain’s first ever astronaut, Major Tim Peake, 41, a former Army helicopter pilot who is due to visit the ISS for a 6-month mission next year. Understandably, Major Peake always keeps a look out for the space station when it passes above him. ‘I always get excited when I see the ISS,’ he admitted, ‘and I even have an app on my phone which gives me an alarm whenever it is getting close! Of course, it’s a bit different when you’re going up there yourself.’ Major Peaked explains what life will be like for him when he does get there. The International Space Station (ISS), pictured, is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500mph (28,100km/h) at an altitude of some 250 miles (402km) ‘The daily working routine is punishing,’ he said. ‘Much of the time, we will performing scientific experiments, and then clearing them up.’ As well as having to become proficient scientists, the astronauts also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the ISS, go on space walks, and, perhaps most challenging of all, deal with each other . During Major Peake’s six-month mission he will have very little downtime, but when he does, like many of the astronauts, he might head to a seven-window cupola from where the crew can gaze down on the planet they call home. ‘Although the cupola is meant to be a place that is used for observing Earth and controlling robotic arms,’ said Major Peake, ‘I know that many use the cupola simply to take in the amazing view.’ This may look like a show from the opening credits of Eastenders, but it is in fact an image captured by astronauts onboard the ISS as they travelled over London .","The comments were made during last night’s Live from Space programme .

"She's the only player in England’s World Cup-winning women’s rugby team to have had a baby – but don’t think it’s put her at any disadvantage. For Emma Croker says her traumatic experience of childbirth has made her even tougher on the pitch. And the 31-year-old said she hoped her experience of juggling professional sport and childcare, as well as a job as a PE teacher, would inspire other women with families. Emma Croker, 31, pictured here with her two-year-old daughter Lucy, is the only mother in the England women's rugby team, but says she hopes her experience of juggling work, professional sport and motherhood will inspire other women . ‘After you’ve gone through childbirth, you don’t fear pain anymore,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘I don’t think anything in rugby is going to be as painful as childbirth. ‘It’s worth it in the end. Ask any mother and it’s worth it to have that little baby in your arms. ‘The experience has made me live for the moment – I want to win every game. But at the end of the day I still have my family to go home to. That’s my number one priority. ‘That’s what’s so great about having a family – whatever’s happening in your job or your rugby or your career, they’re there for you and you can’t be sad in front of your children, they just make you happy.’ Mrs Croker was diagnosed with pre- eclampsia – a condition which can prove fatal for the mother and unborn child – meaning an emergency Caesarean was the only option. But despite the toll on her body, she returned to the rough and tumble of the pitch in her position of hooker after only four months. Mrs Croker, from Essex, is pictured being tackled in the World Cup semi-final against Ireland. The England team took the title for the first time in 20 years . She said: ‘Having people tackling you . and having impact on the area where you’ve had the C-section was quite . scary, but I had a couple of mates at my club in Richmond who tackled me . in the corner to see if it wasn’t too bad. ‘The best thing to do is to get back in the game and give it a shot and see what happens.’ Like . any high-powered woman, Croker knew having a baby might mean the end of . her career, but her determination to get her fitness back meant she won . her place back almost immediately. Now Mrs Croker, from Billericay in Essex, takes two-year-old daughter Lucy with her on tour. The rugby player - who is also a PE teacher - takes her daughter with her on tour and says she loves it . With the help of her husband James, 35, an RAF rugby coach, and mother Carole Layland, 59, a caterer, she was able to juggle looking after Lucy with her job and training. Croker says the battle wounds she sustains during rugby matches are nothing compared to childbirth . ‘Having a family was important to me,’ she added. ‘It’s not easy, you need a massive support network behind you, but you can do it – women don’t have to stop their career or sport once they’ve had their baby.’ Women rugby players, in contrast to their male counterparts, receive no sponsorship to play. As a result all members of the women’s team have day jobs – including a vet, lifeguard, plumber and several teachers – and they get reimbursed for the days they have taken off work as payment. Yesterday, as the team was welcomed home from the competition in France by cheering crowds at Twickenham, Lucy was allowed to get her hands on the cup. ‘She loved it,’ Mrs Croker said. ‘It was a great privilege for us to win this year, never mind have my daughter there. It’s an experience not many people get to share with their kids. ‘She’s really sporty, and she’s always running and jumping off things. So hopefully she’ll get into a sport when she’s older.’ Sunday’s victory was the first time the England women’s rugby team have won a World Cup in 20 years, with the last win in Scotland in 1994. It marks a high point in a long battle for the women, who made it through to the finals in 2002, 2006 and 2010 but missed out each time at the last hurdle. Croker said she hoped Sunday’s victory would inspire other women to take up rugby, which is still seen as a men’s sport by many. She added: ‘When we first started playing and first started getting media coverage there were a few negative comments but we just answer it by saying, “come and watch our game”. ‘Since people have been able to watch us on TV, it’s changed people’s opinions. What they see is a good game of rugby.’","Emma Croker, 31, is the only mother in England's women rugby team .

"These are the horrific injuries suffered by a high-flying student who told a man to stop groping her at the Notting Hill Carnival. Mary Brandon, 22, said she was enjoying the festivities with friends on Monday when a strange man in the crowd grabbed her backside. When he ignored her pleas for him to stop, she said she pushed him away – but instead of leaving he punched her hard in the face. Shocking: Mary Brandon (pictured, right, before the attack and, left, after it) said she was assaulted at Notting Hill Carnival after telling a man to stop groping her. She pleaded with him to stop - but instead, he 'punched her' Horrified passers-by called paramedics and she was taken to hospital where she spent nine hours being treated for a battered eye socket. Yesterday Miss Brandon, who is the granddaughter of a life peer and High Court judge, uploaded photographs of her injuries to the internet to raise awareness of violence towards women. The images went viral after friends of the Leeds University student shared them on social media. She wrote on Facebook: ‘I pushed him away, exercising my right to tell a man to stop touching my body without my permission, so he took a swing at me and punched me in the face. Response: The Met Police (seen at the event) confirmed they were investigating but had not made any arrests . ‘Carnival is supposed to be about community and good vibes. I wanted to have a good time but instead I spent nine hours in A&E because of this coward.’ Miss Brandon said she hoped the photographs would act as a deterrent to other men, and said anyone who thought such behaviour was acceptable was ‘not welcome’ at the carnival . ‘A woman should be able to leave the house without fear of being sexually assaulted,’ she added. ‘Maybe it’d be safer to just ignore it when someone invades your space and body. ‘But I can honestly say I will always stand up to someone who thinks they can get away with this behaviour and I’d take a punch again from this loser or any other loser who thinks it’s OK to treat women like this.’ The attack is thought to have happened at 5.30pm in Westbourne Park Road, West London, as the annual Caribbean festival was in full swing. Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they were investigating but had not yet made any arrests. More than 250 people were arrested at this year’s carnival. Miss Brandon, who is studying for an English degree, is the granddaughter of the late Henry Vivian Brandon, Baron Brandon of Oakbrook. He served as a judge in the 1970s and 1980s, and was made a life peer in 1981. Hundreds of thousands of people descend on the west London area every year to take part in celebrations . Yesterday, her mother Amelia, 59, said: ‘I’m proud of her. If people don’t speak out about violence like this, it might add to the problem. ‘I hope that the police catch the person who did this. There must have been lots of CCTV around and people taking video and photos. Someone must have caught him somewhere. ‘It’s awful and it’s not in tune with the atmosphere of the carnival.’","Mary Brandon, 22, was at carnival when strange man 'grabbed her backside'

"A hero reservist saved a British Army colonel by jumping in front of him as he was pelted with bullets in Afghanistan, it has emerged. The serviceman, an American who normally works for technology giant Apple, acted as a human shield when the colonel came under fire from a rogue Afghan soldier with an assault rifle. He returned fire with his rifle and pistol, but was shot six times himself as he leapt to defend the senior officer. Two of the bullets hit him in one of his legs, while one tore into his shoulder and three rounds were stopped by his bulletproof vest. Scroll down for video . U.S. Army major general Harold Greene, pictured, was killed in the attack which saw a U.S. reservist dive in front of a British colonel to save him from the terrorist's bullets . His amazing act of heroism is believed to have saved the life of the senior British officer, as it is understood he was wearing no body armour. The soldier works as a customer service manager at the Apple Campus, the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. He had already been on three overseas tours with the US military, including one to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. News of the attack emerged at the weekend after the details of an American casualty report were disclosed. Around 15 soldiers in total were injured in the incident, at a military training complex in Kabul on August 5, although none have been identified. They included a German brigadier-general, two Afghan generals and two British personnel, but it is not known whether the colonel was one of them. A US major-general, Harold Greene, was killed — the most senior American soldier to die in combat since the Vietnam War. The report also reveals that one of Greene’s aides, a 31-year-old captain, is now paralysed below the waist after being shot several times. Retired Colonel Susan Myers, second from right, saluting as the casket of her husband, Army Major General Harold Greene, is carried by an honor guard during his burial service on Thursday . It is believed the assailant, Mohammad Rafiqullah, hid in a bathroom with a Nato-issued M16 assault rifle as the group of senior Nato and Afghan officers received a briefing outside. According to one report, Rafiqullah opened fire about 10 minutes into the delegation’s third briefing in an open area near a military policing unit. He emptied one magazine before changing to a second in a three-minute attack. According to witnesses, he fired indiscriminately at the group and did not appear to be targeting any specific person. At first, it was unclear where the firing was coming from – but then a Nato soldier saw the gunman and killed him with two shots. The incident was one of the most high-profile ‘green-on-blue’ attacks of conflict. Nato is due to end combat missions in Afghanistan by the end of the year, with the majority of the remaining 5,000 British troops now involved in the withdrawal operation or in training Afghan troops. A U.S. soldier in Afghanistan who  jumped in front of a British army colonel as he was he was pelted with bullets was shot six times himself, it has emerged. File image used . The attack took place at the Marshal Fahim National Defence University, a training complex that includes a British-run army officer academy which is currently training 1,500 cadets. Rafiqullah, who is believed to have served in the army for at least three years and was in his twenties, came from a district in Paktia province known to harbour fighters from the Haqqani network, which has strong links to the Taliban. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the shooting, as an investigation into the incident is still ongoing.","A U.S. Army reservist was shot six times when he saved a British Army colonel from gunfire by diving in front of him during Taliban attack .

"His back was turned for only a moment. But that was all it took for a sudden gust of wind to send the buggy parked by this man flying on to live Tube tracks – with the terrified toddler still strapped in.

The heart-stopping images, captured on CCTV at a London Underground station, were released yesterday by British Transport Police. First, the buggy is seen being left momentarily unattended as the man pops up a flight of stairs to fetch a second child in a buggy. It appears he may have forgotten to put the brakes on because as a train pulls in to the narrow tunnel, it sucks the air along the platform – pulling the buggy towards the track. The pushchair is shown rolling precariously towards the edge, just feet away from a bystander who is oblivious to the drama as he listens to his headphones. It then topples on to the line, narrowly avoiding the last carriage of the train that is pulling away. Moments later, the child’s mother is captured running across the platform. With no thought for her own safety, she jumps on to the rails to rescue the helpless child, who is still strapped into the upturned pushchair just inches from an electrified rail.

To the rescue: With no thought for her own safety the mother races to help her child... while the bystander still has no idea what is happening . Dicing with death: She risks her life by jumping down on to the tracks to rescue the infant, who is at risk from another train approaching the station .

Chief inspector Mark Lawrie said: ‘This was a frightening incident, not just for the scale of the danger the child was exposed to, but also because the woman then put her own life on the line by going on to the tracks.’ Last night, the incident caused outrage online.

"Douglas Perrin, 66, pictured on a previous sea expedition . Pictured on a previous sea expedition, this is public school master Douglas Perrin who died after a sailing trip turned to disaster. The 66-year-old’s yacht capsized in strong winds off the coast of Ireland on Thursday. Two friends, a retired couple, survived by swimming the stormy seas and climbing a cliff on an uninhabited island where they spent the night. Yesterday, as his widow Judith, 60, was comforted by friends, tributes to the popular teacher poured in. Mr Perrin – who often took his pupils at Bloxham School in Banbury, Oxfordshire, sailing – maintained his love of the outdoors into retirement. Friends said the couple moved to picturesque Dunmanus Bay in County Cork three years ago with their boat to enjoy the stunning coastline. Former neighbour Gavin Pledge, 34, said: ‘He was just a nice guy. He really looked after us, always checked if we needed anything. 'We would see the boat here, outside their house. He was really looking forward to going away sailing. They were both very excited.’ Mr Perrin was born in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, but moved to England and married Judith in 1982. He worked as a politics teacher at the £30,000-a-year boarding school. Father Michael Price, deputy head, said: ‘I remember Douglas as a wonderful gentleman, kind, courteous and considerate at all times, with a bright and engaging sense of humour … he cared for all, but especially for students from abroad whom he taught and looked after with great kindness.’ Mr Perrin later volunteered in Zanzibar and served in the Christian community on the Scottish Isle of Iona.The . body of Mr Perrin, who was wearing a life jacket, was found on Thursday . morning in Roaring Water Bay shortly after his two friends were found.

Mr Perrin, a retired teacher from Oxfordshire, moved to County Cork with his wife Judith three years ago . The man's body was found near Sherkin Island. The couple he was sailing with were rescued across the bay near Castle Island, near where their yacht was found capsized between Carthy's Island and Castle Island . A . search and rescue source said: ‘One of the crew on board thought they . heard somebody shouting so they stopped the boat to listen and they . heard two people on the cliff on Castle Island. ‘The . rescue boat then made its way to the shore and dropped off two crew . members who then went to the casualties who were fairly shaken up and . very cold. They were in their 60s and 70s, they had climbed a big cliff . and had spent a night in the cold.’ Lifeboat . spokesman Denis Quinlan said at first they had dismissed the sound of . shouting for help as seagulls. The party had set off from the village of . Schull and had been planning to take a two-hour trip around the bay . before dinner.

The three sailors were in a Drascombe Lugger, similar to the one pictured, on a trip around the bay when it ran into trouble last night. Friends of the sailors sounded the alarm at around 7pm when they failed to return . Church secretary Maud Swanton said yesterday: ‘He was a very nice man and very helpful. ‘The wife of the deceased told me they were due to meet at 7pm for dinner.

"It was the war which ravaged Europe and changed the world forever - a cataclysmic conflict which a horrified world swore never to forget. And, true to their word, one hundred years after the first shots were fired in the devastating conflict, the trenches, shells and muddy craters can still be seen in one of the First World War's most famous battlefields in Ypres. In Ypres, Belgium, which saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war in three bloody and protracted battles, part of the battlefield has been kept as close as possible to its appearance, in an area nicknamed Sanctuary Wood by sheltering soldiers for whom the trees provided additional cover. The poignant photographs, showing stacks of old munitions as well as a war grave on the battlefield itself, come as across the country people prepare to remember Britain's entrance into the war on August 4, 1914. Scroll down for video . Preserved: A network of trenches in Sanctuary Wood, part of the battlefield at Ypres in Belgium, has been kept in the same state as it would have been during the war . Row on row: Soldiers nicknamed the area Sanctuary Wood because of the additional cover afforded them by the trees, shielding them from enemy shells . Craters: Mud-filled holes left by shells from both sides can still be seen at the site, which was a centre of conflict throughout the war . Remember them: Tributes to four soldiers who died at Typres can be seen secreted in the mud to the right of the picture, while the trench runs on to the left . Members of the Royal family and senior politicians will attend events across the UK and also in Belgium - the nation which the British Empire declared war on Germany to protect. In Glasgow, Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince Charles and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will attend a morning commemoration service at Glasgow Cathedral. A parade will then process to the cenotaph in nearby George Sqaure for a wreath-laying service and march-past planned for 11.30am. Meanwhile in Folkestone, Kent, Prince Harry will unveil a memorial arch on the Road to Remembrance, down which soldiers would have walked on their way to transport ships bound for the front lines. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a memorial service in Mons, Belgium. Prince William and Kate will be hosted by the Belgian government at the St Symphorien military cemetery, close to much of the fighting in the early phases of the war. Later on the Duchess of Cornwall will be present at a vigil in Westminster Abbey at 10pm tomorrow, where a single oil lamp will be lit at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. The sombre ceremony will coincide with a nationwide initiative to turn out all the lights in houses and office buildings except a single bulb or candle for an hour. The plan is a tribute to a famous remark by the Foreign Secretary at the time, Edward Grey, who said on the eve of the war: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.' Bombs: Munitions cases which would have flown across the Belgian skies in the early days of the First World War have been gathered up at the preserved site . Rescue remains: The metal fragments pictured above were once part of a stretcher used to carry the wounded away from the front lines . Poignant: A lonely cross marks the grave of a single soldier, surrounded by trenches, as new life grows alongside it even in the scarred landscape . Among the buildings taking part in the switch-off will be the Houses of Parliament, Broadcasting House in London, the Eden Project in Cornwall, St Paul’s and Durham cathedrals and Wales Millennium centre in Cardiff. Also expected to join in are office buildings including Barclays in Canary Wharf, Bloomberg’s European HQ in the City and Marks & Spencer. Every British embassy and high commission will switch off its lights and light a candle at 11pm local time before posting pictures on Twitter. That evening, a candlelit vigil and evening service will also be held at the National Memorial Arboretum near Alrewas, Staffordshire. The Arboretum is a site of remembrance covered in trees and monuments dedicated to different groups of people who fought in or were affected by both World Wars, and other conflicts. On August 5 another poignant reminder of war will be officially unveiled at the Tower of London, which has been coated with thousands of ceramic poppies as part of an art installation. The work of artist Paul Cummins and titled Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, it will eventually include 888,246 poppies, representing all the British or colonial military fatalities in the war. It will grow over the summer, and the last poppy will be planted on November 11, symbolically marking the end of the First World War. From tomorrow, each poppy will be available to buy for £25, with proceeds shared among military charities. It is just one of the commemorations taking place across the country in remembrance of those who died in those terrible years.

"He has been the butt of more than a few jokes in recent weeks. So it will do nothing to help Ed Miliband’s self-confessed image problems that it appears even children are now mocking him. The Labour leader was yesterday dealt an embarrassing blow when a young boy sneaked up behind him and poked his tongue out during a media appearance. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband and parliamentary candidate Sarah Owen on a walkabout in Hastings, East Sussex, where a young scallywag shows his contempt for Mr Miliband . The boy pulled off his prank behind the back of the unsuspecting politician after riding up on a toy scooter, much to the glee of onlookers. Mr Miliband was posing for photographers with parliamentary candidate Sarah Owen while he spoke to residents during a visit to Hastings, East Sussex. It comes after he batted off suggestions that he was bothered by his image problems during an appearance on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show last week. It's not the first time Ed Miliband has been caught out when there's a camera about as his unfortunate attempt to eat a bacon sandwich showed . He laughed at cartoons comparing him to Wallace from the children’s animation films which Marr produced on air. Marr asked: ‘Again and again and again, you are turned into a figure of fun, and you can’t ignore it. It must hurt, it must make you angry, surely?’ In fact, Mr Miliband is often caught out in the public eye . The Labour leader replied: ‘I think it makes me angry in the following sense: that I think the British people deserve a better debate than this. ‘This isn’t sort of C-list celebrity. This isn’t a sort of ugly persons’ showbiz contest.’ Last week, it was also revealed he is worried enough about his poor public image to have sought help from a world renowned expert on autism in addition to a voice coach. Mr Miliband’s encounter yesterday is reminiscent of David Cameron’s embarrassment in 2007 when 17-year-old Ryan Florence was snapped making a rude gesture behind him. The Prime Minister had previously been mocked for his so-called ‘hug-a-hoodie’ rhetoric, which had been seen as soft on crime.

"I'm just a passenger: Dr Anthony Marsh is reported to have racked up £20,800 a year on VIP transport between his offices – averaging out at £400 a week . An NHS Ambulance boss earning almost a quarter of a million a year is also spending thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ cash on chauffeur-driven rides to work, it has emerged. Dr Anthony Marsh is reported to have racked up £20,800 a year on VIP transport between his offices – averaging out at £400 a week. He is paid £232,000 a year — £90,000 more than the Prime Minister — to run both the West Midlands and East of England Ambulance services, and has been described as the ‘highest paid public servant you’ve never heard of.’ For the West Midlands service (WMAS), which has been fined £2.6million for missing targets and which Dr Marsh has led since 2006, he drives a company car - a 2012 silver Range Rover Sport. But since the beginning of this year, he has also worked three days a week for the East of England service (EEAS). It is understood he cannot drive himself the 154 miles between the two bases himself because he works during the journey. A Mercedes picks him up at his home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, and takes him on a three-hour journey to his office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. He stays in hotels twice a week on average — costing around £80 a time, or £8,320 a year. Last week, Dr Marsh was criticised after it was revealed his annual pay rose by £50,000 this year. His total remuneration amounts to £275,298 with benefits including a £9,400 allowance for the Range Rover and his £33,672 pension. John O’Connell, director of The Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is a crazy amount of money to be wasting when the NHS can’t afford to.’ Joyce Robbins, of Patient Concern, added: ‘It smacks of a different age.’ It comes just three months after WMAS was fined £2.6million for missing government targets for attending 75 per cent of emergencies within eight minutes. Meanwhile EEAS has reached just 73.6 per cent of the most critical ‘Red 1’ calls between April 2013 and March 2014. In addition, it has been told to make £50million savings by 2017. Fast, but not fast enough... Both the West Midlands Ambulance Service and the East of England Ambulance Service have failed to meet targets for attending 75 per cent of emergency call-outs within eight minutes . Commuting in style: Dr Marsh's chauffeur-driven Mercedes takes him on a three-hour journey from his home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to his office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. He can't drive himself because he is working . Dr Marsh was brought in to oversee EEAS after criticising its failings in a report. The service says Dr Marsh has put in plans so its targets are met. A spokesman said his joint role saves £130,000 across both trusts and he oversees 9,000 staff covering 12,000 square miles. He has helped make £6million savings which was funding 400 staff, 147 ambulances and over 60 rapid response vehicles. The spokesman added: ‘The organisation has turned a corner thanks to Mr Marsh’s actions.’ When Dr Marsh’s salary package was revealed earlier this year, Labour MP Tom Watson called for ‘more scrutiny’ and asked whether he was the ‘highest paid public servant you’ve never heard of.’","NHS spends £400 a week on VIP transport for Dr Anthony Marsh .

"He has already been hailed as Britain’s greatest living artist. Now a work by David Hockney has been voted as the nation’s favourite painting in a poll of art fans across the UK. My Parents, painted in 1977 by the Bradford-born artist, depicts Kenneth and Laura Hockney the year before his father died. Artist David Hockney's tender portrait of his parents has topped a poll as the nation's favourite artwork . 'My Parents', painted by Hockney in 1977, depicts his parents just a year before his father Kenneth's death . The painting is one of 25 voted for by 38,000 people on Facebook which will appear on billboards at train stations, bus stops and roadsides across the UK this summer. The project aims to make art more accessible to the general public, with the works billed as ‘the nation’s favourites’. The voters were limited to a long-list of 70 works from public galleries which were pre-selected by a panel of curators and art experts. And some yesterday voiced their surprise at the list, which shunned traditional favourites by Turner and included several unconventional choices. 1. My Parents, David Hockney, 1977 . 2. Farm at Watendlath, Dora Carrington, 1921 . 3. Ruby Loftus screwing a Breech-ring, Dame Laura Knight 1943 . 4. The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal, Grayson Perry, 2012 . 5. A Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach, Stanhope Alexander Forbes, 1885 . 6. Melanie and Me Swimming, Michael Andrews, 1978-9 . 7. Ellen Terry ('Choosing'), George Frederic Watts, 1864 . 8. The Travelling Companions, Augustus Leopold Egg, 1862 . 9. Pottery, Patrick Caulfield, 1969 . 10. Memory Mirror, John Hoyland, 1981 . Among the top 25 were Marc Quinn’s 2006 work Self, which is a frozen sculpture of the artist’s head made from 4.5 litres of his own blood. There was also a photograph of a man holding a sign reading ‘I’m Desperate’ from a series created by conceptual artist Gillian Wearing. The images to be featured in the Art Everywhere project date back over several centuries, with Hans Holbein the Younger and William Blake also among those to be showcased. There is also Henry Moore’s sculpture, King and Queen, John Constable’s painting Study of Cirrus Clouds, and the 1984 work Existers, by Gilbert& George. Turner Prize-winning potter Grayson Perry, whose 2012 work The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal was voted number four, said he was ‘incredibly flattered’ to have made the list. Unveiling the project at Waterloo station yesterday wearing a pink tartan teddy-themed dress, the cross-dressing artist said it fed into the debate on whether ‘democracy has terrible taste.’ ‘From a long list of 70, it’s a great selection,’ he said. ‘It would be interesting to see, if it wasn’t open, what the public would have selected. ‘There would have been so many different choices that you wouldn’t have been able to choose 25 of them. On a practical level that’s my guess.’ Art critic Godfrey Barker added: ‘Maybe the curators have made sure that clichés and the overfamiliar are not on the long-list, and perhaps the public are being forced to choose the less familiar. The poll results showed 'Farm at Watendlath', by Dora Carrington, was the nation's second most-loved artwork . In third place was 'Ruby Loftus screwing a Breech-ring', by Dame Laura Knight. The artwork depicts a female factory worker operating a lathe during WWII. At the time, it was considered the most skilled job in the factory . Mr Barker added: ‘But ideally, we want the public to see what it doesn’t know about, rather than voting for whatever it knows. ‘It’s a magnificent chance to widen people’s experience of art.’ More than 30,000 billboards and outdoor sites across the UK will display the selection of works over the coming weeks. They will include bus shelters, digital poster screens and within more than 2,000 black cabs during the exhibition from July 21 to August 31. Grayson Perry's 2012 artwork 'The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal' was voted fourth in the poll . Sir Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North, has created a specially-commissioned digital artwork for the project, which can be downloaded free of charge. He said yesterday: ‘Art is about sharing. This extraordinary project is about art being everywhere in order to reinforce the fact that art is everyone’s.’ The project, run by the Art Fund, Tate and a collaboration of other organisations, launched last year for the first time, when 30,000 people voted. The top two favourites of 2013 were John William Waterhouse’s The Lady of Shalott and John Everett Millais’s Ophelia, which both hang in Tate Britain. Organisers said the judging panel selected an entirely different long-list this year, to avoid replicating last year’s results.","David Hockney's 1977 masterpiece voted the nation's favourite piece of art .

"A Japanese submarine that was preparing to attack the Panama Canal during World War Two has been discovered off the coast of Hawaii. The 400-foot (122-meter) ‘Sen-Toku’ class vessel - among the largest pre-nuclear submarines ever built - was found by chance in August off the southwest coast of Oahu. It has been missing since 1946 according to scientists at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The I-400 and its sister ship, the I-401, which was found off Oahu in 2005, were able to travel one and a half times around the world without refuelling. It could also hold up to three folding-wing bombers that could be launched minutes after resurfacing, the scientists said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"A trove of sunken treasure from the has been unearthed thanks to a drought that reduced a Polish river to puddles. More than ten tons of ornate marble statues, fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of Poland's River Vistula as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the summer. The haul is believed to have been left behind by marauding Swedish invaders who plundered Poland's rulers in the 17th Century loading the spoils onto barges to transport home. But experts believe the masonry proved too heavy for their wooden warships which eventually sank under the weight. Artefacts: Historians salvage 17th century . marble and alabaster decorative structures in the bed of the Vistula . River in Warsaw, Poland, after its waters ebbed to record low levels . Spoils: The haul is believed to have been left . behind by marauding Swedish invaders who plundered Poland in the 17th . Century, loading the spoils onto barges to transport home . And while the ships were long-since swept away their cargo remained, . entombed in mud at the bottom of the river for more than 400 years. The period is known in Poland as The Deluge, when the Scandinavian hordes launched the Second Northern War in 1655. While they had one of Europe's most powerful armies, Swedish warlords . had little with which to pay their troops so they swept through eastern . Europe pillaging everything in their way. The armies plundered vast quantities of Poland's riches - most of which were never returned. Warsaw was so badly ravaged that its pre-war population of 20,000 was reduced to 2,000 by the time the Swedes set sail for home. They even appeared to break up the stonework, large blocks of carved marble which were used in . the columns, fountains, and staircases of Polish palaces, into manageable pieces which historians believe they planned to reassemble in their homeland. Lost: The stonework has lain at the bottom of the Vistula since the boats carrying it sank before reaching the Baltic . Revealing: Historians say the find is the best material evidence they have so far to recreate the events of the war nearly 500 years ago . Relics: The artefacts now lie exposed apart from a coating of foul-smelling yellow mud . The drought also revealed other fragments of Polish history, including unexploded mines from the  Second World War and pieces of Jewish gravestones - the legacy of successive Nazi and Soviet schemes to wipe out all traces of the Warsaw's Jewish community. Researchers knew about the artefacts, but, . before the drought, retrieving them was a painstaking task because they . were under several feet of water. Now . though, they are lying . exposed apart from a coating of foul-smelling yellow mud. Trove: More than ten tons of elaborate marble . statues, fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of Poland's . River Vistula as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the . summer . 'The . drought helped us a lot because what had been lying underneath is now . at the surface,' said Hubert Kowalski, deputy director of the University . of Warsaw Museum, who is leading the effort to retrieve the marble stonework. Speaking . at a building owned by the Warsaw river police, where some of the . stonework is being temporarily stored, he said historians' knowledge . about what happened four centuries ago had previously been sketchy. 'Now we have evidence, the best material evidence of the Swedish invasion so far,' Mr Kowalski said. He said the gravestones, or matzevah,  would be handed over to the city's . Jewish Historical Institute. Finds of Jewish artefacts are quite common . in Warsaw. Spoils of war: The haul is believed to have been . left behind in the river at capital Warsaw by marauding Swedish . invaders who plundered Polish rulers in the 17th Century . Historians . believed that the Swedes who invaded Poland in the 17th century planned . to move the looted cargo up the Vistula to Gdansk, where the river . joins the Baltic Sea, and from there transport it home. There is still no firm explanation of why the boats sank on the way. Mr Kowalski said he and his team had so far located up to 10 tonnes of stonework, but this was only the beginning. 'The boats had a capacity of 50-60 tonnes (each), so we think that we should find much more,' he said. The Deluge: Johann Philipp Lemke's 1656 painting . shows Swedish king Charles X Gustav in skirmish with Polish Tartars at . the battle of Warsaw. Swedish armies plundered vast quantities of . Poland's riches during their invasion that began in 1655 . Once it has been removed from the river bed and catalogued, the plan is to take the masonry to Warsaw's Royal Castle, one of the sites from which, historians believe, it was looted by the Swedish invaders. For now though, the low water levels that revealed the artefacts are hampering efforts to retrieve them. Regular lifting equipment would sink into the mud, but the river is too low for the researchers to bring in floating cranes. 'We need to wait until it gets higher,' Kowalski said.","The 10-ton haul includes more than ten tons of elaborate marble statues, fountains and palace pillars looted from Polish rulers .
