Mitt Romney's eldest son Taggart - known as Tagg - has said he wanted to punch Barack Obama during Tuesday's fiery debate in Long Island, New York. His frank admission - delivered with a laugh during a local radio interview - came after it emerged that Michelle Obama broke the debate rules to clap when moderator Candy Crowley took her husband's side on whether he had described the Bengahzi attack as a terrorist act. Scroll down for audio . Clash: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were locked in a ferocious fight during Tuesday night's debate . Rancour: The two candidates are believed to harbour consider personal animosity towards one another . At times in the debate it seemed as though Obama and Romney might have a physical confrontation as they circled each other like gladiators in a ring, wagged their fingers and interrupted each other. Each accused the other of playing fast and lose with the facts. When Romney said that the president was 'completely and totally wrong', Obama shot back: 'Governor, that’s not true.' The encounter was perhaps the most rancorous in U.S. presidential debate history. The two men have made little secret of their disdain for each other. During the 2008 campaign, Obama - who expected Romney to be the Republican nominee that year - was privately scathing about the former Massachusetts governor. Listen to Tagg's comments amount about 'taking a swing' at Obama . In an interview with a North Carolina radio station, Tagg Romney was asked by host Bill LuMaye how he feels when Obama accuses his father of being 'a liar'. He responded with a laugh: 'Jump out of your seat and you want to rush down to the debate stage and take a swing at him. 'But you know you can’t do that because, well, first because there’s a lot of Secret Service between you and him, but also because this is the nature of the process. They’re going to try to do everything they can do to try to make my dad into someone he’s not. 'We signed up for it. We've got to kind of sit there and take our punches and then send them right back the other way.' A recording was obtained by Buzzfeed. Influence: Tagg Romney is said to have had a large impact on his father's campaign . Support: Tagg Romney, pictured left with his parents, said he wanted to 'take a swing' at Barack Obama during Tuesday night's debate . Dismissal: During his mother's appearance on The View (left), Josh Romney (right) said that he'd been 'slugged' a couple times by Tagg and 'the President has nothing to worry about' Appearing on The View, Tagg's younger brother Josh dismissed the remark as nothing more than a harmless joke. 'I've . been slugged a couple of times by that brother and let me tell you . President Obama has nothing to worry about,' he quipped. 'It's hard when you're in this process to see your dad get beat up out there... you take it pretty personally. 'I think that's something he was saying off the cuff and I assure you he didn't mean it.' On the trail: Mitt Romney pictured on his campaign plane in Virginia on Thursday . Opponent: Obama speaking at a campaign event in the swing state of New Hampshire on Tuesday . Tagg Romney, 42 and a father of six, is said to have taken on an increasingly pivotal role in his father's campaign. After . the debate, he tweeted: 'Another great debate dad. More likable, right . on the issues. Drove home that Obama's rhetoric doesn't match his . record.' In the interview, . he also revealed that the former 2002 Winter Olympics supremo gets . nervous before the high-stakes debates. 'He's terrified before he gets . out there,' he said. 'Terrified is too strong of a word, but he's like . anybody. He gets butterflies a little bit.' A Romney spokesman said that Tagg Romney's comment was 'all in jest' and should not be taken seriously. All together: The Romney parents with their five sons Tagg, Ben, Matt, Craig and Josh . First-born: Tagg playing as a child with his mother Ann - before his days as a strategist for his politician father . This is not the first time that one of the candidate's five sons has made headlines for off-the-cuff comments made on the campaign trail. In December, Matt Romney joked that his father would release his tax returns 'as soon as President Obama releases his grades and birth certificate'. He . was quick to deny that he was buying in to the 'birther' conspiracy . theory, taking to Twitter to apologise: 'I repeated a dumb joke. My . bad.' Notwithstanding a . couple of controversies, all the Romney sons have been regularly seen on . the campaign trail - despite having their own families and careers. Support: Craig, Tagg and Ann Romney in the audience at the first presidential debate in Denver . Congratulations: Tagg hugs Mitt after the first debate in Denver two weeks ago . Tagg - the only son who urged Mitt to run again for President after he lost in 2008 - is considered teh ringleader, playing a key role in fundraising and strategy. Matt has said that he sees the family's tole as keeping Mitt sane by indulging his sense of humour and playing games with him. Josh is believed to have political ambitions of his own, a rumour supported by his frequent campaign speeches on behalf of his father. Ben is less involved with the campaign, as he is hard at work as a radiologist in Utah, but he has joined his brothers for interviews designed to show the candidate's human side. Craig, the youngest son, is fluent in Spanish, and has therefore taken on the specific role of boosting his father's standing among the Latino voters who could be crucial in next month's election.","Tagg Romney made the comment during a radio interview after the second presidential debate .

Two females employees of a sex store have been convicted of stealing more than £1,400 worth of erotic products from the shop in just two weeks, after being caught on CCTV. Julie Preston, 42, and Rachael Greensides, 27, both worked in the Pulse and Cocktails store in Hull when they stole a range of sex toys, outfits and cash. The store manager became suspicious after another staff member raised the alarm. For two weeks, he watched CCTV footage of the pair stealing sex toys and erotica from the shop. Guilty: Rachael Greensides (left) and Julie Preston are seen here outside Hull Magistrates Court where they were sentenced to 12 month community orders for their crimes . Greensides was seen charging customers for goods and then voiding the sale and pocketing the money after they had left. Preston was seen to steal over £1,000 of products and cash from the store while Greensides stole over £420. Prosecutor Heather Levitt said both women had worked at the store for years before another employee alerted the manager to the fact that clothing was going missing. She said: 'The manager began to monitor the CCTV recordings and discovered them placing carrier bags behind the till and placing various adult items in them before removing the bag and putting it under the counter.' They were both arrested on July 31 and have since pleaded guilty to three counts of theft. The pair claimed they were under pressure to meet targets to sell high-value products and as a result they were keeping back the money from smaller purchases and later ringing them through the till as a high-value purchase. Their solicitor Mike Farr said: 'The aggravating feature is the breach of trust from their employer. 'They were both invited for a internal meeting with the company and made admissions and the police were called. They made full admissions based on the CCTV evidence put to them. Scene of the crime: The Pulse and Cocktails store in Hull where Preston and Greensides stole over £1,000 worth of sex products . 'The property involved is of a relatively low value. 'Preston pleaded guilty to stealing £1,088.60 and she handed back items that were still at her home. Greenside stole £421.20. 'The thefts were not predominantly for financial gain. Preston claims she took items home intending to sell them to friends. 'Both have lost their employment and their exemplary record.' The company told the Crown Prosecution Service it is seeking a civil action against the women for a further £3,018. Mr Farr told the court Preston has already paid back £1,400. Both women have not received their final wage packets and the thefts they are charged with have already been repaid. Magistrates gave both women 12-month community orders and ordered them to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community as well being ordered to pay £85 court costs each.","Julie Preston, 42, and Rachael Greensides, 27 both pleaded guilty to stealing £1,088.60 and £421.20 respectively in just a two week period .

Vandals have desecrated the grave of a 13-month-old baby girl, littering it with smashed beer bottles and stomping on toys left by grieving family members. Police are hunting the culprits who attacked baby Chloe Elliot's grave along with scores of others in a booze-fuelled vandalism spree at Efford cemetery in Plymouth, Devon, on Wednesday night. Families have branded the attack 'disgraceful, immoral and beyond belief' after finding their loved ones' headstones kicked down, ornaments smashed and flowers torn up as they arrived at the cemetery to pay their respects. 'Disgraceful': Little Chloe Elliott's grave, pictured left, was vandalised on Wednesday night . 'It's immoral and shows a complete lack of respect for other people,' said Andy Jean, whose mother Marie Jean's grave was severely damaged in the attack. Mr Jean was visiting the cemetery on what would have been his mum's 80th birthday. 'To do this in a cemetery and knock other people’s gravestones over is beyond belief.'

"By . Eddie Wrenn . PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 10 October 2012 . Officer Michael Vagnini, one of the four men accused of illegally strip searching and sexually assaulting nearly a dozen people over a two-year span . Four Milwaukee police officers illegally strip searched and sexually assaulted ten men in two years, a court was told. According to a criminal complaint, ten men, identified only by their initials, told prosecutors the officers searched them between February 2010 and February 2012. Prosecutors say the stories are strikingly similar: The men allege that Officer Michael Vagnini stopped them, placed his hand down their pants and probed their anus or shifted their genitals, saying he was looking for drugs. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm charged Vagnini with 25 counts, including conducting an illegal strip search, misconduct in office, sexual assault and conducting an illegal body cavity search. Chisholm also charged Jeffrey Dollhopf with conducting an illegal strip search, conducting an illegal body cavity search and two counts of misconduct in public office. Brian Kozelek was charged with conducting an illegal strip search and misconduct in public office. Jacob Knight with conducting an illegal body cavity search and misconduct in public office. One of the victims testified under oath that officers stopped him in July 2011. Vagnini pinched his anus, causing him to yell out 'Man, what are you doing? Don't touch me like that! You can't be doing that!' Vagnini replied with words to the effect of 'Be a man and give it up.' Vagnini is accused of taking the man to a room in a district police station, throwing a box in the room and told him if he defecated once in the box he would let him go. Milwaukee Police officers Jacob Knight (left) and Brian Kozelek, two of the four accused of illegal strip-searching . Officer Jeffrey Dollhopf exits after his initial court appearance in Milwaukee County Circuit Court . The man tried to comply, investigators said in the complaint, but couldn't and was released with a ticket for driving with a suspended license. Officers Dollhopf and Kozelek were in the room but did nothing to stop the proceedings and didn't report Vagnini to a supervisor, the complaint said. A similar scenario allegedly took place that September, when Vagnini took a man he stopped to a room in the same police station after saying 'I want to see what he's got in his butt.' He allegedly inserted his finger into the man's anus, prompting the man to call out 'This ain't right! Call my attorney!' Milwaukee police Chief Ed Flynn addressed the media on the charges against four Milwaukee police officers . Vagnini then allegedly told the man to get the drugs out on his own, gave him a garbage can and had the man push the drugs out and place them into the can. The complaint did not specify what type of drugs the man was hiding but said Dollhopf and Officer Jacob Knight were in the room and didn't try to stop Vagnini or report him. Another victim testified that, in February, Vagnini saw him coming out of his aunt's house, cuffed him, and then searched his anus. When the man tried to pull away, Vagnini put him in a chokehold. Two officers held his arms and one pressed a gun to his head, the victim said. Chief Edward Flynn is under fire following the charges. He told reporters on Tuesday: 'Quite frankly I'm disgusted by the willful action of some of the officers of our police department. 'And I'm appalled by the willful inaction of some other officers in our police department in failing to stop egregious conduct. There's no justification for this.' Asked if he would quit, he said: 'The test of the agency isn't whether or not an act of misconduct occurs. 'It's how the agency responds to it. And this agency responded at every level of the organisation: effectively, rapidly and directly.'","Victims all claim similar attacks which saw Officer Vagnini perform searches on their privates while other officers refused to intervene .

Freddie Starr suffered heart palpitations sparked by the stress of being 'wrongly' accused of trying to grope a 14-year-old girl at a Jimmy Savile sex party, his fiancée revealed. The 69-year-old madcap comic strenuously denied even meeting his accuser Karin Ward despite a video emerging of the pair of them together on Savile’s show ‘Clunk Click’. Today, speaking live via telephone on ITV's This Morning, Starr's fiancée Sophie Lea, 34, told reporters he had suffered heart problems since the allegations emerged. Scroll down for video . Freddie Starr and fiancee Sophie Lea speak outside their home in Studley refuting the allegations against him . Starr's fiance Miss Lea said the couple (their home is pictured) were devastated by the allegations which Freddie has always denied. She said he was in bed and would not be going out for the rest of the week . The comedian also spoke out today, saying he would never have touched an under-age girl. Starr - who suffered a massive heart attack in April 2010 which left him needing quadruple heart bypass surgery - last week failed to ban ITV from airing Miss Ward’s allegations. Speaking outside the couple’s £1m mansion in Studley, Warkwickshire, Miss Lea, who . became pregnant with his fifth child last November,  said: 'We are devastated by the allegations which Freddie has always denied. 'He has never molested a woman and nor would he ever do so. Freddie has suffered heart palpitations, he is in bed and will not be going out for the rest of the week. Together: Karin Ward in yellow, sitting behind Freddie Starr when he appeared on the BBC TV show hosted by Sir Jimmy Savile, 'Clunk Click', in 1974 . 'The allegations made by this woman have not been investigated by the police but we would welcome a police investigation so he can clear his name. 'Freddie asked his agent if he had ever appeared on Clunk Click with Jimmy Savile and he said no, how is he supposed to remember something that happened 40 years ago? 'I understand the woman [Karin Ward] has a book coming out soon. We are going to hire private investigators to clear Freddie’s name.' Allegations: The 69-year-old funnyman was first named by Karin Ward (pictured) when she spoke to the BBC's Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast . Starr was named by Miss Ward first by BBC’s Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was shelved. Last week she told ITV News: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him.' The 1974 footage showing Starr and Miss Ward was unearthed by Channel 4 News. Couple: Freddie Starr (left) is engaged to Sophie Lea (right), 34, who fell pregnant with his fifth child last year . It showed Starr appearing on Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was . being filmed the day she was abused. Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair. Speaking today, the comedian said he would welcome the opportunity to speak to police about 'devastating' claims he was involved in groping a teenager. In an interview with ITV News, the 69-year-old comic said he has people around him who were helping him 'get to the bottom' of the claims. Starr denied the allegation and said he would never have touched an under-age girl. Asked by ITV News today whether he had ever fondled an under-age girl, he said: 'Never. I never have done. I never will do. It’s not my style. It’s not in me to do that. 'If there’s one thing I hate, close to my heart, is paedophiles. I cannot stand them. To be accused like this is devastating. I’ve got to fight back. 'I’m the only one in the ring at the moment and I’ve got people now helping me which I feel better for. And they will get to the bottom of it. Presenter: Starr had denied ever meeting Ms Ward - who claims he tried to molest her in Sir Jimmy Savile's (pictured in 1982) BBC dressing room . 'We will get to the bottom of it. I will take this evidence down to the police station and show them. I want a police investigation. I want a police investigation. I want them to interview me.' Starr said he did not recall ever meeting Ms Ward, and even viewing the footage did not jog any memories. 'Look, I’m in a studio full of people and walked past her. You’re asking me 40 years ago, do I remember? I get asked silly questions like this from the audience - ""I met you 35 years ago, do you remember?"".' He went on: 'I do not like being tarred with the same brush as Jimmy Savile if he has been doing this.' Asked how he felt about the claims, he said: 'It’s making me feel ill. I am mortified. Absolutely mortified by it.' Starr’s lawyers issued a . statement strenuously denying the . ‘awful allegation’ of abuse. A spokesman for Starr said: . ‘Freddie is now 69 and cannot be expected to recollect every show that . he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has met. 'It would . now appear from seeing footage of a Clunk Click show aired in 1974 that . in fact Freddie was mistaken and therefore that he had in fact been on a . Jimmy Savile show. ‘However this does not detract away . from the fact that Freddie vigorously denies the awful allegation that . has been made by Karin Ward, which despite this footage is still totally . unsupported and uncorroborated by any other evidence.’ Miss Ward – who also claimed to have . seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in . Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the . now-defunct Duncroft School for girls. Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded. Yesterday, Biddy Baxter, the former editor of Blue Peter told Radio 5 Live how she was a victim of sexual harassment at the BBC. Miss Baxter, 79, who held the position . between 1965 and 1988, said she endured ‘several slightly hairy . encounters’ with overly-friendly male producers during her early career. She added: ‘There’s been such a change . of culture since then. Now, that sort of incident is taken notice of . whether that’s a good thing or not.’ A campaign was launched yesterday to . posthumously strip Sir Jimmy Savile of his knighthood.

Possible target: Saad Al-Hilli's company may have been watched by Iranian intelligence agents . The satellite firm that employed Alps murder victim Saad Al-Hilli may have been targeted by Iranian intelligence agents desperate to get their hands on high-resolution images of their enemies’ defence and weapons sites. Mr Al-Hilli, a British Iraqi, had been working on a secret aeronautical project at Surrey Satellite Technology in Guildford. The Mail on Sunday has established that part of his role was with the company’s renowned digital imaging enterprise, based close to its headquarters. The 50-year-old engineer, his wife Iqbal, her mother and an unrelated French cyclist were shot dead in a wood near Lake Annecy on September 5. His daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack. Security sources say Surrey Satellite Technology had ‘been of interest’ to MI5 for ten years, with the agency conducting surveillance on British-based individuals who made contact with the firm. At the time of his death, Mr Al-Hilli was also involved in an aerial photography company, AMS 1087, based in Swindon. Last night his partner in that business, James Barnett, said he did not wish to discuss his work or his relationship with Mr Al-Hilli. One security expert said: ‘The Iranians are desperate to acquire cutting-edge technology, which they cannot legally obtain. 'If they were either getting it from Mr Al-Hilli, or hoped to get it from him and he refused, they would not think twice about killing him.’ Iran’s key focus would most likely be Israel, which is fiercely protective of high-resolution satellite images of its facilities. Scene: Aerial photo of the Al-Hillis' car at the murder scene in the French Alps where Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law, were killed . Ali Ansari, professor of history at St Andrews University and an Iran expert at defence think-tank Chatham House, told The Mail on Sunday that Iran did not want to be ‘behind the technological curve’ but added: ‘I can’t imagine anyone selling this to them.’ Yesterday a judge in Geneva –less than an hour’s drive from the Alpine murder scene – suggested that shortly before he died, Mr Al-Hilli had visited the city where he had access to a private bank account containing a ‘sizeable amount of cash’. In a separate development, it was reported that Mr Al-Hilli had changed the locks of his home in Surrey before he went to France, apparently to stop his estranged brother entering the property. Protection: Mr Al-Hilli had recently changed the locks at the family home in Claygate, Surrey, allegedly to keep his brother out of the property .","Saad Al-Hilli's firm may have been under surveillance by Iranian intelligence .

Darren King, of Derby, was jailed for two years after stealing pictures of his girlfriend's teenage daughter . A paedophile stole pictures of his girlfriend's daughter, who had died of leukaemia, to add to his collection of obscene images. Darren King, 42, stole family snapshots of the girl taken when she was aged four and partially undressed, after her mother confided in him about her agony at losing her child. His partner, whom he had befriended only months after her 14-year-old daughter had passed away from the cancer, was devastated when she discovered the pictures in his flat. She called the police and they found the pervert had thousands of indecent images of other young girls. King was jailed for two years and afterwards the mother, who cannot be named, said: 'It betrayed my trust. 'He was the first person, other than my family, I had opened up to after I lost my daughter when she was 14. 'I now find it very difficult to trust people.' Jailing King, from Derby,  on Thursday, October 4 Judge John Gosling said stealing the photographs was 'grotesque'. He said: 'You stole pictures, taken quite innocently, of the girl partly unclothed. 'She showed you the pictures simply to share her loss with you and you took them to indulge your own fantasies. 'Others (pictures) of her clothed, you left behind.' The woman, who lost her daughter in 2010, began going out with King later that year. The mother uncovered King’s perverted behaviour last September after he had asked her to wait for a delivery at his flat. Police found thousands of images, ranging in levels of obscenity, on the man's computer . While tidying she came across a pile of papers, among which she found the photos of her daughter, which King had taken from her home. The police arrived the same day and took away computer towers and camera memory cards to analyse. They found a total of 4,267 indecent images. The majority were category one the lowest level of indecency but they ranged to category five the most serious level. King told police he had been looking at these kind of images on the internet for about four years. He said he would look at them once and then delete them after shooting a photograph of the image on the screen or just taking a mental note. In court, King pleaded guilty to 23 counts of possessing indecent images. Laura Finch, in mitigation, said: 'He has acknowledged he has got a problem and desperately wants some help with that. 'He is thoroughly ashamed of his behaviour, especially towards this lady. 'At the time, I don’t think he realised the intrusion of the offence he committed. 'He said he didn’t look at those pictures again because of the guilt he felt.' King will serve at least half of his sentence in prison. When he is released on licence, he will need to obey a sexual offences prevention order, which will run for 10 years. This includes banning him from possessing pictures of anyone under 16, without the parents’ permission, unless they are a blood relative. He was disqualified for life from working with children and must also sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years. After the sentencing, the woman, who was in a relationship with King for a year, said: 'I am glad that he will now get help. 'I now just want to try to get on with my own life now and put it all behind me.' Investigating officer Detective Constable Steve Fuller said: 'I have dealt with a number of different cases whilst on CID and I would say that this particular crime has had the biggest impact on an individual I have ever seen. 'Happily I believe that the victim has had a lot of support from her family and from partner agencies which has been of great assistance. 'I only hope that the victim is now able to find some closure and I look forward to being able to reunite her with the photographs taken by King which are of massive sentimental value.'","Police discovered 4,267 indecent images in Darren King's Derby home .

The family of the British football coach brutally stabbed to death in New York flew to the U.S. to join hundreds of mourners gathered at his funeral service. Michael Jones, 25, from Tarleton, near Preston, was stabbed multiple times in a 'frenzied' attack in Manhattan in the early hours of Sunday morning following a night out with his girlfriend. Mr Jones - described as a 'great person' and a 'real gentleman' - moved to the U.S. five years ago to coach youth players with the New York Red Bulls soccer team, and had been hoping to remain in America permanently. In his memory: Friends and a host of former players gathered at the American funeral service for slain British youth soccer coach Michael Jones who was stabbed to death in Manhattan . Emotional: The attendees wore jerseys with Michael's nickname and number on the back . Mr Jones' father Perry, 50, and mother Carole, 53, are understood to have been flown to Tuesday's service - which was packed with players and friends wearing shirts emblazoned with the 25-year-old's nickname, 'Jonesy' - by the Red Bulls. Mr Jones senior has told how his son loved living in the U.S. and working with young players. 'He loved New York and he loved the . lifestyle and he was working and hoping to get a visa so he could stay . there full time,' he told the BBC. Beloved: Mr Jones was well-liked by the young players he mentored as a coach in the Red Bulls' Westchester youth league . He said he and his wife received a Facebook message from one of his son's friends on Sunday telling him to call the NYPD. Mr Jones used to coach Cole Reardon, 12, who described him as 'a great person'. 'I've known Jonesy since I was little, since I was seven,' he said. 'He was one of my favorite coaches. He was always a great person, and he would always help me, and joke around. He could be strict but off the field he was fun.' On the night he was killed, Mr Jones had been out in Manhattan with his girlfriend, Bryeanna Murphy, 23, from Mamaroneck, New York. The Liverpool F.C. fan was attacked near Union . Square after what police believe to have been a case of mistaken identity. The suspect, who has been identified as . either Orlando Orea or Orlando Gutierrez, is accused of stabbing Jones . six times and savagely hacking off one of his ears early Sunday morning . before leaving him to bleed to death. Following an incorrect report that the suspect was in police custody, he managed to flee the country after reportedly buying a one-way ticket on an Aero Mexico flight with cash moments before it was scheduled to leave from Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday morning. Miss Murphy's father said his daughter had been left devastated by her boyfriend's death. 'She can't believe it has happened,' he said. He described Mr Jones, who had been dating his daughter for six months, as 'a real gentleman.' He added: 'He was a lovely guy. Good mannered, good fun, just the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to go out with.' The couple spent Saturday night in Manhattan's East Village visiting a friend's apartment. They parted at around 11.30pm and Mr Jones and a group of friends visited several nightclubs in the city. Mr Murphy said that his daughter last heard from Mr Jones at midnight. She was home by 2am and went to sleep. 'She didn't know anything was wrong,' he said. Despite . the boy's' night out, Mr Jones dutifully called his girlfriend several . times throughout the evening - including just before he was killed. Devoted: Mike Jones, 25, called his girlfriend Bryeanna Murphy, 23, several times the night he was killed . Thoughts of the ongoing manhunt for Mr . Jones' killer were put aside at Tuesday's emotional service, which . featured glowing tributes to the popular coach. '(It) was tearful, a lot of memory of . Jonesey; but at the same time a lot of smiles,' said Dave Jervis, the . Red Bulls’ director of training programs. 'As much of a tragedy as it is, we want to celebrate Michael’s life, and his friends and all the people he knew here,' he told The New York Post. Close: A number of Jones' relatives were flown in for the New York funeral service by the Red Bulls . Football fan: Jones was reportedly very happy working for various American youth soccer teams . Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next . to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, . according to the Post. The footage shows . two men appear to exchange words and begin to argue. The suspect then . suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a building and pulls out a knife. A medical examiner ruled that Mr Jones died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart. A piece of his ear was found on the pavement, and his wounds were so severe police initially believed they were dealing with a Halloween prank. Mr Jones had spent five years coaching children aged three to 13 with the New York Red Bulls, whose senior team includes former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and ex-Everton star Tim Cahill.","Friends and relatives of Michael Jones, 25, from Preston, flew to the U.S. for the emotional funeral service .

The hybrid child of Hindi and English, the language is now becoming India's most important language - to the extent that British diplomats posted to the country have now been told they will need to learn the language. Hinglish is not so much its own language, but the free mixing of Hindi and English words and sentence structures - even within a single sentence. While this mixing has occurred since colonial times, it is now maturing and spreading across the country - meaning a diplomat without some understanding of the Hindi words can be left out of the loop in conversations or miss nuances which could affect relationships and business deals.

Meanwhile words have always moved freely between the two languages - words we used every day in English-speaking countries such as shampoo and pyjamas have their origins in India.

The submarine that sank Argentine warship the Belgrano during the Falklands war was involved in a top secret raid to steal a state-of-the-art listening device from the Russians just weeks later, it has emerged. Details of the daring mission in the Barents Sea, involving the notorious HMS Conqueror, have remained under-wraps for almost 30 years - until now. The nuclear-powered attack submarine famously sank the General Belgrano on May 2 1982, killing 323 men, the day the Falklands war began. Daring mission: HMS Conqueror, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, (pictured) was tasked with stealing a two-mile string of hydrophones, known as a towedarray sonar, from a Polish-flagged spy trawler . But just eight weeks later, the submarine was tasked with stealing a two-mile string of hydrophones, known as a towedarray sonar, from a Polish-flagged spy trawler, close to Russian waters. These trawlers, known as AGIs, or Auxiliary General Intelligence, were dedicated to gathering intelligence and were common during the Cold War, often masquerading as fishing trawlers. The device attached to this particular trawler was wanted by the British and the Americans as it was regarded as the most up-to-date device in Soviet submarine detection technology, the Daily Telegraph said. It was designed to subtly listen to enemy submarines and the Anglo-Americans wanted to find out how the enemy had managed to develop it. During . the 1970s they had begun to notice that Russian submarines were becoming . quieter and faster, and had started to fear that they weren't making as much progress in naval technology as they should be. Sunk: HMS Conqueror famously sank the General Belgrano (pictured) on May 2 1982, killing 323 . men, the day the Falklands war began - but it was involved in another daring mission two months later . Going under: Footage of the Belgrano in flames as it sinks after being hit by HMS Conqueror . Known as Operation Barmaid, the crew, captained by Christopher Wreford-Brown, had been ordered to cut through a three-inch-thick steel cable in order to release it from the trawler, without being seen. They used special pincers, designed by the Americans to do this, in a bid to make it look like it had snagged accidentally and been torn off. After hauling the cable on board the plan was to send it to the U.S. for analysis. The operation required skillful seamanship as the Conqueror had to emerge from below into the ship's blind spot and cut the cable just yards from the vessel and its propeller. Stuart Prebble revealed the operation's details in his book Secrets of the Conqueror and said just one minor miscalculation could have spelled disaster for the whole operation. One of the crew said: 'Everyone in the control room was . tense. We were expecting at any time that . we would be discovered and were ready to run, if necessary.' Captain: Commander Christopher Wreford-Brown, RN, outside Buckingham Palace with his son, Paul, aged 10, after being presented with the Distinguished Service Medal . The Conqueror, based on the Clyde, had tried twice before to severe the cable from the boat before her final, successful attempt in August 1982. After releasing the cable the vessel sank into the depths of the freezing Arctic water without being seen. Had they been caught the crew would have risked immediate attack. None of the crew interviewed for Mr Prebble's book have revealed the location of the operation, but it is believed to have occurred in Russian waters just three miles from the coast. He wanted the Ministry of Defence to release the details under the 30-year rule but they refused. However, they said they wouldn't stop him writing about it. Mr Prebble said: 'This was a quite remarkable feat, a daring exploit that carried with it immense risk'.","HMS Conqueror was tasked with stealing a two-mile .

Barack Obama has come up with another excuse for his poor performance in last week's presidential debate - he now says he was 'too polite' towards Mitt Romney. The President and his allies have suggested a number of explanations for his disappointing display, from Mr Romney's surprise shift to the political center to even the high altitude of Denver. But this morning Mr Obama argued that his main problem was that he pulled his punches against the Republican candidate - and promised to be more aggressive in the two remaining debates. 'I think it's fair to say I was just too . polite, because it's hard to sometimes just keep on saying, ""What . you're saying isn't true."" It gets repetitive,' he told radio host Tom Joyner on Wednesday morning. Scroll down for video . Disaster: Barack Obama has blamed his poor debate performance last week on his being overly polite . Attack: The President promised to be more aggressive when the pair meet again on Tuesday . The president admitted to Diane Sawyer that he had a 'bad night' in the first debate . Speaking to ABC News’ Diane Sawyer on Wednesday evening, Obama denied that his poor showing in their first debate had handed his challenger an advantage in the race to the White House. 'Governor Romney had a good night. I had a bad night. It's not the first time,' said Obama, who was speaking in his first televised interview since last week's debate disaster. Despite Romney surging in the polls following the debate, the 'fundamentals of what this race is about haven't changed,' he said. The President also compared the debates to playing sport. 'If you have a bad game you just move on, you look forward to the next one, and it makes you that much more determined,’ Obama told Sawyer. Yesterday MailOnline revealed that the President initially thought he had won last Wednesday's debate. However, over the next few days it became clear that the vast majority of the public and the media disagreed and judged Mr Romney the winner by an overwhelming margin. On the up: Mitt Romney, pictured in Ohio today, received a poll boost after his debate performance . Heavyweights: Mr Romney campaigned with New Jersey's governor Chris Christie in Delaware, Ohio . On Wednesday morning, Mr Obama spoke . to Mr Joyner in an attempt to explain what had gone wrong and how he . would improve before the second debate on Tuesday. The President avoided a number of . lines of attack of which many observers expected him to take advantage, . such as Mr Romney's career at Bain Capital or his controversial claim . that 47 per cent of Americans are 'victims' who are dependent on . government. But Mr . Obama appeared to imply that he would not be so timid at next week's . event, as he said: 'I think it's fair to say that we will see a little . more activity at the next one.' He also predicted that Mr Romney would run into trouble as a result of apparently changing some of his previous policies over the last few weeks. 'Governor Romney put forward a whole bunch of stuff that either involved him running away from positions that he had taken, or doubling down on things like Medicare vouchers that are going to hurt him long term,' the President said. Relaxing: The two senior Republicans on board Mr Romney's campaign bus following a stump appearance . Allies: Mr Christie was one of the first major figures to endorse the former governor of Massachusetts . Mr Obama addressed the worries of his . supporters who are concerned the debate could carry Mr Romney all the . way to the White House, saying: 'By next week, I think a lot of the . hand-wringing will be complete because we're going to go ahead and win . this thing. A top Democratic aide yesterday blamed the President's defeat on his own lack of interest in serious preparation for the debate. 'President Obama made it clear he wanted to be doing anything else - anything - but debate prep,' the Democrat said. 'He kept breaking off whenever he got the opportunity and never really focused on the event.' During the preparation period for the debate, Mr Obama took time off to visit the Hoover Dam and also joked with a campaign volunteer that his advisers were 'keeping me indoors all the time' and 'making me do my homework'.

Preparation: Two students standing in for Joe Biden and Mr Ryan in Danville, Kentucky, scene of Thursday's vice-presidential debate . In his closing statement last week, the President said it had been 'a terrific debate', apparently indicating that he was happy with his own performance. It was only after talking to his staff and seeing the media coverage that he released how firmly the public perception had swung towards Mr Romney. The day after the debate, campaign chief David Axelrod said the Obama camp would take 'a hard look' at what had happened and would 'make some judgements about where to draw the lines in these debates and how to use our time'. He is understood to have taken charge of debate preparation and be planning on longer, more streamlined sessions with fewer people present.","President promises to go on the offensive during second presidential debate next Tuesday .

Tragic: Greg Bear, 17, had been examined by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died of septicaemia. They all dismissed his condition . A teenager died of blood poisoning after medics dismissed his illness as flu four times, an inquest has heard. Greg Bear, 17, had been examined by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died. After he began coughing up blood - a key symptom of  septicaemia - his mother Elizabeth begged one paramedic to rush the teen to hospital. But she was told his condition was not bad enough and that he should take some paracetamol. The paramedic added: 'If I was to take every 17-year-old boy coughing up blood, the system would grind to a halt,' the inquest heard. Mr Bear's condition worsened the following day. His mother told the hearing that when she phoned trainee GP Dr Christopher Cope for help he also dismissed her concerns. Hours later Mrs Bear dialled 999 and the teen was finally taken to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottingham on December 21, 2010, by another paramedic. He died the following morning. Mr Bear, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottingham, had first gone to his GP, Dr Christopher Woods, on December 16 - the day after his 17th birthday - and was told he had a 'nasty cold, possibly flu'. Giving evidence at the inquest, Dr Woods said he had received a message . stating Mrs Bear was concerned her son 'was burning up' and was 'worried about . swine flu'. He said: 'My initial concern was that this could it be something such as . meningitis, so I asked did he have a rash, which Mrs Bear replied that . he didn't. 'Then she went on to explain that he didn't have any pain in his neck. That reassured me that it was much less likely to be meningitis.' Days later he developed . 'uncomplicated septicaemia' which could have been cured by a course of . antibiotics, but was again wrongly diagnosed with flu. Mrs Bear told Nottingham Coroners Court she had been left frustrated by the medics who examined her son. The day before he died she said it was clear her son needed urgent medical attention. 'Greg was red and had pain in his groin and bottom, he was burning up, he was coughing up blood and bile,' Mrs Bear said. Death: The teen was finally taken to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottingham on December 21, 2010, but died the following morning . 'He was in excruciating agony, his fingers were blue, his face was red and hot. We were told to keep giving him paracetamol and to come in if he got worse. 'I thought I wasn’t getting anywhere, I was left not knowing what to do.' The inquest heard Dr Cope had told Mrs Bear to bring her son . into the surgery but failed to record the information about his . deteriorating condition. Dr Cope, who is now fully qualified, told the inquest: 'I didn't appreciate the blue tinge to him while talking to Mrs Bear. 'I cannot for the life of me understand why. I deeply regret not picking that up.' Recording a narrative verdict, deputy coroner for Nottinghamshire, Heidi Connor, said: 'To Greg’s family there aren’t enough words in the dictionary to describe what you have been through. 'As a family your dignity throughout these proceedings has been nothing short of inspirational. You have done your son proud, if he was anything like his parents, he must have been quite a lad.' After the hearing Mr Bear's parents Gary and Elizabeth said they hoped lessons had been learned. 'Hopefully we can take something positive away from the tragic catalogue of errors which took our son away from us,'” Mr Bear's father said. 'We hope medical professionals can become better at spotting the early signs of sepsis so it can be spotted early and lives can be saved. We don’t want anyone to go through what we’ve been through. 'Something as simple as asking when someone last passed urine can save lives. If it’s a long time it’s more than likely they need to go to hospital. Greg was inspirational to his friends. He was well liked by everyone. He would literally do anything for anyone.' Dr Jim Grey, medical director of East Midlands Ambulance Service, said all staff have been given new guidance on recognising early signs of Sepsis.","Greg Bear's condition was dismissed by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died .

"By . Keith Gladdis, On Board The Van Dijck In The Bay Of Seine . PUBLISHED: . 17:22 EST, 14 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:32 EST, 15 October 2012 . Proudly clutching the Union flag, the crew of the British scallop dredger Van Dijck stand firm in the face of the sabre-rattling French. Militant French fishermen have threatened to mobilise a 250-strong armada against British boats legally fishing for scallops off the Normandy coast. They have already attacked the Van Dijck and other British boats with rocks, iron bars and flares in what the crew have called ‘The French Revolution’. Scroll down for video . Standing firm: Crew on board the Van Dijck, pictured from bottom left to right: Liem Roger, Connor Farr, Skipper Gary Smith, Simon Welch and Steve Joyce; top left: Michael Mcneil; and top right: First Mate Daniel Bassett . Bring it on: The scallop dredger's crew (left to right) pictured are Michael McNeil, Connor Farr, Liem Roger, Skipper Gary Smith, First Mate Daniel Bassett and Steve Joyce . But skipper Gary Smith, 47, says his crew refuse to be intimidated by their Gallic foes. Speaking . from the wheel cabin of his 100ft boat he said: ‘These boys are . hardened seafarers and there is nothing more they would like than a . punch-up with the French. ‘But . I told them we must not retaliate whatever they might throw at us. That’s just what the French want. They are trying to goad us into . fighting back and making us like the bad guys in this. We are not. ‘We . have been fishing for scallops here for years and there is plenty to go . round for all of us, they just want it all for themselves. ‘We have painted a Union Jack on the side of the boat to show we will not be intimidated.’ Not scared: From left to right, First Mate Daniel Bassett, Simon Welch, Steve Joyce, Skipper Gary Smith, Connor Farr, Michael McNeil and Liem Roger . As the Van Dijck rocks from side to side in the rough waters of the English Channel it is difficult to see what stirs up such emotion. But when the huge mechanical arms at each side of the dredger haul up 14 steel scoops packed with scallops the bounty is there to see. 'These boys are hardened seafarers and there is nothing more they would like than a punch-up with the French' Gary Smith, 47, Van Dijck skipper . This is what the French fishermen are willing to ram rivals boats for, and even throw ropes into their propellers. A self-imposed summer ban means the French don’t fish for scallops until October 1. When they returned to the waters they were angry to see how much the British boats had harvested. Armed with rocks and iron bars they left the beaches of the D-Day landings determined to confront the British boats. Van Dijck crew member Liem Roger, 24, said: ‘They came armed with basketfuls of rocks. The skipper told us not to hit back. He said that is exactly what they want but in the end we had to go into the wheelhouse with the skipper because it was the only place that was safe.’ Steve Joyce, 25, said: ‘The job is hard enough as it is. We are all exhausted trying to make a living but we are determined to stand firm.’ In charge: Skipper Gary Smith, 47, (pictured) says his crew refuse to be intimidated by their Gallic foes . The Norman fishermen have a long track record of using force to get their own way. Ten years ago they believed a British boat called the Jacobi was poaching scallops in French waters. Up to 100 French fishing boats confronted the Jacobi and a steel cable was thrown into its propellers. 'The job is hard enough as it is. We are all exhausted trying to make a living but we are determined to stand firm' Steve Joyce, 25, Van Dijck crew member . In last week’s confrontation French fishermen also attempted to snag the propellers of the Van Dijck. The evidence – a long blue rope – is displayed on deck. That attack lasted for six hours and ended only with the arrival of a French Navy cutter. However, it cruised past the French to stop amongst the nine British boats to take down their details. The next day it returned and boarded the British boats to check their papers and that their catch was not oversized and was legal. The following day another French Navy vessel did the same. Mr Smith, who has 20 years at sea, said: ‘It’s victimisation. They want to do whatever they can to find faults with us and kick us out.’ Hard as nails: Crew pictured from left to right: Liem Roger, Connor Farr, Simon Welch, Michael McNeil, Steve Joyce, First Mate Daniel Bassett and Skipper Gary Smith . The French raid began in the early hours of Monday. First mate Daniel Bassett, 27, said: ‘It’s astonishing there was no loss of life. They were firing flares on to one boat, which could easily start a fire. 'The French are being greedy and they want everything to themselves. We won't let them win' Gary Smith, 47, Van Dijck skipper . ‘The worst thing was, the British didn’t do anything about it despite our calls for help. We were just left to our own devices. We didn’t stand a chance against so many French trawlers, especially when they are backed up by the French Navy.’ British fishing boats are not allowed within 12 miles of the French coast but the Van Dijck and other UK boats have not breached that line. New quotas mean British boats can fish for scallops for only 36 days in October, November and December, including travelling time, bad weather breaks and mechanical failure. Mr Smith said: ‘It means we have to make the most of the hours we have. The French are being greedy and they want everything to themselves. We won’t let them win.’","French fishermen have threatened a 250-strong armada against British .

A Russian prostitute wept today as she was jailed for kicking a 69-year-old client to death in his own home after a sex session turned violent. Natalia Woolley was acquitted of murdering retired accountant Winston Fernandez but convicted of his manslaughter and jailed for three years. She had told jurors that Mr Fernandez was drunk, dirty and smelly, locked her in, and then made 'disgusting' sexual demands of her, turning angry and violent when she refused. Jailed: Russian prostitute Natalia Woolley, pictured left from an escort website and right in her police mugshot, was jailed for three years after being convicted of manslaughter by a jury at Guildford Crown Court today . She tried to escape and kicked out at his chest and fell onto him as she tried to break free from his clutches, she claimed. He suffered two broken bones in his neck, 17 broken ribs and widespread bruising. His . decomposing body was found slumped in his bedroom nearly a month later . by police officers, alerted by a concerned acquaintance. Jurors accepted Woolley’s account but felt that the level of violence she used had gone beyond self-defence. Judge Christopher Critchlow told the pretty blonde that he was passing the least sentence possible in all the circumstances. He told her: 'I’m quite satisfied you had no intention that he should die. 'I . bear in mind also there was a high degree of provocation by his . behaviour, that this took place with no premeditation and that he was a . man who could behave in a strange way with an escort girl.' 'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described . herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy . and curvacious', was convicted of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez . Police . were called to the house in, in Epsom, Surrey, on February 13, this . year, and they found Indian-born Mr Fernandez dead in his bedroom, . surrounded by signs of a struggle. Detectives . uncovered evidence that the retired accountant had been using escort . girls for company and sex increasingly in the final years and months of . his life. His wife had died in 2000 and he was estranged from his two sons and had few friends. He was also a chronic alcoholic, the court heard. A . handyman who removed six builder’s bags full of empty bottles from the . garage on the day Mr Fernandez died said he 'barely made a dent' in the . collection. Trial: Woolley claimed she had acted in self-defence after the pensioner made 'disgusting' sexual demands of her, the court heard . With numerous . physical and mental health problems, the victim was known to be . difficult and abusive, even proving a nuisance to emergency services . with calls to police and the ambulance service. Not . long before his death another escort girl’s driver had to return to . help her after Fernandez locked her in and threatened to smash her phone . with a hammer, jurors heard. Woolley, . who was separated from her English husband, with whom she has a . daughter living with her mother in Russia, went by the names Lenka and . Alice on the websites of 24carat escorts and Diamond Escorts. Described . as 'incredibly sexy' and 'all things to all men' on the sites, she was . also listed as being 10 years younger than her real age. She had seen Mr Fernandez three times before she visited him on January 16 this year - the fateful night. On that occasion she was working independently and took a taxi from her home in West Kensington, London, to his home. Early next morning she was at a petrol station in Epsom, using their phone to call for a taxi home.In the coming days and weeks she asked a friend to stay at their home and also for others to drive her to Epsom. She confided that she had trouble with a client or that she had had a fight and wanted to check that the other person was okay. After she was cleared of murder, Woolley began to weep as the jury returned the guilty verdict to manslaughter. Her . barrister, David Lederman QC, told the judge at Guildford Crown Court: . 'The jury must have found there was a stage when the defendant behaved . in such a way that what she was doing was not in self-defence, that the . self-defence became offence, but not with the intention to kill or cause . grievous bodily harm. 'It . is quite obvious that this lady, who is a professional escort lady, did . not deliberately go to that house with the intention of beating up this . man. 'We have a man who has a history of behaviour which is consistent with some form of provocation, to which she overreacted. 'It is not beyond speculative guesswork to say that a younger man would have survived the attack.' Scene: Woolley is accused of murdering 69-year-old Winston Fernandez after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey. She is accused of kicking and stamping the widower to death . The judge condemned her for leaving Mr Fernandez and not calling for help but he recalled the damning evidence about the victim. He told Woolley: 'I’m quite satisfied he could be a difficult man and awkward and obsessive. 'On this night he was very drunk, having been drinking all day. 'The account of what took place that night comes from you and I bear in mind your lack of previous convictions. 'It . went wrong and as a result of his behaviour or you not wanting to do . what he wanted you to do because he was smelly, possibly smelling of . urine, and dirty, there was a struggle between you. 'You tried to leave and he tried to prevent you, and in the course of you trying to free yourself you kicked him.' Despite mitigating factors he said there must be an immediate term of imprisonment.","Mother-of-one Natalia Woolley was jailed for three years for the savage attack .

A nurse has admitted administering ten times the correct dose of salt to a baby who later died but denied falling asleep on duty. After the overdose, four-month-old Samuel McIntosh suffered fatal brain damage and died at a hospital in Nottingham in July 2009. Just days before the blunder, staff nurse Louisa Swinburn, 35,  posted a picture of herself appearing to be asleep next . to the baby on Facebook, without the consent of the hospital or parents, a medical tribunal heard yesterday. Posted on Facebook: Nurse Louisa Swinburn appears to be asleep next to Samuel McIntoch's cot in intensive care days before he died of an overdose at a hospital in Nottingham in 2009 . Intensive care: Samuel had been born prematurely at Nottingham's City Hospital and weighed around a sixth of the normal weight for a full-term baby . An . inquest into the death the year after the incident had heard that two nurses, who . were involved in a 'dreadful mistake' which led to the death, could not . explain how the error occurred. The inquest heard that Sister Karen . Thomas and Louisa Swinburn were 'distracted' by another . staff member as they prepared a solution to correct Samuel’s low salt . levels. As a result of the mistake, Samuel was . wrongly given 50ml of a sodium chloride solution despite a registrar . prescribing just 5ml. Tests conducted on a syringe after the . mistake was spotted showed that the sodium chloride had also not been . mixed with dextrose, as required by the prescription. The error meant the infusion given to . Samuel was ten times the required concentration, causing swelling to his . brain from which he died. Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard Mrs Swinburn, who was not present for the hearing, had admitted administering an overdose of sodium chloride to Samuel (Baby A). She admitted that the overdose . related to a concentration of sodium chloride approximately 10 times . that expected from the prescription. She . has also admitted posting on Facebook, on or around June 23, 2009, a . photo of herself on duty at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS . Trust, and the baby. This was without the consent of the Trust, or the baby’s parents. She denies charges that on the . nightshift of June 22-23, 2009, she fell asleep while on duty, and that . she appeared to be asleep in the photo. A fitness to practice panel is to consider whether her alleged actions amounted to misconduct and if her fitness to practise is impaired. If found guilty of misconduct she could be kicked out of the profession. At the earlier inquest, Paul Balen, the . solicitor acting for Samuel’s parents Robert and Sarah McIntosh, urged . the Nottingham Coroner, Dr Nigel Chapman, to consider a verdict of . unlawful killing. But Dr Chapman recorded a narrative . verdict after ruling that Samuel died after a 'drug error' on the high . dependency unit at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC). He said there was no doubt that a . dreadful mistake had taken place, but ruled that it did not fall into . the category of a gross failure. Sarah, left and Robert McIntosh, right, both pictured with their baby Samuel before he died . Sister Thomas, who was in charge of the unit, told the inquest that she had no clear memory of what she actually did. There had been 'a bit of an interruption', she said. Mrs Swinburn told the inquest she could not recall opening five 10ml vials of sodium chloride, saying: 'Nothing occurred to me at all that we had made an error.' Samuel had been born prematurely at Nottingham’s City Hospital on March 1, 2009, and weighed 1lb 4oz - around a sixth of the normal weight for a full-term baby. He was given a 25 per cent chance of survival. He was transferred to the QMC aged 18 days to receive intensive care and by June there was talk of him going home. But he became unwell again on July 4 . and after blood tests it was discovered that his sodium chloride levels . were low and he was put on a course of fluid infusion. Samuel pictured at one day old. Aged 18 days he was transferred hospital and he was expected to survive . Samuel was prescribed three . milimoles of the fluid infusion per kilogram per day. But his sodium chloride levels remained low and after observations it was decided to give him a separate salt solution infusion. It was then that Mrs Swinburn made a ‘catastrophic drug administration error’ by giving him the fatal overdose. As a result, by 3.40am he had lost . 340grams of weight, 12.5 per cent of his body weight, and was suffering . swelling to his brain. Hannah Stephenson, speaking for the NMC, said: ‘Over the next 24 hours Baby A remained significantly unwell. Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre where Samuel was transferred to aged 18 days to receive intensive care . ‘He remained ventilated and he received fluids to correct his sodium level. ‘Neurologically Baby A had a decreased consciousness level and persistent seizures. ‘His sodium level gradually improved, however, there was no improvement in the neurological status.’ Two days later Samuel’s heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated. At this point doctors determined that the damage caused to this brain was ‘non-survivable’. Samuel’s parents were told and a joint decision was taken to stop his intensive care treatment.He died at 11am on July 7, 2009, sparking a trust investigation. The hearing continues.","Four-month-old Samuel McIntosh suffered fatal brain damage after being given ten times the correct dose of salt after nurses became 'distracted'

The wife of the Republican presidential candidate gave a passionate defense of the pro-life stance held by her and her husband during an appearance on daytime talk show The View. Ann Romney said she will not be the one making the decisions but her husband, who is now running as a pro-life candidate in spite of serving as a pro-choice governor of Massachusetts. 'The good news is, I'm not running for office and I don't have to say what I feel. But I am pro life. I'm happy to say that,' she said. 'He could not have, on his conscience, . creating human life for experimentation,' she said in reference to Mr . Romney's decision against stem cell research during his time as . governor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Her View: Ann Romney appeared on the daytime talk show solo after her husband Mitt cancelled his appearance saying that the co-hosts are 'sharp-tongued and not conservative' Range: The interview began by talking about reproductive rights but then progressed to lighter issues like chore wheels . 'That's when he came out saying he was pro life. I think we all have to . understand this is an issue that is so tender and there are people on . both sides of the issue, with very good conscience, coming with a . different opinion.' ‘Four years ago there were a lot of . other issues on the table. What I hear from women now is “help, please . help,”’ she said arguing that economic problems facing mothers concern . them more than reproductive rights issues. ‘If you really want to make a choice and those choices are about reproductive rights, that’s your choice.’ As governor of the majority Democratic state of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney supported a pro-choice stance on abortion, but as he his campaign has grown now to appeal to the entire country, his position has dramatically shifted towards the right. Currently, Romney says that he would prefer to have abortion rights decided on the state level, with exceptions when it comes to cases of rape, incest, or when the health of the mother is in jeopardy. All told, since 1994, Romney has publicly said that he supports nine different stances on abortion rights. The issue has become a central one to this year's presidential campaign as the next president will likely be in a position to appoint one or two new Supreme Court justices who, in turn, could affect the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortions. While her husband did not attend the show, she was accompanied by her middle son Josh. Ann tried to make light of the . fact that her husband cancelled an appearance on daytime talk show The . View because he thought that the show would be a high risk activity for . him because the five female guests were all 'sharp-tongued and not . conservative'. Support: Josh Romney joined his mother during the show, sitting in the audience and addressing one question from the all-female cast of hosts . On the attack: Mrs Romney said that more women were concerned about economic issues than reproductive ones . ‘No, he said sharp and young,’ Ann joked. He . responded to questions about his brother Tagg's comments that while . watching the most recent presidential debate, he wanted to 'take a . swing' at President Obama because of the accusations he was hurling at . their father. 'It's hard when you're in this process to see your dad get beat up out there... you take it pretty personally. 'I think that's something he was saying off the cuff and I assure you he didn't mean it.'Aside from the pointed political discussion about abortion rights at the beginning of the program, . Ann, wearing a red dress adorned with zippers and a breast cancer awareness pin, focused largely on lighter issues like the chore wheel at their house, the family's love of Costco, and her fondness of television. 'I'm a big TV fan, I just haven't had time to watch it,' she said. She said that she has been avoiding television in general because she can't stand watching campaign ads. Guests: Barack and Michelle Obama appeared on the show last month . 'The American people are sick of . campaign ads, am I right?' she said to the audience.

After facing huge criticism for blurred maps, Apple has received an unusual request - to make its maps MORE blurry. The technology giant came under fire for the poor quality of its maps after users found missing locations, areas obscured by cloud and even distorted bridges and roads. However, Taiwanese officials found the maps too accurate - and have asked Apple to blur satellite images of sensitive military installations which are freely available to iPhone 5 users. Part of Hsinchu in Taiwan on Apple's maps - Apple has been asked to removed imagery of a secret base in the area. After widespread criticism of its maps app, Apple boss Tim Cook was forced to make an embarrassing public apology over the firm's flawed maps software.

The defence ministry reacted after the .

'Regarding images taken by commercial satellites, legally we can do nothing about it,' the ministry's spokesman David Lo told reporters. 'But we'll ask Apple to lower the resolution of satellite images of some confidential military establishments the way we've asked Google in the past,' he said, referring to the Google Earth programme. Apple has not yet received a formal request, according to Bravo, a Taiwan PR company handling its media relations. It declined to speculate how Apple would respond to a request. The Hsinchu base houses a cutting-edge long-range radar procured from the United States in 2003. Construction of the radar is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The ultra-high-frequency radar, supplied by US defence group Raytheon, is capable of detecting missiles launched as far away as Xinjiang in China's northwest, military officials say. They say the radar, which cost Tw$36 billion ($1.23 billion and £769,000), is designed to give Taiwan minutes of extra warning in case of a Chinese missile attack.

The wall of water - called The Cribbar - is known as the UK’s biggest wave and was whipped up by 60mph winds. It is created when low pressure systems in the Atlantic trigger huge swells which rise up as they pass over a rocky shelf called the Cribbar Reef off Newquay, Cornwall. Scroll down for video . The wall of water called The Cribbar is known as the UK’s biggest wave and was whipped up by 60mph winds . The Cribbar is created when low pressure systems . in the Atlantic trigger huge swells which rise up . The Cribbar phenomenon happens just a handful of times every winter between September and April. The 24ft wall of water smashed onto Newquay’s Fistral Beach on Wednesday around 1pm amid Britain’s stormy weather - but it has been known to reach up to 30ft. The Cribbar is actually a short series of waves which have earned the nicknames ‘The Widow Maker’ and ‘The Bone Cruncher’ because of the extreme danger of riding them. The Cribbar phenomenon happens just a handful of times every winter between September and April . Despite the danger local surfers Ben Skinner and Tom Butler surfed the wave when it crashed in this week . Some surfers use 'waist high', 'head high', 'shoulder high' and 'over head' as an indicator of wave height. Others measure the wave face from peak to trough - from the bottom to the top . of the breaking wall of water, but it is often difficult to work this out exactly. The other way to measure waves is 'from the back'  - known as Hawaiian Style - which translates to around half of the wave face height. For example a 3ft wave would be considered 6ft wave on this scale. The term 'from the back' relates to when the wave starts to break. It draws water from the shore so that wave trough in the front drops below the average sea level, making the face bigger than the back. Despite the danger local surfers Ben Skinner and Tom Butler surfed the wave when it crashed in this week. The amazing photos were taken by local photographer Geoff Tydeman. He said: 'The Cribbar started coming in with low tide about 1.10pm and lasted a couple of hours until mid tide. 'The surfers are taken out on jet-skis so it takes a while to catch each wave. There was a crowd of people watching them. 'It is thrilling to watch. These guys are riding the biggest waves Britain has to offer.' The .

Primary school exams are to be simplified to accommodate pupils who do not speak English as their first language, the exam regulator Ofqual has ruled. Tests sat by 11-year-olds should be constructed with larger fonts and shorter sentences with fewer verbs. The changes are to be made because some pupils ‘may not understand some of the words or phrases used in an exam or assessment’. 'Dumbed down': Exams in English primary school pupils are to be . simplified to accommodate children who speak English as a . second language . In order to accommodate students who speak English as their second laguage, are colourblind or have learning disabilities, Ofqual is instructing exam writers to ‘dumb down’ exams, the Daily Telegraph reports. The regulating body provides a list of the 1,000 most commonly used English words, instructing test providers to use them. It advised that using complex language could pose a problem for ‘inexperienced readers’ sitting Sats tests in primary schools in England. This has led to accusations that the watchdog is insulting bilingual children and that the guide will lead to a drop in exam standards. ‘There should always be provision for children who speak English as a second language but there is no need to dumb down the exam terminology,’ Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, told The Daily Telegraph. ‘It is an insult to these children.’ Problem: The guide states that complex words and sentence structures could make exams unnecessarily difficult for 'inexperienced readers' ‘A lot of them are very bright, motivated and better at English than native speakers – and they won’t want to be sitting an exam that’s been skewed for their sake. It represents an erosion of exam standards.’ Ofqual defended the guide, saying it was not specifically for pupils who spoke a foreign language, but that the changes would give all pupils an equal chance to show their level of knowledge and understanding of a subject. Easier: The guide instructs test writers to use a limited number of verbs per sentence . ‘The guidance, which was developed in partnership with subject and assessment experts, aims to help achieve this, as well as making sure that questions properly assess the skills and abilities they are designed to test,’ a spokesperson said. The 30-page guide suggests that test designers should ‘present information in short sentences’ and ‘use simple sentence structures with a logical conceptual flow (subject, verb, object)’. It instructs examiners to ‘avoid subordinate clauses’ and discourages them from using complicated sentences such as: ‘The man who was driving the car was in a hurry’ as it contains a lot of condensed information, and should be written as: ‘The man was driving the car. He was in a hurry.’ It encourages ‘simple, active sentences such as subject-verb-object (SVO)’ in favour of passive sentences and also advices test designers to avoid using more than 65 characters in one line. Ofqual also recommends an appropriate font size to be 'between 10pt and 15pt’ and to use ‘underlining, bold, italics, boxes, indentation and shading consistently,’ to make exams easier to read. The watchdog concluded: that ‘test developers and designers need to understand the principles explored in this document if they are to produce “fair access by design” for all pupils.’","Exam regulator Ofqual says primary school tests should be constructed with shorter sentences .

The astonishing new images, released today by the European Space Agency, show the Valles Marineris, believed to be the largest canyon in the Solar System. Stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide, and with a dizzying depth of 10 km, it is some ten times longer and five times deeper than Earth’s Grand Canyon, a size that earns it the status of the largest canyon in the Solar System. Valles Marineris, stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide, and with a dizzying depth of 10 km, it is ten times longer and five times deeper than Earth's Grand Canyon . The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,000 feet / 1,800 metres) at its deepest point. Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history have been exposed by the Colorado River and its tributaries as they cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, creating a vast area that has become hugely popular with tourists. The bird’s-eye . view of Valles Marineris was created from data captured during 20 . individual orbits of ESA’s Mars Express. ESA says a wide variety of geological features can be seen, reflecting the complex geological history of the region. 'The canyon’s formation is likely intimately linked with the formation of . the neighbouring Tharsis bulge, which is out of shot and to the left of . this image and home to the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus . Mons,' it said. 'The volcanic activity is revealed by the nature of the rocks in the . walls of the canyon and the surrounding plains, which were built by . successive lava flows. 'As the Tharsis bulge swelled with magma during the planet’s first . billion years, the surrounding crust was stretched, ripping apart and . eventually collapsing into the gigantic troughs of Valles Marineris..

Lifetime ban: Gloria Dwomoh, 32, poured liquefied meals down the throat of 10-month-old Diamond . A hospital nurse who force-fed her baby daughter to death is facing a lifetime ban from the profession today . Gloria Dwomoh, 32, poured liquefied meals down the throat of 10-month-old Diamond, despite being warned the practice was dangerous. The infant contracted pneumonia caused by having food repeatedly forced into her lungs. Dwomoh was jailed for three years last November after a jury convicted her of causing or allowing Diamond’s death following a three-week trial at the Old Bailey. The Ghanian national remains a serving prisoner, and is not attending a separate central London hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. At the time of Diamond’s death, Dwomoh had been working for St Thomas’ Hospital, Lambeth, and was later sacked after being convicted in the criminal case. Nabeel Osman, for the NMC, told a three-member panel Dwomoh deserved to be struck off for her actions. ‘Irrespective of this course of conduct occurring in a domestic environment, this is conduct fundamentally incompatible with being a registered nurse,’ he said. ‘The fact this related to Ms Dwomoh’s own child is an aggravating feature. ‘She ignored proper, considered medical advice and opinion, and continued with her feeding methods despite criticism. That proved to be fatal ten months into Diamond’s short life. Nurse Gloria Dwomoh and her daughter Diamond who died -  the infant contracted pneumonia caused by having food repeatedly forced into her lungs . ‘It is conduct which doesn’t just fall short of what would have been appropriate in the circumstances, it is in direct contradiction to what would have been expected. ‘There can be no other finding other than one of current impairment [to practice as a nurse], especially in light of the level of criminality that this conduct involved.’ During her original trial, jurors were told Dwomoh fed Diamond from a porcelain jug, a method she insisted was common in her home country.

The baby girl died in hospital at 4.40am on March 3, 2010, after her father noticed she was struggling to breathe. A post-mortem report revealed tiny pieces of food in her lungs, as well as evidence that she had previously breathed in food and vomit on other occasions. It emerged that a string of doctors and social workers had previously warned Dwomoh of the dangers of feeding Diamond using the jug.

She came to the UK on a student visa in 2000 and intended to study fashion. But she qualified as a nurse five years later and has indefinite leave to remain in the country. Dwomoh, formerly of Walthamstow, east London, has not made any formal submissions to the panel that will decide her fate. If ruled unfit to practice, she could be struck off.

"By . Lina Das . UPDATED: . 19:48 EST, 27 October 2011 . She's a scream: Ariana Richards is a respected portrait artist now . During a break in the filming of epic dinosaur movie Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg introduced its 12-year-old star, Ariana Richards, to his special on-set visitor that day, veteran actress Fay Wray. The beautiful heroine of movie classics such as 1933’s King Kong, Wray was known as the ‘Scream Queen’ for her ability to issue blood-curdling cries at the drop of a hat. ‘So Steven brought her right to me  on set and said: “From one great screamer to another,” ’ says Ariana. ‘I think he even dedicated one of my screams to Fay.’ As Lex Murphy, one of the unlucky visitors to Jurassic Park, Ariana’s on-screen howling could shred lettuce. She yelled her head off most memorably when she came face to face with an enormous Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘I remember Steven saying: “Ariana, what on earth are you drawing from when you’re screaming? Were you frightened by a clown when you were really young?” So I guess I must have been doing something right.’ The scene where Lex and her on-screen brother Tim (Joseph Mazzello) have to fend off the advances of a very hungry  T-Rex while trapped in a Jeep is one of the most unforgettable in a film that broke box office records at the time. Released in 1993, Jurassic Park took more than £750 million in ticket sales and, along with two sequels, went on to make almost £2 billion. A Blu-ray version of the Jurassic trilogy has been released — 18 years later, the film has lost none of its ability to scare and entertain. The premise — based on a Michael Crichton novel — was startlingly simple: what would happen if genetically recreated dinosaurs could roam the Earth with humans? And as the story unfolds, we soon get our answer: they’d have us for breakfast. ‘Steven told us that as a child he had a deep longing to live alongside dinosaurs, though obviously without being eaten alive,’ says Ariana. ‘Joseph and I got to live his dream on set.’ Fright night: Ariana, aged 12, in the film . It’s bizarre seeing her today – a woman of 32 and a respected portrait artist – when she’s etched so indelibly in our minds as the shrieking granddaughter of Jon Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a billionaire whose plan to keep live dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park theme park goes so spectacularly awry. Ariana and Lord Attenborough formed a special bond. ‘The warmth he has on screen is exactly what he was like in person,’ she says. ‘He was perfectly cast as the grandfather.’ The film marked Lord Attenborough’s return to acting after a 15-year break, during which he directed acclaimed films such as Gandhi and Cry Freedom. When he won the 1983 Best Director Oscar for Gandhi, he insisted it should have gone to Spielberg for E.T. The two men became friends and Attenborough was persuaded to get back in front of the camera at the age of 69. When Spielberg asked if he would be able to perform a particularly challenging scene,  ‘Richard just said: “Steven, I lived through the Blitz. Don’t you worry about me,” ’ says Ariana. ‘He always had a twinkle in his eye. I knew more about his brother David from The Trials Of Life on TV. Not that I told  Richard that. ‘I just wish I’d had more scenes with him and had kept in touch with him after filming. I did keep in touch with Steven. He never failed to send me a birthday or Christmas gift every year.’ The film also featured Sam Neill, who took the role of paleontologist Dr Alan Grant after Harrison Ford and William Hurt turned it down. Laura Dern played his girlfriend and Jeff Goldblum was Dr Ian Malcolm. Yet the real stars of the movie were the dinosaurs. Though today’s cinema-goers are used to the wonders of CGI, the beasts in Jurassic Park were a blend of computer wizardry and animatronics. ‘That scene where I’m looking terrified as the car is attacked wasn’t that hard because the entire T-Rex head was in my face,’ says Ariana. ‘People assume I was looking at a tennis ball on a stick, but they built this huge model. I could see its eyes moving and its body breathing. It was pretty scary.’ Groundbreaking: A scene from the 1993 film Jurassic Park, which broke box office records when it was it was released 18 years ago . The T-Rex was 24ft long, weighed four tonnes and was considered ground-breaking stuff. At the other end of the scale, in the scene where a Velociraptor opens the kitchen door, a glove puppet was used.

With dinosaurs getting a new lease of life in the TV series Terra Nova (executive produced by Spielberg), there’s talk of a fourth Jurassic film. ‘I think it would be great to bring back Jurassic Park,’ says Ariana. ‘I had no inkling at the time how big the movie was going to be.

A 'fresh' Martian meteorite that fell to Earth last year contains unique evidence of water weathering on the planet’s surface. The rock, blasted off Mars some 700,000 years ago by an asteroid or comet impact, also bears traces of the planet’s atmosphere, say scientists. Analysis of samples of the meteorite indicates it originated on or near the Martian surface. 'Fresh': The 1.1kg chunk of the meteorite, named Tissint after the Moroccan town near where it fell last year, that is now on display in the Natural History Museum in London . There are also signs of elements being carried into cracks in the rock by water or fluid - something never seen before in a Martian meteorite. Martian meteorites allow scientists to study the planet’s geology on Earth without having to mount expensive space missions. However most are not found until long after their arrival, allowing them to be spoiled by Earthly contamination and chemicals. The new meteorite, known as Tissint, is one of only five to be collected after being spotted falling to Earth. Having broken up in the atmosphere, fragments of the rock landed on a desert region of southern Morocco near the town of Tissint on July 18 last year. The pieces were analysed by an international team of scientists that included experts at London’s Natural History Museum. A one kilogram lump of the meteorite measuring about 12 centimetres across is now on display in the museum’s The Vault gallery. Dr Caroline Smith, meteorites curator at the Natural History Museum, said: 'Any meteorite that is seen to fall - they’re called ""fall meteorites"" - are particularly interesting because they suffer from very little contamination. 'One of the main things we found was that some of the chemical signatures in this meteorite indicate it must be from quite close to the surface of Mars, or even on the surface.' Not Mars: It's actually the desert area near the Al Aglaab mountains in southern Morocco where the Tissint meteorite fell . The meteorite contains large amounts of black glass, created by heat from a shock impact melting rock. Scientists know that elements found inside the glass cannot have resulted from contamination from Earth. NASA has revealed new close up pictures of a mysterious object found on the Martian surface near Curiosity. The rover detected a bright object on the ground when it started to collect and sift Martian soil for the very first time. Officials suspect the object is a piece of plastic from the rover which has dropped off, according to an initial report which describes the object, pictured below, as 'benign'. However they have taken a decision not to sample or scoop any more soil until they can confirm what the unidentified object is - leaving Curiosity with a scoop full of Martian soil. One of the rover drivers, Scott Maxwell said on Twitter that the entire team was working hard to figure that out what could have possibly come loose from the rover and they are 'crawling over rover model, tracking down testing records, etc. 'We simply don’t know yet.' Soon after NASA announced the discovery of the bright object, a humorous picture of it was posted on Twitter with the added commentary 'Oh no! I dropped my keys!!'. One of them turned out to be cerium, an element from the Martian surface. The unusual levels of cerium suggested they had been deposited by a leeching process involving water. 'This enrichment has happened because of the weathering process you get at the near surface of Mars,' said Dr Smith. 'Water, or fluids, have picked up the cerium and gone into gaps in the rock.' No-one knows when this occurred, but it would have been some time before the rock was ejected from Mars. Nitrogen originating from Martian atmosphere was also identified in the black glass. Findings from the research, conducted by 20 scientists in five countries, appear today in the journal Science. Lead researcher Professor Hasnaa Chennaoui Aoudjehane, from the Hassan II University in Casablanca, Morocco, said: 'The Tissint Martian meteorite found in Morocco is very important because it is so fresh. 'We have conclusively shown, for the first time, the chemical signatures of weathering processes on Mars.' Dr Smith said scientists on Earth could analyse the rock with a precision not possible using robots such as the rover Curiosity, which recently landed in a Martian crater. 'Meteorites are known as the poor man’s space probe,' she said. She added there was absolutely no suggestion of any sign of Martian life in the meteorite. 'I can say hand on heart that people have not found anything indicative of little green men or little green bugs,' she said. In 1996 scientists at the American space agency Nasa claimed to have discovered evidence of fossil microbes in a Martian meteorite from Antarctica known as ALH84001. Since then other experts have argued that the 'bugs' probably have a non-biological origin.","The rock was blasted off the surface of Mars some 700,000 years ago .

The coalition risked descending into political infighting today, after David Cameron suffered his first significant Commons defeat at the hands of Labour and Tory rebels demanding a tougher stance on the EU’s budget. Tory rebels claimed they had defied the . Prime Minister to vote for the British people, while loyalists warned . Conservatives must ‘get a grip’ and support Mr Cameron or face defeat at . the 20-15 general election. Chancellor George Osborne refused to say a real-terms reduction in Brussels spending was impossible but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned those demanding a cut had ‘absolutely no hope’ of achieving their goal. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed over the . government's stance on the EU budget at Prime Minister's Questions in . the Commons today . Announcement: Commons Speaker reads the result in the House of Commons last night. MPs voted for a cut by 307 votes to 294 . Result: The result is announced to the House as MPs watch on . Mr Cameron will go to next month's European Council summit calling for a real terms freeze in the EU's seven-year budget. But MPs instead backed a call for a cut by 307 votes to 294. Mr Cameron has faced repeated comparisons to John Major, whose premiership was dominated by Tory splits over Europe and endless debates on the Maastricht Treaty which eroded his authority. Tory MP Tony Baldry warned Mr Cameron's hopes of winning the next election had been damaged by last night's vote. 'Colleagues have got to realise that we've got to get a grip and support the Prime Minister. 'Electors do not vote for parties that they see as being divided. I do not believe that the Conservative Party should be putting itself in the position to lose the next general election,' he told BBC Radio 4. The PM yesterday indicated he would use Britain’s veto unless Brussels agreed to limit its budget increases to the level of inflation. But this did not satisfy the Eurosceptics in his party, who insist on a real-terms reduction. In the first major defeat of Mr Cameron’s premiership, a total of 53 Tory backbenchers voted with Labour, which was accused of cynically shifting its position on EU spending earlier this week to embarrass the Prime Minister. Senior government figures had spent the day pleading with rebel Tories to accept that a real-terms budget freeze was the best possible outcome from a crunch EU summit next week. Today Mr Osborne sought to placate the rebels, saying he understood the ‘frustration’ of MPs over ‘outrageous’ rises in EU spending. He declined to say whether he believed a real-terms cut was possible and played down the significance of last night's vote as a ‘debate about tactics’. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said those calling for a cut in the EU budget had 'absolutely no hope' of achieving their goal . ‘What we have got to do is come to a position that is agreed by the other countries and that the House of Commons accepts. That's the circle we've got to square,’ Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4. ‘What you saw last night was a debate about tactics, about the start of a negotiation, understandable frustration from MPs on all sides of the Conservative Party and the House of Commons that the European Union is spending too much.’ He also attacked Labour, claiming its tactics reminded him of the ‘unprincipled’ stances taken by Conservatives in the wake of the Labour landslide in 1997. Foreign Secretary William Hague earlier said ministers would ‘hear and take notice’ of what Parliament had said. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg aimed insisted the Coalition Government’s position remains the same. ‘We will not accept an increase, above inflation, to the EU Budget.  That is a real terms freeze. And we will protect the British rebate in full. That is the toughest position of any European country.’ In a speech to be delivered to the Chatham House international affairs think-tank, he also turned his fire on Labour, angrily accusing them of a ‘dishonest’ and ‘hypocritical’ change of policy for short-term political advantage. ‘In pushing a completely unrealistic position on the EU budget - one that is miles away from any other country's position - Labour would have absolutely no hope of getting a budget deal agreed.’ Ministers insist there is no chance of . persuading all other 26 EU member states to accept a real-terms cut in . spending, since 17 of them get more out of Brussels spending than they . put in. However, they . believe that with most governments being forced to tighten their belts . at home in an age of austerity, there is scope for an agreement on a . freeze. At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘This Government is taking the toughest line in these budget negotiations of any government since we joined the European Union. ‘At best we would like it cut, at worst frozen, and I’m quite prepared to use the veto if we don’t get a deal which is good for Britain. But let’s be clear – it is in our interest to try to get a deal because a seven-year freeze would keep our bills down compared to annual budgets.’ If Mr Cameron does wield Britain’s veto, no deal will be reached – and under the EU’s rules, the current year’s budget is rolled forward, plus inflation. Annual budgets can be agreed by a majority of member states, rather than the unanimity required for a longer seven-year agreement. But last night’s vote will increase the pressure on the Prime Minister, who last year became the first to deploy the veto when he refused to sign up to a treaty on ‘fiscal union’, to repeat the exercise at a summit next month. Enlarge . Financial Secretary to the Treasury Greg Clark said in yesterday's debate: ‘We want to see the EU budget cut. Part of the negotiating mandate that the Prime Minister has agreed is that the very most that we would accept would be a real-terms freeze. ‘If there is no cut or no real freeze, there is no deal. The framework will be vetoed. The Prime Minister has a formidable task in persuading other countries of this, many of whom were looking forward to a seven-year payout.’ Rebel Douglas Carswell said: ‘This is not about Tory divisions or Labour hypocrisy, it’s the moment the House of Commons finally said, “Enough is enough”. Enough to the Whitehall elite and the Eurocrats. We will not put up with it any more.’ Peter Bone, another Eurosceptic MP, hailed what he called a ‘remarkable victory’. ‘Parliament spoke for the people,’ he said. ‘There was enormous pressure on colleagues to vote with the Government. It was a very significant victory for the people. It was because MPs have to face their constituents.’ There were bizarre scenes in the Commons as backbench Tories clashed with each other and with Labour members. Veteran MP Edward Leigh compared his colleague Sir Tony Baldry to wartime prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who was accused of selling out to Hitler, after Sir Tony warned it would be an act of supreme ‘self-indulgence’ to defy the Prime Minister. Remarkable victory: Peter Bone, left, said that the defeat was the day Parliament spoke for the people while Douglas Carswell added that it was the moment the House of Commons said 'enough is enough' Sir Tony denounced claims by the rebels that defeat strengthens Mr Cameron’s position at next month’s summit as ‘cobblers’. He warned that failure to back Mr Cameron would cause the Tories to lose the next election. ‘If colleagues are not prepared to support the Prime Minister, every time they go into a division lobby different from that of the Prime Minister, they are weakening the Prime Minister’s negotiating hand in Europe,’ he said. Abstained: Senior Right-wingers such as former defence secretary chose not to vote rather than side with Labour . ‘We simply cannot carry on with this sort of self-indulgence. If this party hopes to be in government after the next general election, it has just got to get a grip and start supporting the Prime Minister.’ Labour’s Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie, meanwhile, was jeered by Tories who accused Labour, which gave away a huge chunk of Britain’s budget rebate and waved through inflationary increases while in power, of a cynical stunt. Mr Leslie repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would use a budget veto, though his fellow Treasury frontbencher Rachel Reeves had earlier suggested the party might. Mr Leslie said: ‘A real-terms reduction is possible but it requires persuasive diplomacy, careful alliance building and, above all, leadership.’ Senior Right-wingers such as former defence secretary Liam Fox abstained rather than vote on the same side as Labour. But in a hard-hitting speech yesterday Dr Fox warned Mr Cameron that he must threaten to leave the EU or he ‘cannot achieve’ his pledge to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels. ‘If you’re not willing to cross the Rubicon on that point you cannot achieve what we’re trying to achieve,’ he told the Institute of Economic Affairs. Dr Fox said the Tories should enter the next election on a pledge to go ‘back to the Common Market’, stressing economic not political links with Europe and then offer a referendum on the new deal or exit. A source close to the Prime Minister said: ‘We were expecting to lose this vote. Everyone agrees we want to keep down EU spending. The only difference is how you do that. ‘The Prime Minister has made it very clear that a cut is the best case scenario and a freeze is the worst case scenario. He will keep fighting to get the best deal for taxpayers. David Cameron is the only Prime Minister in history to use the veto and our backbenchers understand that. Parliament is absolutely right to express its view. It’s a “take note” motion and we will take note.’","Government loses crunch vote by 307 votes to 294 as Commons demands a real terms cut in funding for Brussels .

'Aggressive': Jan David Morales, who owned a fleet of ambulances in the Midlands, was jailed for child porn offences . The public is being put at risk by dozens of private ambulance firms because they are not being properly inspected by the health regulator, The Mail on Sunday has discovered. In one case, the owner of a fleet of ambulances in the Midlands was allowed to drive vehicles and work  as a paramedic – despite having criminal convictions, including ones for  kidnapping, assault and downloading child pornography. The company, International Medical Assistance (IMA), which has contracts with NHS trusts and provides emergency support at public events, was given a licence by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) last November. Court papers show the CQC granted the registration in full knowledge of Jan David Morales’s 21 child porn offences, for which he was jailed for two-and-a-half years in 2005. But it took the CQC until April this year to stop him from working with patients or driving ambulances, even though he was on the sex offenders register and considered a potential risk to children and vulnerable adults. And even today the company still has its private ambulance licence. The Mail on Sunday has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of other companies have never been properly inspected, with Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks on potential criminals not being followed up. Yesterday, the CQC released figures  revealing that of the 245 private ambulance companies it has registered, only 54 have been inspected. NHS trusts spend millions of pounds a year on  private firms to make up the shortfall in non-emergency patient transport. Peter Littledyke, acting vice-president of the National Association of Private Ambulance Services, said: ‘Our members have very little faith in the CQC. There are a considerable number of services that look good on paper but should not be trading, and certainly not registered with the CQC or any other regulatory body.’ The legal papers, from a tribunal hearing this year, show that the reason inspectors failed to discover Morales’s full offending history was that they had relied on his wife, Luz, to provide a CRB check. It was only when Staffordshire Police contacted the CQC that inspectors realised the potential risk to the public posed by 60-year-old Morales. A full police check showed that in 2006 he was cleared by a jury of  raping a disabled woman in the back of one of his ambulances. Morales had denied the charge. In July this year, Morales challenged the CQC’s decision to stop him working with his ambulance company. A social care tribunal in Birmingham agreed to hear his appeal in private, which meant the case could not be reported. But in a judgment published in the past few weeks, the tribunal ruled against Morales, describing him as aggressive and a potential risk to  the public, particularly children. 'Serious concerns': An IMA spokesman said it had taken steps to remove Mr Morales' directorship and stop him from having an operational role in the business . A CQC spokesman said: ‘During an inspection in early February 2012, we identified serious concerns around  a number of issues, which resulted in us taking action to prevent Mr Morales from driving a vehicle in the course  of providing the service, and from having any direct contact with people using the service. ‘CQC is taking action to cancel the registration of IMA, meaning the  company would no longer be able to provide services. However, because this process is subject to a legal  challenge, we are not able to comment further at this stage.’ Mr Littledyke says he knows of other examples where the CQC has failed  to regulate. In one case a private ambulance operator who was a ‘known  suicide risk’ was approved by the  regulator to run a service. Another private ambulance owner says he knows of a case in which a patient complained that inspectors had failed to check the qualifications of on-board paramedics who had no more than ‘Boy Scout first-aid ’ certificates. In other cases, lifesaving equipment on the ambulances, including oxygen tanks and defibrillators, was not properly checked, it is alleged. The CQC’s own inspections have also uncovered serious concerns with  some of the services they have already  registered. In one example, a patient complained that a member of the ambulance staff failed to obtain her consent before carrying out a procedure involving the recording of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in the back of an ambulance. The woman objected because the ECG was carried out by a young male paramedic and her breasts were exposed. The CQC said: ‘We are strengthening internal processes to support inspections of independent ambulance providers by creating regional networks. ‘We are at the early stages of a two-year inspection cycle for independent ambulance providers and are on track to complete it. We prioritise inspections, inspecting first the services that are suspected of being less safe.’ An IMA spokesman said it had taken steps to remove Mr Morales’s directorship and stop him from having any operational role in the business. He said that a new owner would take over Mr Morales’s financial interest and Mrs Morales would remain with the company. Mrs Morales said that she had told the inspectors about all of her husband’s convictions before IMA was registered.","Private ambulance firms are not being properly regulated by health regulator the Care Quality Commission .

Even the auctioneer admits you could pick up something similar in a charity shop for under £50. But this 'moth-eaten' 1934 men’s fake fur coat fetched a world record £20,400 - 100 times its expected price - at auction after an extraordinary bout of 'bidding fever' swept the sale room. Unloved - and unworn - by its previous owner who was given it as a gift by his wife 20 years ago, the Austin Reed beige mohair plush 'teddy' coat was expected to fetch £200. But the estimate was far outstripped as, to the astonishment of the auctioneer and the joy of the seller, two vintage clothes loving men drove the price up and up during three minutes of breath-taking bidding. 'It was bonkers,' said fashion specialist auctioneer Kerry Taylor, who sold the coat. 'I was absolutely astounded. But we had two bidders who like to win and neither of them wanted to back down. 'The bidding started at £200 and quickly reached £8,000. There was a lull while one of them had a think before it reached £12,000, then another lull before it went to £17,000. 'Everyone in the room was shocked and you could hear a pin drop. When I finally brought the gavel down there was stunned silence then everyone burst out laughing. 'There’s a lot of interest in vintage clothing at the moment, but I never expected anything like this. 'Every now and then you just get these flights of madness when bidding fever sets in. Common sense goes out the window and you have to prick yourself. I think there was probably a bit of machismo involved from the bidders too.' Neither bidder attended the sale in London on Tuesday, bidding by phone instead. Details were released for the first time yesterday when the auctioneers declared it a world record. Buyer and seller both requested anonymity from the auctioneers. All Miss Taylor would say of the mystery buyer is: 'He is competitive and has very deep pockets. And I hope he likes it - he has never seen it apart from in a photograph. Moth eaten: The coat has visible holes and would have cost a couple of guineas - around £2.10 - when new .

It’s a bit moth-eaten and the leather is falling off the buckle. It’s the kind of thing you might find for £50 in a charity shop on a good day.’ British fashion retailer Austin Reed was founded in 1900 when it opened its first shop in London and is known for its menswear, although it began selling women’s’ clothes too in the 1980s. The upmarket chain now has over 70 retail outlets. Sold! Both the auctioneer and seller were shocked by how much the 'moth-eaten' coat fetched . 'Teddy' coats were all the rage in the 1930s when, despite the Depression, fashion was influenced by the escapist glamour of the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Miss Taylor estimated the coat would have cost 'a couple of guineas' - or around £2.10 - when new. The seller, from Cheshire, had bought it second-hand for about £40. She likes vintage clothing and hoped her to get her husband to start wearing some too, said Miss Taylor, but he 'absolutely refused and never put it on'. It had been languishing in a wardrobe for the last two decades, the woman's by now grown-up sons having also refused to wear it. Miss Taylor said the seller watched the auction live over the internet with members of her family who were 'jumping up and down' as the bidding rose. 'She is still in shock but is deliriously happy,' she added. 'She said it was a good job her husband hadn’t liked it.' The final hammer price was £17,000. But with the auctioneers' commission, the total paid for the coat was £20,400. Thrown in with it in the same lot were two 1950s blazers and a red and white striped 1920s men's bathing suit.","Austin Reed 'teddy' coat from 1934 was expected to fetch £200 .

But jeans and high heels is a . particularly urban look, a metropolitan fudge of comfort and effort, . that may not translate to the grass roots. American . magazine Town and Country has noted that together the Camerons exude . ‘modern London posh’, where dark denim and interesting shoes are a . uniform for the women, and the men generally stick to a plainish suit — . suggesting their minds are on more important things than their clothes. Keeping it casual: David Cameron and Samantha arrive at the Hyatt Hotel prior to the start of the conference . No . one can argue with a suit, but some out-of-towners will never view a . pair of jeans as anything but scruff-wear, even if they are teamed with a . pair of glamorous heels. And even in the city this new multi-purpose uniform of the metropolitan elite has its limits. There are still many occasions — such as on the stage in that hall tomorrow, at weddings, christenings, funerals, court appearances and job interviews — when such a casual look simply doesn’t work. Being tall and Matt Roberts-trained slender, Sam looks extremely elegant in jeans and heels. Most political wives couldn’t get away with it. Michelle Obama, for example, always chooses interesting clothes and has an enviously statuesque figure, but the two times she has worn ‘designer’ jeans — a spray-on pair by Helmut Lang and a pair by Alexander Wang that appeared to have been spattered with paint — she got mixed reviews. The first pair looked like she’d never get them off. Fortunately, she did, because it wasn’t a look that worked for her. Her current rival, Ann Romney, unashamedly favours £2,000 Oscar de la Renta numbers, but as her husband is the staunch defender of the one per cent that make up America’s wealthiest citizens, we are unlikely to see her attempting proletariat denim anyway. While Sam’s jeans might be considered a metaphor for the way the Tories are currently viewed: urban, smart, divisive and slightly laid-back, the PM’s wife needs to be careful not to alienate the ladies and gents of the Shires — the bedrock of the party. So come the big speech tomorrow, don’t expect to see her in jeans. Almost certainly they will be supplanted by a more formal ensemble.","The jeans might have been Topshop — the smart money is on the Moto Baxter, in indigo, £40 .

Vintage: Mort Bank sold a gallon of 1992 McDonald's McJordan sauce on eBay for more than £6,000. If you're dining in upmarket restaurants of the kind owned by superstar chefs like Gordan Ramsay, you expect to pay for the privilege. But one well-heeled shopper with a thing for fast food decided he would rather spend $10,000 - about £6,000 - of his hard-earned cash on an old tub of McDonald's sauce. The condiment - a creation named McJordan sauce after basketball star Michael Jordan - languished on auction site eBay for months. Then seller Mort Bank added a 'Buy it now' price and shopper's mouths started to water. Mort told North Dakota's Bismarck Tribune: 'I had this barbecue sauce on the shelf for 20 years. 'It’s probably edible.' It might not taste as fresh as when it was made though. Mort, who owned five McDonald’s restaurants in Bismarck-Mandan and two in Minot, saved the sauce after selling his restaurants in 1996. 'It was in my basement and I would look at it occasionally,' he said. 'I thought it would be worth something some day.' It was only sold in Chicago and Minneapolis. Jordan famously played for the Chicago Bulls. Mort’s ad on eBay for the sauce read: 'A once in a lifetime chance to own the rarest of rare Michael Jordan and McDonald's collectible!' He thinks it is the only tub of it's kind still about. 'I don’t imagine anybody else has one,' he said. The McJordan was a quarter-pound hamburger with smoked bacon, cheese, McJordan barbecue sauce, onions, mustard and pickles. Bank claimed the sauce also is special because Jordan was the first person to have a McDonald’s sandwich named after him. Hungry to win: The sauce was for the first burger named after anyone - the McJordan. It contained a quarter-pounder, smoked bacon, cheese, McJordan barbecue sauce, onions, mustard and pickles. He tried to sell the sauce by auction for four months before he switched to a fixed 'Buy it Now' price. 'All of a sudden everybody was looking at it,' he said. The buyer is from Chicago. Mort thought he was probably a Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fan. The Bismarck Tribune said Mort still has 'at least three storage units' full of McDonald’s memorabilia he has been trying to shift on eBay for three years. His daughter, Margaux Braun of Fargo, writes the words and takes the pictures. He sells and ships them. Items have gone to China, Japan, Brazil and around Europe. The McJordan sauce was his most expensive item. 'I'm pretty ecstatic,' he said. 'You never know what is going to be a hot item.' Happy Meal toys are popular. After selling his stores he had a lot left. 'A lot of them are unopened,' he said. 'I saved them instead of throwing them away.' At the moment he is eBaying a McDonald’s edition 'Wayne's World' VHS tape, a Hamburglar flag and a Ronald McDonald alarm clock. 'If I didn't start selling them I'd be sticking the kids with them,' he said. 'I decided I should start lowering the inventory for the kids' sake.'","Ketchup languished until 'Buy it now' price was added by seller Mort Bank .

A mother who allegedly dumped her baby boy in a trash can three years ago has been convicted of unlawful imprisonment after jurors failed to reach a verdict on a more serious charge of kidnapping. Elizabeth Johnson, 26, suffocated her eight-month-old son Gabriel, put his body in a diaper bag and threw it in a dumpster in 2009, according to the boy's father. Last month, Logan . McQueary testified in the Texas court that Ms Johnson told him . in phone calls and text messages what she had done to their son. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Guilty: Elizabeth Johnson, pictured centre, was convicted of unlawful imprisonment in the 2009 disappearance of her son Gabriel . Authorities said Ms Johnson later . recanted and told police she gave the baby to a couple at a San Antonio . park but she never divulged the couple's identities. It's . unclear whether Gabriel, who would have turned three in April, is still . alive. San Antonio police searched a landfill for him, but his body was . never found, which is why Ms Johnson was charged with kidnapping rather . than murder. The Maricopa County jury deliberated . for a day-and-a-half before returning the verdict today against . Elizabeth Johnson, 26, in the December 2009 disappearance of Gabriel. The . young woman, who was wearing a striped shirt and dark blazer with her . long, brown hair in a ponytail, shifted in her chair but showed little emotion when the verdict was read out. Aggravating circumstances: The court hearing continued after the verdicts to determine whether aggravating circumstances could make Ms Johnson's punishment more severe . No verdict: Jurors failed to reach a verdict on the most serious charge against the young mother, kidnapping . Hug: Elizabeth Johnson, right, gets a hug from her defense attorney Marc Victor . The jury also found Ms Johnson guilty of custodial interference and conspiracy to commit custodial interference. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of 3.75 years in prison while . unlawful imprisonment carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Ms . Johnson, who has been in jail since her December 30, 2009, arrest could . walk away with time served or face a prison term as much as nine and a . half years when sentenced on November 1. The court hearing continued after the . verdicts were read, to determine whether there were aggravating . circumstances that could make Johnson's punishment more severe. She had originally faced up to 27 years in prison if convicted of kidnapping and the other charges. Ms Johnson was initially found mentally unfit to stand trial but later was cleared to proceed. Loss: At the time of his disappearance, Ms Johnson was discussing putting Gabriel up for adoption . Fallout: Mr McQueary, pictured, testified how the relationship quickly broke down after the birth of Gabriel in 2009 . In closing arguments, prosecutor Angela Andrews said Ms Johnson used Gabriel as a pawn in her disputes with Mr McQueary. The prosecutor alleged Ms Johnson ran . off to another state with the child to get back at Mr McQueary after he . ended their tumultuous relationship. The boy's father isn't suspected . in the child's disappearance. Ms Johnson's attorney, Marc Victor, . presented no defense witnesses at trial. He had said the jury likely . would convict Johnson on the custodial interference charge because she . violated a judge's custody order. But he argued prosecutors otherwise failed to prove his client's guilt. Mr Victor described Ms Johnson as an . unsophisticated single mother who was under a lot of stress, was in a . volatile relationship with the boy's father, and was being manipulated . by a woman who wanted to adopt Gabriel. Investigators said Ms Johnson brought . the child from Tempe to Texas, stayed for a week and then took a bus to . Florida without him. Heartbreak: Logan McQueary testified against his former girlfriend, claiming she told him she had killed their eight-month-old son, Gabriel, and thrown his body into a dumpster . Ms Johnson had been fighting with Mr . McQueary about whether to give up Gabriel for adoption. She signed over . temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 . days before she picked him up and left Arizona. The would-be adoptive mother from . Scottsdale, Tammi Peters Smith, was accused of lying on a court document . about the child's possible paternity in an effort to keep Gabriel from . his father. Ms Smith was convicted of forgery and conspiracy to commit . custodial interference. Testifying on September 24, the boy's father said . told jurors Ms Johnson, with whom he had broken up, allegedly admitted . that she just killed Gabriel after driving him to San Antonio. 'I remember asking her over and over . again where she was at,' McQueary said. 'She told me that she killed . Gabriel. She said, ""You made me. You made me kill my baby boy"".' Speaking outside the court, he added to CBS5 that he has not given up hope his son is still alive. Charged: Gabriel's body has never been found so Elizabeth Johnson, pictured in court, was charged with kidnapping . Struggle: Ms Johnson allegedly texted Mr McQueary to say that their break-up had pushed her to kill their baby son . 'It's a slight possibility,' he said. 'It's hard to believe it sometimes when you read the reports and all the investigation.' He added that he was hopeful that his former girlfriend would one day tell the truth. 'I am hoping that someday she will,' Mr McQueary said. 'She's given a lot of different stories and everything is . inconsistent, so its hard to believe anything she says, really.' Mr McQueary stuck . to the story he has told before in his testimony. It is an account he . also told earlier this year during the trial of Tammi Smith. He detailed their rocky relationship and how they started dating in 2007 after Ms Johnson's brother moved in with Mr McQueary. She fell pregnant months later, the Arizona Republic reported. But . after the birth of the baby boy in 2009, their relationship . deteriorated. On December 8, 2009, he moved out of their shared trailer . home in Tempe and took the baby with him - at Ms Johnson's request. Innocent: Mr Johnson told Mr McQueary she wanted him to sign for the baby to be adopted, but he refused . The next day, Ms Johnson called him and . asked for him to sign for their son to be adopted by Ms Smith, who . she had met weeks prior. 'I told her I wanted to be part of Gabriel's life,' Mr McQueary said. 'I didn't want to put him up for adoption.' But she told him he was never going to see Gabriel again, he said. He filed for custody and was awarded shared custody later that month. Ms Johnson was meant to hand over Gabriel to him on December 20, but she never showed up. On December 28, 2009, he said Ms Johnson sent him a text saying she had killed Gabriel. When he called her, she added: 'You made me kill my baby boy.' 'I just kept saying, no you didn't,' he told the court. Becoming increasingly suspicious of her, he recorded the phone calls and took them to the police. By the time they arrested Johnson in Miami, Gabriel was gone - and has never been found.","Elizabeth Johnson, 26, found guilty of unlawful imprisonment today in the December 2009 disappearance of 8-month-old son Gabriel .

For this auspicious occasion, Pippa chose a chic navy skirt and matching jacket with cream trim bearing neat covered buttons down the front by Irish designer Orla Kiely, a label sister Kate has worn many times in the past. Her mother Carole looked as neat and sophisticated as ever in a cream dress and jacket. The two, flanked by Mr Middleton on their left, and brother James on their right, waved as their vessel - a recreation of a 19th-century stern-wheeled paddle steamer - wended its way down the river. Scroll down for video . Chic: Pippa Middleton wore a classic navy and cream skirt suit for her appearance on the Elizabethan paddle steamer for today's flotilla.

On the lower deck the boat is fitted with a bar and dance floor . Enjoying the view: The Middleton family spent the day sipping champagne and admiring the majesty of the royal pageant from their excellent vantage point . The fact that they have been included in the Royal Squadron – a handful of boats sailing behind the Queen – is a strong sign of the monarch's cordial relations with Kate’s family. Shortly before last year’s royal wedding she invited Mr and Mrs Middleton, who run a company selling children’s party goods, to dine with her privately at Windsor Castle and subsequently included them in her carriage procession at Royal Ascot. Sources say the Queen appreciates how close her new granddaughter-in-law is to her family and feels their relationship continues to give her enormous stability. Other VIP guests on the vessel include Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympic organising committee, and his wife, Lady Carole. 'Michael and Carole’s inclusion on Elizabethan took a lot of people by surrprise, but the Queen is incredibly supportive of the duchess and her family,’ said a palace source last month.

The 235-seater vessel also has an upper-deck walkway which offers the largest outside area of any Thames riverboat and will provide its occupants with an unrivalled view of events on the day. The normal cost of a charter for the privately owned boat is £650 an hour. The £10.5million pageant has seen a flotilla of 1,000 boats and more than 20,000 participants take to the water in the largest celebration to be staged on the Thames for more than 300 years.

Violent crime: Vincent Kershaw was found dead on his kitchen floor with injuries to his head and unpacked bags of shopping around him . An elderly widower was found battered to death at his home after revealing he had a secret hoard of paintings by LS Lowry. Retired wagon driver Vincent Kershaw, 84, told neighbours about the stash of valuable works at his home in Milnrow, near Rochdale, shortly before he was found dead in his kitchen. Mr Kershaw, who had been friends with the iconic artist in the 1950s, was known for carrying large wads of money with him and drove a silver BMW sports car. The pensioner was found dead at home last Sunday, when police alerted by a tip-off broke into . his house and found his body in the kitchen surrounded by his . shopping bags which had still not been unpacked. Detectives fear he was followed home from a supermarket and may have been lying dead for up to ten days. It . was initially believed that Mr Kershaw could have died from natural . causes but further tests showed he had died from fatal head injuries. Greater Manchester Police have been examining his home to establish what items may be missing. He had lived alone at the £80,000 semi since his late wife Bridget was admitted to a nursing home suffering from Alzheimers disease. She died earlier this year aged 83. Neighbour . John Ingham, a bricklayer, 51, said: 'Vincent was a nice fellow. He and . Bridget had no children together but they were very devoted to each . other and lived in the house for about 50 years.

Hoarder: Mr Kershaw had told people about his paintings by iconic artist LS Lowry, who was famous for atmospheric views of his beloved Manchester. It is not known which works the 84-year-old owned . 'After she was admitted to the care home he would go and see her every day. I last saw him a couple of weeks ago when I was bringing in my washing, he was looking okay, a bit frail and was shuffling about but he was still okay for his age. 'I got back from a car boot sale on Sunday afternoon and the street was full of police and forensics and then in the evening two ambulances came. 'I’d gone into my house and I can see into his and saw him lying on the floor between the living room and the kitchen. It was a terrible scene.' He added: 'I do wonder whether Vincent . was targeted. He always carried a lot of money with him, hundreds, maybe . even thousands in his pockets and he was a bit of a bugger for flashing . his money. Helpless: Mr Kershaw had lived alone since his wife died and was well known in the area . 'He didn’t drink or smoke and didn’t have any home help, he would do all his own shopping. He used to drive but he got his licence taken away - I think it was because he was getting on. 'He was a mechanic before he retired and before that he said he was a wagon driver and used to pick up coal from Barnsley. 'One day he was showing me these pictures, he said, ""have a look at these"". I knew they were Lowry but I thought they were only prints and wouldn’t be worth anything. 'They were like what you’d pick up at a car boot sale. 'But then I was speaking to him again and he pulled me to one side and said that in the 50s he used to pick up the coal from the factories over near Barnsley when there was no motorway. 'His lorry had broken down and he’d gone to this house and it turned out to be the home of Lowry. From then on he used to stay there three times a week. He said that Lowry had given him an original painting. Tragic episode: The 84-year-old was friends with the artists in the fifties, and stayed at his house three times a week when picking up the coal from factories near Barnsley . 'Vincent said he did have some prints but that he did have an original, I don’t know what it was but I had no reason to doubt him.' Neighbour Angela Burleigh, 45, said: 'He was a lovely old man and would always stand at his gate, I think he knew what times people were coming and going and he always gave you all the gossip. He knew everything about everyone because he was a long standing resident. 'The thing is you wouldn’t know if there was anything wrong because he always used to keep his curtains shut. He used to say to me, ""I keep my curtains closed because I have got lots of valuable artwork and I don’t want anyone to see"". 'He’d never tell me what they were. I don’t know if he was rich but he used to have a silver BMW sports car.' Another neighbour John Platt, 61, added: 'He was his own character and liked to do things his way. He was always very smartly dressed and visited Bridget in the home for quite a few years before he died. 'I thought he had died of natural causes but the police are now saying it’s suspicious.' A mother of two who did not give her name added: 'Apparently they found him on the kitchen floor with head injuries and he still had his shopping in the bags from the local Tesco. Brutal attack: The widower was savagely beaten in what police suspect was a bungled burglary . 'The receipt had said it was the 4th October when he did his shopping. I think he’d got the bus to the shops, it’s only about 10 minutes away in Milnrow village. 'Apparently he’d been found with a piece of the kitchen unit in his head, his door was unlocked but his keys were in the back of the door. He hadn’t even unpacked his shopping and his wallet was missing. 'He was quite a feisty character, I think they are thinking someone followed him from the supermarket.' Detective Chief Inspector Alistair Mallen said; 'We cannot say if anything was missing from the house as he was a bit of a hoarder. He picked up his pension from Milnrow Post Office on October 4 at approximately 10am and we know he carries a lot of money. 'We have not found the wallet but we have got to go through the house and search. 'We know he went for his pension and then at 1pm went to Tesco Express to get his groceries. 'On Sunday at 5.10pm we received a call a concern for his welfare as some of his neighbours had not seen him for a while. 'He was a fiercely independent chap who lived here on his own, his wife passed away in July. He looked after himself, was well dressed, got out and managed his own affairs.'

In a candid new autobiography, the food critic said the man, who was in his 60s, kissed him on the mouth after telling him he would 'show you what happens when you get a girlfriend'. He told how he clearly remembers his 'hot, stinking, tobacco breath' before adding: 'I turned to jelly, in a state of total confusion.' My sex abuse hell: MasterChef star Gregg Wallace, pictured with new girlfriend Cara Franco, has revealed how he was kissed on the mouth by his babysitter's husband when he was eight years old . The 48-year-old said he fell victim to the man, called George, while he was living in Peckham, south London. In his book Life On A Plate, he writes: 'While my babysitter Bernie seemed a kindly woman, her husband, George, was often there too, a tall scrawny man in his 60s, who chained-smoked roll-ups.' A few days after the kissing incident, he said George tried to get Mr Wallace to come for 'a lie down' in his bedroom, but he refused. The former greengrocer went on to explain why he never felt able to speak out about his horrific experiences until now. Fears for the future: The TV personality told how he was 'scared of marrying again' after splitting up with his third wife Heidi Brown (pictured) after just 14 months of wedlock . He said: 'I never did tell mum, or . anyone else. I didn't really understand what had happened and somehow I . knew he (George) would also be in really big trouble. 'I didn't, until I got older, consider myself a victim. Instead, I felt ashamed, as if I was complicit.' Mr Wallace, who has a 15-year-old daughter Libby and a son Tom, 18, later told The Sun that he was encouraged to finally shed light on the abuse by his ex-wife Heidi. He also revealed how he was 'scared of marrying again' after splitting from third wife Heidi, 30, in March after just 14 months of wedlock.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:29 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:12 EST, 18 October 2012 . The dangers of Chinese sky lanterns are to be examined by a government study which could pave the way for them to be banned, MailOnline has learned. Ministers are poised to launch an independent study to assess the scale of the risks posed to livestock, crops and the environment. The probe will look at international efforts to limit their impact and consider their value to the economy after a boom in popularity of releasing the lanterns at weddings, festivals and parties. A government study into the safety of sky lanterns will examine their use around the world. Dozens are pictured being released in Thailand . The image of sky lanterns filing the sky has made them popular for weddings, parties and festivals but ahead of Bonfire Night, ministers are urging people to think twice about using them . Farming leaders have long called for a ban on the lanterns, complaining that when the wire frames fall back to earth they can be eaten by cattle. Several cows have died as a result of choking on small pieces of wire chopped up into hay or silage when crops are harvested, according to the National Farmers’ Union. New farming minister David Heath, who warned of the dangers of the lanterns in opposition, is to order a study into the dangers and urged people to ‘think carefully’ before using them. He said: ‘The Government is aware of . concerns about the impacts of sky lanterns on animals, crops and . property and has taken steps to raise public awareness about the . potential dangers sky lanterns pose, and to encourage people to think . carefully before using them. New Farming Minister David Heath said an independent study would look at the risks posed to the environment, livestock and plants . ‘We will continue to look for further opportunities to do this over the coming months, especially as we approach bonfire night. ‘In order to assess the extent of the dangers posed by sky lanterns and possible steps to address such dangers, Defra proposes to commission an independent study to examine in detail the scale of the risks associated with the use of sky lanterns, and their impact on livestock, plants and the environment. ‘The results of this study will help inform any future Government action.’ Before the general election Mr Heath suggested he did not want to ban the lanterns, but there are concerns that even a move to alternatives using wicker instead of wire have failed to remove all the risks. In addition to the threat posed to livestock, there are also dangers that a lit flame could ignite crops or hedgerows during dry weather. Louise Staples, rural surveyor for the NFU, said today: ‘These types of lanterns may be fun and look pretty when they’re lit but they can pose a real danger to farms and farm animals, especially livestock in fields. ‘Cattle can eat the wire in the lantern which finds its way into the silage they are fed. The lanterns land in fields, are chopped up into small pieces when grass is gathered and made into silage. If swallowed, the wire can puncture the stomach lining, causing extreme pain and in some cases can be fatal. The NFU says some cows have died after choking on the wire frames of lanterns which have been chopped up into feed . ‘There’s also a good chance that the wire part of the frame could get wrapped around an animal's foot, become embedded in the skin and would cause extreme pain. ‘Obviously, fire is also another major problem particularly during the summer. These lanterns can pose a serious risk if they land in a field of crops or straw. Perhaps worse is if they come down near a barn or even by a thatched house which could easily catch fire.’ Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh, who tabled parliamentary questions about the problem, said: 'Many people enjoy letting off Chinese lanterns to celebrate special occasions, but there are complaints from farmers about the harm they can cause to farm animals and machinery. 'We welcome this research into those issues so that the government has the full facts at its finfertips before changing the law.' The NFU has urged its members to contact any venues near their farms using lanterns to warn them of the dangers and pleasing with them not to use them. A Defra spokesman said: ‘Given the concerns and complaints that are being made about the damage sky lanterns can do, we want to find out just what effect they are having on farming and the environment.’","New farming minister David Heath commissions an inquiry into the impact of the lanterns on the environment, livestock and plants .

Katie Krivan says she feels lucky to be alive after surviving breast cancer when she was just 30 . A woman who volunteered to work with lions said one saved her life... after biting her on her breast. Katie Krivan, 30, was working as a volunteer at a lion park in South Africa last year when the nine-month old cub bounded up to her and bit her. Although the bite was not serious she kept an eye on the wound and the following month discovered a lump. The next month, Miss Krivan, an investment analyst from London, was diagnosed with breast cancer and had emergency surgery four days later. She faced months of painful treatment and worry, but the condition is now in remission and she says she feels lucky to be alive. She said: 'Not many people can say a lion bite saved their life, but it is true for me.' Miss Krivan says she decided to describe her unusual ordeal as October is Breast Cancer Awareness month. She said she had never checked for signs of cancer before and, at 30, never considered she might develop breast cancer. It was only after receiving the bite in South Africa in January last year that she started to keep a close eye on skin near the wound. She said: 'I always liked big cats, so I thought it would be cool to volunteer somewhere I could be with them every day. 'The first day I was there, they took me into an enclosure and a nine-month-old lion ran up and bit me. It wasn’t serious. I just got such a shock, but it left a mark. Katie noticed her lump after she suffered a bite from a young lion at a safari park (file photo) 'It was from checking that that I first noticed the lump and was diagnosed with breast cancer the following month. 'It was the worst day of my life. I went through all emotions at once - shock, denial, anger, hopelessness and devastation. 'I thought: ""This happens to other people, not me. I’m too young.""' After having surgery, she was put on a course of chemotherapy. 'I was so sick that I couldn’t even get out of bed,' she said. 'I suffered insomnia, mouth ulcers, mouth thrush, achy body, headaches and was often near to collapsing. I also lost my nice thick hair - which was devastating.' Miss Krivan praised staff at the Haven breast cancer centre in Fulham who have supported her in her struggle to beat the disease. She added: 'Looking back, I can’t believe what I have gone through. 'People tell me I’ve coped amazingly, but the truth is that I do worry that the cancer will come back. For now though, I am just so grateful to still be alive.'","Katie Krivan received nip on the breast from lion cub in South Africa .

Encore of silence: Bruce Springsteen's microphone was cut off during the Hard Rock Calling Festival as he was joined on stage by Sir Paul McCartney . Legendary performance: Paul McCartney joins Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band on stage . Then, suddenly, the music died. Before the stars could deliver their final song, organisers decided to pull the plug – because the event had overrun its allotted time and was in breach of noise regulations. With the microphones cut off, the superstars couldn't even say a final thank-you to the audience and had to leave the stage in silence. Among the crowd, confusion soon turned to anger. As they shuffled away into the night, fans took to social media to make their disapproval known. One called the incident 'Rock and roll sacrilege'. Another tweeted: 'Shameful! Springsteen and McCartney caught by curfew.' The headline act at the Hard Rock Calling festival, Springsteen and his E-Street Band had been playing for over three hours when the show was brought to a sudden halt. It was supposed to end at 10.30pm but it was nearly 11pm when organisers cut the power. E-Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt also took to Twitter to express his outrage. He said the stars had planned a final encore number before the sound was cut off. The 61-year-old said: 'One of the great gigs ever in my opinion. But seriously, when did England become a police state? Is there just too much fun in the world? We would have been off by 11 if we'd done one more. On a Saturday night! Who were we disturbing?

How about they go catch some criminals instead of f****** with . 80,000 people having a good time? Last night Westminster Council confirmed it was the concert organiser Live Nation which ended the show. A council spokesman said it did so to comply with its licence, which allowed the event to go on until 10.30pm, adding: 'Licences  are granted until certain times to protect residents in the area from noise late at night.' Those in well-to-do Knightsbridge and Belgravia have badgered the council about noise from concerts in the park. There were 109 complaints in 2011, around twice as many as in 2010. A Live Nation spokesman said: 'It was unfortunate it was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public's health and safety.' London mayor Boris Johnson waded into the row, saying the decision to end the show was 'excessively' officious and if he had been consulted he would have ordered the music should continue. Rousing set: The rockers performed I Saw Her Standing There and Twist and Shout together . As McCartney came onto the stage Springsteen told the delighted revellers: 'I gotta tell you, I've been trying to do this for 50 years.' The pair then delighted the crowds by collaborating on the final songs of . Springsteen’s marathon set. However, the musical veterans both . found their microphones silenced towards the end of their extended . version of Twist and Shout. Springsteen did not seem to notice at . first, and even attempted to address the crowd one more time. But . as it became clear that the sound would not be reinstalled, the veteran . rocker simply shrugged his shoulders and left the stage as baffled fans looked on. Springsteen had apparently been due to finish his set at 10.15pm and was over 30 minutes over the running time. 'English cops may be the only individuals left on earth that wouldn't . want to hear one more from Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney!' Audience members that took to Twitter to express their anger at the decision included actor and comedian Stephen Merchant. He wrote: . 'Ashamed to be British right now. Springsteen and McCartney playing Twist & Shout in Hyde Park and council pulled the plug cos of curfew'. 'Springsteen and McCartney: Only in Britain could a local council pull the plug on the greatest artists of the last 50 years giving it all,' wrote journalist Richard James. The controversial incident has turned London into an international laughing stock just weeks before the 2012 Olympics. Springsteen, who played with his E .

Bruce Springsteen was unable to address the crowd after his final song when his microphone was cut off after he broke curfew . Bruce delighted the crowd with a 29 song set which lasted over three hours . A jubilant Bruce – who changed his clothes during the show - thrilled the crowds with his set, and often left the stage to shake hands with audience members. He sported jeans and a waistcoat over a shirt and at another stage wore a checked shirt. He also made the night for one lucky fan who had brought along a banner asking him to play the song Take 'Em As They Come, and listing the concerts around the world where he had requested it. Fans surely won't have minded their idol being unable to address them after the concert, since he had broken curfew by playing 29 songs in over three hours leading to his microphone being cut off . Taking the banner, Springsteen said ‘Tonight, my friend, this is your lucky night. You're going to hear this damn thing. ‘It's a completely obscure track I wrote for The River when I needed some rock songs.’ Bruce has only performed the song nine times before, the last being almost 10 years ago Copenhagen, Denmark in 2003. Springsteen also made the night for one lucky fan who had brought along a banner asking him to play the song Take 'Em As They Come . Springsteen’s encore included fan favourites including Born In The USA and Born To Run. Other acts on the main stage included Lady Antebellum, Morello and Hey Monea!

"‘Huaman Julia Munez’s case proves domestic violence against men still isn't taken seriously (and that women are no less dangerous)’ By . Peter Lloyd . PUBLISHED: . 07:43 EST, 7 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:39 EST, 13 September 2012 . Earlier this week, MailOnline detailed the story of Huaman Julia Muńez: a Peruvian woman arrested for cutting off her boyfriend's penis and flushing it down the toilet. Her defenceless victim, 46 year-old Ramon Arias Apayco, suffered the violent assault while sleeping in a hostel. Currently in intensive care, he will no longer be able to urinate without medical intervention, enjoy sex or father children. The reason? Infidelity. And suspected infidelity at that. Huaman Julia Mu¿ez was a Peruvian woman arrested for cutting off her boyfriend's penis and flushing it down the toilet . Immediately, the story went viral. News sites across the world re-reported it - some sympathetically, others with glee, as if this terrible assault was karmic revenge for all the hideous sex crimes committed against women since the beginning of time. It's not. It's an extreme form of sexually-related domestic violence - and something which is increasingly common for men across the world. Last year, Katherine Kieu Becker was arrested in California for drugging her husband's dinner, tying him to their bed and severing his penis before destroying it in a garbage disposal unit. When police arrived she told them 'he deserved it'. Why? Because he'd asked for a divorce. In December 2011, 70 year-old Virginia Valdez was detained in Los Angeles for savagely attacking her husband's genitals with industrial scissors. She will now answer to charges of assault with a deadly weapon, spousal abuse and mayhem. Prior to that, in 2004, Liverpudlian Amanda Monti was jailed for ripping off - an attempting to swallow - one of her ex-boyfriend's testicles, simply because he rejected her advances at a party. The woman allegedly flushed her partner's penis down the toilet . And in April this year, Sinead Walker from Bath was arrested for trying to tear her ex-partner's penis from his body with her bare hands. The unprovoked attack, which was also reported by the MailOnline, happened while her victim was already making a desperate 999 call for help. Although these cases seem rare - and people will argue that they pale in comparison to attacks suffered by women - the reality is very, very different. In Thailand, rates of penis removal are so high that doctors are having to specialise in re-attaching severed organs - assuming that patients don't die of blood loss first. These vile crimes have nothing to do with self-defence or survival. They're about women assuming a right to avenge a broken heart. The same misguided belief, I assume, that violent men feel when they throw acid in their ex-girlfriend's face. The difference is, however, that society rightly condemns violence against women - but not men. I was a 12 year-old boy in 1993 when Lorena Bobbitt became an icon for slicing off her husband's penis because: 'He always have [sic] [an] orgasm and he doesn't wait for me to have [an] orgasm. He's selfish.' The price she paid for this? Not a single day in jail. The message it sent out? That men deserve everything they get for having the bad taste to be male. As a child, this incident - and how she escaped justice - resonated with me. Not least because it was celebrated. Intelligent female figures like Jo Brand joked about the matter, creating a culture which cheered violent women. As someone who was bullied by girls at school (because they knew I ethically couldn't - and wouldn't - hit back), I could see the manipulation of my gender on a micro and macro level. Nineteen years on and nothing has changed. Men - like the boys who will grow up to be abused men - are still fed the same sexist mantra that I was at 12: 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. This is particularly dangerous when women they'll share a bed with believe it. The reason? Infidelity. And suspected infidelity at that (posed by model) Twelve months ago, while talking about Katherine Kieu Becker's case on live television, Sharon Osbourne claimed that it was 'fabulous'. The next day, she was forced to apologise through gritted teeth - but clearly had no idea why her comments were so wicked in the first place. And this is the root of the problem: dangerous ignorance. Not least because official statistics prove that men are almost equal victims of domestic violence. According to charity Mankind Initiative, for every three victims of partner abuse, two will be female, one will be male. Likewise, one in six men and one in four women will suffer domestic abuse in their lifetime. The event took place while her defenseless victim lay sleeping (posed by model) Despite this, the lion's share of resources - including government funding - only ever serves females. In fact, most shelters actively turn men away. Don't believe me? Ask Erin Pizzey - the woman who, in 1971, founded the world's first ever domestic violence safehouse. A heroine, she herself had to flee Britain after radicalised feminists sent her death threats for saying that men also suffer abuse. Something which is backed up by fact, after fact, after fact. The added proof that lesbian relationships experience near-identical rates of violence to heterosexual ones is further evidence that women also communicate with their fists. But society continues to fail us by turning a blind eye. Apparently, us men already have it too good. Try telling that to Ramon Arias Apayco and his family who were weeping on Peruvian TV. Yes, my comments will be ridiculed and rejected, but all inconvenient truths are at first. My main hope is that eventually all victims will be offered the protection they deserve: regardless of gender. Hopefully, in light of this week's latest tragedy, the law will deliver a clear message that domestic violence is no less horrendous when the attacker is female.",‘Huaman Julia Munez’s case proves domestic violence against men still isn't taken seriously (and that women are no less dangerous)’

A mother who suffered two miscarriages today thanked TV presenter Phillip Schofield for 'saving' the life of her miracle baby. Shelley Wilkinson, 34, had lost two daughters due to a weak cervix when she unexpectedly fell pregnant again. But as she reacted with fear to the possibility of losing a third child, her husband Andrew, 34, recalled an item he watched on ITV1’s This Morning, presented by host Schofield, about a rarely used 'bionic band' procedure for mothers-to-be. Overjoyed: Shelley Wilkinson and her husband Andrew with baby Lyla. Mrs Wilkinson had lost two babies due to a weak cervix when she fell pregnant again. But Mr Wilkinson recalled an item he watched on ITV1's This Morning about a rarely used 'bionic band' procedure . Just days later Mrs Wilkinson had a consultation at Liverpool Women’s Hospital - within 48 hours she went under the knife for a transabdominal cervical cerclage, a stitching procedure which has been given to less than 150 women in the region. The operation involves fitting a ‘bionic band’ over the neck of the cervix, keeping it shut during pregnancy, protecting the foetus from infection and lowering the chances of miscarriage. The procedure was a success and after resting through the remainder of her pregnancy, Mr and Mrs Wilkinson’s dreams came true when Lyla was born on August 23. Now the happy couple have taken Layla home to Chorley, Lancashire, where she was introduced to her six-year-old big brother Josh. Mrs Wilkinson, a care assistant, today said: 'Lyla’s just perfect, my little miracle - and its thanks to This Morning that I found out about saving her. 'I can’t describe what it was like to hold her for the first time. Andrew and I have been through a lot of despair losing two babies and we just felt joyful to have Lyla with us, healthy and gorgeous. Welcome: Baby Lyla relaxes in hospital shortly after her birth . Family: Mr and Mrs Wilkinson, Lyla and her older brother Joshua . 'The help and support we’ve had from . Liverpool Women’s Hospital and the midwives have been brilliant and I’d . just like to say to expectant mothers who experience problems that help . is out there. 'It just took us a bit of luck by watching Phillip Schofield to find it.' Mrs Wilkinson had been diagnosed with having a weak cervix and as a result her waters twice broke at 22 weeks, in 2008 and then 2010, losing daughters Chloe and Olivia respectively. After the second tragedy Mrs Wilkinson was told her cervix wasn’t strong enough to hold a baby to full term and she was so traumatised that she told her husband she never wanted to have another baby. So last year, when Mrs Wilkinson discovered she was pregnant again she instantly fell to pieces with all the horrors of what had happened rushing back. She said: 'When I fell pregnant again we had mixed feelings as it was very likely to happen again. 'But Andrew remembered seeing something on This Morning about a woman who told how she had undergone an operation in which her womb was tied to prevent the baby from coming too early. Phillip Schofield, pictured with his This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby, is a hero in the Wilkinson household . 'He thought that procedure could help us and I asked for a referral to Liverpool Women’s Hospital. 'It was a bit of a whirlwind but after talking to the consultant I knew it would give my baby the best chance. It was even more delicate because I was eight weeks gone and ideally the operation should happen before pregnancy.' A spokeswoman for Liverpool Women’s Hospital said: ‘The synthetic band, known as a transabdominal cerclage is like a band of steel which is placed at the neck of the womb. 'It has a 95 per cent success rate but is only carried out at a handful of centres in the UK.' A spokesman for ITV1’s This Morning said: 'It’s always great to hear from viewers of the show, but to know that the programme helped Shelley and Andrew with such a precious gift of a baby is just fantastic.'","Shelley Wilkinson had lost two daughters due to a weak cervix when she unexpectedly fell pregnant again .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:48 EST, 7 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:02 EST, 8 August 2012 . Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home . The family and friends of a gifted surgeon killed outside his home reacted furiously yesterday when a teenager charged over his death escaped prosecution. Anthony Owen, 68, was found sprawled on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later from head injuries. A 17-year-old boy was arrested, questioned by detectives and charged with manslaughter. But yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case, saying a pathologist’s report supported the boy’s claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self defence. Without any witnesses, lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction. Mr Owen’s sister, Aileen Hepplewhite, 53, said: ‘To say that dropping the prosecution is a step in the wrong direction is an understatement. ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. Obviously as a family we are disappointed no one  will face trial but that hardly conveys the feelings we have about everything that  has happened.’ A neighbour said: ‘It’s terribly upsetting. I can’t begin  to imagine how difficult it must be for the family. It’s just typical of our justice system. It’s an absolute disgrace.’ Another resident added: ‘This teenager claimed self-defence and with no evidence or witnesses it seems there’s nothing the law can do. ‘It’s a terrible shame and awful for Anthony’s family that they will not see justice done.’ The incident took place in March in the prosperous Cheshire village of Hale. Afterwards three teenagers were seen riding away from Mr Owen’s £750,000 thatched house on BMX bikes. Three suspects were arrested and questioned before one – the 17 year old – was charged with manslaughter. A respected oncologist, Mr Owen began his medical career in 1968 and was awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1973. He was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his tragic death. Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, . Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. The devout Roman Catholic, who had . never married, had lived in Hale for more than 30 years, nursing his . mother Anne, herself a retired doctor, until she died in 2003. Laurie Northern, who attended church . with Mr Owen, described him as ‘the type of man who would stand up for . himself’. And residents living in the village have complained that . teenagers from a nearby housing estate cause frequent problems. Rachael Barber, senior prosecutor at . the CPS, said: ‘After very careful consideration of all the evidence in . this case, including new evidence which has recently been presented, I . have decided not to continue the case against a 17-year-old youth in . connection with the death of Anthony Owen. ‘The youth was originally charged with . manslaughter on the basis that there was  a reasonable suspicion he had . committed the offence and there were grounds for  believing that the . continuing investigation would provide further evidence to support the . prosecution. Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours . ‘Since then, new evidence has been . presented, including the final pathologist’s report which indicates that . the injuries to the victim were consistent with the victim suffering . one blow to the face. ‘The pathologist’s report provides . supporting evidence for the defendant’s version of events: that he was . acting in self defence. This expected further evidence has not provided . us with a stronger case to meet the test of sufficient evidence for a . realistic prospect of conviction.’ She said that without witnesses . prosecutors would not be able in court to rebut the defendant’s claim . that he was acting in self defence. ‘In addition, we took into account . that he had come  forward voluntarily to give his account and that he . has no previous convictions,’ she added. Two other youths, aged 14 and 17, who were also at the scene, were earlier released without charge due to insufficient evidence. Another neighbour said: ‘I sincerely . hope the lad feels some remorse over the death of a wonderful man and a . gifted surgeon who saved and extended so many lives.’ The mother of the teenage boy, whose . identity is protected by law, said: ‘We have been advised by our . solicitor not to make any comment until after the coroner has held an . inquest.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Anthony Owen, 68, found lying next to his white Honda Civic near home .

The CEO of ExxonMobile says fossil fuels might be causing the Earth to warm, but says a collaboration of scaremongering environmentalists, 'lazy journalists' and the 'illiterate public' are blowing the problem out of proportion. Rex Tillerson, who leads the world's largest oil company, believes the true impact of climate change cammot be accurately predicted by scientists. And whatever fallout might come from the, he said, humans will be able to adapt. Meanwhile, scientists claim the disastrous effects of global warming are on display across the nation right now, as American celebrate the July Four holiday with record heat, dangerous thunderstorms and the remnants of horrific wildfire still burning in Colorado. Speaking out: Rex Tillerson admitted that fossil fuels are warming the climate, but called the predictions of disaster 'overblown' Tillerson dismissed the dire warnings about consequences of possible global warming. 'We have spent our entire existence adapting. We’ll adapt,' he said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'It’s an engineering problem and there will be an engineering solution.' He added that the oil industry is capable of providing cheap, reliable and safe energy well into the future. Fears about spills, environmental contamination and the disastrous effects of global warming are overblown by environmental groups that 'manufacture fear' and 'lazy' journalists who report their findings without checking that the claims are valid, Tillerson said. Severe: Thunderstorms and dangerous heat hovers over much of nation for the Fourth of July holiday . Because of this, he said, the industry's biggest challenge is 'taking an illiterate public and try to help them understand why we can manage these risks.' The comments drew a rebuke from many scientists and environmental groups. Scientists say the perspective is also refuted by the severe and irregular weather many Americans are currently experiencing. These are the kinds of extremes climate scientists have predicted will come with climate change, although it cannot be said that climate change is the cause. Nor will researchers say global warming is the reason 3,215 daily high temperature records were set in the month of June. Celebration: AAA estimates that 42 million families will travel more than 50 miles to visit friends and family over the holiday . Scientifically linking individual weather events to climate change takes intensive study, complicated mathematics, computer models and lots of time. Sometimes it isn't caused by global warming. Weather is always variable; freak things happen. So far this year, more than 2.1 million acres have burned in wildfires, more than 113 million people in the U.S. were in areas under extreme heat advisories last Friday, two-thirds of the country is experiencing drought, and earlier in June, deluges flooded Minnesota and Florida. 'This is what global warming looks like at the regional or personal level,' said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. 'The extra heat increases the odds of worse heat waves, droughts, storms and wildfire. This is certainly what I and many other climate scientists have been warning about.' The abnormal weather will continue on for Independence Day and this weekend. Powerless: More than 1 million families in the Mid-Atlantic are sweltering in high heat without electricity after a storm knocked down power lines across the region . Temperatures are expected to be ten degrees above normal and climb near 100 in much of the country on Wednesday. The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for most of the Midwest, where heat is likely to be 15 degrees above average for this time of year -- up to 104 degrees. Severe thunderstorms are also predicted for the Great Lakes region. These weather problems confront a record number of holiday travelers -- an estimated 42 million Americans who are driving or flying more than 50 miles from home to be with family on the Fourth of July. In Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio, more than one million homes remain without power in sweltering heat after storms pummeled the Mid-Atlantic over the weekend. Severe drought in some places could curtail fireworks displays. Cities in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri have all passed bans on personal fireworks because of the tinder-box created by lack of rainfall. The situation in similar in Colorado, where firefighters are only beginning to bring the Waldo Canyon wildfire under control. The blaze razed 18,000 acres and led to the evacuation of 36,000 residents around Colorado Springs.","Rex Tillerson, the head of the world's largest oil company, admitted fossil fuels are causing climate change .

A father died as he tried to save his son from drowning after waves washed them into the sea during a fishing expedition. Peter Sleeman, 60, threw out a life-buoy in an attempt to rescue his 27-year-old son Paul, who had fallen from rocks into the water after being hit by a wave. But then another wave dragged the older man into the sea, too. The pair struggled against the current for about half an hour, being ‘tumbled around like a washing machine’, as a rescuer described it. When help arrived, it was too late for Peter Sleeman. The younger man was told to let go of his father, who was face down in the water, and swim to the rescue boat to save himself. Yesterday relatives paid tribute to Mr Sleeman, who had been fishing with his son at Tregardock beach, near Delabole in north Cornwall, on Sunday morning. RNLI volunteer Damien Bolton, 31, from Port Isaac, Cornwall, was one of three crewmen called out to rescue the pair. He said they arrived only just in time to save Paul Sleeman. ‘It was a high spring tide and the water was going right up to the rocks,’ he said. ‘We saw both the father and son close to the cliff. Their bodies were being tumbled around like a  washing machine, hitting them into the rocks. Rocky and desolate: The pair were swept out to sea at the difficult-to-reach Tregardock beach in Cornwall . ‘The son was holding his father and both were in a life-buoy. The father was face down in the water. I told the son he would have to let go of his dad and swim towards us. He did not want to do it – but I told him he would die if he didn’t. ‘He had bravely held on to his dad until we got there – but then had to make the hard decision to let go of him and swim to us.’ He continued: ‘Just as he got to the boat, he went limp. I think another 30 seconds in the water and he may have died. He had taken on a hell of a lot of water and had cuts on his arms where he had been slammed into the rocks. It was very clear to us that when we got him on the boat it was literally just in time, but definitely without his dad’s actions the son wouldn’t be with us either.’ It is understood that before Mr Sleeman swam to the boat, he attached a line of rope to his father’s body and was able to bring the other end of it on board. The village of Delabole, near the tragic scene: The two men were fishing on rocks on Sunday when the son, aged 27, was engulfed in the wave . The crew then towed Peter  Sleeman to . water away from the rocks where they were able to pull in his body. It . is believed he was already dead at this stage. His son was kept in hospital overnight and discharged the next day. Locals claimed that the secluded . Tregardock beach, which can only be reached by clambering across cliffs, . had a history of drownings. Volunteer RNLI lifeguard Damien Bolton, 31, helped drag the Sleemans out of the sea . Rod Keat, 70, who grew up in the area . and lives two miles from the beach, said: ‘The tide washes right up to . the rocks and the beach is covered completely by water. ‘Several people have been caught on . the rocks in the past. There is no lifeguard and, without a phone, it . would take at least half an hour to get to the nearest house.’ Distant relative, Gillian Davey, 43, from Delabole, said: 'Paul is very upset, but I don't think he is critical anymore. 'My mother-in-law rang me late morning yesterday. I know the pair of them went fishing at 6am yesterday morning. 'I then got a phone call late morning, early afternoon to say that Peter had died and Paul had been taken critically ill. 'It's awful what's happened. It's not a beach we go to very much. My husband is a fisherman and it's not somewhere he goes to. 'He probably hasn't been there half a dozen times in all his years he's been fishing. 'There aren't very many coast guards . down there - really we're just thankful that there was people walking . past to raise the alarm because it could have been worse.' Karen Davey, 40, from Delabole, released a tribute on social networking site Twitter. She tweeted: 'Sad news about a distant . cousin who lost his life on the Cornish coast today. Be careful out . there guys, no matter how experienced you are!' Ms Davey did not want to comment when contacted about the death. Officers described the events, which unfolded at 8.30am on Sunday, as 'tragic'. Insp Andy Oliver, from the force, said: 'This is a tragic incident with the quick actions of the father saving his son. 'It seems the dad threw in a life-belt . to try and save his son, but was tragically washed into the sea too and . later declared dead. 'They appear to be from Cornwall, . visiting family in the area. The immediate next of kin have been . informed. The incident will be referred to the coroner.' Tregardock is a secluded tidal beach in north Cornwall known for its powerful waves popular with surfers. Last night, locals claimed it had a history of drownings as there are no lifeguards and the beach can only be accessed by clambering down rocks. At high tide the sea comes right up to the cliffs - which can catch some beachgoers unawares. The beach is popular with locals because it is hidden away from tourists and offers stunning natural beauty. A tourist website advertising accommodation in the area reads: 'Here there are crashing breakers, wild flowers, sea birds and vast, open skies. 'Walk down to the tidal beach and make footprints in its two miles of golden sand, explore the rock pools or surf the waves if you dare.'","Both father and son were swept off to sea by giant waves off the coast of Cornwall on Sunday morning .

A deaf and blind man hanged himself in grief after his wife died of a sudden heart attack, a coroner has decided. Stewart Timms, 63, and his wife Valerie, 68, who was deaf and mute, had been a loving and devoted couple who dedicated themselves to helping each other with their disabilities. But after Mrs Timms died in the bedroom of their home in Andoversford in Gloucestershire - her husband hanged himself a few feet away, deputy Gloucestershire coroner David Dooley concluded. Tragic: Stewart Timms (left) hung himself after discovering the body of his wife Valerie (right) who had died of a heart attack . Mr Dooley ruled that Mr Timms, a cabinet maker, committed suicide and that Mrs Timms, a retired housekeeper, had died of natural causes. The couple had two children and eight grandchildren. Their bodies, both dressed in nightwear, were found on June 16 this year after their daughter Emma Scott, of Blockley, Gloucestershire, went to visit. They had last been seen alive two to three days before the discovery. In a statement, their daughter said her parents had been married for 38 years. Both were registered deaf and her father was also registered blind after suffering with worsening tunnel vision. 'They were a couple who were very much in love,' she said. 'They did not argue and had not been arguing in particular in the run up to their deaths. 'They were always there for each other,' she said. Mrs Scott said that her father had tried to hang himself 24 years-ago after being told he was going blind - but that he had not said anything recently or immediately before his death which caused her to be concerned. When she arrived at their house Mrs Scott said she got no answer so she tried the back door and found it unlocked. Family: Mr and Mrs Timms pictured in happier times. The couple were said by their family to be devoted to eachother . She said she had seen her father’s guide dog, Arnie, and realised something was wrong after spotting faeces and urine on the floor. Mrs Scott said she went to neighbour Adrian Stoner to ask for help. He went into the house and then returned to tell her that her father had hanged himself. 'I was subsequently informed that mum had also been found and both had been certified deceased,' she said. Mrs Scott said she was 'positive' her parents' deaths were not connected - and that neither would have assisted the other in taking their life. 'They were a wonderful couple who were too much in love,' she said. Mr Timms’ brother Howard Timms said he had found his brother 24 years ago when he tried to kill himself four months after the devastating news that he was developing blindness. He had been deaf from birth. His blindness had cost him his job at that time but he had later been re-employed by his former employers and did a less high level job using a special bright light, he said. 'After he tried to kill himself the hospital discharged him into my care and we took up athletics together. Rural: The Timms lived in the Gloucestershire village of Andersford (file picture) 'He actually ran marathons and he built up a new life for himself.' Mr Timms described his brother and Mrs Timms as ‘symbiotic’ in the way they helped each other. Mrs Timms had learnt to drive in her forties when her husband could no longer do so. 'He always pushed himself to be cheerful. He didn’t want to be a drag on anyone else,' said Mr Timms. Det Insp Alastair Graham, who led the investigation into the double tragedy, said 'the likely scenario' was that Mrs Timms had died from 'non suspicious causes' some time on Wednesday June 13. 'At some stage Mr Timms discovered that his wife of nearly forty years had died and he decided to take his own life by hanging himself,' he said. Pathologist Professor Neil Shepherd said Mrs Timms died from cardiac arrest due to myocardial fibrosis, high blood pressiure and diabetes. There was no evidence of any injury to her. Pathologist Dr Pritti Joshi said Mr Timms died from hanging. At their joint funeral in July donations were made in aid of Guide Dogs for the Blind. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide on Mr Timms and natural causes on his wife. He said that for a man with such poor vision to have hanged himself would have taken a lot of effort and determination and was clear evidence of suicidal intent. It was not necessary for him to rule which person died first but he believed it was Mrs Timms followed by her husband, he said. Howard Timms said: 'This was a very sad end to a wonderful love story.'","Stewart Timms took his own life after finding his beloved wife dead .

A Russian prostitute accused of murdering a wealthy retired accountant at his £1m home has tearfully told a jury how he had terrified her by locking her inside his house on previous occasions. Natalia Woolley, 38, said she had to climb out of a window of the four-bedroom detached property in Surrey at least once to escape 69-year-old Winston Fernandez. Widowed father-of-two Mr Fernandez, of . Epsom, Surrey, was found with 17 broken ribs and smashed . bones in his windpipe on February 17. 'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described . herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy . and curvacious', is accused of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez - who wanted to marry her, a court heard . His corpse was found almost a month after he was killed, by police who were called to the property by worried neighbours. Giving evidence at her trial, Woolley, who denies murder, said she only agreed to visit him again in exchange for a promise that he would never lock his front door again while she was there. In a police interview she said Mr Fernandez locked her into his house, demanded she perform oral sex on him as well as other sexual acts and attacked her by pinning her down and grabbing her legs. Woolley told jurors that she was trying to fight off Mr Fernandez when he grabbed her during a fight. 'He was so aggressive when he started to behave in that way. I couldn't see a way out. He didn't let me out. He started to grab my legs. I don't know, I just wanted to get away from him,' she told the court. Trial: Ms Woolley claimed when she arrived at his home he fell over heavily on at least three occasions and he had blood on him . Asked by David Lederman QC, of the . defence, if she was trying to escape, Woolley replied: 'Yes. He was a . dangerous. I couldn't understand what he was doing. He was not in a . normal state ... he was drunk. I had to leave from there. I just wanted . to go.' In a police interview read to the . court, Woolley said she slipped and landed on Mr Fernandez after he . lifted his head as he lay on the floor. The court heard that Woolley . repeatedly asked her friend Kevin Markey to call Mr Fernandez's home in . the days following the incident. She also tried to enlist the help of some of her clients by asking them to drive her to Epsom. One of them refused to get involved . after she told him that she needed to go to the Surrey address 'to see . if someone was alive', but another man did agree to drive her there on . January 22. Woolley, wearing a pink scarf and . long-sleeved black top, broke down in tears as she was asked why she . requested that Mr Markey delete text and Skype messages they exchanged . following her fight with Mr Fernandez. She also called her mobile phone provider 3 to ask if it was possible that her iPhone could be traced, the court heard. 'If I worried about this I would have probably deleted all my text messages and all my messages on Skype, ' she said. Guildford Crown Court heard that the . defendant went on holiday to Tenerife and visited her daughter in . Russia after Mr Fernandez's death, before returning to the UK where she . was arrested . The trial has already heard how the . pensioner had spent his money on escort girls and had developed a . fixation with Woolley who was one of a number of prostitutes who visited . him. Mr Fernandez was planning to ask Woolley to marry him, a jury had heard. But . he was intending to give her a strict ultimatum - that she would have . to give up being a call girl if they wed, it was claimed. Weeping . at times and her voice breaking with emotion, Woolley, a former student . at Hammersmith College, London, who had a passion for art and . photography, said Mr Fernandez was not an easy client. Court: Ms Woolley said that she stepped over . the pensioner as he was on the ground but in the scuffle that followed . she stumbled and her leg landed on his head. She said 'I fell on top of him' 'He was drunk every time I saw him. On various occasions, he locked me in and hid the keys,' she said. 'So I had to escape from a window,' added Woolley. Woolley said . she had extracted a guarantee from him in advance that he would never . lock her inside in future, on the night Mr Fernandez is alleged to have . died. 'I said what happened must never happen again. He promised not to lock me in again so I went round there,' she said. But she said when she arrived at his home, he fell over heavily on at least three occasions and he had blood on him. She . said he brandished a wine bottle at her before trying to smash a beer . bottle over the table leaving her fearful of being blinded by flying . glass. Jurors heard that he accused her of taking his money and not doing anything for him. Scene: Woolley is accused of murdering 69-year-old Winston Fernandez after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey. She is accused of kicking and stamping the widower to death . The £600-a-night prostitute told the court: 'He said to me, ""I paid you the money and you didn’t do anything"".' She revealed to the court she was so terrified that she decided to leave as soon as possible. She said that she made for the front door but found that it was locked. 'I said, ""Open the door otherwise I shall shout and scream"".' She explained that he then asked her for sex, saying: 'You’ve not done any service.' Woolley said she went upstairs after he promised to unlock the front door. The court heard that Mr Fernandez demanded certain sex acts but said she refused. The defendant told the jury that the pensioner started to undo his trousers before grabbing her and forcing her on to the bed. 'He hit me on the back and I felt . something on my head. He was very angry because he couldn’t get what he . wanted. So he started throwing things about,' she said. She said that Mr Fernandez then fell very heavily. After . that, she said, he had grabbed her leg and tried to stop her escaping . and she kicked him four or five times in the midriff. She denied hitting Mr Fernandez with a chair. 'I was stressed and I was panicking. I was so shaken that I didn’t know what to do,' she added. The defendant said she then left the house after cutting his phone wires to stop him calling her again and walked to a nearby garage where she called a cab to take her back to her home in London. Woolley, of West Kensington, London, denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Natalia Woolley said she had to .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 10:43 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:29 EST, 10 October 2012 . High court: Paul Woollard, pictured, is fighting for his job after joking with a child molester that he wanted to rape a colleague . A policeman sent a sordid 'joke' to a paedophile about raping a colleague and provided the pervert with a 'shoulder to cry on' when he was on bail for sexual abuse, a court was told. As well as befriending sex offender Robert Meade, Paul Woollard also used a police computer to run checks on him - and is now fighting to save his career at the High Court. Wiltshire Chief Constable, Patrick Geenty, is adamant that Mr Woollard must be sacked and is challenging the 'bizarre' and 'irrational' decision of the Police Appeals Tribunal (PAT) to order his reinstatement on the force and issue him with a final warning. John Beggs QC, for Mr Geenty, told the court Mr Woollard had used his police email address to send Meade a series of explicitly-worded messages including one which read: 'Just waitin for the women to come and open up. I might rape her as theres noone else here (sic).' Meade, who Mr Woollard knew through a shared interest in cricket and angling, admitted sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl at Swindon Crown Court in October 2009 and was jailed for a year. Mr Beggs, in his written submissions to the court, conceded there was no evidence Mr Woollard knew about Meade’s crime when he sent the 'rape joke' email, but added that he had 'continued to associate' with his friend even after he was charged and on bail. He had also committed flagrant breaches of the Data Protection Act by repeatedly accessing the 'Niche' police intelligence computer to look up details about Meade, the QC told the court. Mr Geenty’s predecessor as Chief Constable, Brian Moore, had ordered Mr Woollard’s dismissal from the force but, in May last year, he was overruled by the PAT which directed he be reinstated and given a final warning. Challenging that ruling, Mr Beggs argued: 'No reasonable tribunal could have imposed a sanction other than dismissal for an officer found gulity of such a cumulative litany of allegations which undermined public confidence in the reputation of the police service'. Describing parts of the PAT’s reasoning as 'bizarre', the QC asked: 'How would a Wiltshire victim of rape react to learning that a sexual offences trained officer ""joked"" about raping a woman himself? Would that encourage her to come forward to Wiltshire Police?' He added: 'How would a man on the Devizes omnibus view the fact that one of his local officers, on duty, is sending foul emails to an inappropriate associate, joking about home-made and barely legal pornography and masturbation.

'How would a local citizen respond to the knowledge that one of his local officers is lending a shoulder to cry on to a child sex offender on bail? 'What would the 14-year-old victim of Robert Meade, or her parents, or her friends, or other victims of sexual assault think of the police if they discovered that Mr Woollard accessed intelligence about Meade’s offence not for the proper policing purpose of detecting crime, but to check up on his friend?' Hugh Davies, for Mr Woollard, conceded that his misconduct had been serious and that the court would be 'wholly unimpressed' by his behaviour. However, he had expressed remorse and the case did not concern his 'honesty and integrity'. Urging Mr Justice Wyn Williams to find that 'a lesser outcome than dismissal' was acceptable, the barrister said the Chief Constable 'does not have a monopoly of wisdom' on what is and is not behaviour justifying the termination of a police officer’s career. Emphasising that Pc Woollard had not accessed police intelligence 'at the direction of Meade', the barrister argued that the overall effect of the allegations he faced was 'misleading and prejudicial' and that dismissal should not be 'the default sanction' in such cases. The language used by the PAT in condemning PC Woollard 'could hardly be stronger' and it had clearly not underestimated the seriousness of his misconduct, he added. Mr Justice Wyn Williams has now reserved his judgment on the Chief Constable’s appeal until a later date.","PC Paul Woollard wrote to Robert Meade: 'Just waitin for the women to come and open up.

A dog owner who used herbal remedies on her injured pets rather than taking them to the vet has been banned from keeping animals after they lost almost all their hair. Susan Lambert, 54, failed to take her two German Shepherds, called Tee and K, to the vet after they were accidentally sprayed with sulphuric acid by a farmer treating his crops. Instead, she used homeopathic remedies at home in Colwall, Herefordshire but within three months both pets had lost their fur. Ignored RSPCA advice: Susan Lambert did not take her two German Shepherds (pictured is Tee) to the vet after they were accidentally sprayed with sulphuric acid. Three months later they lost most of their hair . The animals were seized in May this year and Hereford Magistrates Court heard how Lambert had been initially advised by RSPCA officers to take her dogs to the vet after the accident. Lambert was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and banned from keeping animals for three years on Monday. She was also fined £600 and ordered to pay £400 court costs. Before herbal remedies: Tee was happy and healthy before Lambert used homeopathic remedies on the dogs rather than taking them to the vet . After Tee and K were finally examined by vets, they were found to be riddled with parasitic mites that had burrowed into the dogs’ skin and caused them to suffer from severe mange, a parasitic skin infestation. When RSPCA officers were called later on, they were shocked when they discovered five-year-old male K had shed half his fur while eight-year-old female Tee was completely bald from the neck down. Tragically K was put down after vets also discovered he had an inoperable tumour. Banned: Lambert was banned from keeping animals for three years at Hereford Magistrates Court (pictured) after she was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals . Tee has made a remarkable full recovery and is being put up for adoption by an animal charity. The ruling comes as a man who beat his Jack Russell dog to death in a brutal attack was jailed for 150 days and banned from keeping pets for life. Christopher Keogh, 31, kicked, punched and slammed one-year-old Bambi against a brick wall before dumping the bloodied body in a bin. Animal rights protesters Colchester Animal Defenders demonstrated outside Colchester Magistrates’ Court, jeering Keogh as he entered on Tuesday.","Susan Lambert used homeopathic remedies to treat her dogs who had been accidentally sprayed with sulphuric acid .

Michelle Obama may be a champion for healthy eating, but that doesn't stop her scoffing Reese's while on the road. The First Lady let slip her penchant for the chocolatey treat in an interview with Ryan Seacrest yesterday, and the American Idol host quickly shared it with the world via Twitter.

Tasty treat: Michelle Obama, pictured right, let slip to Ryan Seacrest, left, that Reese's are her guilty pleasure on the road . The snack-time confession comes as the Obamas revealed they won't be posing for any photos in the voting booth on election day — because they are both casting their ballot early. President Barack Obama and Michelle said yesterday that they are both voting early, a nod to the campaign's efforts to encourage supporters to vote absentee by mail or cast their ballot at an early voting location. Reese's: The First Lady likes to indulge in Reese's, pictured, when on the road . Mrs Obama told her Twitter followers yesterday that she dropped her absentee ballot in the mail, annoucing: 'I couldn't wait for Election Day!' The first lady then tweeted out a photo of her posing with the envelope holding her absentee ballot. Minutes later, the president said on Twitter that he was following Mrs Obama's example and intended to vote early in person in Illinois on October 25 — three days after the final presidential debate. 'If your state has early voting, join me,' Mr Obama said on Twitter, directing followers to a link with more information about early voting. At a rally at Ohio Wesleyan .

I voted for my husband. Yes! It felt so good. Right now, my . absentee ballot is on its way to Illinois, my home state.' She added: 'Forgive me if I'm a little excited today. For me it was Election Day.' Mr . Obama's campaign said it was the first time a presidential nominee and . his spouse will not vote in person on election day, reflecting their . emphasis on early voting in several key battleground states. Mr Obama dominated early voting in 2008, giving him an edge over Republican John McCain well before election day. In Colorado, Florida, Iowa and North .

Obama has repeatedly urged supporters to vote early, placing an . emphasis on absentee and early voting during recent rallies in . battleground states such as Florida, Iowa and Ohio. The . strategy aims to free up campaign workers and volunteers on November 6 . to focus on a smaller number of potential supporters and make sure they . get to the polls. 'I voted for my husband': Michelle Obama, pictured, tweeted a photo of herself voting early . Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign has targeted supporters who don't typically vote in every election, placing a premium on getting those voters to cast early ballots. Most of Mr Romney's remaining supporters would be people who are much more likely to vote, regardless of whether they are contacted by the campaign. Mr Obama's campaign has tried to bolster in-person early voting in states where that is already under way and reduce Republicans' typical advantage in absentee voting. Democrats lead Republicans in Iowa in vote-by-mail ballots and in-person early voting; in Ohio, Democrats have requested and cast more ballots than Republicans. In Florida, Obama's campaign has cut into the GOP's advantage in absentee ballots. Analysts estimate that about one-third of all voters could cast their ballots before election day.","The healthy eating advocate admitted to indulging in the chocolatey treat while travelling .

"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 18:36 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:26 EST, 18 October 2012 . A 17th century Mohawk Indian whose name means 'she who bumps into things' because of her poor vision and a New York nun who miraculously cured two dying patients will this weekend be declared saints. Kateri 'Caterina' Tekakwitha and Mother Marianne Cope, also known as 'Mother of the Outcasts', are among seven Roman Catholics set to be canonised by Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday. Hundreds of pilgrims are travelling to Rome to attend the ceremony, with some of Mother Marianne's followers stopping over in her hometown of Utica, New York, on the way. Saintly: Mother Marianne Cope, pictured left in 1883, and Kateri Tekakwitha, right are among seven Roman Catholics set to be canonised by Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday . Mother Marianne was known for her strength and kindness, battling bureaucrats in Hawaii as she led a group of fellow Franciscan nuns to care for leprosy patients in the islands. By declaring her a saint, the Vatican will formally recognise that she is in heaven and was responsible for teenager Kate Mahoney's medically inexplicable recovery from multiple organ failure in 1993 and Sharon Smith's successful 2005 fight against an infection that tore a hole between her intestines and stomach. Saving Ms Mahoney's life almost 20 years ago paved the way for Mother Marianne's beatification in 2005, and Ms Smith's unlikely recovery was the miracle needed for her to be canonised. They were cured after friends and . family prayed to Mother Marianne. In Smith's case, a sister pinned a bag . of soil containing some of Mother Marianne's bone fragments to her . hospital gown. At the ceremony on Sunday, presided over . by the Pope, the church will also canonise Caterina Tekakwitha, a 17th-century Mohawk Indian and daughter of a Mohawk Chief. Mohawk: Caterina Tekakwitha, pictured, lived from 1656-1680 in the U.S. and Canada, and became the first Native American to be beatified in 1980 . Remembered: The National Kateri Shrine and Native American Museum is pictured in Fonda, New York . Caterina cared for the elderly and sick and . lived from 1656-1680 in New York and Canada. She became the first Native . American to be beatified in 1980 and was recently approved by Pope . Benedict XVI as one of seven new Catholic saints. Caterina has a national shrine located in Fonda, New York, where she lived as a teenager. She was born in 1656 in nearby Auriesville but her parents - one of whom was a Mohawk Chief named Kenneronkwa - and brother died of smallpox when she was aged only four. Caterina survived but was given the unfortunate surname because of her poor vision - as it literally means 'she who bumps into things'. Sunday's ceremony comes nearly a century after Mother Marianne's 1918 death at Kalaupapa, an isolated peninsula on Molokai Island where Hawaii governments forcibly exiled leprosy patients for decades. Mother Marianne heard the call to come to Hawaii from New York state in 1883 when she was 45. She . was the only religious leader in the U.S. and Europe - of 50 asked - . who agreed to a request by Hawaii's king and queen to come to the . islands to help leprosy patients. Saved: The Vatican will formally recognise that Mother Marianne was responsible for the medically inexplicable recovery of Kate Mahoney, pictured right, and Sharon Smith, left . At . the time, there was widespread fear of the disfiguring disease, which . can cause skin lesions, mangled fingers and toes and lead to blindness. 'I am not afraid of any disease,' she wrote, agreeing to what would become a more than three-decade mission helping those banished to the unfriendly sea cliffs of the Hawaiian peninsula. The Hawaiian kingdom began exiling patients to Kalaupapa in 1866 to control the disease, a policy that remained in place until a century later even though new drugs in the 1940s made it curable. Shortly after her arrival from . Syracuse, N.Y., she had learned that a government-appointed . administrator was abusing patients at Branch Hospital in Honolulu. Mother . Marianne threatened to leave with the six sisters that accompanied her . unless the government removed the official. The government soon gave her . full oversight of the hospital. 'She was just an ordinary person, like us,' Charlotte Recarte, 67, a retiree from Oahu, told The New York Times. 'Inside all of us, we can be saints. We just have to do the work. That's what Mother Marianne did.' Caterina found Christianity as a teenager despite her Mohawk clan being vehemently against it. Banished: Children and adults stand outside Father Damien's church in the late 19th century when around 600 sufferers were shipped to the island . After her family passed away, she was looked after by her uncle, a Turtle Clan chief who hated the religion, but a conflict moved her four miles north-west to Caughnawaga, New York, aged 10. Despite her disfigured face from smallpox, a number of men were interested in marrying her. But Caterina decided to stay celibate because she believed they only wanted her for political gain. It was as she thought more about the potential of a loveless marriage, she started to find out about Christianity. Her mother had given her a set of . rosary prayer beads but her uncle had taken them away because he did not . want her to become a Catholic. But she became more and more interested . in the faith. Caterina then . began Catholic teaching in secret aged 18. Her uncle eventually allowed . this as long as she stayed in their village. She . was persecuted by her fellow villagers for joining the faith but soon . escaped to the Mission of St. Francis Xavier - a Canadian settlement. Canonisation: Pope Benedict XVI, right, will declare the two women saints on Sunday . Caterina was known for her gentleness, kindness, and good humour, according to the website of her shrine in Fonda. She vowed to stay a virgin for her whole life in 1679 in Canada and taught children to pray, as well as working with the elderly and sick. She died in 1680 after a serious illness and was buried in Quebec, Canada. She was said to appear to many people after her death and held responsible for miracles. Legend has it that just minutes after she died she shone brightly and all the marks from smallpox vanished from her face, revealing her true beauty. Caterina is highly-regarded in Catholicism because of her commitment to helping others despite all  the persecution and illness she suffered herself. Both women will be honoured during the ceremony in Rome. Two-hundred fifty pilgrims are travelling from Hawaii to witness the canonisation of Mother Marianne. Among those attending the canonisation are nine Kalaupapa patients. Although cured, a dozen people still live at the peninsula, all older than 70. It will be the second trip to Rome in three years for Hawaii pilgrims. Many made a similar trip in 2009 for the canonization of Saint Damien, a Belgian priest who moved to Kalaupapa to care for leprosy patients in 1873 and who died of the disease 16 years later. Many are also making a pilgrimage to Utica, where Mother Marianne moved with her family from Germany in 1839, aged one. At St. Joseph's church and parish school, she developed her faith but left in eight grade to work in a factory after her father became ill. In 1862, she entered the Sisters of St. Francis in Syracuse. Bishop Silva said Mother Marianne's life has many lessons for people today, even though leprosy isn't a threat anymore. Her example can be applied to other issues, such as domestic violence or homelessness. 'She is an inspiration to us to do the hard work, to not always do the glory work, but to roll up our sleeves and do what needs to be done for the sake of our brothers and sisters,' he said.","Kateri 'Caterina' Tekakwitha cared for the elderly and sick in New York and Canada until her death in 1680 .

A 'Dad's Army' hand-grenade left over from the Second World War left 13 people needing hospital treatment. The casualties, who were not seriously injured, were exposed to toxic fumes after workmen disturbed the stockpile of phosphorous grenades left in the sealed-up cellar of a property in Bamber Bridge near Preston, Lancashire. It is thought one of the grenades, issued to members of the Home Guard during the last World War, was dislodged and cracked, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said. Lethal: The hand-grenade found was thought to be one issued to the Home Guard - now fondly known as 'Dad's Army' after the popular TV series - during World War II . The device is a glass bottle about eight inches high which on being thrown and hitting the target was intended to break and release the contents, a highly flammable mixture of phosphorus and benzene, self-igniting on exposure to air. It was to be used by the 'Dad's Army' of reservists against Hitler's Nazi occupiers if Britain had fallen to German invasion, but had been left and forgotten about for almost 60 years in the sealed-off cellar of a former fire station, now used as the premises of a printing firm. The cellar of the old fire station is linked with that of the former Town Hall next door - now an estate agent - and a further six such devices have been found in the shared cellar space. Both cellars had been bricked up for some years. Firefighters were first called to reports of a fire at the premises of Sprint Print on Station Road in Bamber Bridge at 12.23pm yesterday. But on arrival they soon established that wisps of smoke thought to be from a fire were in fact chemical fumes from a source, thought to be a small container or bottle of acid, in the cellar. Toxic: Six staff at the Royal Preston Hospital, where the casualties exposed to the grenade fumes were taken, subsequently complained of breathing difficulties . Two drainage company employees investigating a report from the occupier of damp masonry are thought to have inadvertently dislodged one of the bottles in the stockpile, causing it to leak and release fumes. They were exposed to the fumes and were injured along with three workers at Sprint Print. Of these five casualties, two suffered chemical burns and three experienced breathing problems. Two paramedics and six hospital staff at the Royal Preston Hospital - where the casualties had been taken, subsequently also complained of breathing difficulties. One casualty suffered blisters to the exposed skin of his arms but all 13 casualties have responded well to treatment and have been allowed home. The cracked grenade has now been made safe and removed from the building for disposal by an army disposal team and the rest of the stockpile will be disposed of in a controlled explosion, the fire service said. At the height of the incident five fire engines, a Hazardous Materials Unit, Mobile Fire Station and approximately 40 firefighters were sent to the scene and a 50-metre exclusion zone put in place.","Workmen disturbed a stockpile of .

There are conflicting accounts about whether Khamis Gaddafi was killed during conflict or fatally wounded and later died. Libyan national congress spokesman, Omar Hamdan, said the 28-year-old died 'in battle' but gave no further details. Conflicting reports: Colonel Gaddafi's youngest son, Khamis (pictured), has allegedly been killed, but accounts of exactly how he is said to have died are confusing.

The Al Arabiya news agency, however, has been cited on NBC News as saying that sources claim Khamis Gaddafi was found seriously injured, arrested and later died. There have been several reports in the past that he has been killed, including during a NATO airstrike in August 2011. Government forces claimed 13 people were killed and 121 wounded on a fourth day of bitter clashes for control of the town. History repeating: Khamis's reported death comes a year to the day after his father, Colonel Gaddafi (above), was captured and killed by rebels on October 20 last year . Reports of his death brought scenes of wild celebrations in Misrata, the city which had been under siege for six months by Khamis's 32nd Brigade.

Three more men has claimed Grease star John Travolta sexually assaulted them. A New York-based masseur alleges Travolta groped him during a massage at a five star hotel around two years ago, RadarOnline is reporting. The website quotes a source 'close to the situation' who says Travolta groped the unnamed man against his will during an in-room massage. 'Travolta indicated that he wanted much MORE than a massage,' the source told RadarOnline. 'He also claims that there was alcohol present in the room and that Travolta encouraged the man to drink with him during the time of the massage.' The website reports the masseur is now 'assessing his legal options'. And another masseur at the posh Eden Roc Resort in Miami and a former hotel employee at the Westin Hotel in Seattle have also come forward, according to the New York Daily News. The news comes after the the first two unnamed masseurs to come forward - dubbed John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 - parted ways with lawyer Okorie Okorocha. But both have hired celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred and may take up the lawsuit again with her. Ship worker Fabian Zanzi came forward with similar claims last week, accusing Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship. Claims: John Travolta (centre right) allegedly tried to perform an oral act on Jeff Conaway (left) as he slept. The pair starred alongside Olivia Newton John and Stockard Channing in the hit film Grease . An unnamed gym employee also alleged this week that Travolta fondled him against his wishes when he worked out at the gym while he was shooting a movie, according to RadarOnline. Aside from the five sexual assault claims, former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez made claims to the National Enquirer he had a homosexual tryst with Travolta at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California, in 1997. On top of this, there was more anguish for Travolta yesterday when it was reported he tried to give his  Grease co-star Jeff Conaway oral sex while he was sleeping. Travolta allegedly tried to perform the act at Conaway's home in the 1990s, Conaway's former fiancée Vikki Lizzi told the National Enquirer. Scenic: Former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez claimed this week he spent an afternoon with the Travolta at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel in 1997 . She said that her partner, who played Kenickie in the 1978 hit movie, was so upset with the incident it ended his long-term friendship with the star. Conaway died last May, aged 60, from complications of pneumonia. Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer is yet to comment on today's allegations - but previously said: 'As a result of the published lies about my client we expect some 'John Does' to come out of the woodwork and assert false claims.'

A glittering new Bunny Girl outfit has been unveiled to celebrate the launch of a new bar at London's Playboy club. Norwegian womenswear designer Nina Naustdal created the one-off Swarovski Bunny outfit in collaboration with the Playboy Club to coincide with the opening of Baroque, a bar masterminded by the entrepreneur behind the Hoxton Pony.

Only Bunny Sara (pictured), who greets celebrities guests, gets to wear the special bunny suit . HOW TO BE A BUNNY . While the glamorous waitresses make being a Bunny Girl it look easy, being a Bunny takes a lot of work. The original values and requirements dating back 50 years still stand today. Bunnies are carefully chosen at auditions and embark on strict cocktail-making and behaviour training, on which they are tested. The pose they must master in front of all clientele is called the 'Bunny Stance,' which involves standing with legs together, back arched and hips . tucked under. If taking a short rest, bunnies must do so elegantly in the 'Bunny Perch,' sit on the back of a . seat or railing without being too close to a patron. The famous 'Bunny Dip' is a manoeuvre where the . Bunny elegantly leans backwards while bending her knees, lifting her . left knee and tucking the right leg behind, allowing her to serve drinks while keeping her modesty fully intact. Custom made and fitted to each girl by the in house seamstress, the costumes are altered when required. Playboy's director of promotions Victor Lownes first conceived the Bunny girl costume which was later refined by Hugh Hefner. There was no bow tie, collar or cuffs and the ears were much taller to begin with. The uniform was formally debuted in February 1960, at . the opening of the first Playboy Club in Chicago. Constructed on a . classic merry widow corset and made from fine rayon-satin, a rosette name-tag was attached on the hip of each one. Pointed ears, fluffy cotton tails, . collars with bow ties, cuffs, black tights and . high-heels completed the look. The . costumes were made of two halves in different shapes and sizes - the . front and back - which were selected to custom fit each individual Bunny best, then sewn . together. There was even a full time seamstress on duty to make sure the costumes were always immaculate.

It suggests that the 19th century practice of sending patients to retreats to soak up the sun's rays could have done some good. The latest study found patients recovered more quickly from the infection lung disease if they combined antibiotics with exposure to sunlight. Catching the rays: Vitamin D appears to dampen inflammatory responses . The findings, from Queen Mary University, suggest high doses of the vitamin dampen down the body's inflammatory response to infection, reducing damage to the lungs. Study leader Adrian Martineau, said: 'Sometimes these inflammatory responses can cause tissue damage leading to ... cavities in the lung. 'If we can help these cavities to heal more quickly, then patients should be infectious for a shorter period of time, and they may also suffer less lung damage.' The researchers also said they think vitamin D's ability to dampen inflammatory responses without interfering with the action of antibiotics suggests supplements might be useful for patients taking antibiotics for diseases like pneumonia, sepsis and other lung infections. TB, which people in wealthier parts of the world often mistakenly believe to be a thing of the past, is proving a tough disease to beat. In 2010, it infected 8.8 million people worldwide and killed 1.4 million. Drug-resistant cases of Tuberculosis are on the rise in the UK, according to figures released in July. In 2010, there were 342 cases which could not be dealt with by traditional antibiotics, while in 2011, this figure rose to 431. The infection destroys lung tissue, causing patients to cough up the bacteria which then spreads through the air and can be inhaled by others. In recent years, rates of drug-resistant TB have been spreading fast across the world, causing alarm among public health officials and prompting calls for more research into new and more effective treatments. Human lung section with tuberculosis: The infection destroys lung tissue causing patients to cough up bacteria, spreading it . The researchers, whose study was published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, split 95 TB patients who were on standard antibiotic treatment into two groups. For the first eight weeks of their treatment, 44 of them were also given high dose vitamin D, while the remaining 51 got placebos. Anna Coussens from Britain's National Institute for Medical Research measured signs of inflammation in blood samples to see what effect the vitamin D had on immune responses. 'We found that a large number of these inflammatory markers fell further and faster in patients receiving vitamin D,' she said. The researchers also found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that cause TB, cleared from the phlegm coughed up from deep in the lungs faster in patients on vitamin D, taking an average of 23 days to become undetectable under the microscope compared to 36 days in those on placebo. Martineau said it was too early to recommend all TB patients take high-dose vitamin D alongside antibiotics, as more research with a larger group of patients was needed first.","Vitamin D appears to dampen inflammatory responses without affecting effect of antibiotics .

Hair straighteners are causing 'horrific injuries' to hundreds of young children across the UK, a safety charity has warned. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said at one hospital in Northern Ireland, one in 10 of children admitted with burns, had been injured by the beauty device with some needing plastic surgery. Hair straighteners can reach scorching temperatures of 220C - hot enough to fry an egg. As they take 40 minutes to cool they remain dangerously hot for far longer than many parents realise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hair straighteners reach temperatures of 200C and most commonly cause hand injuries among children . Youngsters who grab or fall on them can suffer disfiguring injuries as their skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults. Figures released by the Royal Belfast for Sick Children show that 17 children aged between three months and nine years attended A&E at the hospital in 2009-10 with hair straightener burns. The average age of the patient was just 18months. They represented nine per cent of the 187 children who attended with 'thermal injuries' during that year. In June this year, the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol revealed is had . treated 110 children for serious burns in the last five years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents have urged parents to remember the three S's... SWITCH hair . straighteners off and unplug them straight away . SLIDE them into a . heat resistant bag . STORE them out of the sight and reach of children . They add to take care not to burn yourself when using straighteners by making sure you don't place them too close to your scalp or ears. Across the UK this would add up to hundreds of serious injuries every year, with thousands more receiving minor injuries. Children are most likely to receive burns to their hands, however children have also sustained injuries to the head, arm and foot. Nicola Vance, a mother from Belfast, . revealed her 19-month old toddler was injured after falling onto her . straighteners a year ago just after she had switched them off. Although . she whisked him away, just a couple of seconds did serious damage. She said: 'Alfie has just learned to . shuffle so he was moving along the bed, he caught himself in the sheets . and just fell forward onto the straighteners. 'The . middle of his eyebrows was all red and his skin had melted. If the . straighteners had been any hotter, they would have peeled off his . forehead. 'Alfie was lucky that he didn't lose his eyes, although he has been scarred for life.' Now RoSPA are working with the . Belfast Health and Social Care Trust on a 'Too Hot to Handle Campaign' to raise awareness of the risks. Alfie Vance received facial burns after he fell onto his mother's straighteners . Sheila Merrill, RoSPA’s public health . adviser, said: 'The campaign in Northern Ireland builds on other . awareness-raising work that RoSPA has been carrying out across the UK. 'We . know from reports and from talking to the people who work in A&E . that burns from hair straighteners is a significant issue and a national . problem. 'And yet the . risks posed are so easy to reduce. Simply by putting these devices into . heat resistant bags after use, and storing them in a place that’s out of . the sight and reach of children, we can go a long way to preventing the . kind of burns which can scar for life.' The campaign has created a video to show just how hot straighteners can become. Dr Julie-Ann Maney, consultant . in paediatric emergency medicine at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick . Children, said: 'Hair straightener burns are preventable. The Too Hot to . Handle campaign will highlight how dangerous these devices are, . particularly to small children and that the public need to be aware of . the horrific injuries that can be sustained.'

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 05:13 EST, 29 February 2012 . A boom in motherhood among older women has driven up the number of pregnancies to record levels, official figures revealed yesterday. For the first time, more than 900,000 women became pregnant in a year, a level not reached even during the baby boom years after World War Two. The unprecedented number of conceptions was fuelled by the fast-rising rates of pregnancy among women in their 30s  and 40s. The latest figures show that 40-somethings were becoming pregnant in  2010 at more than double the rate of two decades ago. The baby boom is being fuelled by more and more older women getting pregnant . In a single year, conception rates for women in this age group rose by 5.2 per cent. The increase for those aged 34 to 39 was 4.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent for those aged 30 to 34. The Office for National Statistics said the latest leap was down to the race among working women to catch up and have the families they missed out on in their 20s. This is a new influence in addition to the factors driving rates in recent years: high immigration and the arrival in Britain of large numbers of women of child-bearing age who then have families. Many women may also be influenced by the recession making family life more important. Newly jobless women and those with less work also have more time for family. The report said the rise in numbers of conceptions ‘could be attributed to the increased contribution of women aged 30 and over, or possibly due to the economic climate following the 2008-2009 recession. ‘Family may also be valued more highly during tough economic times and, as parents could be out of work, they may have more time to spend on child rearing.’ No longer nuclear family: The data also showed that most babies are now conceived outside marriage . The ONS said the reasons for more . over-40s conceiving include delaying motherhood by participating in . higher education, holding off on marriage and the desire to get ahead in . their careers to buy a home and be financially secure before starting a . family. Migrants who were not in Britain in their early child-bearing years have . also boosted levels by becoming mothers later in life, said the report. According to the 2010 figures, 909,245 women in England and Wales became . pregnant. This was a rise of 1.4 per cent on the 896,466 pregnancies in . the previous year. There were 723,165 babies born with the average age for new mothers now almost 30. Just over one in five of the pregnancies, slightly fewer than 190,000, . ended in abortion. Half of conceptions to girls under 18 ended in . terminations. There have not been so many pregnancies in England and Wales before. Numbers have never reached 900,000 since the 1967 Abortion Act came into operation, legalising terminations. The baby boom peaked in 1964, when there were 880,173 maternities, which . are comparable to conceptions now. In the post-war year of 1947, there . were 891,504 maternities. According to the latest figures, conception rates for women in their 20s remained flat. Those in their early 30s were the least probable to have an abortion, . with 12.6 cent of pregnancies among 30 to 34-year-olds terminated in . 2010. This is the age group where they are most likely to marry and  settle down. Decline: The number of teenage girls falling pregnant in England and Wales, has reached its lowest level since 1969 - but failed to meet Labour targets . Tony Blair’s attempt to slash teenage pregnancies by handing out contraceptives and more sex education did not hit its target. Labour’s flagship strategy costing £250million had aimed to halve conceptions in England by 2010. But official figures yesterday showed the 12-year plan only cut the numbers of conceptions to the under-18s by 23.8 per cent. For 2010 alone, however, under-18 pregnancies did drop by 7.3 per cent. Pregnancies among the under-16s also fell, by 6.8 per cent in a year to 2010. This meant 36 girls in every 1,000 aged 15 to 17 became pregnant. The Office for National Statistics said policies, including sex education and the availability of contraceptives, could explain the fall. But it said there could also be ‘a shift in aspirations of young women towards education’. There was more media awareness among young people and ‘the perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother’. Diane Abbott, Shadow Public Health Minister, warned that Coalition reforms would reverse Labour’s good work before 2010. She said: ‘The danger is that this government will cause the fragmentation of sexual health services.’","Lowest rate in teens since 1969 in England and Wales .

Mr Johnson ‘high fived’ spectators along the parade route as he was treated like a pop star, but he was also forced to fend off endless questions about his leadership ambitions. By contrast, the Prime Minister delivered a low-key speech, which was received politely but with far less enthusiasm. He was left to watch as Mr Johnson, who has emerged as the favourite to succeed him as Conservative leader, whipped onlookers into a frenzy. Addressing the crowd on the Mall outside Buckingham Palace, the Mayor said the Games had come to a ‘final tear-sodden juddering climax’. ‘We should pay tribute to all the thousands of people who have delivered the greatest Olympic and Paralympic games that have ever been held,’ he declared. Addressing the athletes gathered behind him, Mr Johnson added: ‘This was your achievement, you brought this country together in a way we never expected. ‘Speaking as a spectator you produced such a paroxysm of tears and joy on the sofas of Britain you probably not only inspired a generation, you probably helped to create one as well.’ Acknowledging how he appears to be defying political gravity, the Mayor added: I can get away with that. We say thank you to the armed services and the police and...and G4S and all the people who work for them, yes. ‘We should thank the people without whom the last six weeks would not have made sense and not have been possible: the most successful team of athletes this country has ever assembled. ‘You routed the doubters and you scattered the gloomsters and for the first time in living memory you caused Tube train passengers to break into spontaneous conversation with their neighbours about subjects other than their trod-on toes.’ Mr Johnson boasted Britain had bagged more medals than France, Australia and Germany and ‘made everybody very proud’, before suggesting Britain had invented sport. ‘You brought sport home to a city and a country where by and large it was invented and codified,’ he declared. ‘Above all you brought home the truth about us and about this country – that when we put our minds to it there is no limit to what Britain can achieve.’ Speaking before the Mayor, Mr Cameron had hailed a ‘great British summer that will be remembered in hundreds of years to come’.

And you showed us all that we can be: all-welcoming, tolerant, vibrant, with a future every bit as exciting and thrilling as our past.’ The Mayor yesterday dismissed claims that he is plotting an early return to the Commons to try to seize the Conservative leadership as ‘complete cloud cuckoo land’. ‘I’m absolutely not going to be returning to Parliament, I’ve got a job to do here in London and that’s what I want to do and it’s a massive, engrossing job,’ he said. However, talks have taken place among rebel Tory MPs about finding Mr Johnson a seat in the 2015 General Election so he is ready to replace Mr Cameron if the Prime Minister fails to win an overall majority.

More than a quarter of American households have just one person living  inside and singles will soon dominate the U.S., according to a new book. Although living in families is a traditional practice almost universal around the world, the book ‘Going Solo’ claims it’s experiencing an effective attack. New York University expert Eric Klinenberg says singles boost economies because they have more disposable income and more time for others. Social patterns; New York University sociology professor Eric Klinenberg, right, claims in 'Going Solo', left, that the U.S. will soon become dominated by singles . But many often lose out because they receive inferior tax breaks and pay more for insurance compared to married people, reported Newsweek. Henry David Thoreau tried living by himself in the mid-1800s, when he was still in his twenties, and the result was his famous book ‘Walden’. The critically-acclaimed work described living alone in the woods. ‘I never found the companion so companionable as solitude,’ Mr Thoreau wrote. One of four siblings himself, he died unmarried, aged 44, and biographers record one proposal to a young woman that was rejected. He built his cottage within walking distance of his family in Concord, Massachusetts, and the pubs he and his friends frequented. By himself: Henry David Thoreau tried living by himself in the mid-1800s, when he was still in his twenties, and the result was his book 'Walden' It was on property owned by his mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Mr Thoreau's mother visited often, bearing home-cooked meals. 'Solitude, once we learn how to use it, does more than restore our personal energy. It also sparks new ideas about how we might better live together' Eric Klinenberg . About 4million Americans were living solo in 1950 and it was up to 31million by 2000, with women outnumbering men 17million to 14million. ‘There are so many different kinds of singles (that) single people have had trouble organising as a political bloc,’ Mr Klinenberg says, reported Newsweek. ‘But there are now so many ... it’s hard not to pay attention to them.’ Between 1950 and 2000, another book appeared in 1962 that may become a landmark - Helen Gurley Brown's ‘Sex and the Single Girl.’ Swedish thinker: Nobel Peace Prize winner Alva Myrdal opened a 'collective house' in the 1930s with 57 units for single women and single mothers . ‘She is engaging because she lives by her wits,’ he quoted her as writing of modern women. ‘She is a giver, not a taker, a winner and not a loser.’ 'There are so many different kinds of that single people have had trouble organising as a political bloc. But there are now so many... it’s hard not to pay attention to them' Eric Klinenberg . Mr Klinenberg also collects interviews with older people who choose independent living rather than available alternatives as long as they can. Most Americans, Europeans and others elsewhere measure life satisfaction in terms of integrity, independence and self-respect, he writes. More than 11million elderly Americans and 72million Europeans live alone. ‘In the coming decades many millions more will do so,’ he writes. Though the book, which has generated much debate, is largely concerned with the U.S. it devotes ten pages to solutions innovated in Sweden.

Britain could be forced to contribute to its own EU rebate under ‘unacceptable’ new Brussels plans, which would cost the UK more than £800 million a year. European Commission President Herman van Rompuy unveiled the extraordinary proposal yesterday, as he outlined his latest plans for the next seven-year EU budget. Mr van Rompuy initially suggested that the UK could keep the £3.2 billion-a-year rebate famously secured by Margaret Thatcher. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy's plan to dramatically cut Britain's EU rebate is likely to anger David Cameron . An EU diplomat said there was an acceptance among negotiators that ending Britain’s rebate would scupper any chance of a deal, adding: ‘People realise that no British prime minister can go back to the House of Commons and defend having given up the rebate.’ But detailed proposals revealed that Britain would be expected to contribute to its own rebate in future. Officials refused to say how much money would be involved. But if the payment is made at the UK’s standard 13 per cent EU contribution, it would cost £416 million a year, or almost £3 billion over the seven-year period. However, according to new documents the EU president wants to go even further and impose a 25 per cent cut for 2014 to 2020, costing a total of £5.6 billion. British Government sources last night insisted that the rebate - which was watered down by Tony Blair - was ‘non-negotiable’. A senior source also rejected a ‘compromise’ budget proposal which would see funding for the EU rise by more than the rate of inflation. David Cameron has indicated he will veto anything that goes beyond a real-terms freeze when the budget negotiations begin in Brussels later this month. ‘Our position is extremely clear,’ the source said. ‘The Prime Minister has said he wants a budget freeze at worst and, with his veto last year, he has demonstrated he is serious about this.’ MPs voted earlier this month for the EU budget to be cut. In 1984 the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back' Tory MP Mark Reckless described Mr van Rompuy’s proposals as ‘ludicrous’. Mr Reckless said: ‘A rebate that we . have to pay for ourselves is not a rebate. It is a complete non-starter . and suggests that they are not serious about achieving a deal - it is . just unacceptable. ‘There has been a parting of the ways . between the EU leadership and the British people, and the gap is now so . wide it is hard to see how a deal can be done.’ Mr van Rompuy’s lastest proposals represent a modest reduction in the original one trillion euros (£800 billion) demanded by Brussels. But a real terms freeze would require a cut of up to £160 billion in the plans - much further than Mr van Rompuy is willing to go. British sources believe a deal is possible on a budget freeze this month, but unlikely. ‘A freeze is possible, but the landing pad is the size of a postage stamp and it’s covered in trip wires,’ a source said.’ Officials believe it is more likely that this month’s summit will result in a stand-off, with a decision delayed until next year. Sources in Brussels have suggested the summit could even be cancelled to allow Mr van Rompuy to save face. Britain owes it EU rebate to Margaret Thatcher’s famously tough negotiating stance in Europe. In 1984 the then Prime Minister secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding ‘our own money back’ during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France. When she threatened to withhold Britain’s annual payments to Brussels, fellow EU leaders eventually caved in. In the intervening years the deal has been worth tens of billions of pounds to Britain.Tony Blair gave away a large chunk of the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal.","European Commission President Herman van Rompuy unveils plan to slash Britain's rebate over seven years .

It was a unique and groundbreaking experiment to show British television viewers the true effects of a jet disaster. After four years of preparation a Boeing 727 was crashed into the Mexican desert - answering the question most consider when getting on a plane - where should someone sit to give themselves the best chance of survival. And in a macabre twist, people logged into Facebook last night could 'check-in online', choose where they would have sat on the flight and after the terrifying collision, which ripped off the front of the jet in a cloud of sand, debris and twisted metal, they found out if they had died or survived. The impact was pulled off deliberately for a documentary by the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 exploring the results of a 'serious, but survivable' crash-landing - producing incredible footage of its demise. And its conclusion was that despite having the best seats and service on the plane, being in first or business class makes you less likely to survive a crash landing. Scroll down for video of the crash . Groundbreaking: With its fuselage ripped in two, the deliberate crash-landing of this Boeing 727 in the Mexican desert shows just how devastating such an impact can have. The collision was filmed for a documentary and subjected to scientific tests in an effort to further understand 'serious, but survivable' crashes and improve safety . Wrecked: The experiment was designed to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of such disasters on the human body . They flew the Boeing over a remote part of desert before allowing it to smash . into the ground. On this occasion the jet, which can carry up to 170 passengers, contained only crash-test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence. A pilot had earlier flown the jet out to a Mexican desert and jumped out before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground. The experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body. It is the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane has been crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment. The last time was in 1984 when NASA teamed up with the FAA to crash a Boeing 720 into the Mojave Desert in California, USA. Online check-in: People watching with access to the internet could log in via Facebook and choose their seat on the ill-fated flight . Going down: The Boeing 727, which can normally carry 170 passengers, plunges into the ground in a remote-controlled descent moments after the pilot ejects . Amateur footage of the crash shows the plane heading into the desert floor while a helicopter flies alongside with a film crew. The latest experiment is expected to . give a better insight into a crash landing thanks to the benefit of . improved filming and remote control technology. The show is the result . of four years' work by London-based TV company Dragonfly Film and . Television Productions. Sanjay Singhal, executive producer of the documentary, said: 'We felt the time was right to do it again. 'It . has never been safer to fly, but we want to use this as an opportunity . to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety . in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does . occur. 'This has been an . extraordinary feat of organisation, involving up to 300 people on . location, including the production team, pilots, experts, risk . management, plus local crew, military, fire teams and police.' The plane was crashed in a remote and . unpopulated part of the Sonoran Desert of Baja California, Mexico. The . location was chosen after an extensive international search to find a . suitable location offering the perfect conditions for this . ground-breaking scientific project. First for 30 years: The aircraft, which was loaded with crash-test dummies and cameras, sends sand and debris shooting into the air as it careers into the desert floor . For safety reasons, an exclusion zone at the crash site was manned by security teams, as well as the Mexican military and police. Ahead of the crash, a full safety review of the project was undertaken by the highly-qualified pilots and commanders as well as the Mexican authorities which concluded that it was safe for all concerned. Following the crash, the aircraft will be salvaged and an extensive environmental clean-up operation is being carried out by a reputable agency with the full co-operation of the Mexican authorities. David Glover, Channel 4 senior commissioning editor, added: 'This is a ground-breaking project, allowing a team of leading international scientists and crash investigators the first chance for a generation to study the crash of an entire passenger jet. 'The scientists are also looking at passenger safety, plus new 'black box' flight data recording technology. 'They have been hugely enthusiastic supporters of the project and couldn't wait to get to the crash site. Despite long careers, none of them have seen a plane crash before their eyes like this before. 'We hope that this documentary will provide valuable new scientific results as well as giving passengers vital information about how they can improve their own chances of surviving the extremely unlikely, but frightening, prospect of being in a serious plane crash.'","Boeing 727 crashed deliberately for documentary exploring the effects of serious impacts on planes and people .

Her LLL breasts are deemed embarrassing by her children, she finds it uncomfortable to sleep and she has two torn vertebrae - but still Lacey Wildd insists she is proud of being plastic. The mother of six who has had 12 operations to give her the seventh largest breasts in the world says she will not stop having cosmetic surgery until they are the world's biggest. The 44-year-old from Miami, Florida, is already planning her next visit to the surgeon when she will go up to a MMM. She has not been deterred by the fact her 21lb breasts are already so . heavy that to help support them she has had to have an internal bra made of pigskin and her own muscle implanted into her torso. Embarrassing mom: Lacey Wildd's children - from left Brandan, 10, Michael, 15, Jenaveve, 5 and Tori, 17 - desperately want her to stop having surgery . Money- making: She insists that she the size of her breasts are actually for her children's welfare. 'I started all this so I can give them a better life,' said Ms Wildd . Four of her children Tori, 17, Michael, . 15, Brendon, 10, and Jenaveve, five, still live at home, and Tori has . faced teasing at school because of her mother's appearance. But Lacey insists that her ambition to increase the size of her breasts is actually for her children's welfare. 'I started all this so I can give them a better life,'' said Ms Wildd to the Sun Sentinel. 'My boobs are my paycheck. Go big or go home is my motto. 'I am proud to be plastic.' Then and now: Lacey Wildd in 1990 after her first operation, left, and today as an L-cup . Despite her children's concerns, . Ms Wildd, real name Paula Simonds, is determined to have the procedure - . which will take her closer towards her goal of becoming the world's biggest breasted model. 'If I have triple M implants it will take me into the top five big breasted models in the world,' said Ms Wildd. 'There is a top five and then everybody else is below that. 'It will increase my fame and earning power considerably. I want to make the most of this opportunity, to give my kids a good lifestyle.' She has already made sacrifices due to her breast size: she can no longer exercise or even pick up her youngest daughter. She is forced to sleep on her side hugging a pillow because the weight of the implants is too heavy on her chest and she can not have mammograms, instead having to rely on sonograms. Growing up in Illinois, Ms Wildd used to be a thin, brunette waitress and became a mother of two in her late teens. Career boost: Ms Wildd, left after surgery in 2001 and right today, says having bigger breasts will help her support her family . 'I wasn't making as much money as the blonde girls with the big boobs. I had two kids to take care of on my own,' she Ms Wildd who has worked as a tattoo artist, a veterinarian assistant and a marketer. Cosmetic surgery carries the same general risks as all operations, including infection and blood clots. There's also a risk of bleeding and scarring. Problems that can occur immediately after breast reconstruction surgery include infection, fluid under the wound and pain and discomfort. If the area around the breast implant becomes repeatedly infected or fluid keeps building up, the implant may need to be removed. Sometimes, the flap of tissue that is used to make a new breast can die and will need to be surgically removed. Long-term problems that can develop after breast reconstruction surgery include the implant hardening and changing shape, fluid leaks from the implant making lymph glands swell and unequal-sized breasts due to changes in weight. Using money from waiting on tables, Wildd saved up money for her first implant, and at 21, she expanded from an A cup to a D. 'That . was the day that changed my life. It gave me a lot more confidence. The . way people noticed me. People wanted to be around me. I turned myself . into a Barbie,' she told the newspaper. She . eventually moved to Las Vegas, where she worked as a showgirl and . continued developing her figure. At 26, she plumped up to a double D . cup and three years later, she became a triple D and had six more operations to expand her breast size. At 24 she increased to a K cup and last year, she ballooned to an L cup. Ms Wildd's . children say her huge breasts are embarrassing and want her . to stop risking her health. They are worried the MMM . implants will cause terrible side-effects such as stretching, tearing, . or even an infection that might kill her. Tori, 17 said: 'I don't want my mom to have her boobs made any bigger. Transformation: As a child Ms Wildd says she used to be a brunette tomboy, left, but today she is a peroxide blonde glamour model . I think she isn't really thinking about our opinions. What if she dies? Is she taking that into consideration? 'Does she really care that her kids could be left alone?' But the surgery-addicted model, who recently split from long-term boyfriend Manny, insists she will be careful. She said she is preparing her skin for the larger . implants to avoid the risks of rupturing, and will take every care to . avoid dangerous staph infections. 'I've stopped wearing a bra, so my skin has time to stretch,' she said. Addicted: The glamour model has had 12 breast enlargements as well as tummy tucks, bottom implants and silcone implants in her lips . 'I'm also trying to lose weight, and I went on a diet of liquid, vitamin B12 shots and apples for a while. Ms Wildd wears a corset to sculpt her . waist, and has also had two tummy tucks, four full body . liposuctions, abs sculpting, bottom implants and two bottom lifts. 'I know that the surgery is going to be dangerous,' she said. 'I went into this knowing that there are going to be very big risks involved. But I'm ready to take that chance.' She is able to pay for the surgeries through donations from fans who have given her thousands of dollars through the internet. [caption .

'The skin around her breasts is already extremely thin, and it would be too dangerous for her to undergo more surgery,' he said. I would advise she reconsider and seek help for her surgery obsession.' But Ms Wildd believes there are surgeons willing to carry out larger breast . implants, and is considering going abroad for an op. She admitted she worries about the effects of her fame in her children, especially Tori and Michael, who are in high school. 'I know Tori probably gets teased at school about me. All the boys she knows want to be my friends on Facebook,' she said. 'But whenever the kids bring friends home, they see I'm really cool, like a normal mom. 'I dress normally at home, play with the kids and make nice meals for my family. 'When I'm not acting or modelling, I'm just like anyone else.' Now she appears in films, TV shows, and advertisements, and has thousands of online fans. The mother, who also has silicone . lip implants, is often mobbed by fans at the beach or the mall while . dressed up for modelling assignments. But whenever she is out with her youngest children she says she is very protective so they have space together as a family. Ms Wildd added: 'I was one of six children, and my mom was so poor we couldn't afford a place with electricity or running water. 'I want to provide for my kids and pay for a college education, so they have opportunities I didn't have.'","Glamour model Lacey Wildd, 44, wants to supersize to a MMM cup .

Sweden's Euro 2012 squad playing England tomorrow have been rapped by their country's prime minister for conducting a bizarre bare-bottomed training session. A hugely embarrassing film shows reserve goalkeeper Johan Wiland on all fours with his shorts lowered, as players fire off shots at his exposed buttocks. The team were playing a game called 'the pig' in which players volley the ball to each other. Scroll down to watch the video . Down on all fours: Sweden's goalkeeper Johan Wiland kneels down on the ground with his shorts lowered so his fellow players can use his buttocks for target practice . Rearranging: But after the other players struggle to hit the spot, Wiland jumps up to reposition himself . As 'punishment' for letting the ball drop, Wiland was made to get on his hands and knees for the humiliating naked ritual. Sweden were defeated by Ukraine on Monday and must beat England in Kiev on Friday to stand a chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals. But instead of a rigorous practice session at their training ground, they were caught playing the oddball game popular in school playgrounds. Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt today lashed out at the national team that now has the hopes of the country on its shoulders. He told Sweden's Expressen newspaper: 'People who carry expectations should be aware of that and act accordingly. Bracing himself: Wiland, after turning himself into a slightly easier target, wearily looks behind as his team mates prepare to shoot . Ready, aim, fire: Sweden's footballers line up to try and hit the target - Wiland's bottom . 'It's important to reflect on how what one does in order to meet expectations.' Centre Party leader Annie Loof described the game as 'tasteless', adding to the paper: 'They are really not being good role models.'

The head of Sweden's anti-bullying group Friends also told Expressen: ""They have shown unbelievably poor judgment. Lucky escape: Fortunately for Wiland the ball goes wide of the mark . 'Tasteless': Politicians have criticised the naked target practice game - claiming the players are not behaving like 'good role models' for their young fans . 'They are heroes for thousands of boys and girls across Sweden and I don't think they should send signals that this is okay. 'These sorts of games happen at schools and at sports clubs, but there are also children who end up vulnerable in these situations.'

When she met the Queen and Prince Philip at a garden party in Western Australia late last year Gina Rinehart became a figure of fun when the Duke pointed to her large hat and said she might poke somebody’s eye out ‘with that thing’. But today it’s Mrs Rinehart who is laughing - all the way to the bank - after being named as the world’s richest woman with a fortune of more than £18 billion. The daughter of the late Australian iron-ore mining magnate Lang Hangcock, 58-year old Mrs Rinehart has been given the richest woman title by the country’s Business Review Weekly magazine, putting her at the top of its Rich 200 list. In the money: Gina Rinehart is laughing all the way to the bank after being named as the world's richest woman with a fortune of more than £18 billion. She makes about £630,000 every 30 minutes . Mrs Rinehart has easily surprised Forbes’ calculation of the £16 billion estimation of Christy Walton, widow of John Walton and holder of a major stake in the American retail giant Wal-Mart. Prince Philip told Mrs Rinehart she 'might poke somebody's eye out' with her hat at a garden party last year . The most recent estimates say the Queen is worth around £300 million. In an extraordinary accumulation of riches from the mining industry, Mrs Rinehart’s wealth has grown by an unprecedented £11 billion this year alone. She makes more than £630,000 every 30 minutes, say financial experts. She can thank a recovery in the price of iron ore over the past six months and foreign investment in new projects. Andrew Heathcote, the rich list editor, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that if the demand for natural resources remains strong, additional multi-billion pound mines were ‘almost inevitable’. ‘There is a real possibility that Rinehart will become not just the richest woman in the world, but the richest person in the world.’ To do that, she could have to climb past the £43 billion fortune of Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu. While she has received good news about her wealth, Mrs Rinehart has still had no satisfaction from an ongoing financial feud with her children. Two months ago Australian High Court rejected her bid to suppress details of the battle she is having with her children over a multi-billion pound family trust. The Queen talks with Gina Rinehart at a garden party in Perth last year. It was at this event that Prince Philip commented on her large black hat, pictured . Her youngest child, Gina - who has stood by her mother in the family feud - accused her siblings of being ‘motivated entirely by greed’, saying they would ‘regret putting money before family.’ She added: ‘Unfortunately, this realisation will come too late as the damage to our family and its good reputation will already have been done. 1.

A pair of raiders caught clutching a crowbar and £200 outside a pub they had just burgled looked certain to go to jail. Yet despite being caught red-handed, they laughed at their victims as they walked free from court after a blunder by prosecutors. Crown Prosecution Service lawyers lost vital evidence including a sock containing the money, fingerprints and photos of the crime scene. Landlady April Grimes is fuming after the burglary case was dropped because of a lack of evidence . Mrs Grimes, pictured with her daughter April, said she is more than £300 out of pocket after having to pay to replace smashed windows in her pub . When they asked for an adjournment to hunt for the evidence, a district judge refused and dismissed the case. Last night furious pub landlady April Grimes, 47, branded the justice system ‘a joke’ after the pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, walked free. She said: ‘These lads were caught red-handed – I saw them being caught. I thought they might go to prison, yet they got away with it. ‘The two defendants were laughing at us going out of court. They knew they were not going to be sent down. It was joke justice. ‘They got away with it because someone didn’t do the basic job of getting the evidence together.’ The break-in happened in the early hours one morning in July as Mrs Grimes slept upstairs with her partner at the Britannia Tavern in Oldham. The thieves smashed a back window to gain entry, waking the couple, who dialled 999. About £200 of coins was stolen from the fruit machine at the Britannia Tavern pub in Oldham . Mrs Grimes watched from her upstairs window as the police arrived moments later to find two men outside with cash from the pub fruit machine. One of them approached an officer brandishing a crowbar and was tasered before they were both arrested. Mrs Grimes said: ‘They had lined up bottles on the bar and had been drinking. They then raided the fruit machine and put the money in a sock. There must have been about £200 in coins in there. ‘The police were great and  we thought we had a good case, as they were caught red-handed.’ But the landlady said she was stunned when she heard the pair, aged 42 and 31, intended to plead not guilty when they appeared in court last week. ‘They had put aside three days for the trial,’ she said. ‘The police were there and we all thought it was going to be a cut and dried case. ‘Then the CPS came over to me and said the case had been dismissed because of lack of evidence. ‘They told me they didn’t have the sock used to hold the money, photos of the scene, fingerprint  evidence and photos of the fruit machine and smashed window. Mrs Grimes said she will now make a formal complaint to the CPS and said slammed the 'joke justice' system . A district judge at Oldham Magistrates' Court dismissed the case because of a 'lack of evidence' ‘I’m not surprised it was down to lack of evidence – they seemed to have lost the lot.’ The district judge at Oldham magistrates’ court dismissed the case as an ‘abuse of process’. Mrs Grimes said: ‘I’m livid. Not being able to deliver the evidence is just not good enough. I have lost up to £400 in repairs. ‘People will go out and commit these crimes and they are doing it because they know the courts are letting them off. These guys didn’t even get a smack on the wrists.’ She is making a formal complaint to the Crown Prosecution Service. Last night Kate McAlinden, the district crown prosecutor for the area, said: ‘I am looking into why the evidence was not available as a matter of urgency so I can contact the victim with a full explanation. ‘Before making any further comment, the CPS will consider the district judge’s reasons for dismissing the case.’","£200 in coins stolen from pub fruit machine and stashed inside sock .

Naming the 150 men who allegedly hired a Maine Zumba dance instructor for sex will mark them all with a 'scarlet letter,' a defence attorney is arguing. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court will tomorrow consider whether to allow the 'list of shame' - which residents claim includes politicians, policemen, farmers, accountants and even a TV personality - to be released. Stephen Schwartz is fighting to have the names blocked, and yesterday launched an appeal against a decision made by a state judge to put them on the public record. Scroll down for video . Secret studio: Alexis Wright, 29, a Zumba fitness instructor is accused of providing sex for money to potentially over a hundred documented men at her studio and office . 'We think there's a really important principle at stake here: These people are presumed innocent,' Mr Schwartz told The Christian Science Monitor. 'Once these names are released, they're all going to have the mark of a scarlet letter, if you will.' Alexis Wright, a 29-year-old fitness instructor from Wells, has pleaded not guilty to 106 counts of prostitution, invasion of privacy, tax evasion and other charges for allegedly accepting money for sex and secretly videotaping her encounters. Her business partner Mark Strong Sr, a . 57-year-old insurance agent and private investigator from Thomaston, has . also pleaded not guilty to 59 misdemeanor charges for his alleged role. Detailed list: An attorney for Ms Wright's business partner has said he has a list of more than 150 people who were alleged customers of Ms Wright, pictured . Kennebunk Police are awaiting word from the courts before they release the identities of the first tranche of alleged clients or 'Johns'. Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Maine, meaning that those found guilty will face fines but no jail time. 'There's still some of that puritanical New England left around,' Will Bradford, who owns a copy shop in town, said. 'There are places in the world that would laugh at this.' However, other residents claim the names should be kept secret to prevent innocent people, such as children, being victimised as a result of someone else's crime. Kennebunk bakery employee Josh Raymond told CNN customers were talking about the scandal, but 'in hushed tones.' The Portland Press-Herald is debating whether to publish all names or just those well-known in the community in an effort to minimise the damage to reputations and livelihoods. The local York County Coast Star newspaper is set to publish the full list, believing it's the right thing to do. 'There are people in this community who have had their names dragged through the mud for months because people believe they are on the list,' Coast Star editor Laura Dolce told CNN. 'We also believe that printing the names of those charged with engaging a prostitute is the fair thing to do... to help set the record straight and put to rest the ugly rumors that continue to circulate throughout town.' On Thursday, a state judge declined to stop the release of the names but Mr Schwartz launched an appealed against the decision. Kennebunk police have been issuing . summons to Ms Wright's johns and originally planned to release the first . names of suspected clients on Friday. Mr Schwartz is appealing and is also asking permission to take the case to superior court. Searches of Ms Wright's studio and office turned up video recordings of sexual acts, billing information and meticulous records about clients, according to court documents. Shocking find: Police say in this studio, now seen vacant and for sale, video recordings of sexual acts, billing information and meticulous records about clients were found produced by Ms Wright . Business partner: Mark Strong Sr., seen after his arrest and during his arraignment, was Ms Wright's business partner who now faces 59 charges, including promotion of prostitution and violation of privacy . Anticipation: The alleged scandal at the former Pura Vida fitness studio, in Kennebunk, seen closed this week, has attracted incredible attention from locals who eagerly await the names of Ms Wright's suspected male clients . Based on that information, Kennebunk . police have been begun issuing summonses to Ms Wright's johns on . misdemeanour charges of engaging a prostitute. The . first names were to be released on Friday in police activity reports . that are made public every other week, said Lt. Anthony Burpee. But . Mr Schwartz, who is a lawyer for two of the men believed to be on the list, asked a judge on . Thursday to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the release of . the names. District Judge Andre Janelle quickly rejected the motion for a restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the release of names. The three-page order was signed by the judge on Thursday night and filed on Friday in Biddeford District Court. The existence of such a list has fuelled speculation about who is on it. Residents have said they've heard it could include lawyers, law enforcement officers and some well-known names. Surprise moves: One women who took the fitness dance class instructed by Wright, pictured, said she was surprised by the news even though she says Wright did come across as rather flirtatious to the men . Mr Strong's attorney, Dan Lilley, has said he has a list of more than 150 people who were alleged customers, but that he wouldn't release the names unless they're called as witnesses if the case goes to trial. Allison Ackley, who participated in Wright's Zumba class, said she had no idea that Ms Wright was allegedly leading a double-life. 'She was very professional. She was an amazing dancer and she held a good class so I liked going. I thought she was a little, not risqué but a little flirtatious, with a couple of the male participants in the class. But it's Zumba. You're there to have fun. I didn't think anything of it.' The case has rocked this small town, which is well-known for its ocean beaches, old sea captains' mansions and the neighbouring town of Kennebunkport, home to the Bush family's Walker's Point summer compound . 'It'll be interesting to see who's on that list because we're hearing that there are selectmen, there are policemen, that there are firemen — people that we're going to know in town,' said local resident Elaine Nicholson. 'So everyone is, like, waiting with baited breath.'","Alexis Wright, 29, is accused of running a brothel out of her Zumba fitness studio in the town of Kennebunk .

Parenting: The picture - in which her face is clearly visible - went viral on the Internet and sparked outrage with some calling the dad 'sick' and urging social services to investigate him . While he had defended his tough love approach, he also regrets that the image reached so many thousands of people. He never intended for it to go viral. 'This doesn't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice. It makes me human,' he said. His daughter, thankfully, has remained ignorant of the entire ordeal. 'My biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank God has remained ignorant of this ordeal,' he said. 'If people actually have my daughter’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone.' People have every right to pass judgment on me and disagree with my actions. I personally thought it was funny and wasn't looking for attention but merely trying to give parents that are able to laugh at these silly things a chance to. I've seen similar things online but I guess they just flew under the radar.  Being in the company of “shaming” parents is false because I wasn’t angry with my daughter I was making light of a messy situation. As far as the negative comments, I've been treating them the same way I'm raising my daughter to treat anyone that would bully her I'm ignoring them. I don't judge them. I've been flooded with support, been properly asked to use my daughters image on like minded blogs and I greatly appreciate that. Many people loved it and received exactly as intended. The outrage this has caused is terrible. To say that I've been threatened is an understatement. I'm very sorry for offending anyone but I refuse to coddle my child and make her think the world is going to be handed to her with padded walls and no worries. This wasn't a lesson I was teaching her or some action with ill intent. I will admit it was poor judgment on my part to allow it to be seen to this magnitude. I don't raise my daughter on poor judgment but I like every other person in the world am capable of making one. This doesn't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice. It makes me human. In her life I'm certain she'll meet bullies and people who are just plain mean. Many of them were in the original post talking flat out perverted and disgusting about my 3 year old. This is why I deleted it. I will always do everything in my power to prevent that but they're out there. I've learned a few things from this and that's that not everyone has the same sense of humor and I'll just have to keep my photos to family, close friends and myself. People are far more easily offended then I actually thought. I would appreciate it if this didn't get any bigger. My biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank God has remained ignorant of this ordeal. If people actually have my daughter’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone. I don’t need the approval of people who automatically assume someone is a bad parent because of one instance of disagreement. My daughter and my wife are my whole life. They are all I really need.","Father spoke exclusively to MailOnline about fury following photograph .

Paralysed for life: Engineer Matthew Edmonds arrived at court to see Samuel Evans sentenced for an attack that left him in a wheelchair . A judge lamented his 'pathetic' sentencing powers as he jailed a drunken yob who left an aerospace engineer paralysed from the neck down for less than three years. Matthew Edmonds, 33, was left with only some limited movement in his arms after he was punched in the street by Samuel Evans. Thug Evans was already subject to a suspended jail term for a previous assault when he lashed out at Mr Edmonds, causing him to fall and hit his head on a concrete floor, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Evans was sentenced to a total of 34 months in jail after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Edmonds, who was helped into court in his wheelchair. Jailing him for 28 months for the assault and implementing his six-month suspended sentence consecutively, Judge William Hart told Evans the public might view the penalty as 'pathetic'. While the result of the punch was 'devastating' for Mr Edmonds, who worked as an aerospace testing engineer, sentencing guidelines did not allow him to pass a longer term for the offence - or one which would truly mark the gravity of the consequences of his actions, the judge said. The maximum sentence for the offence of unlawful wounding is five years, but Evans' guilty plea meant he was entitled to a reduction. Evans had written a letter to the court saying 'I have wrecked Mr Edmonds’ life and I hate myself for it.' He added: 'I have done wrong in my life but I never thought something like this would happen. I am a stupid boy. 'I swear I have changed and I couldn’t be more sorry. I have wrote to Mr Edmonds to say sorry and I know he could never forgive me but I truly am 100 per cent sorry.' Outside court after the hearing Mr Edmonds, who had been brought to court from the spinal injuries unit at Salisbury Hospital, said he had been hoping Evans would get a longer sentence but he understood the judge’s hands were tied. 'I knew Evans had one previous conviction for violence but I didn’t realise there were others as well,' he said. 'He told the court he has written to me but I have never had a letter from him. I thought what he wrote that was read out in court did not sound that genuine - it was just the standard sort of thing you would expect him to say in the circumstances. 'I came to court because I just wanted to draw a line under it all. It was quite hard being in court to hear it all and to see him. But it was something I felt I had to do. Sentence: Judge William Hart, right, gave Samual Evans, left, less than three years in prison which he admitted might seem 'pathetic' 'I am now classed as a tetraplegic, paralysed from the neck down. I do have some limited movement in my arms but that’s all. 'I was working as a non destructive testing engineer in the aerospace industry. I won't be able to go back to that work and I shall have to re-evaluate what I am going to do.' Giles Nelson, prosecuting, said Mr Edmonds had been with two friends in Stroud town centre making their way to a taxi rank on March 25th at 3am when they encountered Evans. 'Evans started dancing around Mr Edmonds asking him if he would like to ""bum him"",' said Mr Nelson. “He asked him this several times. He was moving around the group and putting his backside towards Mr Edmonds.' Mr Nelson said Evans was clearly trying to provoke a reaction and it was one of Mr Edmonds’ friends who did react, leaning over and slapping Evans on the back of the head or neck. Evans then unleashed a punch which floored Mr Edmonds. 'He hit his head on the concrete and the injuries he sustained are absolutely devastating,' said Mr Nelson. 'He is confined to a wheelchair and is now what his consultant has described as a permanent tetraplegic. 'The consequences of what happened that night are dreadful.' Gloucester Crown Court, pictured, heard that the thug constantly tried to provoke Edmonds before punching him to the ground and paralysing him . Mr Nelson outlined Evans past convictions including one in 2010 for battery, another in July last year for the same offence and then in August last year for assault causing actual bodily harm when he got a 36 weeks suspended sentence from Judge Hart. Joe Maloney, defending, read out Evans’ letter to the court and said: 'He is genuinely sorry for the pain and anguish he has caused Mr Edmonds. He has had difficulty coming to terms with what he has inflicted on Mr Edmonds. “ . Jailing Evans Judge Hart said it was he who had passed the suspended sentence on him last year. 'At that stage it was believed that if given a further chance under supervision you might be able to change your ways. How wrong we were.' said the judge. Crime: The incident happened in the centre of Stroud (file picture) as Mr Edmonds was walking towards a taxi rank . Evans clearly had a propensity for getting drunk and being violent in public places, as all his previous offences showed, he said. 'On this dreadful night you were drunk and looking for trouble, as appears to have become your habit. You used offensive and provocative behaviour. 'You then struck a forceful blow to Mr Edmonds. The consequences for him have been as dramatic as they could be, short of death. It was catastrophic. He is paralysed below the neck and that is a result of what you did.' The judge said the maximum sentence for the offence of unlawful wounding which Evans admitted is five years imprisonment but he was entitled to a reduction for his guilty plea. Many might regard the maximum as ‘pathetic’ in such circumstances, he added.","Samual Evans punched Matthew Edmonds to the ground where he hit his head and became paralysed .

An evil thug who savagely beat a little baby girl - breaking both her legs, fracturing her skull and leaving her with permanent brain damage - has jailed for 10 years and nine months. Polish-born Grzegorze Lis, 35, even bit the tiny eight-week-old's arm as he inflicted an horrific catalogue of injuries, the court heard. The violence was so severe, the child has been left her blind and deaf and in need of constant round the clock care, it was said. Horror: St Albans Crown Court heard harrowing details of how the eight-week-old suffered agonising injuries at the hands of evil Lis . And the tiny child was left in agony for almost a week because Lis' twisted partner, Joanna Skrodzka, 22, refused to alert authorities in a bid to protect him, St Albans crown court was told. Skrodzka, who shared a flat in, Hemel Hempstead, with Lis, was jailed for two years for an offence of child cruelty. St Albans crown court heard today that the injuries to the baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were inflicted by Lis. Both the baby’s legs were broken at the lower shin area close to the ankles. Both thigh bones had also been broken. The child suffered a fractured skull . caused by a massive impact injury and there was evidence that it had . been violently shaken in a separate incident causing bleeding on the . brain and leaving it starved of oxygen, which had left her blind. Jane Bickerstaff QC prosecuting told . how in March of this year the baby girl born just two months earlier in . January was attacked and violently assaulted by unemployed Lis on a . number of occasions. Agony: The tiny baby was finally treated for her injuries in Great Ormond Street Hospital, pictured - after enduring almost a week with terrible injuries . But Skrodzka turned a blind eye to the terrible pain the baby was suffering, the judge was told. As a result, no medical help was there for the little girl. It was not until almost a week later . that staff at Watford General Hospital saw the baby for the first time . and she was immediately transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in . London. Today Polish born Miss Skrodzka appeared . for sentence having been found guilty by a jury last month of the . offence of child cruelty. Recorder Amanda Tipples who had . presided over Skrodzka’s trial said that she thought the injuries had . been inflicted sometime between Thursday, March 1, or Friday, March 2, . of this year by Lis. Passing sentence, Recorder Tipples . told Skrodzka: 'You failed to get any medical help for her even though . you were aware something terrible had happened to her and she was . unwell.' The recorder said a 'right thinking person' would not have waited more than five minutes once it was realised the child was ill. Lis was jailed on Monday for two offences of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the baby girl with intent and causing her actual bodily harm. During Skrodzka’s trial, expert evidence was given by a doctor that in 600 cases he had been involved in, this was one of the worst cases of brain damage he had ever seen where the child had survived. The court heard today the child is now incontinent because of it’s injuries and will need 24 hour care for the rest of her life.","Grzegorze Lis, 35, even bit the tiny infant on her arm as he inflicted an horrific catalogue of injuries .

The billionaire owner of a $90 million condominium at a new luxury Manhattan building could only have to pay an estimated $20,000 in property taxes - a far cry from the $230,000 the city is owed. The staggering tax break for residents of One57, a stunning 95 story residential building under construction on West 57th Street, is intended for property developers who designate 20 per cent of their units to low income families. Though the building could reap the benefit of the city's housing program, the low income renters won't be housed in the posh building and instead will be placed in subsidized units in the outer boroughs of New York City. Opulent: One57 will be New York's tallest residential once it opens in 2013 . Luxury: The building, located at 157 West 57th Street in Manhattan, is currently under construction and was designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc . One57, New York's tallest residential building-to-be, has been under construction since 2009 and is set to open in 2013. Full-floor apartments start at floor 77, with the Park Hyatt Hotel at the base, and the starting price for a space in the tower is reportedly $45 million. The tower, designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc, will offer luxury amenities like a full service spa, a screening room, private dining room, a full spa and even a pet wash room. The billionaires behind fashion label Michael Kors, Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, have both signed contracts for $50 million full-floor apartments in the tower at 157 W. 57th Street. A sprawling 13,554 square foot apartment on the 75th and 76th floor on . the building, reportedly sold for $90 million to an unknown buyer and the penthouse of One57, located on the 89th and 90th floors, was rumored to have sold for $95 million. For the $95 million property, in normal circumstances taxes would ring up to roughly $230,000 . annually but with the developer's tax benefit, the wealthy buyer could only have to hand over less than 10 per cent of the tax bill, or $20,000, to Uncle Sam. High end: The units at the Manhattan tower reportedly start at $45 million . Stunning: The building overlooks Central Park and comes with a slew of amenities including an indoor pool, a screening room, a pet-wash room, an arts atelier and a full service spa . The NYC . Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the . Department of Finance administers the housing program, known as 421, . that provides a tax abatement to property developers that allocate residential units to the needy for a reduced price. Luxury developers have taken advantage of the program, taking the tax break for units in high-priced buildings but not carving out space in those builders for lower income renters. Instead, developers tend to provide low cost real estate in less expensive neighborhoods outside of Manhattan. The . developer of the luxury building, set to open in 2013, has applied for . the 421 exemption but has not yet been deemed eligible for the tax . benefit, according to CNBC. High five: Lawrence Stroll, left, and Silas K. F. Chou, second from right, celebrate the IPO for the label of fashion designer Michael Kors, second left, in December 2011 . But just the possibility of the tax benefit for the creme de la creme of New York, is causing an uproar. One local politician has decried the practice and is calling for an end to the entitlement. 'This is an outrageous giveaway,' Brad Lander, a New York City . councilman told CNBC. 'We can't afford to be giving away millions of dollars in . tax breaks for nothing.' The tax break is estimated to have cost the city more than $1 billion in lost tax revenue, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office. But the head of Extel Development, the company overseeing the . construction of One57, insisted that they have followed the city's . guidelines. 'We've had some benefit because of the abatements, but the real benefits . have been to  affordable housing,' Gary Barnett, founder of Extell . Development, told CNBC.

A music promoter allegedly stalked his ex and her new lover for months before shooting them both in the head outside a motel. Joseph Kernizan is suspected of gunning down Tracy Bennett and her reggae star boyfriend Wayne Hamilton as they left a New York motel following a steamy tryst. Ms Bennett, 38, was heard begging for her life in the Bronx car park before she and Mr Hamilton were murdered, witnesses said. Gunned down: Tracey Bennett, pictured, had been dating Wayne Hamilton for five years before the pair were shot dead in a motel car park, friends said . Mr Hamilton, also known as Captain Barkey, had apparently previously taunted his lover's former partner in a song called Nah Lef Joe. The track, released in 2010, is about . about having sex with a woman who has not left her partner, with the . chorus running, 'She tell me she nah lef Joe.' Friends said the song was aimed at . Kernizan, 42, who police are hunting in connection with Saturday's . double murder outside the Holiday Motel. 'It’s a song about her not leaving Joe,' said Ms Bennett’s friend Bella, who declined to give her last name. 'He . was begging her to leave Joe for a long time.' Mr Hamilton, 50, had repeatedly been warned . by friends to end the affair because Kernizan was 'a serious man,' dancehall artist Wickerman told Jamaican entertainment news site . One876Entertainment. Warning sign: Reggaeton singer Mr Hamilton, 50, had recorded a song called Nah Lef Joe in which he complained about his lover not leaving her ex-partner . Hamilton’s grieving music partner, David 'Wickerman' Taylor, told the New York Post that Kernizan had been stalking Mr Hamilton for months. 'It was August when he told me that this man in New York was following him,' Mr Taylor said in an emotional interview from Jamaica. 'Barkey said the man trailed him, he was stalking him. And he tried to run him down, off the road. 'I said, ""You’ve got to be careful."" I warned him, ""You don’t know what this guy will do."" 'We figured he had a tracking device on her. 'That was Barkey’s only enemy. Everyone loved him. He was not a troublemaker.' On the run: Police suspect Joseph Kernizan of murdering Ms Bennett, the mother of his children, and her lover in cold blood . Police believe Kernizan was waiting when Ms Bennett and Mr Hamilton emerged from the . Holiday Motel at around 3.10am and were about to drive away. Ms Bennett screamed: 'Don't do it! Don't do it!' before her jilted boyfriend allegedly fired more than two dozen . bullets at the defenceless pair. Mr Hamilton was shot several times in the back of the head as he tried to run away, while Ms Bennett was shot in the head as she stood beside a . Toyota Camry with the motor running. Witnesses who . were celebrating a birthday in a room upstairs said they overheard four or five gunshots, 1010 WINS reported, and ran to see . what was happening. 'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' said party guest Ricky Gugliotta. Singing career: Mr Hamilton, left, who went by the stage name Captain Barkey, had moved from his native Jamaica to Wisconsin, where he lived with wife Mavis . 'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.' Both were pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services, according to the New York Daily News. Kernizan fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources said. Motel guest Augustine Mawugbe, 45, said he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots. He said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol. 'Aggression': Neighbours said Kernizan, pictured in a police mugshot, was regularly heard having loud arguments with Ms Bennett, the mother of two of his children . He said . the man fired about ten times, and then got into a light green Toyota Camry . or Ford Taurus and drove away at speed. Ms Bennett had been dating Ms Hamilton for five years, friends said, but had struggled to leave Kernizan, the father of two of her three children, a 12-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy. Her oldest child, daughter Dajahnae, 18, rushed home from the University of Baltimore after learning her mother was dead. 'He was so obsessed with her,' said her friend Bella. The 38-year-old even took out an order of protection against the music promoter, making him even more enraged, said others. Crime scene: The cold-blooded murders took place in the parking lot of Holiday Motel in The Bronx . Her neighbours said they often heard her and Kernizan, nicknamed 'Country', . screaming at each other and police were regularly called to their tidy . two-storey home. 'We always heard them fighting,' said Carolina Manzano. Neighbours described Ms Bennett as a sweet woman who was seen . leaving her house every morning for her job as a nurse at Winthrop University Hospital, while Kernizan stayed out late and often returned in flashy cars. Tenants at a house he owned in Brooklyn said he also owned a nearby barbershop, opened a club and owned four different cars. Mr Hamilton's . friends said he was . originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee with his wife Mavis, who knew nothing about his affair with Ms Bennett. Tragedy: Guests at the motel saw Mr Hamilton and Ms Bennett celebrating with a bottle of champagne just hours before the early morning murders . ‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub. Another . friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Mr Hamilton - best known for his 1996 hit Go Go Wine - on Friday from . the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club. Mrs Hamilton, who had dropped him off at the airport on Friday for his trip to New York, left worried messages for him when she did not hear from anything. The 48-year-old said: 'Now that he’s dead, what can I do? The memories that I’ll keep is the man that I know that loved me. 'He was the funniest, kindest, most loving person you would ever meet.'

It’s 42-year-old Gary Connery, plunging to earth at something like 60mph on a wing and a prayer. He has just jumped out of a helicopter at 2,400ft and is travelling rapidly towards us over the English countryside. Parachute? They are for sissies. Mr Connery prefers his sail-like ‘Wingman’ suit, which, everyone hopes, will allow him to steer towards a (relatively) soft landing on a bed of cardboard boxes. Scroll down for video . Free as a bird: Stuntman Gary Connery glides above a country house in Henley-on-Thames in his attempt to become the first skydiver in the world to land without a parachute . Jump: Gary Connery's flight lasted just 45 seconds . Ah yes, the landing. He admits that’s the tricky bit.So as we wait for him in a sunlit field in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, all eyes are skyward. Standing nearby is his loyal wife Vivienne, who has spent the last couple of days helping her husband and an army of volunteers arrange a 12ft-deep layer of 18,600 boxes in a 40ft wide strip, about the length of a football pitch. Yesterday, as he clambered into the helicopter from which he was to make  his leap of faith, the ex-paratrooper and veteran film stunt expert was confident he had left nothing to chance in his campaign to become the first man to pull off this death-defying stunt. Through binoculars, we can see him standing on the skids wearing helmet and neck brace. Then he steps into fresh air. Like a distant speck on a canvas of blue, he comes gradually into view. He looks like a cross between Superman and a flying squirrel, arms outstretched with the suit spreading out to his fingertips. To one side, a circling red kite gives him a suspicious glance. Vivienne goes momentarily quiet. Suddenly, we can make out his face. Then, with the rather satisfying but seldom-heard percussion of man against cardboard, he cannonballs into the boxes at 50mph – and into the record books. He calls Vivienne on a walkie-talkie before emerging triumphant. Mission accomplished. Although he had an emergency parachute (the Civil Aviation Authority insisted on it) it would never open in time to save him once he passed a certain altitude. Target: Mr Connery gazes at the rectangular strip of cardboard boxes in a field way below . View from the other side: Mr Connery looks like a superhero as he is milliseconds away from flattening the cardboard cartons . Easy does it: This stunning image shows the split second before Mr Connery hits the cardboard boxes to achieve his dream . He's alive! The daredevil clambers out of his cardboard crash-pad to ecstatic cheers from onlookers . Thus, the critical point – no one dares call it ground-breaking – came 200ft up and 400ft from the boxes. ‘Essentially it’s a controlled crash,’ he tells me rather perkily. ‘Once I got six or seven seconds away, I was totally committed.’ First question: Why? ‘Why not?’ he replies. ‘Ask an artist why he paints a picture or stands all day at a block of rock with a hammer and chisel. This is my art.’ What does it feel like to fly? ‘It’s beautiful,’ he says dreamily ‘It’s a very emotional experience – so serene, so surreal.’ And landing? ‘Amazing. So soft.’ The birdman, who flew under sponsorship from the Bremont watch company, based in his home town of Henley-on-Thames, admits there was a risk involved but does not accept it was foolhardy, or even dangerous. On the brink: Mr Connery prepares to take a leap of faith from the side of a helicopter above the English countryside .

Precarious: Mr Connery (right) sits in the front of the helicopter moments before he steps on to the rail below ahead of his jump .

He has, after all, come close to death in a jump from the Eiffel Tower, ridden a bicycle over Beachy Head and parachuted from the top of the London Millennium Eye. He once leaped from Tower Bridge into a moving boat, and plunged off a cliff after setting himself ablaze. Next? ‘He is planning to become a human firework,’ Vivienne casually discloses. Final question: Does anyone need £22,000 worth of slightly used cardboard boxes? Coming in to land: The daredevil prepares to crash into the middle of the mountain of cardboard boxes .

A majority of mothers of newborns said that their Facebook use increased after birth - whereas fathers stay the same, and the increase can bump up stress say Ohio State researchers . You might think that the birth of a child would be a moment to spend some quality time with the real world - but it appears not. A majority of mothers of newborns said that their Facebook use increased after birth - whereas fathers stay the same. The 'habit' can also cause stress - at  a time that is already difficult for masy parents. Mothers who were more frequent . visitors to their Facebook accounts and who managed their accounts more . frequently reported higher levels of parenting stress. The researchers cautioned that they . can't tell from this data whether more Facebook use caused stress for . mothers, or if mothers with higher levels of stress were more likely to . use Facebook frequently. ‘I think the most likely . interpretation is that mothers who experience higher levels of stress . are looking for social support on Facebook so they visit more often,’ she said. ‘I know that I see a lot of Facebook . posts from new mothers talking about how their child wouldn't sleep, or . how their second child was harder than their first. Stressed-out mothers . may be using Facebook to vent and to find help.’ Results showed that 44 percent of mothers said their Facebook use increased after giving birth, compared to 27 percent who said it decreased and 29 percent who said it stayed the same. For fathers, 31 percent said their Facebook use increased, while 19 percent said it decreased and 51 percent said it stayed the same. The majority of mothers - 58% - visited their accounts at least once a day, compared to 44 percent of fathers. Nearly all women - 93% - said they . had uploaded photos of their child to Facebook, while 83% of . fathers said they did. The study, published in the July issue of the journal Family Relations, is the first to investigate new parents' use of Facebook during this stressful life event. The results offer some initial clues as to how Facebook use may affect new parents' adjustment to parenthood, according to the researchers. The findings suggest that, despite all the new demands faced by new parents, spending time on Facebook was worthwhile to them, said Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, co-author of the study and associate professor of human development and family science at Ohio State University. ‘Given all the stress that new parents are under and everything they have to manage, it wouldn't have been surprising if we had found a decrease in Facebook usage - but that's not what we found,’ Schoppe-Sullivan said. ‘These mothers may be taking time off from work, and may be far from family, so this network they created for themselves on Facebook can be very valuable in helping them cope,’ said Mitchell Bartholomew, lead author of the study and a graduate student in human development and family science at Ohio State. The study involved 154 mothers and 150 fathers, most of whom were white and highly educated. The data from this study came from questions asked nine months after the birth of their child.","Majority of mothers increase Facebook use after birth .

Highly paid energy bosses who are imposing above-inflation price increases on their customers can claim staff discounts on their power bills that save them around £150 a year. Senior executives and managers at five of Britain’s six energy giants are entitled to cuts in their household fuel bills of up to 12 per cent while they impose increases of up to 9 per cent on consumers. The millionaire chief executive of Scottish firm SSE, Ian Marchant, 51, is taking advantage of the staff discount. He claims a 12 per cent discount on the energy bill for his luxury home – estimated at £140 a year – despite receiving a £1.2million pay package. Ian Marchant (left) has pay package of £1.2m and claims 12 per cent (£140) discount on his energy bills. Vincent De Rivaz (right) is also paid £1.2m and is offered a discount of £48. He has not said whether he has taken the cut he is eligible for . Two other firms, EDF UK and npower, admitted their bosses were eligible but would not say if they had taken advantage of the scheme. Vincent de Rivaz, 58, the Frenchman who is chief executive of EDF UK, is eligible for a £48 discount on the cost of his household fuel and electricity bill while taking home £1.2million in pay and benefits. Volker Beckers, Chief Executive of RWE npower has a pay package of £1m. He is entitled to £100 discount, but it is not known whether he has claimed it . Volker Beckers, the German who is chief executive of npower, is paid £1million in cash and benefits, and is entitled to vouchers worth £100 for buying his energy from the firm. Executives at other energy firms have decided not to take up their staff discounts due to public anger at the size of the price increases. The entire board of directors at British Gas’s parent company Centrica has agreed not to take the universal £200 staff discount on their energy bills this year. E-ON chief executive Tony Cocker does not take the annual £150 ‘staff energy reward’ which is open to all employees. Scottish Power does not offer a staff discount. Last night the energy fatcats were urged to give up the perks. LibDem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘This is highly insensitive. These energy bosses on £1million-plus packages really should do the right thing and follow their colleagues by giving up these discounts. It is the least they can do when most people are struggling to pay the extra charges put on their energy bills by their firms. ‘These people are earning in excess of £1million but still they worry about clawing back a few pounds.’ Paul Green, spokesman for the older people’s organisation Saga, said: ‘These executives need to examine their consciences to see if it is right that they accept these discounts.’ Many families are already struggling to pay their energy bills amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes for more than 60 years. Millions of households will be forced to find an extra £100 on average to cover the cost of their heating and power bill following price increases of up to 9 per cent. The rises have provoked anger as the wholesale price of electricity and gas has actually fallen over the past year. Scottish Power has increased gas by 7 per cent and electricity by 6 per cent recently, while npower has increased gas by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent. SSE has increased gas by 9 per cent and electricity by 9 per cent. British Gas has increased gas by 6 per cent and electricity by 6 per cent. E-ON has ruled out price rises until next year. EDF has yet to announce its price rises. Yesterday SSE boss Mr Marchant refused to discuss his 12 per cent staff discount but an SSE spokesman confirmed that he took it. Standing at the marble-tiled entrance to his £1million home in Edinburgh, Mr Marchant said: ‘Please leave me in peace, I am trying to enjoy my Sunday lunch.’ He then shut the door. EDF refused to deny that their millionaire boss Mr de Rivaz accepted the £48 staff discount offered to all employees. A spokesman said: ‘All our employees are offered a fixed discount of £48 per year off their energy.’ Npower said it did not offer a staff discount on bills but did offer a loyalty scheme earning vouchers of up to £100 if their employees choose the firm as their electricity and gas provider. A spokesman said all board members were entitled to join the scheme. ‘Whether they do so or whether they subsequently choose to donate them to a charity is a personal matter,’ he added.","Chief executive of Scottish firm SSE Ian Marchant, 51, has knocked £140 off the energy bill for his luxury home .

A former model who waged a stalking . campaign against Rio Ferdinand was branded a danger to the footballer . and his family today as she was jailed for 18 weeks. Susanne Ibru, 39, described as 'a predatory and manipulative fantasist,' was arrested last month after being caught loitering outside the Manchester United defender’s £5m mansion. The crazed fan had earlier been banned from going near 33-year old Ferdinand, his wife Rebecca, 31, and their three small children after she repeatedly made a 400-mile round trip from London to Cheshire just to call at their family home. Gesture: The order had banned Ibru from trying . to contact Mr Ferdinand and his family. She has previous convictions . including for  wounding, criminal damage and assault . But last month the footballer’s . security staff were forced to call in police again when she ignored the . restraining order by turning up late at night by taxi and began pressing . the intercom buzzer. When police arrived Ibru told them, 'My name is Susanne Ibru, and this is my house. My belongings are in . there.' It was not known whether Ferdinand and his family were at home . at the time. Ibru, from Peckham, South London, . today gave a one fingered salute and yelled abuse as she was led away . from Macclesfield magistrates court in handcuffs. She also vowed to appeal against her jail term after she pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order. JP Denise Rankin told her: 'Your antecedent history makes this offence more serious. 'Predatory fantasist': Former model Susanne Ibru makes an obscene gesture as she is led out of Macclesfield magistrates court in handcuffs today . 'You have brought psychological harm . to the victims living at the property and you have a history of . breaching court orders and a pattern of violent offending. 'You are a high risk and there is a . possibility of serious harm to the victim and also to his family and . staff living at the property.' Ibru, who has previous convictions for . wounding, criminal damage, assault, public order offences and . possessing an offensive weapon, had claimed she was an accomplished . athlete with ambitions of becoming a sports agent. But she was also said in expert reports to be 'living in a fantasy world, unable to interpret social situations and boundaries.' The . stalking campaign arose out of claims by Ibru that she had met the . soccer star at the home of his stepfather’s mother in Peckham in 1998. Over a four-month period in 2010 . she repeatedly turned up at the Ferdinands’ home in the middle of the . night claiming she needed to speak to the footballer to 'resolve some . issues.' Victims: Ibru has appeared at the Ferdinand's family home uninvited on several occasions demanding to see the Manchester United star (Mr Ferdinand is seen here with his wife Rebecca) She was warned by police about her conduct but she claimed she was 'more than' just a football fan and added: 'He needs to ask his mum why I’m turning up at his house.' Ibru even told one officer she would be 'packing up and moving in with Rio this week or next week.' But the former England captain told the court he had no idea what Ibru wanted to speak to him about and her actions had left him so alarmed he had thought about installing CCTV and additional security at his home. He said in a previous court hearing how he had felt 'angry and upset' about Ibru's behaviour and was 'worried' for the safety of his family. He said he first met her through a liaison officer at Old Trafford in 2006. The footballer’s wife Rebecca said she believed Ibru was 'obsessed' with her husband and insisted talk of the stalker having had a relationship with him was 'all lies.' In May last year Ibru was jailed for ten weeks after admitting harassment and was banned from contacting Ferdinand and his family for ten years. Campaign: Ibru, a former model, has been described as a 'fantasist' following her stalking campaign against Mr Ferdinand . The order also forbids her from attending any match or public events where he would be present. Yet on September 21 this year, at 11pm, police were called to the address in Alderley Edge as she tried once again to make a late night visit. In court today Ibru - of no fixed address, appeared handcuffed in the dock with her hair scraped into a bun, wearing a cream suit jacket and clutching at scraps of paper. The court was told she had sacked her solicitor and would be representing herself. Prosecutor Kate Marchuk said: 'She was made the subject of a restraining order on May 9th last year. 'That order would bar her from attending or entering Alderley Edge in Cheshire or communicating with Mr and Mrs Ferdinand and not to go to any venue where he would be in person. 'This was breached when on September 21st, security officers contacted the police saying that an unknown female was pressing the intercom buzzer. 'She had got out of a taxi at around 11pm and tried to gain entry, but she was challenged by one of the security officers as she pressed the intercom buzzer. 'On the police’s arrival - and knowing of her history and [the] restraining order - they promptly arrested her. 'But she became abusive to the police and was taken to the station and interviewed.' She said she had lived there for 15 years and that she did not care about the restraining order. 'I’m going straight back there as soon as I get out,' she said. In her defence, Ibru told magistrates: 'I have nothing to say apart from my belongings are at my home. 'That is my home and I did not say to police officers that I had lived there for 15 years - that house had not been bought then, it was purchased in 2002. My belongings are there.'","Susanne Ibru had been banned from going near Ferdinand and his family following stalking campaign .

An oil tycoon who used African law to attempt to strip his ex-wife of a £17.5million divorce payout has won a landmark case to slash the money by £9million. Multi-millionaire Michael . Prest, 50, one of Britain's most successful black businessman, originally claimed under 'native' African law his oil company didn't belong to him. And despite being slammed for his 'ingenious and dishonest' attempts to conceal his huge wealth from the divorce courts, he has won his marathon legal fight. One of the country’s top family judges said that 'there were almost no lengths to which he was not prepared to go' in his fight to cut down his 49-year-old ex-wife Yasmin’s divorce settlement. Although she insisted he was worth 'tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds' and asked for an award of £30.4 million, he was adamant he was worse than penniless, with net debts of £48 million, and said his ex was entitled to only just over £2 million. After a marathon dispute that ran up 'astronomical' legal costs of more than £3 million - and during which Mr Prest 'repeatedly flouted' his duty to fully and frankly disclose his assets - he was last year ordered to give his ex-wife money and assets worth £17.5 million. However, in a ruling today that award was cut by up to £9 million by the Court of Appeal. In a majority decision - which exposed a gaping rift between family and commercial lawyers - the court ruled the divorce judge had been wrong to 'pierce the corporate veil' and award Mrs Prest six London properties owned by companies that her ex-husband was said to control. Family law specialist, Lord Justice Thorpe, said: 'Once the marriage broke down, the husband resorted to an array of strategies, of varying degrees of ingenuity and dishonesty, in order to deprive his wife of her accustomed affluence. 'Amongst them is the invocation of company law measures in an endeavour to achieve his irresponsible and selfish ends. If the law permits him so to do it defeats the Family Division judge’s overriding duty to achieve fairness'. However, his powerful dissenting judgment was overruled by Lord Justice Rimer, who said the divorce judge had simply been 'wrong' to equate the companies that owned the properties with Mr Prest and to regard their assets as his. Even though Mr Prest had been found to be in control of the companies, the divorce judge simply had no power to find that he was personally entitled to the properties they owned or to pierce the corporate veil and award them to his ex-wife. Costly divorce: Yasmin Prest outside London's Appeal Court in an earlier court appearance . Lord Justice Patten, who had the casting vote, agreed the appeal - which was brought by three companies that own a portfolio of flats and houses in London worth £9m - should be allowed. Issuing a resounding warning to wealthy couples, the judge said that those tempted to transfer assets to companies for wealth protection or tax avoidance purposes 'cannot ignore the legal consequences of their actions in less happy times'. The highly educated couple married in 1993 and had four children, now all teenagers, and enjoyed an 'extravagant lifestyle' until their split in 2008. Mr Prest told the divorce judge he needed £800,000-a-year to live on and his ex said she required £730,000-a-year to keep herself and the children in the style to which they were accustomed. Despite his claims that he was £48m in debt, Mr Justice Moylan found last year that Mr Prest was worth 'conservatively...at least £37.5m' and had been treating the court proceedings 'as a game' to defeat or minimise his ex-wife entitlements. Mr Prest, who was named as one of the three most influential black men in Britain in 2007, was also ordered to pay maintenance of £24,000-a-year for each of his four children, along with their private school fees and medical bills. Lawyers for the three companies that bought the appeal insisted that their assets did not belong to Mr Prest but are 'held in trust' for his children and the children of his four siblings in Africa, under Nigerian Itsekiri customary law. Mr Prest, the court heard, received a gift of £10,000 'seed money' from his Nigerian father before he died in 1992, and he used that cash as the foundation stone on which he built his oil and property empire. Under customary law in Nigeria, his father’s death left Mr Prest as head of his family, with a responsibility to use his late father’s money to look after his siblings and their children, his legal team argued. However Mrs Prest’s lawyers have always insisted that the companies, and the assets they hold, are '100% owned and controlled' by her ex-husband and that they are effectively his 'alter ego.'","Michael Prest, slammed for being 'dishonest', is one of Britain's most successful black businessmen ."

Liverpool is the whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show huge regional variations in case rates – clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts. Whiplash claims cost insurers  £2billion a year, with bogus payouts adding £90 to the typical car insurance premium. Whiplash: Bogus claims cost the insurance industry £2¿billion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by £90 . In the 12 months to March, the number of cases in Liverpool was 22 per thousand residents. Uxbridge in West London and Oldham were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand. Those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas. The lowest rates were in Scotland, where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases. A survey of GPs last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are ‘fake or over-diagnosed’. At least 30,000 – 6 per cent – are outright fraudulent, according to the Insurance Fraud Bureau.UK insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day, twice the level in other European countries. Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘This is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made. ‘And there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims. ‘Whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down. ‘Either we have developed the weakest necks in Europe or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected.’ Aviva has called for a radical overhaul of the system, saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims. Dominic Clayden, claims director for the insurer, said: ‘We operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to “have a go” – there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought. 'However, this “whip-cash” is not free. It is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years. ‘The UK needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve, but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums. Crackdown: The nationwide issue was brought to light by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke who has held a 'Whiplash Summit' in Parliament in a bid to crack down on the crooks . ‘The Ministry of Justice needs to increase the small claims limit to £5,000, meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers. We also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped.’ But John Spencer, of personal injury specialist Spencer’s Solicitors, said: ‘There are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that. ‘But you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated.’ Last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Car insurance costs are simply too high, they must be reduced. ‘The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims. ‘But we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the Government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down.’ Whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly, damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck – a common injury in a car accident. However it is difficult to diagnose and doctors must rely on the patient’s description of their symptoms.","Twenty times more compensation claims per head in Liverpool than other parts of the country .

Stewart, who was leading the race, tried to avoid the takeover attempt by Michael Waltrip. But the pursuing driver clipped Stewart’s bumper, sending him ploughing into several other cars.

The No 14 car slid towards the barriers surrounding the track, taking out the other cars in the process as screeching tyres and clouds of smoke filled the arena. It was all part of the spectacle for the baying NASCAR fans, as many roared and cheered as the cars slid and careered into one another. Matt Kenseth, who was higher up on . the track at the time of the crash, was able to avoid the carnage and . slipped by unscathed to win the race ahead of Jeff Gordon and Kyle . Busch. Gordon and Busch . were nose-to-tail behind Stewart when the crash happened, but were . somehow able to round the carnage to finish the race. Races . at the Talladega and Daytona Speedway are run with restrictor plates . which limit the speed of the cars, but that wasn’t enough to prevent the . ‘big wreck’ on Sunday. Luckily, no one was seriously injured in the crash after the cars ground to a halt and the flames were extinguished. Carnage: The racers collided amid screeching tyres and clouds of smoke . Before the mayhem: The cars move at great speed in close proximity to one another . Not for the first time: Jamie McMurray (No 1) spun off the track before the massive wreck in the final lap . Stewart, who had tried to block out his opponents in the final lap to seal the victory, took full responsibility for the crash and said: 'I just screwed up.' Driver Dale Earnhardt Jr was shocked after the huge pile-up, and believes that the close proximity of the cars was a contributing factor. He said: 'It’s not safe. It’s not. It’s bloodthirsty. If that’s what people want, that’s ridiculous.' 'If this is what we did every week, I wouldn't be doing it,' Earnhardt said. 'I'd find another job. ... You can't get away from each other. It's obvious. How many cars were in that wreck? And that's OK with everybody? 'I don't even want to go to Talladega or Daytona next year, but I got no choice.' Earnhardt Jr's team-mate, Gordon, echoed his views and said: 'That literally is bumper cars almost at 200 miles an hour, and I don't know anybody who likes that.' Loving it: Fans can be spotted cheering as the cars continue to slide across the track . The real deal: The drivers managed to complete 188 laps before the huge crash took place . Just a scratch: Jimmie Johnson managed to drive across the finish line after wrecking his car . ‘I've gained a little bit of patience over the years,’ said Kenseth. ‘And I had to be patient two or three times.’ ‘I saw Tony's back bumper and I saw him getting spun out,’ he added. ‘I don't know how that happened or how he got in that position, but I saw him spinning out and then when we were clear of him.’ After Gordon and Busch, David Ragan and Regan Smith were fourth and fifth respectively. Jimmie Johnson even managed to cross the finish line with smoke rising from his battered car after being caught up in the wreck.

Colton Harvey was charged as an adult for killing his 16-year-old sibling Candace Harvey on January 15 this year at their rural home. Harvey offered the guilty plea in exchange for being charged with second-degree murder and was handed down a 45-year prison term in Arkansas. Scroll down for video .

The teenage boy has given no motive as to why he murdered his sister. According to 5 News the parents told investigators the two teenagers never fought. Prosecutor David Gibbons said: 'No signs that would alert somebody that this would happen, no quarrels, no fussing and fighting.' The boy cried as he addressed the . judge, at one point raising his cuffed hands to his face so he could . dab his eyes with a tissue. The scrawny, blonde teenager appeared in court with his feet shackled as he told Judge William Pearson he used a rifle to kill his sister. The judge asked: 'You stated that you murdered your sister. Is that correct?' Harvey whispered: 'Yes, sir.' Tragedy: Miss Harvey, 16, was murdered in her bed by her brother Colton, 15 . Youth: Numerous tributes have appeared online to the fun-loving teenager who appeared to have been killed by her younger brother without motive . Pearson sentenced Harvey to 30 years for second-degree murder plus 15 more because he used a gun. Prosecutors initially charged Harvey with first-degree murder which has a maximum penalty of life in prison. He could be up for parole in 12 years, depending on good behavior. 'How far did you get in school?' the judge asked the teenager, who responded in such a quiet voice that the judge had to repeat some of his answers. He responded: 'Ninth grade.' Authorities believe that Harvey killed . his 16-year-old sister after their parents left to go grocery shopping . 40 miles away.

The sheriff said the boy seemed remorseful and had tears in his eyes when he turned himself in on January 15. Investigators found the girl's body in her bedroom at the family's home near Ozark, a town of around 3,600 people, 120 miles northwest of Little Rock. The question of why Harvey shot his . sister remained unanswered. Prosecutor David Gibbons said: 'He never did . give what I would consider to be a clear motive.' Harvey's . attorney, Bill James, said there was a history of mental illness in the . family. However an expert wasn't able to give a diagnosis because of . Colton's young age.

And it's not, ''Woe is me.'' It's about what he's done to his mom and what he's done to his family.' Local sheriff Anthony Boen said at the time of Harvey's arrest that deputies had never been called to the home and there weren't any reports of trouble with the teenagers. A neighbor described the family as 'nice and quiet' and the boy as a 'nice young boy'. Donna Sheppard, who lives next to the family's home, said her grandson knew the boy from school. She said: 'It's the most shocking thing I could have ever imagined.' Mrs Sheppard said she did not hear any gunshots before she left for Sunday school a little after 9am and learned about the shooting when she came home from church that afternoon.

Prince Andrew's former girlfriend Koo Stark has been accused of stealing a £40,000 painting from her former partner. The US-born actress has 'strenuously denied' the charge, and claimed it was given to her as a gift. Miss Stark, who famously appeared naked in the film Emily, is accused of taking the oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape by Dutch master Anthonie Van Borssom from the home of her ex-partner American financier Warren Walker. She was arrested two days later. Wearing a blue polka dot dress Miss Stark, whose real name is Kathleen, indicated she would be entering a not guilty plea when she answered a summons at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today. Prosecutor Paul Mitchell told the court Miss Stark arrived at Mr Walker’s Notting Hill home with a bunch of flowers on July 21 and told the housekeeper she was taking two pictures. As the housekeeper went to get a vase Miss Stark is alleged to have taken a picture off the wall and the pair got in a 'tug-of-war’ over it. Miss Stark lost when the housekeeper managed to hold on to it but she then ran up the staircase and took another painting before fleeing the property, it was claimed. Miss Stark’s lawyer Edward Henry told the court his client 'strenuously denied’ the charge. District Judge Paul Clark declined jurisdiction of the case and bailed the 56-year-old to appear before magistrates again on November 16 so her case can be sent to the crown court for trial. The photographer was in a relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her ten days before their wedding in 1997. She also dated Prince Andrew when he returned from the Falklands conflict in 1981, after they met on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy. He took her on holiday to Mustique, . she was invited to Balmoral to meet the Royal Family and there were . rumours of an engagement. But the romance ended when it emerged she had appeared semi-naked in a raunchy film called Emily in 1976. In a statement read outside court by Miss . Stark’s solicitor Jules Azzopardi, she branded the charge she faced as . 'bogus’ and told how she had been subjected to a 12-hour ordeal at a . police station over it. Prince Andrew and Koo Stark had a romance before her naked role in a film was discovered . Stunning Miss Stark denies the claim . Mr Azzopardi said: 'Miss Stark’s innocence and her reputation will be vindicated during these proceedings. 'She faces prosecution for allegedly stealing a painting. It is a bogus charge. 'This was one of several gifts given to her by the chief prosecution witness, given to her before and after the birth of their child. 'You may think that his is the crime, not hers - to claim that this painting, which was given in love to her by him is now claimed to be allegedly stolen by the mother of his child. 'In a 12 hour ordeal following her arrest, detention and interrogation in which she set out her defence, Miss Stark was told by the police that no future action would be taken against her and that this investigation would be discontinued. 'The reinstatement of this investigation and prosecution is regrettable as is the lack of respect towards Miss Stark by her accuser. 'The basis of allegations made against her will be shown for what they are at trial and Miss Stark is confident that the court will acquit her.' Stark will next appear at West London Magistrates’ Court on November 16 before the case is sent to Crown Court.

She has not been able to speak since February . A talkative 21-year-old is facing the prospect of never speaking again after an extreme case of laryngitis seven months ago has left her speechless. Alice Mitchell, from Rayleigh, Essex, lost her voice back in February this year 2012 after her larynx became inflamed. More than seven months on and her voice has yet to return with doctors warning the self-confessed 'chatterbox' that she must now face the realistic possibility her voice may never recover. In an email interview she wrote: 'I . am finding this all very hard as most people don’t understand that it . has affected my life a great deal. 'Most people just seem to think I am joking and they laugh or make jokes, like asking me to repeat things. 'When I go out with people I can’t talk to them because they won’t hear me.' Alice has had to put her life on hold due to her odd ailment. The . bubbly youngster has been forced to take sick leave from her role as a . lifeguard at Virgin Active gym in Thundersley, Essex, due to the fact . she cannot make herself heard to swimmers in the pool. She . has also been left frustrated after health bosses ruled she must be . without her voice for more than a year before she can receive treatment . on the NHS or disability benefits. Laryngitis occurs when the larynx (or voice box) becomes inflamed. This stops the vocal chords from vibrating correctly . Her mother Jenny Mitchell, 47, said: 'It’s been a nightmare for her. 'Her vocal cords are okay but the muscle at the back is damaged which is restricting her voice box from functioning properly. 'She’s engaged to her boyfriend Paul and they’re trying to save for their own place but everything is on hold. 'We’re quite a loud family and Alice is a chatterbox but we have had to learn to stop and let her talk. 'If we don’t she bangs the table to be heard.' Laryngitis is the swelling and inflammation of the voice box which means the vocal chords cannot vibrate correctly causing hoarseness. Most cases of laryngitis are caused by viral infection, such as a cold, and will usually pass within three weeks. However, it can also be caused by gastric reflux, allergies or overuse causing lesions to form on the vocal chords. These cases are more likely to prove chronic. Each year in England around 250 people are referred to hospital consultants for chronic laryngitis. Common treatments include vocal rest, increasing fluid intake, humidity, and voice therapy.","Alice has had to give up her job as a lifeguard as she cannot communicate with swimmers .

Federal agents have raided the Massachusetts pharmacy linked to the widespread meningitis outbreak across America that has left 16 people dead and left more than 200 ill with the infection. Agents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration searched the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in the Boston suburb of Framingham, with officers from the local police department providing support. Nearly 14,000 people nationwide are at . risk of infection because they received injections from suspect steroid . medications shipped to 76 facilities in 23 states. Raided: The Food and Drug Administration searched the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham after at least fifty vials of steroids containing fungi linked to meningitis were discovered . Caution: The grounds of the pharmaceutical company's headquarters were cordoned off as the agents raided the property . Outbreak: The NECC's products have been linked with the deadly meningitis outbreak across America which has left 16 dead . The raid took place as calls came for . an even wider probe into whether the pharmacy may have broken federal . laws dealing with controlled substances, as additional meningitis cases . were announced in the country. Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said in a statement: ‘I can confirm that this office and our law enforcement partners are investigating allegations concerning the New England Compounding Center.’ Ortiz said it was ‘entirely premature’ to speculate about what might be uncovered. Paul Cirel, a lawyer representing NECC, said the raid was unnecessary and that ‘asking would have produced the same result.’ He added: ‘It is difficult to understand the purpose of this search, since we have been clear that (NECC) would provide, and has provided, anything requested. ‘We've been clear that warrants weren't needed.’ The entrance to NECC's headquarters was cordoned off with yellow tape as the agents searched the property into the night. The FDA's criminal unit, the Office of Criminal Investigations, is a team of agents with specialised knowledge and training to investigate violations of food and drug laws. It pursues about 1,200 criminal cases each year. Long haul: Agents and local police search the premises well into the night . Lethal: The raid was undertaken as the outbreak widens, with 231 confirmed cases across the country . The raid came as a leading U.S. lawmaker called for an investigation of whether the compounding pharmacy violated federal laws covering potentially addictive drugs. Meanwhile, the U.S. meningitis outbreak is widening. A 16th fatality was announced on Tuesday, after the death of a patient from south west Virginia. According to statistics released yesterday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are 231 confirmed cases of meningitis in America, 19 more cases than the previous figures revealed. Experts believe the outbreak will get worse before it gets better. Dr William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said: ‘We will see more patients reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more.’ The FDA on Monday widened its investigation of the cause of the fungal meningitis outbreak to other drugs made by NECC. Product: Pictured are the vials of the injectable steroid used to treat back pain made by New England Compounding Center implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak . Last week the FDA said that more than 50 vials of steroid treatments from NECC tested positive for a fungus that causes meningitis. Infections have been detected within two weeks of a patient receiving the NECC-supplied medication methylprednisolone acetate, on average, and up to 42 days afterward. But anyone exposed to the vials of . the steroid  - used to treat back pain and other conditions - should be . vigilant for health problems for several months, CDC officials said. Local health authorities have contacted over 90 percent of patients who . may have been exposed. Although . it remains unclear exactly how any medication could have been . contaminated, federal regulators have come under criticism for failing . to prevent the outbreak by closely regulating drug compounding companies . such as NECC, which prepare medications for clinics and doctors largely . outside federal oversight. The FDA has said the law does not give it adequate authority to do so, leaving regulation largely to the states. The pharmacies are owned by Gregory Conigliaro, an engineer, and his brother-in-law Barry Cadden, a pharmacist who was in charge of pharmacy operations at NECC. 'It does seem like the agencies, both at the state and the federal level, may have been misled by some of the information we were given,' Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said last Wednesday. Hopeful: CDC workers at the Infectious Disease Laboratory hope that the raid of the NECC can help to control the widespread outbreak . Besides the meningitis cases, two additional patients have a different type of fungal infection from injections in their joints (as opposed to back injections). Massachusetts Democratic Representative Edward Markey, a senior member of the committee that oversees business, called on the Justice Department to investigate whether NECC violated federal laws designed to stem illegal activity in controlled drugs. The company already faces multiple investigations by the FDA and several states, but Mr Markey's request could launch an even more serious probe involving the Drug Enforcement Administration, which oversees sales of potentially addictive or controlled drugs. The FDA said on Monday it was looking into two other drugs produced by NECC. The agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid from the one found to have caused the deaths. It said on Tuesday that one transplant patient was infected with a fungus after receiving a drug used in open heart surgery manufactured by NECC. The FDA originally said two such patients were infected. Investigation: Shawn Lockhart and his colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working round the clock to ascertain exactly how the outbreak of fungal meningitis began . Confirmed: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have found Exserohilum, a type of fungi, in patients with meningitis . Another patient identified by the FDA received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC. On Tuesday, FDA official Janet Woodcock stressed that the two additional products had not been linked to confirmed infections. She asked doctors to contact patients injected since May to make sure they had no signs of infection. NECC said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the FDA. The FDA has been inspecting the NECC facilities. Woodcock said that based on the condition of the plant and other factors, 'we really can't assure the sterility of these products.' The legal threat to NECC also mounted as more victims of meningitis filed lawsuits, including two filed by Michigan residents this week. All but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis is not contagious. The outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates as a whole in the U.S. NECC engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the FDA, which generally oversees drug manufacturers. Tragic: Lilian Cary, 67, from Michigan died of meningitis in September, weeks after being treated with steroids for back pain . Grieving: Lilian's husband, George, received similar treatment at the same clinic where his wife was treated but said there was 'no evidence' he had contracted meningitis . In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need. A Reuters investigation found that NECC solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations. State pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products. The states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida. Lilian Cary, 67, from Howell, Michigan, is one of the victims of the infection. Ms Cary's husband, George, received pain-killing injections at the same Brighton-area clinic where his wife was treated shortly before her death. The grieving husband was forced to have a spinal tap to check to see whether he had been infected, but said there was 'no evidence' that was the case.","Agents from the Food and Drug Administration searched New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Boston .

Two suspects in the killing of U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens have been arrested in Instanbul, according to reports. The pair, believed to be Tunisian nationals, were detained while trying to enter Turkey at Ataturk Airport.

Remains of the consulate: Two Tunisian nationals have been arrested in Instanbul in connection with the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi (pictured) A member of the foreign . service and two former Navy Seal bodyguards were also killed after terrorists . overran the consulate and set fire to it. Mr Stevens was the first US . ambassador to die in the line of duty since 1979. Turkish broadcaster Kanal D reported the arrests on its website today. The two suspected are believed to have tried to enter the country using fake passports. Police in Istanbul have declined to comment on the report. The terrorist plot stunned America on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington . [caption . The consulate, located in the city of . Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the . attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 . terror attacks. The State Department is currently conducting an internal investigation into the Benghazi attack. President Obama has ordered both the CIA and the Pentagon to hunt down the terrorists who attacked the consulate. It is unclear what the president plans to do once the perpetrators of . the assault in Benghazi are found, but he has mobilised the . military's Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to help carry out the . mission. JSOC and the CIA teamed up to send Navy Seal commandos into Pakistan in 2011 for a raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The . White House plans for retaliation come after it was revealed that . security officials missed key signs that the consulate and US Ambassador . Chris Stevens were in danger. The Daily Beast reported . that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to . testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described . in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The . letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens . were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on . Facebook. One such post . mentioned the route that Mr Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the . diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety . The letter also mentions two separate . bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security . guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June . 6. Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries. Meanwhile it has been alleged that . the State Department denied a request from the security team at the US . embassy in Libya to retain the services of a DC-3 airplane in the . country once commercial flights to the country had been reinstated. The information was apparently contained in an email seen by . ABC News - which was copied to Mr Stevens. It is understood that the plane was used to get staff around Libya, not just in and out of the country. But the allegation will raise further . questions about the level of security support provided to diplomatic . staff in Libya. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four American lives . The . revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. State Department spokeswoman Victoria . Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and . posted there has been withdrawn.' New evidence has suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was . involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was . a protest gone wrong.

Biggest in Europe: The proposed brothel in Vienna will 'cater' for 1,000 guests every day, with 150 prostitutes on call around the clock (file photo) An Austrian businessman has unveiled plans to open Europe's largest brothel - complete with a round the clock supply of 150 sex workers and even parking space for coaches. The £12m project, known as the 'FunMotel', will be located near the capital Vienna and have capacity for 1,000 'guests' a day across 147 rooms. It will be surrounded by a three-metre high fence to ensure privacy and offers traditional hotel features such as restaurants, gym and beauty facilities as well as sex services including 'swinger parties, gang bangs and porn stars.' The precise location of the new mega-brothel, expected to open its doors - or is that curtains - in 2014 remains a secret so as not to alarm local residents. The developers, Vienna-based 8Quadrant, say the 'number of females' and the 'affordable prices' will 'ensure absolute satisfaction for male customers.' Peter Laskaris, the businessman behind the project, said the 'four-star facilities' will be the sex industry's shift from 'grocer to supermarket.' He told the Austrian newspaper Der Standard: 'We've deliberately spread false information about the location to avoid trouble before we had the authorisation to go ahead. 'But it will be situated in a location that doesn't bother anyone.' All that is known is that the 'FunMotel' will be located somewhere in Lower Austria, the state which surrounds the capital. New Viennese regulations requiring brothels to have official licences have meant locating the brothel in the city centre is impractical. Local authorities and the police have already given their consent to the project. Prostitution in Austria is both legal and regulated. Red light: The brothel, which will be called the 'FunMotel' already has the support of Viennese police and local authorities (file photo) There has been a mixed response to the news. Sandra Frauenberger, councillor for women's issues on Vienna's city council, said moving prostitution indoors 'was a priority because off the streets work is safe work.'

In a historic revelation, featherweight boxer Orlando Cruz has become the first openly gay man in the sport's history, describing himself as a 'proud gay man.' The Puerto Rican, who is currently ranked No.4 in the world by the WBO said 'I've been fighting for more than 24 years and as I continue my ascendant career, I want to be true to myself.' 'I want to try to be the best role model I can be for kids who might look into boxing as a sport and a professional career. I have and will always be a proud Puerto Rican. I have always been and always will be a proud gay man.' Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz has become boxing's first and so far only openly gay man . Cruz, 31, who began boxing at the age of seven, has enjoyed a successful career, with an appearance as part of the 2000 Puerto Rican Olympic Team in Sydney under his belt. The boxer debuted as a professional following the games and won his first world title on March 22, 2008. Currently he holds the WBO NABO featherweight title and will defend the belt against Jorge Pazos on October 19th in Kissimmee, Florida. Should he win that bout, he will put himself in line for one of the more prestigious world titles in boxing. Boxer Orlando Cruz (right), battles Alejandro Delgado during a fight at the Palm Bay Community Center in Palm Bay, Fla. Describing himself as 'a proud gay man,' Puerto Rican featherweight Orlando Cruz is believed to be the first pro boxer to come out as openly homosexual while still competing . Cruz told The Associated Press in an interview that he is relieved about his decision but had initial reservations. 'I developed physically and mentally to take such a big step in my life and in my profession, which is boxing, knowing that it would have pros and cons, highs and lows in this sport that is so macho,' he said. 'I kept this hidden for many, many years.' Cruz said he met with psychologists and others before making the announcement, adding he has the full support of his family, trainer and manager. He praised his mother and sister for their unconditional love and said his father has always backed him. 'Like every father, he wants his son to be a full-blooded man,' Cruz said. 'But he is aware of my preference, my taste.' Cornelius Lock (left) of the US knocks down Orlando Cruz of Puerto Rico during his NABO Featherweight title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on September 19, 2009 in Las Vegas . Few active professional athletes have come out. There has yet to be an openly gay player in Major League Baseball, the NBA or NFL. Pedro Julio Serrano, spokesman for the U.S.-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, praised Cruz for his decision and said it breaks stereotypes that gay people are not involved in sports like boxing. 'It also gives a lot of hope to young gays who can see in him the integrity and bravery to be who you are and face a society that is often intolerant, especially in this type of sport,' he said. Reaction to Cruz's announcement was largely positive across social media, with many praising him for taking what they called a brave step given the sport's violent history. Among those who sent messages of support was Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin, who announced he was gay in 2010. Boxer Orlando Cruz poses for pictures after a training session at a public gym in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Thursday after coming out as the first openly gay man in boxing . Some Twitter messages expressed concern for Cruz's safety and wondered whether other boxers will be reluctant to fight him. Dommys Delgado, president of the Boxing Commission of Puerto Rico, brushed aside those comments. 'Orlando has proven to be an excellent boxer with very good chances of becoming a world champion,' she said. 'We do know that it is a very macho sport. Those who don't want to fight with him, well, don't fight.' The only other professional boxer who was quoted as saying that he had relations with men and women was U.S. Virgin Islander Emile Griffith, who told The New York Times in 2005 that he struggled with his sexuality. His comments came decades after he ended his 18-year career as a pro boxer. Griffith is best known for his 1962 fight against Cuban Benny Paret, who taunted Griffith with gay slurs before the bout. Griffith knocked him out, and Paret died 10 days later. Cruz said he is prepared for the fallout from his announcement, saying many boxers had already suspected he was gay but gave him privacy. 'I've been fighting for more than 24 years and as I continue my ascendant career, I want to be true to myself,' he said. 'I have always been and always will be a proud gay man.'",Orlando Cruz makes historic decision to come out as the first openly gay boxer in the history of the sport .
"By . Emma Clark . PUBLISHED: . 15:36 EST, 8 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:48 EST, 9 October 2012 . Karen Cosford, 47, arriving at Bradford Crown Court, was jailed for three years over the sexual relationship . A prison nurse who had sex with a violent rapist in his cell while her colleagues stood guard has been jailed for three years. A team of Karen Cosford’s colleagues were also jailed for misconduct after keeping her relationship with ‘evil’ lifer Brian McBride a secret – believing their discretion would be financially rewarded. Married Cosford, 47, whose husband also worked in the prison service, sent the serial rapist a catalogue of texts telling him ‘you are my world’, ‘miss you so much’ and ‘can’t wait for you to get out’. By chance her unwitting husband Derrie Cosford, a prison negotiator, became part of the investigation into McBride - who hinted of his wife's lies and deceit. The shamed nurse's claims that she had been forced into the relationship were dismissed by a jury at Bradford Crown Court, who found her guilty of misconduct in a public office for the sexual relationship, failing to notify authorities that McBride had a phone and purchasing top-ups for him. Carolyn Falloon, 50, and Jacqueline Flynn, 46, who both worked with Cosford on the healthcare wing at the high-security Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, were also convicted of failing to notify authorities about the affair and mobile phone. A third colleague Kevin Wilson, 57, admitted misconduct in a public office at a previous hearing. Prosecutors said the guilty officers were motivated by ‘greed’ and were duped by McBride’s claims of wealth on the outside. Sentencing the group today Judge David Hatton QC said: ‘It’s a sad business indeed when four people with previous good character, public servants who have devoted years of their lives to their vocation, should find themselves being sentenced for having abused their positions of trust.’ Prison workers Kevin Wilson, left, and Carolyn Fallon, right, kept their colleague's affair with the inmate secret . Speaking to Cosford, the judge said: ‘You believed him to be a man of means and planned on continuing your relationship with him on the outside until you reached the conclusion that you had been strung along.’ During the four-week trial the court was told how Flynn admitted during police interviews that she stood guard outside McBride’s cell while the pair were inside and had heard them having sex. The court heard that McBride, who was serving a life sentence for multiple offences of rape and violence, was in the healthcare centre as an in-patient and worked as a cleaner while he was there. The affair came to light when a search of McBride on September 25, 2009 uncovered a mobile phone charger. McBride was put in his cell while a thorough search of the wing was carried out and four mobile phones were subsequently discovered. In the prison kitchen investigators . found a photograph of a nurse, who was identified as Cosford, and an . unsigned love letter hidden inside a bag of sugar. The jury heard that McBride became agitated during the search, prompting a number of negotiators working in the Prison Service to visit him - one of whom was Mr Cosford. High-security Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, pictured, where Brian McBride was serving a life sentence for rape . One of the wings in the prison which holds 570 inmates, 70 per cent of which are serving life . During a negotiation McBride hinted to Mr Cosford that he had been having a relationship with his wife. Mrs Cosford, of Altofts, West Yorkshire, later reported to prison authorities that McBride had raped and threatened to kill her family if she reported him. She said she was forced to text the convict and write the love letter which read: ‘I didn’t realise how much I do miss you until I went on holiday. ‘You understand me more than anyone, we can have a wonderful future together, everything we talked about will happen, just give it time... ‘I can’t wait for us to continue our relationship outside of the confines of this place...’ Referring to him as her ‘knight in shining armour’, she added: ‘You are the most understanding, patient, manly, kind man that I have ever known.’ Wilson and Flynn were sentenced to 15 months in jail. Falloon was given a 21-month prison sentence. Prison officer David Sunderland, 49, of Wakefield, was cleared of failing to notify the authorities about McBride’s phone.","Karen Cosford, 47, told violent rapist Brian McBride she loved him and couldn't wait for their future together .

Just last week he sparked controversy by claiming that those who couldn't take the pain of his heels should not wear them. But today, as he unveiled an exhibition featuring hundreds of pairs of his sought-after heels at London's Design Museum, Christian Louboutin thought it wise to backpedal slightly. Louboutin, who began his career more . than 20 years ago, hit the headlines when he called high heels . 'pleasure with pain', adding, 'If you can't walk in them, don't wear . them.' But at this morning's preview, he defended the remark, saying: 'I am concerned with . comfort. I know that it's important but I don't want to have this evoked . in my design. 'I am concerned with comfort, but I don't want this evoked in my design': Louboutin defended his 'heels are pain' comment at the unveiling of his 20 year retrospective at London's Design Museum today . Hundreds of pairs of the designer's red-soled shoes went on show at the space, celebrating 20 years of the Christian Louboutin brand . 'My work is not about comfort but in the engineering of the shoes there's something that makes them as comfortable as possible.' The exhibition, which will run for 10 weeks, has burlesque star Dita Von Teese star as a stunning centrepiece. Louboutin, famous for the red soles on his stilettos, has made Von Teese, one of his most fiercely loyal customers, appear in the form of a three-dimensional holographic performance to illustrate Louboutin's earliest design inspiration - the showgirl. Star of the show Dita Von Teese attended a private viewing of the exhibition last night, where she was said to be 'thrilled' with the dancing hologram . Dita Von Teese is the stunning holographic centrepiece of the exhibition celebrating the famous red-soled footwear brand.

The burlesque performer's silhouette morphs from a Louboutin shoe to dance on stage before she transforms back into a stiletto. But despite his fondess for Von Teese, Louboutin, who opened his first boutique in Paris 20 years ago with Princess Caroline of Monaco as his first customer, has always maintained his passion lies not in impressing celebrity, but in creating shoes that are, he says, 'like jewels'. He guards his red soles jealously - Pantone 18 Chinese red - and is currently embroiled in an ongoing legal battle with YSL over their use of a red sole. Elsewhere though, he says it matters not if others use colour on their soles. Speaking . today, Louboutin also gave his blessing to Topshop boss Sir Philip . Green's daughter Chloe, who has designed green-heeled shoes for her . father's store. 'It has her name on the shoe. There's nothing wrong with that. I wish her luck,' he said. He said it was 'a bit emotional' to see his first UK exhibition because his work has been so inextricably linked to his personal life. 'Having an exhibition about [my work] is a . big premiere for me and it's quite a journey. 'But this journey has . lasted for 20 years so to me it makes me to see what was missing, . what I have forgotten, what was bringing me memories, what was bringing . me less good memories, actually not so much. But basically it made me go . through a big part of my life.' 'It is . interesting to see after 20 years what you have been keeping, what you . miss and what you are missing.'

The devil is in the detail, and the techniques involved in creating Louboutin's flourishes elevate the designer to star status . Louboutin's intricately designed shoes have been worn by an impressive roll call of celebrities - but the designer says what really matters to him is to make shoes that are 'like jewels' The exhibition will be the first comprehensive presentation of Louboutin's work, and will showcase how he has helped transform the design of the shoe over the past 20 years . Erotic? Louboutin has said in the past that the arch of a woman's foot in a high heel emulates its shape when she orgasms . Shoes say a lot about a woman, Louboutin says. 'There is an element of seduction in shoes that doesn’t exist for men… a woman can be sexy, charming, witty or shy with her shoes' Dozens of cobblers' moulds are on show at the Design Museum - all in Louboutin red to match his soles, which is a Pantone colour trademarked by Louboutin . Christian Louboutin always wanted to design shoes that 'looked like jewels' Louboutin was born in 1963 in Paris, son of a cabinenetmaker father and a mother who stayed at home to look after the boy and his three sisters. Unruly as a child, he was expelled from school three times and ran away from home aged 12. He never returned, either to home or to school, but began sketching shoes in his early teens. A regular on the Paris party scene, he made the acquaintance of the likes of Mick Jagger and Andy Warhol, becoming part of the in-crowd. His first job was at the Folies Bergeres cabaret, helping the showgirls backstage - and it was this scene that has provided him with so much inspiration over the years. There was some formal training - a short stint studying art at the Academie d'Art Roederer. But for Louboutin, it was a visit to the Museum of African Art in Paris that he felt moved to make high heels for women. At the exhibition he saw a sign in a photograph forbidding women in heels to enter a building for fear of damaging the floor. 'I wanted to defy that,' the designer said. 'I wanted to create something that broke rules and made women feel confident and empowered.' Solo trips to Egypt and India as a teen provided him with yet more colour and imagery to feed from, and when he returned to Paris in 1981, Louboutin presented his ideas for high heels to top couture houses, landing him a position with Charles Jourdan. He later went to work as an apprentice in the atelier of Roger Vivier, shoemaker to the Queen and widely regarded as one of the world's top shoe designers. Later, as a freelance designer, he created shoes for Chanel, YSL and Maude Frizon, before setting up his own company in 1991 in Paris with Princess Caroline of Monaco his first customer. Since then, he has dressed the feet of such stars as Sarah Jessica Parker, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Dita Von Teese. He has said his goal is to 'make a woman's legs look as long as they can;' and says of his shoes that they should make a woman look 'naked'.

On one . occasion it took four nurses to hold her down to force-feed her. Two . years later, on a shopping trip with her father, Emma began to realise . the harm she was doing to herself. At one point, she felt so weak he had . to carry her up a flight of stairs. She later collapsed crossing a road . and only narrowly avoided being hit by a car. Emma was so thin at one point that even lying on a hospital bed left her bruised . ‘It was only then that I thought, “Maybe I’m not so well”, she said. ‘It wasn’t like a magic switch . suddenly turned on though. It was still a long and difficult journey. Anorexia was like a prison that I couldn’t escape from. ‘I could see the devastating effect . this was having on my parents and I didn’t know how to help them, but I . thought, “I can’t lose my family, they mean everything to me”.’ It has taken Emma a further six years . to come to terms with looking healthy.

The Only Way Is Up Foundation aims to . visit hospitals to advise doctors and nurses on the best tactics they . can use to get anorexics to eat, while providing help to family members. ‘Only in the last year have I been at . semi-peace with myself.

"Katie Lowe weighed 21 stone and was a size 24 . Now she is a healthy size 12-14 after joining a gym and changing her lifestyle . Swapped pizza and ready meals for salads and fruit . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 05:31 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 17 September 2012 . A student who was so fat that she struggled to walk without crutches two years ago has shed a staggering nine stone - after she moved in next door to the gym. Katie Lowe, 24, tipped the scales at nearly 21 stone after a series of operations on her knees led to her spending evenings on the sofa gorging on takeaways and piling on the pounds. And after struggling to squeeze into size 28 trousers, the 5ft 4in English student realised she needed to take drastic action - and moved in next door to the gym to kickstart a new healthy living plan. Katie Lowe was so fat that she struggled to walk without crutches two years ago has shed a staggering nine stone . After struggling to squeeze into size 28 trousers, the 5ft 4in English student realised she needed to take drastic action . Now, two years on, Katie has lost a staggering nine stone - after swapping nights in for gym sessions and shunning pizza in favour of rustling up home cooked meals - and can slip into a size 12-14 dress. And the PhD student - who also works full time in marketing - has become an internet sensation after blogging about her weight loss. Katie, from Worcester, said: 'A year ago, I was so heavy I could barely walk. I’d be knocking back up to four different types of painkillers before breakfast some days. 'I’d always been big, but the weight just piled on after I injured my knees in 2007. I had three lots of surgery, and while I was recovering, I just got bigger and bigger. 'I went back to uni to study for a PhD, and I knew I couldn’t live the student lifestyle the way I had done before - I had to do something about my weight. Student life took its toll on Katie and she gorged on pizza and junk food for her meals . 'But I knew that if I was going to beat the bulge, I’d have to shun the takeaways - so I moved into the house next door to a gym. 'It was just what I needed to give myself a kick start. I met a fitness coach who helped me develop a lifestyle plan. 'I go to the gym a couple of times a week, but I also just do things like go for a walk around the park and think more carefully about what I eat. 'I’m thrilled with the amount of weight I’ve lost - I can’t believe the difference losing weight has made to my whole life. I’m so much happier now.' Katie had struggled with her weight since she was a child - and only got even bigger after embracing student life as she studied at the University of Birmingham. After injuring her knees, she struggled to walk very far. Katie said: 'I was always the fat kid at school, hiding at the back in PE. My parents tried to get me to eat healthy meals, but I’d always sneak off and buy sweets and crisps at school. 'When I started at university, I did what most students do - spent my time drinking, eating processed food, and not moving around an awful lot. 'I’d tried dieting before, but always ended up putting all the weight back on again straight away. 'But this time, I didn’t want to do that - so when I moved house, I decided it might keep me motivated if I was living next to the gym - no excuses.' Katie started a fitness programme put together by fitness consultant Matt Peacock - who devised healthy meal plans and exercise programmes to melt away the pounds. Katie has moved next to a gym and the results have been startling, after she has lost half of her body weight . Katie joined the gym, where she works out for 60-90 minutes three or four times a week and has seen a huge difference . And living next door to the St John’s Sports Centre, she had no excuse to miss a session. Katie added: 'The programme has been brilliant for me - it’s a healthy lifestyle change I can stick to, rather than a faddy diet. 'I was so intimidated the first time I walked through the gym doors - I could barely walk for 30 minutes on the treadmill - but I love it now, and I even enjoy lifting weights. 'But making a few small changes to my life has made the world of difference. 'I make sure I eat small, healthy meals throughout the day, so I don’t get hungry, and I fit in my exercise around my life - I’ve started walking instead of taking the bus, and try and fit in a workout whenever I can. Katie has changed her lifestyle completely and has now dropped to a size 12-14 dress from a size 24 . 'If I have a busy week ahead, I cook all my meals from scratch at the weekend and freeze them, so I don’t resort to ringing for a takeaway. 'The weight has dropped off, and I can’t believe I’ve lost almost half my bodyweight without ever once feeling hungry.' Well being consultant Matt said: 'Katie has done excpetionally well, and we’re really proud of her. 'There’s no point telling someone they can never eat anything they enjoy again - that’s why people ditch their diets. 'We’ve tried to devise a plan that doesn’t make her feel like she’s missing out on anything, while doing a healthy amount of exercise a week. 'I tell her to try and get her heart to 115bpm for at least 60-90 minutes three or four times a week - which encourages the body to burn off fat reserves, rather than use energy from elsewhere.' Katie said: 'I started blogging about my weightloss to keep myself on the straight and narrow - I thought if I made a public record of how well I was doing, it would force me not to give in. 'I now have thousands of people reading the blog everyday - which has amazed me. I’ve had lots of lovely messages from people all over the world, and I’m really pleased that people say I give them inspiration. 'Two years ago, I’d never set foot inside a gym, and never thought I would - so it just goes to show if I can do it, anyone can!' Breakfast: Sausage sandwich .

Her partner, Eric Linforth, 33, added: . ‘After about 20 minutes waiting at the surgery she got worse, her lips . were blue, she was really hot and she was having trouble breathing. I . went up about four or five times asking to be seen. ‘Finally, I went up and said they had . to call an ambulance because she had got so bad.

Outrageous: Samantha Brown posted this picture of her in a sparkly party dress on Facebook while on day release during a five-year sentence for the manslaughter of her boyfriend Dean Darvill . A woman locked up for stabbing her boyfriend to death has outraged her victim's family by posting a glamorous picture of herself on Facebook while on day release. Samantha Brown has not yet served half of a five-year sentence behind bars for the manslaughter of 23-year-old Dean Darvill. He bled to death after she stabbed him in the groin following a row when he accused her of having a lesbian affair. Brown is being allowed out on day release to prepare her for freedom and it is believed she reactivated her Facebook page on a recent trip away from her young offenders' institution. The 21-year-old has changed her account name to Sammii Priincess Brown and posted a picture of herself in a sparkly party dress. Her victim’s family were alerted to what she was doing on the social networking website when she 'tagged' a number of old pictures, including of herself with Dean. Dean's mother, Jacqueline Threatwell, was told by probation workers that Brown was to be allowed out on day release before her release, expected in July. But they were outraged when they learned Brown, who has never expressed public remorse for the killing, used her freedom to show herself off on Facebook. Dean’s uncle Steven Darvill, 42, said: 'It makes me angry. It makes my whole family angry. 'I don’t know how she has the cheek to set herself up on Facebook like that as if nothing has ever happened. 'She’s not supposed to have any contact with our family as part of her release conditions. I’ve reported her for it. 'It’s obvious she’s still looking at me and my family. She still has pictures of her and Dean on there. 'I’ve spoke to victim support and they’ve said they will look at it very seriously. 'It’s upsetting, especially for my sister Jackie. You would think she would come out quietly rather than start up on Facebook immediately and show so little respect for us. 'I can’t believe she can come out and call herself Sammii Priincess Brown and post a picture of herself wearing a party dress as if nothing ever happened. It’s disrespectful. It’s as if she’s saying ""I’m back out - look at me"". 'Yes, she’s got to come out sometime, but she should leave our family alone. Has she not done enough damage to Dean and the rest of the family?' Brown admitted manslaughter after stabbing Dean, from Swinton, in the groin, severing vital arteries. Other pictures on Brown's Facebook page include one of her with Dean (left), who bled to death after she stabbed him in the groin, and one of her with her sister Toni Brown (right), who was jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence after refusing Dean's desperate appeals for help . The attack took place during a party at the home of her sister Toni Brown in Wroxham Road, Blackley. Toni Brown, 27, refused desperate pleas for her to call help for Dean. He died the next day in hospital. She was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter by gross negligence. She is also due out in July. The sisters failed in bids to have their sentences reduced last November. Mr Darvill said he has asked to have a meeting with Samantha Brown before her final release. He said: 'I want to see if there’s any remorse for what she’s done and to ask her why she did it. 'Jackie has her good days and bad days. But she’s still not really come to terms with Dean’s death. She goes to the cemetery most days during the week. To her, it doesn’t seem real that he’s gone.' After Greater Manchester Probation Trust was alerted about Brown’s Facebook page, it was removed. A spokeswoman said: 'She’s been spoken to by both institution staff and probation staff and steps were taken to remove the content, which was inappropriate.'","Samantha Brown given five years behind bars for killing Dean Darvill, 23 .

The five U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates are revealed in new FBI statistics released at a time when strained budgets are forcing police layoffs. No other city in the country, with more than 100,000 people, had a worst rate of serious offences than Flint, Michigan. The second highest violent crime rate was recorded in Detroit, also in Michigan, followed by St Louis, Missouri; Oakland, California; and Memphis, Tennessee. Troubled: An excess of guns on the street mean Flint in Michigan had the highest violent crime rate in the U.S. last year, according to FBI figures for the year after 20 police were axed from the city's force . FBI data for 2011 showed there were 2,392 incidents of violent crime in Flint which has a population of around 102,000. That same year, there were just 1,246 violent crimes in all 10 of the safest cities in America - which in total have 13 times as many residents as Flint. Flint Mayor Dayne Walling told MSNBC: 'There are too many guns on the street and it’s easy for individuals with evil motives to take another human being’s life.' The city where unemployment runs at 18.9 per cent and which experienced 52 murders last year lost 20 of its 140 police officers in 2010. Struggle: Detroit, Michigan where there were 344 murders last year, according to FBI data, faces high unemployment and poverty rates, while the city's police budgets are being cut . The money saving move reduced the presence of police officers in the street and affected how quickly the force could respond to crime. The far larger city of Detroit in the . same state recorded the second highest rate of violent crime in the U.S . last year with 21.4 offences per 1,000 people  - just behind Flint's . rate of 23.4. 1.

Memphis, Tennessee:Violent crimes per 1,000: 15.8Population: 652,7252011 murders: 117Unemployment rate: 11.1 percent . The city of more than 710,000 people is one of the country's poorest with almost a third of people living in poverty and a 19.9 per cent unemployment rate. There were 344 murders committed in the city last year, up 11 on 2010, but an 18 per cent cut Detroit's police budget will see 380 posts lost. The tightening budget will also see 'Virtual Precincts' introduced with police stations closing from 4pm to 8am and people told to report non-emergency crime to a call centre instead of 911. The third highest violent crime rate city of St Louis, Missouri experienced 18.6 incidents per 1,000 people in 2011. There were also 113 murders recorded last year in the city of 320,000 where the unemployment rate runs at more than 11.5 per cent. The number of murders fell from 144 in the previous year - but the violent crime rate went up by 1.1 per cent over the same period and St Louis robbery rate is the fifth highest in the country. Despite the high crime rate St Louis Police Department has faced big budgets cuts and may need to have 100 less officers patrolling its streets. Oakland, California has historically been one of the state's the most crime-ridden cities and its violent crime rate last year of 16.8 per 1,000 people is the fourth highest in the U.S. The number of murders committed in 2011, 14 more than in 2010, and the city had the ninth-highest murder rate in the country two years in a row. Oakland city council member Desley Brooks wants to add $11million to the city's police budget, acknowledges increasing violent crime was a problem. She said to MSNBC: 'We cannot ignore that we have had an increase in violent crime, and so we cannot continue to do the same thing the same way and expect that it’s going to be a different result.' Ongoing issues: Oakland, California has long been one of the state's the most crime-ridden cities and its violent crime rate last year of 16.8 per 1,000 people is the fourth highest in the U.S . The FBI crime report revealed that overall the U.S. experienced a four per cent drop in reported violent crime, year on year. The findings were is based on information collected from 14,009 law enforcement agencies across the country. Another city that defied that the national trend of declining crime rates in major U.S. cities last year was Memphis, Tennessee. Its violent crimes rate per 1,000 people increased, from 15.4 to 15.8 with murders going from 89 in 2010 to 117 in 2011 and 100 more aggravated assault cases. The unemployment rate went 1.2 percent over the 12 months and the with the city facing a £45million budget deficit its mayor A C Wharton Jr has refused to rule out police officer redundancies.

A teenager paraded naked through a Tesco store and karate-kicked a policeman in the face after taking the £10 legal high Benzo Fury, a court heard yesterday. Katie Wilson, 19, spoke of her shame after she went on the rampage in the middle of the day in the supermarket. The teenager was so out of control when she went on a 'terrifying trip' she was mistaken for a heroin addict by police called to the store in Bourne, Lincolnshire. She kicked an officer in the face barefoot and broke the wing mirror off a patrol car as officers battled to arrest her. Controversial party drug Benzo Fury gives users a high similar to ecstasy and was blamed for . the death of Alex Herriot, 19, at the RockNess festival in Scotland last weekend. Katie was fined £200 and given a one-year . conditional discharge after she admitted outraging public decency and . criminal damage at Grantham Magistrates Court on Monday. Katie, a shop assistant from Deeping St James, Lincolnshire, urged others not to take the drug as she recalled the incident yesterday. 'I have learnt my lesson. If anything this has been the making of me - it was the real wake-up call I needed,' she said. 'I'm so embarrassed about it, I'm just horrified that it made me become something I'm not. 'I was an absolute mess - I trashed my . friend's flat and then I just walked out of the flat stumbled up the . road and into the store. 'I was parading through the Tesco aisles like a catwalk diva. I was a disgrace and it was a real terrifying trip. Guilty: Katie Wilson was fined £200 after admitting outraging public decency and causing criminal damage as she went on a 'terrifying trip' in Tesco in Bourne, Lincolnshire . Killer party drug: Benzo Fury, the £10 legal high which Katie Wilson took, was blamed for the death of Alex Herriot, 19, (right) at the RockNess festival in Scotland last weekend . 'I had chewed a pen so it looked like I . had black teeth and I had drawings all over my body. The police thought . I was a heroin addict. 'But I'm really a decent girl - I drive a BMW and I work hard, it really wasn't me. Benzo Fury is just the latest 'legal high' to appear on the market. The drugs - which are not banned and are sold as not fit for human consumption produce a similar effect to banned substances. But they have a different molecular structure to banned substances so are not illegal under anti-drugs legislation. There are a large number of 'legal highs' - some are known by their brand/product name. Although the authorities move to ban new highs such as mephedrone or 'meow meow', new variants of the drug are created so quickly they are fighting a losing battle. Knowing that these substances are legal makes them very tempting for teenagers to try - even though they are completely unregulated and potentially harmful. Benzo Fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high. It induces feelings of empathy similar to Class  A drug ecstasy. It is also a stimulant and it's side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia. Controversial 'legal highs' such as Benzo Fury and Ivory Wave are manufactured in laboratories in the Far East and eastern Europe. 'I haven't been out for about a month . now and I'm really into my fitness - I'm a changed girl and I would . advise other people to stay away from the drug. 'It is very dangerous and it can do you real damage - I don't want others to make the same mistake I did.' The court heard Katie walked into the Tesco store just after midday in front of stunned shoppers on May 23. Daniel Paulson, prosecuting, said: 'She was then taken to a back office where something was found for her to wear. 'Police then attended and placed Miss Wilson under arrest.' However, Wilson refused to leave quietly and attacked the officer and a car. Mr Paulson added: 'She admitted the offences in interview. She said she had taken legal drugs which caused her to act in the way she did.' Rob Arthur, defending, told the court: 'The fact she went out to Tesco in Bourne naked shows the mental state she was in. 'These experiences mean she will never risk taking such substances again. This is clearly a day Miss Wilson would like to put out of her memory if she could. 'I don't think she could be any more apologetic to the officer in relation to her behaviour that day.' Chairman of the bench Jo Johnson told her: 'I hope you have learnt your lesson.' Rampage: Katie Wilson paraded naked through this store in Bourne, Lincolnshire.

But now one Briton has decided to go one step further and had the time of his life by holding a wake in advance of his own death. Rex Curtis, 69, from Cornwall, invited 300 friends and family to a huge party - but he is not even terminally ill - he just didn’t want to miss it. Speech: Rex said a few words - but was heckled and told to be quiet because he was 'dead' Happy crowd: Unusually for a wake, the 300 or so friends had a great time at the event to celebrate Rex's ongoing life .

Emaciated: Brooke had been abandoned in stormy conditions despite being less than one year old - and was taken to a vet after being found by a dog walker on marshes.

Healthy: Since her rescue, Brooke's weight has more than doubled from just 7.05kg when she came into care with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to 14.56kg - a 106 per cent increase . In court: Mother-of-three Cassie George, 22, and her partner Paul Hilton, 30, also left their pet rabbit to die . Seven months after her rescue in . February, this black and white Staffordshire Bull terrier cross is . getting healthier and her weight has more than doubled. Since her rescue, Brooke’s weight has gone from just one stone (7.05kg), when she came into care with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to more than two stone (14.56kg) - a 106 per cent increase. Today pictures emerged of a starving Brooke taken when she was saved and then looking healthy this month, as her former master and mistress avoided jail for causing unnecessary suffering. Mother-of-three Cassie George, 22, and her partner Paul Hilton, 30, also left their pet rabbit to die in its hutch before letting a neighbour dump the two starving dogs in the field. RSPCA inspector Vicky McDonald said today: ‘I collected Brooke and she was one of the thinnest dogs I had ever seen that was still alive. She was so cold and thin and hardly move. ‘I took her to a vet and when weighed she was less than half the weight she should be. It is clear she had not been roaming the streets - she’d been dumped. ‘The fact that she’s survived after . being in a shocking state when she was discovered and is testament to . all of the people who have cared for her since then. ‘I’ve . never seen an increase in body weight like that, she’s more than . doubled her weight, that’s how terrible a condition she was in.’ The . discovery was made after RSPCA officers acting a tip-off went to the . couple’s home on Keble Grove in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in January . after a report about a dead rabbit. Saved: Brooke is seen (left) looking emaciated after she was rescued, and (right) a door is pictured leading out of the home's dining room, which is thought to have been scratched and chewed by dogs . Spotted: In February, the couple's dark brindle Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog named Chubbs was found by a member of the public on a nearby marshes playing field, pictured . The body of . the rabbit, which had been left to starve to death, was found in its . filthy hutch. But George told the inspector she had no other animals - . and it is believed the dogs were kept hidden. Seven . weeks later in February, the couple’s dark brindle Staffordshire bull . terrier-type dog named Chubbs was found by a member of the public on the . nearby marshes playing field. 'I collected Brooke and she was one of the thinnest dogs I had ever seen that was still alive. She was so cold and thin and hardly move' Vicky McDonald, RSPCA inspector . Chubbs was collapsed, emaciated and barely alive, and by the time assistance arrived he had died. Two days later Brooke - then called Bitches - was found on the playing fields in a sheet. Miss McDonald said: ‘She must have been dumped there because in her condition there was no way she could have walked there. ‘A member of the public walking a dog found her by a fence and a brook. It was just too much of a coincidence for both dogs to be found in a similar state at the same location. ‘I did a public appeal for anyone who recognised the dogs to get in touch and they did. That’s when we realised we were already dealing with the owner about a rabbit.’ Shocking: The filthy hutch and body of the dead rabbit also owned by Cassie George and Paul Hilton . Tests revealed the rabbit, which was . white and brown, was malnourished and suffering from a chronic ear . infection and its body was found in its own filth. 'Chubbs was in such a poor state, he died before any help arrived. Brooke was found in identical circumstances, wrapped in a sheet and hidden in some bushes in the same fields' Tony Stock, prosecuting . Chubbs died as a result of malnutrition. He was also dumped in a manner that exposed him to the elements. But . after being signed over to the RSPCA, Brooke has now been rehomed. George pleaded guilty to nine allegations and Hilton pleaded guilty to four allegations under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 during a hearing at Wigan Magistrates Court. ‘Chubbs was in such a poor state, he died before any help arrived,’ Tony Stock, prosecuting, said. ‘Brooke was found in identical circumstances, wrapped in a sheet and hidden in some bushes in the same fields. ‘That dog was more fortunate and after receiving immediate and emergency care, that dog survived. Brooke survived only by the narrowest margin.’ Atrocious: Pictured are the filthy conditions inside the home of pet owners Cassie George and Paul Hilton . Karen Schofield, defending both George . and Hilton, said the couple had bought the dogs as pets and added that . they had ‘started off looking after the dogs and caring for the dogs . well’. She said: ‘She (George) wasn’t really bothered about getting pets, but accepted that it might be a good thing for the children to have some pets in the house.’ 'She wasn’t really bothered about getting pets, but accepted that it might be a good thing for the children to have some pets in the house' Karen Schofield, defending . But whilst pregnant with their third child George became scared of the dogs and they became confined to the back room. She claimed she thought a neighbour was feeding and walking the dogs and did not realise he had actually dumped them. Hilton was jailed for 18 weeks - suspended for two years - and given a nine-month supervision order. George was also jailed for 18 weeks - suspended for two years - and got a four-month curfew. Both were disqualified for life from keeping animals and each had to pay £500 costs.

To look at little Ruby Hodgson's bright smile you would never think that just four weeks ago her life was hanging in the balance. The three year old, from Redcar, in North Yorkshire, has been battling a brain tumour which, at one stage, stretched from ear to ear. Then, just one month ago, when it seemed she’d beaten the tumour, . she was so badly hit by stomach bug C.difficile, it looked like she may . not even be around to celebrate her October 8 birthday she shares with her dad . Wayne. Brave smile: Three year old Ruby Hodgson, from Redcar, Cleveland, who has battled back from the brink of death twice . Devastated parents Wayne and Sally could only look on helplessly as doctors at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) battled to save their little girl. Ruby’s latest problems began when, . after completing 25 of her 28 chemotherapy doses, she contracted, as a . side effect, mucositis - a painful inflammation of the digestive tract. Encouraged by her progress, her consultant decided to stop the chemotherapy to spare her further pain. Sally recalls: 'We were on a high. We just felt so relieved that ""yes, that looks like the end of the cancer.""' Thumbs up: The cheeky toddler gives the camera her view on the situation . But the very next day, Ruby’s temperature rose, so it was back up to the RVI again. And very quickly, things took a dramatic turn for the worse. With her immune system low, the C.difficile - a usually harmless stomach bacteria - had turned life-threatening.Sally told the Gazette Live: 'Basically, all the good bacteria had been wiped out by the bad.'Anyone we asked said it was severe - and we knew severe cases often didn’t make it.'Ruby suffered a prolapse, her lung collapsed and her little body swelled up massively because it was retaining fluid. C. diff produces poisons which cause diarrhoea, and in the worst cases, a potentially fatal infection of the abdomen. Medics quickly fitted a catheter and . put the little girl on morphine, paracetemol and ketamine, but the . toddler was still screaming and rolling in pain. Father Wayne said: 'You couldn’t fit another person into the room - every consultant and doctor was in there.' Sally said: 'When I heard my mum on the phone to my dad crying, saying he’d better get himself up, that’s when it hit home.' According to the family even the nurses looking after Ruby struggled to contain the tears. She was placed in intensive care and on a ventilator, where she was sedated for several days 'so her tummy could go to sleep'. Play time: Ruby will not let her condition get in the way of her fun . Doctors administered, for the first time, two types of drugs intravenously, in a move which will benefit other children in the future. It worked and before long, Ruby was out of danger. Even then the drama was not over. Condensation in her feeding tube dripped into her lung, prompting another emergency response. Yet after a four-week hospital stay, just a few days later Ruby was ready to return home to be reunited with brother Daniel, 17, and Emily, 13, and play again with her favourite loved Disney characters. All end of treatment tests have shown no sign of Ruby’s tumour returning. She’s also back on a normal diet. Her grateful parents now want to spread the word about Crawford House - the Sick Children’s Trust accommodation which meant they could stay with Ruby in Newcastle during her treatment - and the need to give blood, with Ruby receiving more than 30 pints.","Ruby Hodgson, from Redcar, North Yorkshire, nearly died four times .

Its menu includes scones, cakes and pancakes all freshly made by cafe owner and University of Edinburgh graduate Natalie Kwek, 26.

Local businesses and tourism groups have welcomed the plan with ‘open arms’ to boost the Highland economy while Lama Yeshe hopes to get a glimpse of Nessie. Fascinated with Loch Ness legend: Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche (right) plans to open an inter-faith peace and healing centre in Loch Ness because he believes there 'could be such a thing or something like' the Loch Ness monster (left, a depiction of the creature on exhibition) Lama Yeshe runs health centres around the world, including the famous Samye Ling Monastery in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He said today: ‘When I first came to Scotland I remember watching these people searching for the Loch Ness monster. Epic journey: Lama Yeshe fled Tibet with the 14th Dalai Lama (pictured) in 1959 and endured a 15-day journey on foot over Himalayan Mountains to India . ‘I always wanted to know if they would find something. For me, I believe there could be such a thing or something like it.’ Lama Yeshe fled Tibet with the 14th . Dalai Lama in 1959 to escape the Chinese suppression of the national . uprising and remains close to the iconic spiritual leader. The . men endured an epic 15-day journey on foot from the Tibetan capital, . Lhasa, over the Himalayan Mountains to India where the Dalai Lama . denounced the People's Republic and established a Tibetan government in . exile. The new facility will feature a special gift blessed by the Dalai Lama, a 12ft peace pole, made from Lochaber oak, which has the inscription ‘May Peace Prevail on Earth’ in Tibetan, in his handwriting, and in English and Gaelic. While Lama Yeshe would not disclose the exact location of the planned centre it is believed the centre could be based in Drumnadrochit. He said they were in discussions with owners of a potential site, which had previously been used as a healing centre. The centre will be open to everyone and aims to build inter-faith relations in Scotland. He said: ‘The main reason for the centre is because there is something missing here.’ The lama said his centre on Holy Isle, near Arran, generated new businesses for local shops and guesthouse owners. Famous teaching: Lama Yeshe runs health centres around the world including the Samye Ling Monastery (pictured is its entrance-way) in Dumfriesshire, Scotland . Blessed gift: Lama Yeshe remains close with the Dalai Lama, who has blessed a special 12ft peace pole that will feature at the new facility . He said: ‘In Arran, we have many . tourists from all over the world staying there. This helps the people of . Arran, like guesthouses. ‘They don’t just come to the centre and leave, they stay to see Arran.’ Lama Yeshe also said the group was looking for a building in Inverness where they could run classes and have soup runs. He said: ‘We are trying to provide a service that, in this financially strained time, the council cannot. Graham Ambrose, of marketing group Destination Loch Ness, said: ‘If it brings more people from around the world to Loch Ness from different countries that we don’t usually get, that can only be a good thing. ‘And if people stayed on in the local B&Bs, that would benefit everyone. ‘It would be good particularly in the winter months when the area is at its most peaceful.’ Businessman Willie Cameron, who owns Loch Ness Marketing, said he would welcome the Tibetan group with ‘open arms’. He said: ‘I know in other parts of the country this group has blended in very well in the community and have done a lot of good work.’ Potential place: While Lama Yeshe would not disclose the exact location of the planned centre it is believed the centre could be based in Drumnadrochit (pictured Urquhart Castle in the village)","Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche wants to open a peace and healing centre in Loch Ness to be closer to the Loch Ness monster .

Apple is in talks with US cable firms about streaming live TV to its upcoming TV set, it has been claimed. However, mystery still surrounds the firm's much rumoured plans to built its own TV. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has not yet reached a deal with American cable companies. Apple already makes a £99 TV box, but the firm is believed to be developing a far more advanced version, as well as its own line of TV sets. Apple already sells a £99 'Apple TV', a small device which plugs into a HD TV . The box delivers films, music and television shows from iTunes to a TV set and also lets iPhone, iPad and iPod touch stream content from their device to a TV. Apple also produced an app for iPhones and iPads letting owners control the device from their gadget. A full Apple TV is expected to improve on this functionality, allowing users to see information about programmes they are watching and to change channels. Speculation about an Apple television has been rife since the publication of Steve Jobs biography last year. It is believed Steve Jobs worked on the Apple TV project before his death. He told his biographer that firm had 'cracked' a way to make TVs easier to use. The Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched. Late last year, 'industry sources' were quoted as saying that Apple would launch 32-inch and 37-inch television sets some time this year. 'Two people briefed on the matter said the technology involved could ultimately be embedded in a television,' the WSJ said. 'Apple has worked on prototypes for televisions in the past, according to people briefed on the projects.' The rumours comes as Sky yesterday unveiled its remote control iPad app letting users control their Sky+ box from an iPad.","Claims firm is talking to cable firms about showing live TV .

Graham Doyle, 25, another carer at the home, verbally berated patients . by putting on a German accent 'like a Nazi solider', the court heard. Dove was appearing at court to be sentenced for the horrifying abuse alongside fellow carer Doyle. Other footage shown to the court featured Doyle physically and verbally restraining patients.

Horrific: This member of staff stamps on the patients hand in yet another shocking image from the now-closed home . The video shows Dove helping pin Simone to the floor, force feed her medicine and squirt shower gel in her eyes. Eventually a visibly distressed Simone starts to choke and is sick, forcing the workers to leave her. At one point Simone can be heard to cry out to her mum and screams 'I’m cold mum, I’m cold'.

'She didn’t recognise herself. She didn’t set out to hurt anyone emotionally or physically.' Punishment: A judge will sentence the group of 11 care home workers later this week . She added that since the Pamorama investigation had been aired Dove had . been subject to physical abuse and suffered a broken jaw and a hateful . Facebook campaign.

Return: The Duchess of Cornwall, seen on a visit to India in 2006, has returned to the country ahead of a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea . With a three-week tour of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand ahead of her, the Duchess of Cornwall clearly felt in need of a little pampering. And it seems a face mask and a glass of wine in front of Downton Abbey wouldn’t quite do the trick. Instead, the duchess has flown to southern India for a secret week-long retreat at a ‘holistic heath centre’. There, she can take advantage of customised dawn yoga sessions and ‘spiritually healing’ ayurvedic massages. Camilla arrived at the Soukya International Holistic Health Centre in Bangalore on Saturday with a party of ten,  which is believed to include members of her family as well as a personal assistant and her Scotland Yard bodyguards. Prince Charles, famously an advocate of alternative remedies, is not among the group. It is understood that Camilla is staying in the centre’s £3,500-a-night presidential suite. Measuring 2,500 sq ft, it boasts three bedrooms, a fruit garden, an open air shower and its own lotus pond. The duchess enjoyed a four-night stay in the same suite when she and Charles visited the country for the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Although the couple were on an official visit, that trip, like the current one, was paid for by her husband and did not cost taxpayers, aside from the cost of her Scotland Yard security team. The retreat claims to be a ‘unique facility that helps restore the natural balance of your mind, body and spirit’. It is set within a 30-acre organic farm and guests follow a strict ovo-vegetarian diet, paying around £140 a day for a range of different treatments. They include  ‘hydrowashes’, reflexology, and a ‘four-hand’ Ayurvedic massage carried out by two female therapists. On . her first visit Camilla was said to have tried abhayanka, a massage . with medicated oil, and shirodhara, where warm oil is poured on the . forehead. One insider revealed that the last time the duchess stayed she undertook daily dawn yoga and meditation sessions. ‘She could do the difficult asanas [poses] with ease. It seems she has done yoga before,’ they said. Camilla was also said to have had several ayurvedic massages. These . start with the therapist reciting an ancient prayer to invoke healing . and involve ‘vigorous’ massage strokes using scented oils. Spiritual: Prince Charles and Camilla are seen near Jodphur on a visit to India in 2006 . A spokesman for the clinic has declined to comment on their royal guest. But Clarence House confirmed that the duchess was out of the country on a private holiday. A spokesman said: ‘The Duchess of Cornwall is on a private holiday. 'She . will fly on to meet up with the Prince of Wales for the start of their . Diamond Jubilee tour to Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand next . weekend.’ It is believed that Camilla will meet the prince in Singapore. Relaxation: A woman receives a mud spa treatment at the Soukya Holistic Health Centre in India . Ayurvedic medicine is a system of healing which has been practised in India for thousands of years and has been steadily gaining followers in the West. High-profile fans include Madonna and Cherie Blair. Ayurveda, which means ‘science of life’ in Sanskrit, is based on the idea that all matter is composed of five elements – air, fire, water, earth and space. These combine in the body as biological forces, or ‘doshas’, called vata, pitta and kapha. Ayurveda views the balance of these forces in the body as good health and their imbalance as the cause of disease. The . aim of the holistic healing method is to rebalance the body and restore . health and wellbeing. Ayurvedic medicine also treats specific physical . and mental health problems. Treatment . for general ailments can include massage, yoga, meditation, . aromatherapy or herbal steams (to rid the body of toxins), or the . prescription of Ayurvedic drugs. Proper hygiene, diet and lifestyle are . considered essential for good health. But . safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, after a study in 2008 . found that a fifth of treatments contained levels of toxic metals and . chemicals up to 10,000 times higher than the accepted limit.","Camilla has flown to the Soukya International Holistic Health Centre in southern India ahead of a tour of Australia and New Zealand .

He released a heartrending statement in which he spoke of his pain over his son Sage's sudden death. But Sylvester Stallone's nephew has blasted the actor, accusing him of being to blame as he continually neglected the 36-year-old who was found dead at his Hollywood Hills home on Friday from an apparent overdose. Edd Filiti made the claims on his Facebook page, though the messages have since been removed. Accused: Sylvester Stallone's nephew has slammed the actor and his wife Jennifer Flavin for neglecting his son Sage, seen here attending the Daylight premiere together in 1996 . In a posting where the 18-year-old slammed the 66-year-old Rambo star's current wife Jennifer Flavin, he also said the action man had cut Sage out of his life, devastating the aspiring filmmaker. When Sage called his father on July 6 to wish him happy birthday, the Hollywood star apparently didn't pick up and didn't call him back. 'What did he do wrong, say happy birthday?' Edd wrote. 'Neither you [Stallone's wife Jennifer Flavin] or he could return a phone call, which is all he wanted, his father. 'I know you don't care what happened, but you'll care when you’re squirming under the burning magnifying glass of public opinion. You people make me f****** sick.' Edd, who is the son of Stallone's half-sister Toni Ann, also went on to make a withering attack to 43-year-old former model, who married the Rocky favourite in 1997. Gone: The offending messages have since been removed from his Facebook page . Edd said: 'Jennifer Flavin, you won. You tore this family apart and got your trophy, Congrats! 'Like you told my family, ""I'm Sly's family now, he doesn't [need] you anymore. Lets see how much he needs you after this.' Edd later decided to remove the comments from his Facebook page, telling the New York Post that he regretted sharing his feelings. 'I made a mistake. It is a very emotional time and I vented my feelings,' he explained. 'I was feeling raw and emotional and I never meant for my feeling to become public. 'I took the post down minutes later. I never meant to insult my uncle. I have my own issues with him, but that should never be said on Facebook. I want to recant my words.' Tragic: It is believed the aspiring young filmmaker died of an accidental drugs overdose . Sage's mother Sasha Czack,split with Stallone in 1985 after 11 years of marriage. According to reports she got a $12 million divorce settlement from the filmmaker. A source said: 'Sasha has been inconsolable. She’s totally devastated. Her children are her life.' Meanwhile it has emerged officers investigating the death want to talk to several doctors that prescribed him medications. It follows reports that Los Angeles Police . Department Robbery and Homicide division has taken over the case. A source told RadarOnline: 'Detectives from the LAPD are in the process of going through evidence recovered from Sage's house and will be contacting the doctors that prescribed the medications found there. 'There was more than one doctor that Sage was seeing in the days leading up to his death. 'Cops want to establish a timeline of events leading up to Sage's death and they want to know what his medical history was.' While prescription bottles were found at the scene, no suicide not was found and it is believed his death was accidental. On Sunday night, Sylvester issued a statement asking 'people to respect my talented son's memory and feel compassion for his loving mother Sasha,' and for the media to stop 'the speculation and questionable reporting.' Big break: Sylvester helped his son to stardom when he cast him in Rocky V in 1990 . He added: 'When a parent loses a child there is no greater pain. This agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives. 'Sage was our first child and the center of our universe and I am humbly begging for all to have my son's memory and soul left in peace.' An autopsy and a toxicology test were completed Sunday, but the results of the latter will not be released for weeks. Meanwhile a photographer who did a feature on Sage in May said he was not surprised about the death, though he said the young filmmaker was far from suicidal. Girls and Corpses snapper Mark Berry told RadarOnline: 'I saw nothing to suggest that he was in a suicidal mood. He was telling me about how he wanted to shoot a film, he seemed hopeful for the future and making work plans. 'My impression was that he was a very talented character who seemed under the influence of a pharmaceutical medication, he wasn’t a wreck but he was just a little spaced out. 'I wasn’t entirely shocked when I heard (of his death), my initial thought was that he had an accidental overdose, or that his body just packed up.'

A mother resorted to kicking a defenceless rabbit around the garden in a bid to grab her teenage daughter's attention. Lily Todd carried out the attack on the pet after becoming embroiled in an argument with her daughter, Hartlepool Magistrates heard. When a shocked neighbour intervened and called the RSPCA, Todd said attacking the rabbit was the only way she had of getting through to her daughter. Despite denying the attack on the rabbit, called Twinkle, 51-year-old Todd, who also owned another rabbit and a cockatiel, was found guilty at trial and disqualified from owning animals for five years. RSPCA officials praised magistrates for the sentence and described Todd’s attack on the animal in her garden on Sandringham Road, Hartlepool, as 'awful'. The court heard that Todd argued with her teenage daughter at around 8.30pm on Friday, March 30 this year. She went back inside to get the rabbit and started kicking it, while demanding her daughter went back inside the house. The rabbit ran off and a neighbour picked it up and took it to his home, while Todd continued looking for it. John Ellwood, prosecuting, said: 'Her neighbour gave her back the rabbit and warned her that she shouldn’t kick the rabbit. 'The defendant said that was the only way she could get her daughter in, and the only way she would listen to her. 'The neighbour said that it was not the rabbit’s fault and the defendant then picked up the rabbit and threw it at the neighbour, stating that he should just have the rabbit.' Todd’s neighbour took the animal back and alerted the RSPCA of the attack, who then collected the rabbit and took it to the vets. X-rays were carried out which showed that the rabbit had suffered five fractured ribs in the attack, two on the right side and three on the left . Cruel: Twinkle the rabbit suffered five cracked ribs in the attack. A neighbour called the RSPCA after seeing it take place . Vets described the injuries as being consistent with being kicked or thrown. Todd was interviewed and admitted losing her temper, but denied kicking the rabbit. She pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. As well as being disqualified from owning animals for five years, Todd was given a 12- month community order with a requirement of supervision and ordered to pay £500 costs to the RSPCA. John Relton, mitigating, said: 'My client is a 51-year-old lady of previous good character who is in poor health. 'She owned two other animals, another rabbit which was in good health and a cockatiel which was also in good health. 'This was a singular attack born out of frustration.' Twinkle and two other pets owned by Todd have been taken into care by the RSPCA, which branded the attack 'awful' RSPCA inspector Kristina Raine said: 'I am pleased with the conviction and the sentence passed. 'This was an awful attack on a small and defenceless animal. 'When it was x-rayed the rabbit had fractured ribs which, along with the witness statements, could not have been explained any other way. 'We are very grateful for the assistance of those witnesses who were a key part of this prosecution and we could not have done it without them. 'The RSPCA always hope for a ban on keeping animals as the best way of ensuring the safety of others in future.

He unleashed a public outcry by inviting controversial dog trainer Cesar Millan onto his daytime TV show. Now it seems Alan Titchmarsh has landed himself in the doghouse with animal-lover Yasmin le Bon. The model is ‘on the warpath’ after he said Mr Millan’s unconventional methods were ‘barbaric’, according to her rock star husband. Alan Titchmarsh (left) has landed himself in the dog house with Yasmin Le Bon (pictured right) Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon warned the mild-mannered horticulturalist to be ‘very afraid’, saying Mr Millan is ‘pretty close to holy’ in his household. The US-based trainer – known as the ‘dog whisperer’ –has a host of celebrity clients including Scarlett Johansson and Oprah Winfrey, although is not known if he has trained Mrs Le Bon’s own pets. The brunette beauty has a Chihuahua called Tinka, a Pug named Luigi, and Cecil, a Boston Terrier. In a confrontational interview on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on Wednesday, Mr Millan was criticised for kicking badly behaved dogs and using electric shocks and spiked collars to control them. Mr Titchmarsh, 63, said the methods were ‘pretty barbaric treatment’ and ‘totally unacceptable’. Simon Le Bon (pictured with his wife) wrote on Twitter that his wife was furious after Alan Titchmarsh's comments To Cesar Millan . But while many animal lovers were furious . at the decision to invite the trainer onto the show in the first place, . Mrs Le Bon instead took issue with Mr Titchmarsh’s aggressive interview . technique. The 47-year-old model read a report of the interview in yesterday’s Daily Mail. It seems the domestic bliss of the Le Bon household was somewhat disturbed by her subsequent outburst of fury. Clearly shaken by his wife’s reaction, Mr Le Bon, 53, told his Twitter followers: ‘WTF did Alan Titchmarsh say about Cesar Millan that’s seriously put my wife on the warpath? He should be afraid, very afraid!’ Alan Titchmarsh (left) labelled dog whisperer Cesar Millan's (right) methods 'barbaric' Cesar Millan was criticised for mistreating dogs . He added: ‘Cesar Millan is pretty close to holy in this house.’ The . interview also divided TV viewers. Hundreds watched a clip of the . interview on YouTube before entering into a heated debate in the video’s . comments box. One said: ‘Cesar, you’re a legend. You understand dog psychology better than anyone else I’ve ever seen in my life.’ But others applauded Mr Titchmarsh’s confrontational stance. Another commented: ‘Congratulations Alan on asking these questions - what a shame all Milan did was avoid them!’ Mrs Le Bon, who lives with her husband in south west London, has often spoken of her love of dogs, and has even launched a range of boutique dog-walking accessories. In the past she has admitted her pets’ manners are far from perfect, although it is not known whether she uses Mr Millan’s methods to improve their behaviour. She said: ‘We’ve a lazy Pug named Luigi, who often can’t be bothered to get up, and a Chihuahua called Tinka, who thinks she’s a guard dog and tears around after foxes. I’m often the one who ends up going walkies. ‘Luigi chews everything. Him and Simon get on great. In fact, I think the pug wants to become Simon and Simon wants to become the pug. It’s a little bit worrying.’ Mrs Le Bon’s spokesman did not respond to a request for a comment yesterday.","Alan Titchmarsh grilled his guest Cesar Millan on the 'totally unacceptable' way that he trains dogs .

'Stubborn and feisty': Charlene Pickering was killed instantly after she was hit by a train travelling at 60mph, an inquest heard . A mother was killed by an express train travelling at 60mph after she climbed down on to railway tracks to 'scare' her boyfriend, an inquest heard yesterday. Charlene Pickering, 23, got on to the tracks at Wimbledon station, south-west London, after arguing with boyfriend Daniel Pickett about what to do with the rest of their evening after she had downed four glasses of wine. But because of disabilities, including a dropped foot she had sustained in an accident years earlier, she was stuck. Platform supervisor Olu Owalabi tried desperately to help her to safety but, only four seconds later, Miss Pickering was killed instantly when she was hit by the high-speed train to Exeter. The station worker remains 'traumatised' by his experience, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe yesterday recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. 'We are not ever going to know what was on her mind but I believe, on the balance of probabilities, this was an impulsive act whilst intoxicated as a result of some disagreement with her boyfriend,' the coroner said. 'I think this has been a very tragic combination of alcohol combined with impulsivity and strong will.' In a statement Mr Owalabi, who could not attend court for medical reasons, said: 'As I pulled her up a train came and hit her. That was the last time I saw her.' He had already warned her about dangling her legs over the platform in actions the coroner noted was 'dabbling in very dangerous practice'. When asked if anything could have been done to stop the express train Kay Lane, coroners officer for British Transport Police, said: 'CCTV clearly shows a matter of seconds from when Charlene is first noticed on the tracks. 'Even if Mr Owalabi had called for help rather than helping her up he would still have not managed to stop the train entering the station. It is a matter of four seconds.' She added: 'No-one actually saw her until the crucial moment.' The train had been driven by a trainee driver under supervision, but instructor Michael Moorgate told the court there was nothing they could do to stop the tragedy. Mr Pickett was arrested at the scene and restrained as it was feared that he too was going to get on to the tracks and 'hysterical' but he was soon released, it was said. Scene: Miss Pickering was hit by an express train at Wimbledon station, in south-west London, on January 8 . The inquest heard that the incident happened at 7.30pm on January 8 this year. Mr Pickett told the hearing that the couple had been arguing because Miss Pickering had wanted to stay out drinking, having already had four glasses of wine, while he said they needed to get home. He said he had thrown her bag and coat at her in an attempt to make her leave, but she was refusing to go and threatened to walk across the tracks. Mr Pickett told the court: 'I said to her ""Why are you doing this? Don't be so stupid."" 'She has done similar stuff to scare me before, nothing as major as this, but once when we were out in Kingston she just walked off down to the river and I think it was just to scare me.' The inquest heard that Mr Pickett got Miss Pickering away from the platform edge after being warned about her behaviour by staff. But they continued arguing and, when they went to get on a train, Miss Pickering realised that she had lost her bag. Mr Pickett said that he called her mother for help, but Miss Pickering shouted 'This proves how much you love me' and threw her mobile phone on to the tracks. Couple: Daniel Pickett (left) told the inquest that Charlene Pickering (right) had been arguing with him before she climbed down on to railway tracks to 'scare' him . He went to get staff to retrieve the phone, but when he returned Miss Pickering had disappeared. Mr . Pickett said: 'I looked for her and I thought maybe because she said to . me before that she was going to walk across the tracks so it was . possible she could have done that. 'I . called out and said “where are you?” I was thinking she had walked over across the tracks, I ran upstairs and came down on to the other side of . the platform. 'That is when I called out and I saw her under the lip of the platform. 'The ticket inspector came down and I said “She is there”. I was telling her “Get up, don’t be so stupid”. 'That is when the ticket inspector was trying to help her back up... by that time the train was coming.' The couple met when they were pupils at Rydens School in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, but had only been together for four months. CCTV footage of the incident was shown to the court. Describing the footage, Miss Lane, for British Transport Police, said: 'She is seen standing on the tracks resting her arms on the platform and then in the next still she has both her arms on the platform and appears to be trying to pull herself up. Grieving: Daniel Pickett, pictured arriving at Westminster Coroner's . Court yesterday for the inquest, told the hearing that his girlfriend had tried to . scare him in the past . 'She continues her efforts for several seconds and after this she drops out of view.' The court heard that Miss Pickering was down on the tracks for four minutes before Mr Pickett and the station worker found her. Mr Owalabi, who was hearing a high-visibility jacket, was seen trying to pull the woman from the tracks for four seconds until he was thrown backwards as the train arrived. Miss Pickering’s step-father Guy Pollington, sister Danielle, and aunt attended Westminster Coroners Court. Her mother, Pamela, did not attend but in a statement said to the court: 'She was a loving and sociable with a tremendously bubbly personality. 'She loved to chat and be around people and she lit up a room whenever she entered it.' Miss Pickering, who had a four-year-old son, was 'stubborn and feisty', her mother said, which helped her cope after she was seriously injured in a road traffic accident in 2000. Following the accident, Miss Pickering had a dropped foot which meant she limped and fell frequently, and she had nerve damage to her spine. She also had metal plates put in her hip. Miss Pickering feared she was bi-polar and believed she would 'die young', her mother said. She had also tried to take an overdose in the past. Mrs Pollington said in her statement that her daughter went on to the tracks 'almost certainly not giving thought to the consequences'. 'We believe she would have felt more than able to climb back up,' she added. Miss Pickering's family believe the platforms were higher than she thought and, because of her disabilities, she became stuck on the line. Recording her verdict, Dr Radcliffe noted Miss Pickering had a history of 'attention seeking' and had tried I the past to scare her boyfriend. Toxicology showed she was drunk when she died. She said: 'I don't believe there is any evidence whatsoever that could lead me to conclude that on January 8 she had any intention of taking her own life.'

A teenager has told a court how a Nigerian man accused of threatening girls with 'black magic' to try and force them into prostitution raped her and said he wanted to marry her. Osezua Elvis Osolase, 42, is alleged to have imprisoned the teenager - who is now 18 - in a flat for three months and raped her up to three times a week. The court heard he forced her to call him 'Uncle' and she was deprived of other human contact for weeks before she managed to take his keys and flee. Osezua Elvis Osolase, 42, is on trial at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) Osolase, a former security guard and recycling worker from Gravesend, Kent, is accused of 13 offences of trafficking, rape, false imprisonment and sexual activity with a child. He is alleged to have smuggled three children from Nigeria to Britain in order to sell them into prostitution in Italy. He is also alleged to have sexually assaulted the girls - who are now aged 15, 17 and 18. Osolase's alleged victims say he used African Juju magic rituals to scare them into doing as they were told and to prevent them from running away. Juju refers to traditional West African religions involving objects of superstition and witchcraft. The churchgoing teenager, told a jury at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday that Osolase - whom she knew as 'Uncle' - visited her at the flat. She claims he told her he wanted to make love - but she did not want to. She told the court: 'He said he wanted to play with me and make love to me. 'He said he wanted to take care of me. I didn’t want to have sex and I told him. I told him I didn’t want to sleep with him. 'Uncle took off his clothes then he took off my clothes. He then took a condom out of his wallet. 'He said he wanted to get married to me. I felt bad and I felt sad. I didn’t love him, I didn’t like him and I felt frightened of him.' The teenager - the third girl to give evidence at the trial - claimed Osolase, who was married to a German national, had helped bring her to the UK. She eventually managed to get hold of his keys and escape from the flat, the court heard. But the teenager told the jury Osolase found her in a park nearby and took her back to the flat, telling her: 'Do you think you are clever?' She added: 'I didn’t run away again because I had no place to stay.' The trial continues.

When Archie and Harley Garthwaite were born at 23 weeks with holes in their hearts, their parents were told to expect the worst. The twins weighed just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz each and doctors said it would be a miracle if even one of them survived unscathed. As well as the holes in their hearts, the boys, who are not identical, had bowel problems and were unable to breathe for themselves. At just two weeks old, Archie had to undergo gruelling open heart surgery, with his brother following a fortnight later. A small miracle: Twins Archie (left) and Harley Garthwaite (right) have amazed medics after they survived being born more than four months premature. Both were born with holes in their hearts, and had to undergo surgery just weeks after being born . Medics also operated on them both to correct bowel problems, performed laser treatment to stimulate their underdeveloped eyes, and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them breathe. And despite the odds being stacked against them, the twins have clung to life. Their mother Hayley Kennedy, 20, said: ‘It was the scariest time of our lives.’ Miss Kennedy, who is engaged to . the children’s father, Billy Garthwaite, had a smooth pregnancy until her waters to . Archie’s sack broke at 21 weeks. The couple, who live in Hartlepool, County Durham, spent the next two weeks at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton with doctors desperately trying to prevent Hayley going into labour, due to the risks of giving birth too prematurely. But at 23 weeks, Miss Kennedy began suffering cramp-like pains and realised Archie’s arrival was imminent. He was born 15 minutes later and placed straight into an incubator and onto a ventilator. Harley arrived two-and-a-half hours later. It soon became clear that both boys had holes in their hearts. They underwent risky three-hour heart and bowel operations at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Miss Kennedy, who was originally given a due date of last week, said: ‘The doctors told us to be prepared to lose them because the chances of even one of them surviving the surgery was so small. 'Unique and a complete rarity': Doctors had warned the boys' parents Hayley and Billy (pictured) to expect the worst. The twins' recovery has been hailed as a miracle given how premature and unwell they were . Archie, who now weighs 5lb, has been allowed home, but requires a round-the-clock supply of oxygen. At 4lb 8oz, Harley is still in hospital but should be discharged over the next few weeks. 'To get to this stage with one of them home and the other almost ready to come home is just mind-blowing,' said Miss Kennedy. 'We never thought we’d get to this stage. 'I am the proudest mum in the world and they’re our little miracles. 'We are so lucky to have them both with us and I wouldn’t wish what we have been through on anybody. 'I cried every night because I couldn’t hold my babies, we weren’t allowed to touch them.  I didn’t feel like a proper mum. 'Now after everything they have been through, we just can’t believe they are still here.' She added: ‘Archie is laid back and quiet like Billy, but Harley is bad-tempered and loud like me.' Dr Chidambara Krishna Iyer Harikumar, a consultant neonatologist at the University Hospital of North Tees and the doctor who helped deliver the babies, said they are the only set of twins he has ever known to survive being born so prematurely in his 20-year career. He described the miniature pair as ‘unique and a complete rarity’. He said: ‘Only about one in 10 babies born at 23 weeks survives and of those who make it, one in two of them will be brain damaged. ‘Therefore we’re talking about just one out of 20 babies will come out of this without damage. ‘For both twins to make it and to make it without brain damage is very, very rare to say the least. ‘In fact, I am not aware of any 23-week twins surviving in this region and it is definitely a first in this hospital. ‘I was there when they were born and I did not think they would survive, they were very, very small, and had very thin skin. ‘They have had some complications and operations in the early days, but it is heartening to know that both of them have come out of this winners and virtually unscathed.It is just amazing.'","Archie and Harley Garthwaite born at 23 weeks with heart, bowel and breathing problems .

A 22-year-old man died from a severe allergic reaction to the milk in his oatmeal after spending one night in custody over a misdemeanour charge for marijuana use. An autopsy report from the Snohomish County medical examiner revealed that Michael Saffioti died from bronchial asthma triggered by the consumption of dairy after spending a single night in the Snohomish County Jail in Washington State. Now his mother, Rose Saffioti, is suing the county for what she said is his wrongful death. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Michael Saffioti, 22, who suffered from severe food allergies and asthma, died from an allergic reaction while spending the night in prison for a misdemeanour offense . Request denied? He had requested to spend the night in the Snohomish County's medical facility, but was instead put in with the general population . On July 2, Saffioti turned himself in to police, after his mother Rose Saffioti assured him it was the right thing to do, and that he would be out the next day. Mrs Saffioti told The Herald newspaper of Everett that despite reassurances that the prison staff would take his medical needs into consideration, her son was scared. ‘He said, “Mom, I have a bad feeling that they are not going to take me seriously.”’ The mother, from Mukiteo, Washington, said that her son brought along a bag of medications needed to control his allergies and asthma, and he had expected to be placed in the jail's medical unit. Instead, he was placed in the general population. Mrs Saffioti received a call the next morning to inform her that her son was dead. She said that she has spoken with other inmates who were there. Many of them knew her son, and called him ‘Bubble Boy’ because of his debilitating allergy to dairy. Mrs Saffioti believes the cause might have been what he was served for breakfast on July 3 – oatmeal with milk, and that her son’s death could have been prevented. She also said that her son’s desperate pleas for help went ignored. She has since filed a wrongful death claim against Snohomish county. Outraged: His mother, Rose Saffioti, pictured, is now suing the county for her son's wrongful death . Ann Bremner, Mrs Saffioti’s attorney, told Q13 FOX that the guards thought the 22-year-old’s cries for help were fabricated. ‘The response from the guards was something like this,’ she said. ‘”If you don’t cut it out, you’re going to be in the hole.”’ A report from the Snohomish County medical examiner’s office released earlier this week revealed that he died from bronchial asthma brought on by his milk allergy. Mrs Saffioti said that her son's allergies were so severe that he had to ask what a girl had eaten that day before he could kiss her. The sheriff's office said that its investigation is on-going. Friends and family of the young man told the Herald that Saffioti’s substance abuse problem stemmed from anxiety produced his medical condition. He used the pot to calm his nerves, they said.","Michael Saffioti turned himself in to police on July 2 for misdemeanour marijuana charge .

Boris Johnson sweeps into the Tory party conference today with a direct challenge to David Cameron to stand up for the ‘struggling middle’ who he claims are being ignored. The Mayor of London arrives in Birmingham with a fresh attack on government policy towards cash-strapped working families, in a move which will fuel speculation about his hopes of challenging Mr Cameron for the leadership. With the Tories stung by criticism that it is giving millionaires a tax cut at a time of deep austerity, Mr Johnson launched a staunch defence of families struggling with living costs who are ‘feeling utterly and understandably ignored’. Swashbuckling arrival: London Mayor Boris Johnson (left, pictured last Thursday) called last night for British Prime Minister David Cameron's (pictured yesterday) government to do more to boost growth . Mr Johnson last night refused to . say if Mr Cameron was a better Prime Minister than he would be, . insisting the claim was ‘unverifiable’. The London Mayor - branded a . ‘blond-haired mop’ by his party leader yesterday - made a typically . swashbuckling arrival at the Tory conference by also demanding a . referendum on Europe, saying he doesn’t know what the current Tory . policy is. He called for the Government to do more to boost growth, warning it is ‘heading for disaster’ by failing to build a hub airport. He also positioned himself as the champion of the ‘struggling middle’ who are feeling ‘utterly ignored’. In a newspaper article today, he says middle-class families earning between £30,000 and £64,000 a year face many difficulties with everyday life, especially housing costs. He writes: ‘They are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. It is time to help them.’ Mr Johnson made clear yesterday that he would like the top job after his mayoral term is up in 2016, insisting it was healthy that he is in ‘competition’ with Mr Cameron, an Eton and Oxford contemporary. The mayor repeatedly refused to say whether Mr Cameron is a better leader than he would be. But he did concede: ‘I’ll tell you what I’ll say. He’s a better prime minister than Ed Miliband will ever be.’ Pressed to admit that Mr Cameron was better than him, the mayor told Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5: ‘I think it’s unverifiable. It’s unverifiable.’ Mr Johnson said his rival was ‘doing a fantastic job’ and pointed out that he had urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership. Party colleagues: Boris Johnson (left) said his rival was 'doing a fantastic job' and pointed out that he had urged David Cameron (right) to run for the Tory leadership. They are pictured together in August . But he was prepared to say only that Mr Cameron had been a better choice in 2005, a time when Mr Johnson had been forced to resign from the Conservative front bench and was in no position to challenge for the leadership. ‘It’s self-evidently true that in 2005, I thought he was the man for the job and I didn’t think I was the man for the job,’ he said. ‘I want to be Mayor of London. After four years is up, heaven knows.’ Mr Johnson used his newspaper column to complain that for many people in London and the South East, even those with incomes from £30,000 to £64,000, struggle to buy a home near where they work and are priced out of the market for even modest properties. ‘We need to think how to target this group — the struggling middle — that is currently not being helped, and that is so vital for the economy,’ he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. A ‘huge chunk’ of new houses are built as ‘affordable homes’ and ‘another sizeable chunk [was] of top-end stuff – swish houses and apartments, often for foreign buyers’. It what will be seen as a direct challenge to Mr Cameron’s government, he adds: ‘We are not doing as the Victorians did, and providing new stock to be bought by the people in the middle – on household incomes from £30,000 to £64,000; and they are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. ‘They cannot get the mortgages they would need, not at current prices, and not with lenders in their current mood. ‘They have to live at a great distance from their place of work, and spend huge quantities on travel and hardly get to see their children in the evenings.’ Tensions have been clear in the . relationship between the two men for years but they have flared in . recent weeks after the mayor repeatedly upstaged the Prime Minister at . the London Olympics. 'It’s self-evidently true that in 2005, I thought he was the man for the job and I didn’t think I was the man for the job. I want to be Mayor of London. After four years is up, heaven knows' David Cameron, London Mayor . But Mr Johnson said: ‘If senior politicians were endlessly pally and friendly with each other and there was no element of competition, I think people would think it was a plot against the electorate.’ Mr Cameron yesterday insisted there was ‘no point trying to contain Boris’. In an interview he said: ‘He will always speak his mind. He’s Mayor of London, he can speak out if he wants to. So I am relatively relaxed about having the blond-haired mop sounding off from time to time.’ Later, Mr Cameron said he did not think being mayor would be Mr Johnson’s last job. ‘I have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome. I like having other people in the Conservative Party who are popular, who get out there, talk our message and explain our vision and values,’ he said. ‘Boris is fantastic like that. He is one of those politicians people warm to and I think it is great that we have in our party figures like that. I have said to Boris, “Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don’t think your job in politics is over”. Thumbs up: Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson cheer during the London 2012 Victory Parade in September . ‘I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that. I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.’ But in comments likely to woo the Tory Right, Mr Johnson made clear he wants a referendum in Britain on any future EU treaty. Mr Cameron’s position is that such a referendum will be necessary only if it transfers powers from Westminster to Brussels. But the mayor indicated that he thinks changes in the eurozone would affect the UK and should be put to a vote here regardless. 'I have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome. I like having other people in the Conservative Party who are popular, who get out there, talk our message and explain our vision and values' David Cameron, Prime Minister . In a second dig at the PM, Mr Johnson suggested the Prime Minister’s efforts to explain his position on Europe remain unclear and took a dig at Mr Cameron’s abandonment of his ‘cast iron promise’ to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. He said: ‘I don’t know exactly what the position is now. I think we were promised a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. My strong view is that it would be right to consult the people on any further constitutional changes within the EU. ‘If they do go forward as a consequence of the difficulties surrounding the euro with a new settlement, a fiscal union or there are big changes to the treaty which will inevitably affect us ... then I do think that must be put to the people of this country. It should be put in the form of a referendum on that particular treaty.’ Last week Mr Johnson claimed Downing Street’s slow progress in addressing aviation capacity risked ‘economic catastrophe’. Last night he repeated those concerns. ‘I do think there’s a major problem,’ he said. ‘Unless we make sure that we both increase our aviation capacity and close down the third runway at Heathrow option, I think we are heading for a disaster.’","London Mayor arrives at Tory party conference today positioning himself as the champion of hard-pressed working families .

Obama's biggest task tonight in the second presidential debate will be to woo back ‘waitress moms’ so crucial to his re-election, after a poll showed Mitt Romney has stole their votes in the first showdown and they are now neck and neck among women voters. According to a Gallup/USA Today poll of 12 swing states, Romney leads Obama by 12 points among men. But it is his surge among women voters to within one point of Obama that has given him a four-point overall lead that sets him on course to win the White House on November 6th. The poll, released on the eve of the second presidential debate in Hempstead, New York, marks an apparent end to months of double-digit Obama leads over Romney among women and has plunged Democrats into panic mode. Debate prep: President Obama spent the weekend in Williamsburg, Virginia preparing for the debate while Romney based his debate preparations at a Marriott in Boston, Massachusetts . New format: Unlike the first debate, the second meeting will be in a 'town hall' format in which undecided voters will pose questions to the candidates . Unlike the first debate, the second meeting will be in a ‘town hall’ format in which undecided ordinary voters – probably about a dozen – will pose questions. At least half of them are likely to be women. In addition, the debate will be moderated by a woman - CNN’s Candy Crowley. Democrats traditionally enjoy a marked advantage among women. Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election was said to have been based on winning over middle class, aspirational so-called 'soccer moms'. But Obama’s popularity among females has plummeted after Romney’s commanding debate performance in Denver nearly two weeks ago. Vice-President Joe Biden's bullying display over Romney's running mate Paul Ryan also left many women voters feeling alienated. Tied: Mitt Romney is now neck and neck with President Obama among women voters, according to a new Gallup survey . Within an hour of the Gallup survey being released, the Obama campaign – which recently mocked Republicans for questioning poll methodology, went on the offensive against the 75-year-old polling firm. Reporters were sent a memo from Obama pollster Joel Benenson. In it, he said: ‘'The latest Gallup/USA Today Battleground survey showing President Obama and Governor Romney tied with women in battleground states (48-48) is an extreme outlier, defying the trends seen in every other battleground and national poll,' said Benenson. Overall, Romney has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in the 12 battleground states, while Obama is trailing with 46 per cent support, according to the survey. Without winning women, Obama's path to victory in November is complicated, if not impossible. The memo includes a chart of selected surveys from a handful of battleground states that give Obama a 10-point lead over Romney among women nationally.  'This implausible result among women appears to not even provide an accurate reflection on the electorate today, making its value questionable,' Benenson insisted. Women tend to start paying close attention to election campaigns later and are more open to persuasion than men. This makes female voters, particularly the blue-collar ‘waitress moms’ whose families have been hard-hit by the recession and unemployment, the most-prized group of swing voters in 2012. Fighting for women: Female voters, particularly the blue-collar . ‘waitress moms’ whose families have been hard-hit by the recession and . unemployment, are the most-prized group of swing voters in 2012 . Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic . pollster, told ‘USA Today’: ‘In every poll, we've seen a major surge . among women in favourability for Romney’ since the Denver debate. ‘Women . went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out . thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get . something done for them.’ Unlike the first presidential debate, tonight's debate will be in a 'town hall' format, meaning candidates will answer questions from members of an audience, rather than a moderator. There are 80 audience members total, which were selected by Gallup from a sample of undecided voters who live near the debate's location in Hempstead on Long Island. The participants had to submit their questions ahead of time. The debate moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, will decide who to call on during the debate based on her reviews of their submitted questions. The candidates will have two minutes to respond to each question, after which the moderator can ask a follow-up question of her choosing. The candidates will have one minute to respond to the moderator's question. The 'town hall' format is designed to be more relaxed and conversational, with the candidates free to walk around the forum instead of remaining confined behind a podium or a desk. But the format also lends itself to more opportunities for unplanned or candid events, such as the 1992 debate where President Bush was caught on camera checking his watch. She . added that while Obama currently maintains an edge among women voters, . the changed views of Romney could be ‘a precursor to movement’ in . greater numbers towards the Republican nominee. ‘It opens them up to . take a second look, and that's the danger for Obama.' Democrats were scrambling Monday to maintain their historical edge among female voters. Party officials held a conference call in an effort to raise alarm over how a Republican administration would impact women's lives negatively and the . progressive group MoveOn.org released an ad starring three Hollywood . actresses who claimed Republicans would try to end abortion rights for . women. The . Romney campaign, on the other hand, touted the survey's findings as . proof that women are increasingly concerned about the economy instead of . issues like birth control. Republicans said the survey shows women feel . Romney is better equipped than Obama to spur economic growth. Romney's path to winning a greater share of the female voting bloc has been long and arduous. He . trailed the president by 18 percentage points among female voters in a . Gallup survey from April, around the time that Democrats were attacking . Republicans for 'waging a war on women' by supporting legislation that . would limit insurance coverage for contraceptives. That's when Romney's advisers decided to . step up the visibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaign trail to try . and make Romney more relatable as a husband and a father. Wooing women: First Lady Michelle Obama and Romney's wife, Ann, have been helping their husbands appeal to women on the campaign trail . The campaign also organized 'Women for . Romney' grassroots groups in battleground states across the country and . began cutting dozens of television ads that featured clips of Ann . talking about Mr Romney's 'softer' side. The strategy has helped Romney slowly . chip away at Obama's lead among female voters and after the president's . decidedly lackluster debate performance earlier this month, Romney . appears to be finally closing the gender gap. As Romney looks to maintain the progress . he's made among female voters, he's likely to tread lightly on topics . such as abortion and birth control during tonight's debate -- and to . pivot back to the economy whenever possible. Introducing Ann: Romney's advisers decided to step up the . visibility of his wife, Ann, on the campaign trail to try and make . Romney more relatable as a husband and a father . In the lead: Overall, Romney has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in 12 battleground states, while Obama is trailing with 46 per cent support, according to the Gallup survey . High stakes: President Obama's supporters are hoping for a stronger performance from their candidate in Tuesday's debate after his lackluster first performance . President Obama, on the other hand, will be looking for every opportunity to remind female voters of the measures he has enacted while in office that target women, such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He will also be looking for every chance to remind women that that he was raised by a single mom and that he is the father of two daughters.","Mitt Romney is heading into the second presidential debate with a four-point lead over President Obama, according to the latest Gallup survey .

A criminal accused of raping and murdering his girlfriend's five-year-old daughter seven years ago made his first court appearance yesterday. Casey Frederiksen, 33, is charged with first-degree murder and first degree sexual abuse in the 2005 slaying of Floyd, Iowa, girl, Evelyn Miller. During the 10 minute appearance at Floyd District Court, Frederiksen's bond was set at $1 million on each charge but he wouldn't be let loose even if he could come up with the money, because he's currently serving a 14-year sentence on child porn and drug charges. Evelyn was reported missing on July 1, 2005, by her mother Noel Miller. Frederiksen had been caring for the five-year-old, along with the couple's two other children, when she disappeared. The child's body was found five days later on the banks of the nearby Cedar River, but details of the girl's death were never released. In a celebrated breakthrough for a case that had long frustrated relatives and investigators, Frederiksen was last month charged with Evelyn's murder after he made remarks in jail that showed he knew information about her death that investigators had never made public. While incarcerated, Frederiksen would cry and say, 'I'm sorry Evelyn',' one inmate told investigators. Another inmate said that Frederiksen talked about touching the girl's dead body and carrying her to the river. A third said Frederiksen told him he'd molested the girl for years. Frederiksen claimed to police in 2007 that an acquaintance had taken the girl at knifepoint and never brought her back. He later said that he made up that claim, an affidavit says. Accused: Casey Frederiksen, 33, is charged with first-degree murder and first degree sexual abuse in the 2005 slaying of Floyd, Iowa, girl, Evelyn Miller . In prison: Magistrate Ann Troge, left, set Frederiksen's bond at $2 million but he's already in jail for child porn charges . Frederiksen told another inmate the girl was found with her clothes on – a detail not released by investigators. And in 2009, after he was indicted on meth charges, he allegedly told another inmate he could 'get away with murder and still do life.' 'What a glorious afternoon it is,' Floyd County Sheriff Rick Lynch said after the 33-year-old was dealt the charges last month. He thanked Floyd's residents for their patience during the seven-year investigation. Frederiksen has been returned to Iowa from a federal prison in Illinois where he was serving the separate child porn sentence. A preliminary hearing is set for October 26. In yesterday's brief appearance, Frederiksen told magistrate Ann . Troge he was concerned about his personal safety due to jailhouse death . threats, according to Radio Iowa. Frederiksen also raised an objection . to expanded media coverage of his initial appearance but magistrate . Troge overruled the him. Babysitting: Frederiksen had been caring for the five-year-old, along with the couple's two other children, when Evelyn Miller, pictured, disappeared . If convicted, Frederiksen would face life in prison as Iowa does not have the death penalty. Evelyn's mother reported her missing after returning from an overnight shift as a nurse's aide. Kayakers discovered the girl's body days later two miles away on the banks of the river. Investigators had questioned Frederiksen in the death – giving him immunity to testify about drug activities, but he was never charged. A police affidavit filed on September 27 laying out the case against Frederiksen did not mention whether a murder weapon was discovered. An autopsy found Evelyn died of sharp force injuries, including wounds to the neck, and that there was evidence of sexual assault. Those details were never released to the public. The affidavit paints Frederiksen as acting erratically and lying after the girl vanished, being addicted to child pornography involving young girls, and making incriminating statements while in prison. Slip up: Frederiksen, pictured centre, was last month charged with Evelyn's murder after he made remarks in jail that showed he knew information about the her death that investigators had never made public . Life: If convicted, Frederiksen, pictured right, would face life in prison as Iowa does not have the death penalty . It says FBI dogs picked up Frederiksen's scent near where authorities believe the girl entered the river. Frederiksen claimed he last saw Evelyn asleep on a loveseat when he woke up to change a boy's diaper at 2am. But as volunteers were searching for Evelyn in coming days, Frederiksen didn't join them and instead went with a friend on a trip to Des Moines and Waterloo, the affidavit says. The girl's paternal grandparents, Richard and Linda Christie of Waterloo, said the day Frederiksen was charged was the happiest day they've had in seven years and praised investigators for their work. They remembered the girl, who would be 12, as loving to dress in pink, having a beautiful smile, and celebrating Halloween as her favorite holiday. Richard Christie called the arrest a 'bittersweet moment' since Frederiksen had been a friend of their son and they knew him since he was a child, 'so it's a tragedy both ways.' Linda Christie was less diplomatic. 'He has done hideous things. He raped and murdered my granddaughter. I am not in the mood to forgive someone who could do that to an innocent little girl,' she said. 'Justice will be done.'","Casey Frederiksen, 33, is charged with first-degree murder and first degree sexual abuse in the 2005 slaying of Floyd, Iowa, girl, Evelyn Miller .

Since . the video has become viral, Mr Jordan has written a series of posts on . his Facebook page, saying that he’s not an awesome parent, just a . ‘normal guy with a reasonable moral compass that I try very hard to keep . pointed North.’ The incident started when his 15-year-old daughter posted a scathing rant on her Facebook page that complained about the chores she was made to do- like making her bed and emptying the dishwasher. While she hid the rant from her groups . labelled Family and Church, her father saw it when he posted a funny . photo of the family dog on the profile that they have for the animal. On . the Today show, Mr Jordan and his wife Amy said that they were . consciously trying to make a point about how careful their daughter- and . children in general- have to be when they post things online. ‘That's . the point: a lot of what we were trying to make with her in the . beginning was don't post anything on the web that you don't want the . entire world to see and that's one of the reasons why we were upset with . her in the first place,’ Mrs Jordan said. To date, the video of Mr Jordan shooting her laptop has been viewed over 31 million times on YouTube. ‘I think all of this has driven the point home,’ Mrs Jordan continued. Irreparable: He shoots nine bullets into the computer, which he tells Hannah she will have to pay for as well . Crumpled: After reading his daughter's rant bemoaning her chores, Mr Jordan crumpled the paper in his hand . The message in question: Tommy Jordan sat in a wooden chair with his daughter's rant and read it in its entirety . Hannah is still grounded and still does not have a new laptop, but that is all a part of the lesson that her parents were trying to show her. In her original Facebook rant, she complained about how she should get paid for doing her chores and that her parents always want her to get a job. Though they did not address the money issue directly, it seems unlikely that it changed. To prove that he did not act purely out of rage, Mr Jordan surprised Hannah with her hard drive on the morning show. ‘I didn't just go out there and empty an entire clip into my kids laptop, there was a little bit of thought in it,’ he said. While she did not seem over the moon about the fact that she still had all of her data and photos, that was surely part of the lesson too. To my parents, . I'm not your damn slave. It's not my responsibility to clean up your s**t. We have a cleaning lady for a reason. Her name is Linda, not Hannah. If you want coffee, get off your ass and get it yourself. If you want a garden, shovel the fertiliser yourself, don't sit back on your ass and watch me do it. If you walk in the house and get mud all over the floor that I just cleaned, be my guest, but clean it up after you are done getting s**t everywhere. I'm tired of picking up after you. You tell me at least once a day that I need to get a job. You could just pay me for all the s**t that I do around the house. Every day when I get home from school, I have to do dishes, clean the counter tops, all the floors, make all the beds, do the laundry and get the trash. I'm not even going to mention all the work I do around your clinic. And if I don't do all that every day, I get grounded. Do you know how hard it is to keep up with chores and schoolwork? It's freaking crazy. I go to sleep at 10 o'clock every night because I am too tired to stay up any longer and do anything else. I have to get up at five in the morning, to get ready for school. On the weekends, I have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother won't come get me up at six. I'm tired of this bulls**t. Next time I have to pour a cup of coffee, I'm going to flip s**t. I have no idea how I have a life. I'm going to hate to see the day when you get too old to wipe your ass and you call me, asking for help. I won't be there. Signed, Your Pissed Kid, Hannah .

A teenager who died in a car accident may have crashed because she was concentrating too hard on her new satnav, an inquest was told yesterday. Laura-Louise Salford, 17, was using the TomTom device for the first time on a trip to the seaside with friends. It gave no warning of a crossroads and – believing she had the right of way – she drove straight on without slowing down. Killed: Laura-Louise Salford had passed her driving test a month before she died in May this year . A van smashed into the side of her car, killing her instantly. Laura-Louise was driving a Toyota . Aygo that her parents had bought her after  she had passed her driving . test at the first attempt a few weeks earlier. On the day of the crash – May 31 – . she told them she was going to take two friends to a swimming pool near . her home in Rotherham. Instead the trio went on a 60-mile trip to Hull . and on to the resort of Bridlington. On the way home the satnav did not indicate that the minor road she was on was about to cross a main road. Glen Simpson, who was driving the van . that hit her on the crossroads, told the inquest: ‘Out of the corner of . my eye I saw something black. There was nowhere I could go, I collided . straight into the  side of the car.’ Driving conditions were good and there was no evidence either vehicle was breaking the speed limit. Scene: The crossroads where Laura-Louise's Toyota was hit by a van, killing her and injuring her two friends . Ian Clark, an accident investigator, . followed the route taken by Laura-Louise using the same satnav and . concluded the student’s over-reliance on the device may have been a . factor. ‘The road signs are there,’ he said. ‘They are clearly visible. Why they weren’t seen or observed is not . possible to comment on. ‘The satnav system they were using is . telling you the next place where you are required to make an adjustment . is a quarter of a mile further on.

Anna said . Laura-Louise was a careful driver. She told how she was knocked out in . the crash, adding: ‘I remember waking up and seeing Laura’s face.

Scientists have discovered a huge black hole lurking near the centre of our own galaxy thanks to a rare phenomenon which broadcast its presence with a torrent of high-energy X-rays. Nasa's Swift satellite detected the rising surge of X-rays, produced by a rare X-ray nova, last month and say it is evidence of a black hole that is part of a binary system near the Milky Way's core. 'Bright X-ray novae are so rare that they're essentially once-a-mission events and this is the first one Swift has seen,' said Neil Gehrels, the mission's principal investigator. 'This is really something we've been waiting for.' Scroll down for video . Newly discovered black hole: Swift J1745-26 with labels and scale of moon as it would appear in the field of view from Earth. This image is from September 18, 2012 when the source peaked in hard X-rays . An X-ray nova is a short-lived X-ray source that appears suddenly, reaches its emission peak in a few days and then fades out over a period of months. The outburst arises when a torrent of stored gas suddenly rushes toward one an incredibly dense and compact object, either a neutron star or a black hole. The rapidly brightening source triggered Swift's Burst Alert Telescope twice on the morning of September 16, and once again the next day. Named Swift J1745-26 after the coordinates of its sky position, the nova is located a few degrees from the centre of our galaxy toward the constellation Sagittarius. While astronomers do not know its precise distance, they think the object resides about 20,000 to 30,000 light-years away in the galaxy's inner region. A black hole is a region of space-time where gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called 'black' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater. Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies. Ground-based observatories detected infrared and radio emissions, but thick clouds of obscuring dust have prevented astronomers from catching Swift J1745-26 in visible light. The nova peaked in hard X-rays - energies above 10,000 electron volts, or several thousand times that of visible light - on September 18, when it reached an intensity equivalent to that of the famous Crab Nebula . That nebula is a supernova remnant that serves as a calibration target for high-energy observatories and is considered one of the brightest sources beyond the solar system at these energies. Even as it dimmed at higher energies, the nova brightened in the lower-energy, or softer, emissions detected by Swift's X-ray Telescope, a behavior typical of X-ray novae. By Wednesday, Swift J1745-26 was 30 times brighter in soft X-rays than when it was discovered and it continued to brighten. 'The pattern we're seeing is observed in X-ray novae where the central object is a black hole. Once the X-rays fade away, we hope to measure its mass and confirm its black hole status,' said Boris Sbarufatti, an astrophysicist at Brera Observatory in Milan, who currently is working with other Swift team members at Penn state. The black hole must be a member of a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system, which includes a normal, sun-like star. A stream of gas flows from the normal star and enters into a storage disk around the black hole. In most LMXBs, the gas in the disk spirals inward, heats up as it heads toward the black hole, and produces a steady stream of X-rays. But under certain conditions, stable flow within the disk depends on the rate of matter flowing into it from the companion star. At certain rates, the disk fails to maintain a steady internal flow and instead flips between two dramatically different conditions - a cooler, less ionized state where gas simply collects in the outer portion of the disk like water behind a dam, and a hotter, more ionized state that sends a tidal wave of gas surging toward the centre. 'Each outburst clears out the inner disk, and with little or no matter falling toward the black hole, the system ceases to be a bright source of X-rays,' said John Cannizzo, a Goddard astrophysicist. 'Decades later, after enough gas has accumulated in the outer disk, it switches again to its hot state and sends a deluge of gas toward the black hole, resulting in a new X-ray outburst.' This phenomenon, called the thermal-viscous limit cycle, helps astronomers explain transient outbursts across a wide range of systems, from protoplanetary disks around young stars, to dwarf novae - where the central object is a white dwarf star - and even bright emission from supermassive black holes in the hearts of distant galaxies.","Black hole was discovered by Nasa's Swift satellite last month .

A doctor groped the bottoms of two teenage girls at a firework display on bonfire night last year, a court heard. Anaesthetist Niaz Ahmed is said to have targeted the youngsters while he was working at a medical tent at the event, telling them ‘If you are looking for sex you have come to the right person’. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 53-year-old had also boasted about the size of his penis, made thrusting motions with his pelvis and asked them to strip for him online. Claims: Anaesthetist Niaz Ahmed is accused of groping two teenagers at a fireworks display last year . It is claimed Ahmed told the girls and their friends his sex life with his wife was poor and that he was able to satisfy a woman. Prosecutors claim the doctor went on to simulate sex and rub himself against one girl, who was 16, and touch the upper legs of a 15-year-old. Ahmed, of Cleadon, denies one charge of sexual assault and one of sexual activity with a child. Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court: 'This occurred on November 5 2011 at a fireworks display in South Shields. 'The two girls were there with their friends and the defendant was there associated with the safety tent, wearing a high-visibility jacket.' The court heard the girls initially spoke to Ahmed because one of them thought she recognised him through his hospital role. Mr Hodson added: 'They admitted they had entered into banter but the conversation got out of hand. 'They said the man had said despite his age he was very good sexually and could satisfy a woman as he had a large penis. 'He made thrusting movements with his pelvis.' 'Abuse': Ahmed bragged about the size of his penis and prowess in the bedroom, Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard . Ahmed agrees he had been involved in the 'banter' with the girls and their friends and said despite feeling uncomfortable decided to go along with their conversation, even after it was turned sexual by them. He claims he was told the girls were older than their true age. Mr Hodson said: 'The defendant said he was entering into the spirit of things and matching them as they bantered along, encouraged to do this by the other  people present. 'The crown will ask you whether a doctor did indeed participate in the banter and then try and push things too far.' Ahmed denies the charges in a defence statement submitted to the court but Mr Hodson said the document 'raises some difficult questions' as the doctor admits he 'very briefly' touched both girls’ bottoms with playing along with the banter. Mr Hodson added: 'It was the complainants, the defendant says, and others who made sexual remarks, not him, and the whole group was revelling in his uncomfortable state. 'Mr Ahmed said he was uncomfortable and did not know how to react to this situation and he decided to play along with he joke and very briefly touched each girl on the bottom.' The trial continues.

A devastated mother committed suicide after her three children, husband and subsequent partner all died in separate tragedies. Patricia Gibbs, 67, felt 'so alone' when her son James Ellis, 33, was killed when his Yamaha motorbike collided with a van near Summercourt, Cornwall in June last year. He was the last of her three children after the deaths of her daughters Tracy Jane in 1987 and Catherine Mary in 1995 an inquest in Truro, Cornwall heard this week. 'So alone': Patricia Gibbs committed suicide in April after her son James Ellis (in picture frame) died in a motorbike accident following the deaths of her two daughters, first husband and subsequent partner . After James’ death she said: ‘You don’t expect to lose your children before yourself and it never gets any easier. ‘James was my only one and now he’s gone. ‘I just feel so alone. I would happily have given up my life to spare him.’ Mrs Gibbs’ first husband died in a boating accident and her subsequent partner suffered a heart attack. Mrs Gibbs’ husband of eight years Leslie Gibbs found her dead at her cottage in Bugle, Cornwall in April this year, the coroner heard. The 59-year-old engineer told the coroner that although she was ‘usually quite bubbly,’ he believed the death of her son was ‘a tipping point’. Afterwards he said: ‘Her hobby was her family. 'She was a lovely person. I couldn’t have wished for any better.’ DC Steve White said: ‘For one person to experience so much tragedy in a lifetime is quite unusual and very sad.’ Tipping point: The inquest heard that Mrs Gibbs' family was her hobby and that James (pictured) was 'her only one' The inquest heard Mrs Gibbs had drunk some cider and gin, which was unusual for her, before taking her own life in a bedroom which contained her mother’s possessions and a photo of her son James. Her husband returned home from work to find a note from his wife on the kitchen table and their dog Buster locked in the utility room. The note said life was getting too difficult since the death of her children and she missed them. The inquest heard she suffered from depression and panic attacks after their deaths. Mrs Gibbs was also frustrated that she had to wait so long for an inquest into James’ death. She said last August: ‘I feel like I am going mad wanting to explode with all the waiting. I just want to know what happened that day. ‘I won’t be able to move on until I know. For now I am trying to go back and think of the happy times we had together. ‘I can’t believe we are never going to meet again and he’s not going to come up that path smiling with that motorbike helmet under his arm. ‘James always said “don’t worry mum I’ll always be here to look after you” but I guess that’s not to be.’ Her grandson Luke Hawken’s wife Gemma wrote: ‘When Luke’s mother died, Pat looked after him as her own. ‘She was really not that happy. Many sad things had happened in her lifetime.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Patricia Gibbs was shattered when her son died last year .

"By . Liz Hull . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 30 November 2011 . They had two children in private education, owned homes worth more than £500,000 and enjoyed running around in luxury cars. Friends could have been forgiven for thinking sisters Andrea and Roberta Vaughan-Owens had won the lottery. In reality, however, their lavish lifestyle was funded by conning taxpayers out of £130,000 in benefits and tax credits. Guilty: Roberta Vaughan-Owen, left, and her sister Andrea have both been given three and a half years for their part in an attempted £161m VAT fraud . On top of this they managed to trick insurance firms into paying their mortgages by claiming on employment protection policies – despite having no jobs. The scams were going swimmingly until the authorities smelt a rat and began to investigate. But instead of lying low, the sisters dreamt up an even more audacious fraud – to try to get their hands on an astonishing £161million by claiming back VAT on a fictitious advertising deal with Liverpool Football Club. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, that’s where they came unstuck. Yesterday the sisters were both given three and a half year jail terms after being found guilty of fraud. Judge Niclas Parry, sitting at Caernarfon Crown Court, attacked the ‘lax manner’ in which insurance companies, banks and ‘above all Government departments permitted such blatant fraud’. He said: ‘It’s no wonder this country is financially on its knees.’ In court, the pair were described as more ‘Laurel and Hardy than Bonnie and Clyde’. A jury was told they had a modest upbringing but soon acquired a taste for the high life. Their fraud began in 2003 when the sisters started taking advantage of the ‘inept’ tax administration system. Between April 2003 and July 2008 they conned the taxpayer out of £120,000 in tax credits by pretending to work 16 hours a week for their own recruitment firm, when, in reality, they did nothing. Lavish: The sisters lived in this £400,000 detached property in Colwyn Bay and also have a second home worth £137,000 in nearby Caernarfon . Administrators took their claims at face value, but, had they checked, would have discovered the pair were telling another Government department they were too ill to work in order to claim another £10,000 in incapacity benefit. The sisters used the cash to pay for two of Andrea’s children to attend a private school in North Wales. They lived in a £400,000 detached property in Colwyn Bay, owned a second home worth £137,000 in nearby Caernarfon, enjoyed expensive spa treatments at an upmarket hotel, and drove around in luxury cars. When authorities started investigating the tax credits scam in 2006, the sisters worked out another way to live rent free. Despite being unemployed, Andrea managed to get a mortgage on the Colwyn Bay property by telling the bank she was a self-employed recruitment boss earning £120,000 a year. She then took out insurance cover, ensuring the mortgage would be paid if she lost her ‘job’. Insurance firms handed over £30,808 in mortgage payments before the con was uncovered in the summer of 2007. And that’s when the sisters came up with their VAT con. The pair thought that if they could secure invoices for multi-million pound properties and expensive cars, they could then claim back VAT as start up costs for two new businesses. They inquired about purchasing several stately homes as well as a dozen Land Rovers and a £325,000 Rolls Royce Phantom. However, when no one would provide them with invoices and banks and car dealerships refused them credit they submitted an application for a VAT rebate on a fictitious £920million deal to advertise their recruitment firm at Liverpool FC. The rebate was for £161million. The demand set alarm bells ringing at the tax office and officials began to investigate. Both women said the claim had been a mistake because they did not understand the forms. But a jury rejected their version of events. Andrea, 42, was found guilty of eight counts of fraud, while Roberta, 37, a former police civilian worker, was convicted of five charges.","Tried to claim back tax on fictitious advertising scheme with Liverpool FC .

"By . Ian Fletcher . UPDATED: . 06:07 EST, 22 January 2012 . Weaker beer: AB InBev are dropping the alcohol volume in their popular lagers to combat the cost of duty . Lager drinkers are in for a shock after brewing giant AB InBev decided to cut the alcohol volume in Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's, according to The Grocer. The shake-up of the three top brands should save millions of pounds that will offset duty hikes and cost increases, the trade magazine says. The world's largest brewer is cutting the alcohol volume of the popular beers from 5per cent to 4.8per cent. The company, which unveiled price hikes across its drinks portfolio last year, will shift the beers to the lower abv at the end of this month. The Grocer said yesterday that the brewer would not give reasons for the reduction but confirmed that only beer sold in the UK was affected. An AB InBev spokeswoman told the magazine: 'Our decision to bring Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's to the UK market at 4.8per cent abv during 2012 is in line with evolving UK category trends.' Last October, AB InBev said that rising raw material and energy costs would force it to pass on a 7.8 per cent price increase across all its brands from 2 January - a strategy being pursued by other brewers. But industry insiders say that some retailers had rejected demands for price increases and producers were cutting abv to offset costs, retain price points and shore up profitability. One industry source told The Grocer: 'Some of the major multiples have denied price increases for three years and the brewers' answer is to shift into smaller bottles and move from 5per cent to 4.8per cent.' Hannah Stoddell from The Grocer said most Stella drinkers wouldn't bat an eyelid as long as the taste doesn't change . Cutting Stella Artois' abv by 0.2per cent would save AB InBev an estimated £8.6million a year in duty based on its off-trade sales alone according to market researchers Nielsen. But Tim Wilson, managing director of market analysts Wilson Drinks Report, said that it would need to persuade big customers that there was something in it for them too, with money being invested back into the brand. Hannah Stodell, senior reporter of The Grocer said: 'Let's be clear. This is not about Stella's 'wifebeater' tag. With brewers struggling with duty hikes and cost increases, something had to give. 'For AB InBev, the decision to cut the strength of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's is certainly timely - coming in the week the All-Party Parliamentatry Beer Group raised a glass to lower-alcohol beers and their contribution to responsible drinking. 'But while AB InBev points to 'evolving trends' towards lower-strength beer, the £8.6 million off-trade annual saving on Stella alone is a nudge in its own right for new boss Inge Plochaet, particularly in light of the £11.6 million decline in Stella sales last year. 'The reduction might put a few punters off but the majority probably won't bat an eyelid as long as the 4.8per cent brews deliver on taste.'","Largest brewer to cut Stella Artois, Budweiser and Becks alcohol volume from 5% to 4.8% .

"Alyssa Bustamante was 15 when she killed Elizabeth Olten in 2009 . Sentenced to life in prison with possibility of parole today . Grandmother of victim shouted in court: 'I think Alyssa should get out of jail the same day Elizabeth gets out of the grave' By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 8 February 2012 . Jailed for life: Alyssa Bustamante, 18, was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole today . The Missouri teenager who confessed to strangling, cutting and stabbing a nine-year-old girl because she wanted to know how it felt to kill someone was sentenced today to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Alyssa Bustamante, 18, pleaded guilty in January to second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the October 2009 slaying of Elizabeth Olten in St Martins, a small rural town west of Jefferson City. Bustamante had been charged with first-degree murder and by pleading guilty to the lesser charges she avoided a trial and the possibility of spending her life in an adult prison with no chance of release. Bustamante was 15 years old when she confessed to strangling Elizabeth, repeatedly stabbing her in the chest and slicing the girl's throat. She led police to the shallow grave where she had concealed Elizabeth's body under a blanket of leaves in the woods behind their neighborhood. Prior to receiving her life sentence, Bustamante said to the family of her victim: 'If I could give my life to bring her back, I would. I just want to say I'm sorry for what happened. I'm so sorry.' Elizabeth's family members wept as Alyssa made her statement prior to the sentence handed down by Cole County Presiding Judge Patricia Joyce. The teenager's defense attorneys had argued for a sentence less than life in prison, saying Bustamante's use of the antidepressant Prozac had made her more prone to violence. They said she had suffered from depression for years and once attempted suicide by overdosing on painkillers. But prosecutors sought a longer sentence, describing the 18-year-old as a thrill killer who lacked remorse. They noted that Bustamante had dug two graves several days in advance, and that on the evening of the killing had sent her younger sister to lure Elizabeth outside with an invitation to play. Alyssa Bustamante (left), then 15, told . authorities she had strangled, stabbed and buried her nine-year-old . neighbor Elizabeth Olten (right) because she wanted to know what it felt . like to kill . Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt . David Rice testified that the teenager told him 'she wanted to know what . it felt like' to kill someone. The trial's conclusion follows days of testimony in a small courtroom in Missouri's capital city. Proceedings . descended into chaos yesterday as prosecutor Mark Richardson made an . impassioned request for a lifelong sentence for Bustamante. - Prosecutor Mark Richardson . Her . grandmother and grandfather stormed out of the courtroom, prompting . Bustamante — who had been staring blankly downward as Richardson . recounted her crime — to begin silently crying for the first time in her . court proceedings that have spanned more than two years. Then . as Cole County Circuit Judge Pat Joyce announced that she would reveal . her sentence on Wednesday, Elizabeth's grandmother interrupted and cried . out from her wheelchair. 'I . think Alyssa should get out of jail the same day Elizabeth gets out of . the grave!' declared the grandmother, whom a prosecutor later identified . as Sandy Corn. The . disorder capped an emotional, two-day sentencing hearing highlighted by . repeated references to words Bustamante had written in her diary on the . night she strangled, slit the throat and repeatedly stabbed Elizabeth. Bustamante, . then 15, wrote that it was an 'ahmazing' and 'pretty enjoyable' experience, ending the entry by saying: 'I gotta go to church . now...lol.' 'The motive . has to be the most senseless, reprehensible that could be in humankind, . and that is to take a life for a thrill,' Richardson said. Bustamante's . attorney, Donald Catlett, cited the testimony on Tuesday of mental . health professionals who described Bustamante as a 'psychologically . damaged' and 'severely emotionally disturbed' child. They . recounted her family's history with drug abuse, mental disorders and . suicide attempts, noting her father was in prison and her mother had . abandoned her. Her mother was in the courtroom on Tuesday for the first . time. Various mental . health professionals testified over the course of the two-day hearing . that Bustamante suffers from major depression and displays the features . of a borderline personality disorder. Morbid fascination: Bustamante previously attempted . suicide and was a cutter. Defense attorneys highlighted her troubled childhood as part of their argument about why she . should receive leniency . Some also said she shows early signs of a bipolar disorder. Bustamante . began taking the antidepressant drug Prozac after a suicide attempt on . Labor Day 2007 at the start of her eighth grade year. Her . dosage of the medication had been increased just two weeks before she . murdered Elizabeth. Bustamante's attorneys presented evidence from a . psychiatrist who testified that Prozac could have been a 'major . contributing factor' in the slaying — a theory rejected by a prosecution . psychiatrist who insisted there was no scientific evidence of Prozac . causing homicides, or even increasing aggression. Each . time defense attorneys elicited testimony about Bustamante's troubled . childhood, prosecutors countered by asking the mental health experts to . describe what Bustamante had told them about the murder. Those . mental health officials testified that Bustamante told them she dug a . grave several days in advance of the killing, then used her younger . sister to lure Elizabeth outside with an invitation to play. Bustamante . led Elizabeth into the woods by telling her she had a surprise for her. Bustamante . sliced Elizabeth's throat — as the child apparently tried to resist — . with a knife that had been hidden in a backpack. Bustamante also . strangled Elizabeth to the point of unconsciousness, then repeatedly . stabbed Elizabeth in the chest. She was buried in a shallow grave. On Monday, a handwriting expert . described how he was able to see through the blue ink that Bustamante . had used in an attempt to cover up her original journal entry on the . night of Elizabeth's murder. He then read the entry aloud in court: . 'I just f***ing killed someone. I strangled them and slit their throat . and stabbed them now they're dead. I don't know how to feel atm [at the . moment]. It was ahmazing. As soon as you get over the ""ohmygawd I can't . do this"" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable. I'm kinda nervous and shaky . though right now. Kay, I gotta go to church now...lol.' The . journal entry was presented to the judge not long after Elizabeth's . mother and other relatives pleaded with Cole County Circuit Judge Pat . Joyce to impose the maximum sentence. Elizabeth's . mother, Patty Preiss, described her daughter as 'happy, little girl,' when she left her home about 5pm after begging to go play with . Bustamante's younger sister. Life behind bars: Eighteen-year-old Alyssa Bustamante is escorted out of the Cole County Courthouse today as she is handed down a life sentence . Preiss said she told Elizabeth to be back for dinner at 6pm but never saw her again. 'So much has been lost at the hands of this evil monster,' Preiss tearfully said, with Bustamante sitting several feet away. 'Elizabeth was given a death sentence and we were given a life sentence.' With Bustamante looking at her, Preiss said: 'I hate her, I hate everything about her.' The judge cut off her testimony when she described Bustamante as 'not even human.' FBI agents seized the journal from Bustamante's bedroom during a search of her family's home the day after Elizabeth went missing as hundreds of volunteers scoured the rural area around St. Martin's. 'I hate her, I hate everything about her... [She's] not even human.' -Victim's mother Patty Preiss . Bustamante suggested to FBI and the Missouri State Highway Patrol officials that the girl had probably been kidnapped and that whoever had done so deserved to be convicted. At one point, law enforcement officers discovered a hole in the ground in the shape of a shallow grave near Bustamante's home. They testified that Bustamante acknowledged digging it but said she just liked to dig holes. It was only later that Elizabeth's body was found concealed under leaves in another grave in the woods behind the Bustamante home. The victim's mother called the teen, seen here in 2009, 'less than human' at the sentencing hearing . At one point Bustamante had written that she intended to burn down a house and kill all the occupants, but she never followed through with that. On October 14, one week before Elizabeth's slaying, Bustamante had written that she was unable to use her cell phone because the charger had died, which meant she couldn't talk to anyone about the depression and rage she was feeling. 'If I don't talk about it, I bottle it up, and when I explode someone's going to die,' she wrote in a journal that was read to the court by her defense attorney, Charlie Moreland. Prosecutors said Bustamante plotted Elizabeth's death, even digging two holes to be used as graves, then attended school for about a week while waiting for the right time to kill. Hundreds of volunteers searched for two days for Elizabeth before her body was found. Juvenile . justice officials testified at an earlier hearing that Bustamante had attempted to commit . suicide in 2007 and had been receiving mental health treatment for . depression and cutting herself. On a now-defunct YouTube page in her name, one of Bustamante's hobbies were listed as 'killing people'. A few weeks before the murder she tweeted: 'This is all I want in life; a reason for all this pain.'","Alyssa Bustamante was 15 when she killed Elizabeth Olten in 2009 .

"By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 14:32 EST, 14 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:39 EST, 15 March 2012 . The last horrifying moments of an eight-year-old girl's life were revealed in graphic detail today by a woman who has admitted bludgeoning her to death with a hammer. Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was abducted from outside her school in Woodstock, Ontario, on April 8, 2009. Her body was found 103 days later stashed in garbage bags and buried under a pile of rocks. Terry-Lynne McClintic took to the stand for the second day at London, Ontario's crown court for the murder trial of her ex-boyfriend and alleged orchestrator of the abduction and brutal murder. She broke down as she revealed the little girl begged for help moments before she was killed. Disturbing case: Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was only eight-years-old when she was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by a couple who were high on drugs . Michael Rafferty, 31, is accused in the first-degree murder, sexual assault and abduction of Tori. He pleads not guilty. McClintic had already plead guilty to a first-degree murder charge and is serving life in prison. Since the trial started on March 5, the court has heard that the school girl was pummeled with a hammer, sexually assaulted, slain and buried like an animal. Her body was found naked from the waist down and she had blunt injuries to her body that lacerated her liver and fractured her ribs — injuries that could have been fatal on their own. From the ploy she used to lure the girl away from school, to the conversations they had when she promised she wouldn't let Rafferty rape her again, to the rage she said overtook her and led her to beat Tori to death with a hammer, McClintic spared no detail in her gut-wrenching testimony. Trial: Michael Rafferty, 31, has pleaded not guilty to murder, sexual assault and abduction . As Tori's devastated parents listened, the 21-year-old described how she and Rafferty singled out the little girl because she was on her own - the first day she was allowed to walk back from school alone - and lured her to the car by saying they had a schitzu puppy. McClintic was high on Oxycontin, as she was most days, and had also smoked marijuana. The drug-addicted couple made three stops, she said, to pick up Percocet, a highly-addictive narcotic pain killer, coffee and a hammer and garbage bags before arriving at the remote area chosen to kill the innocent school girl. McClintic said she 'knew what was about to happen', so walked away from the car. When pressed as to what that was, she replied: 'I believed he was going to rape her.' After Rafferty sexually assaulted Tori the first time in the front seat of his Honda Civic, during which time she could hear screams and cries for help, he called McClintic to take her to the toilet, she told the court. The 21-year-old recalled Tori was bleeding and crying and pleaded with her: 'Just don't let him do it to me again.' 'I told her I was sorry and that she was a very strong girl. And she said ""Like you?"" And I told her she was much stronger', she testified. The convicted child killer then took Tori back to Rafferty, so he could commit the senseless, depraved act again. At this point in her testimony, Tori's parents Tara McDonald and Rodney Stafford broke down in tears. Rafferty's former girlfriend told the packed courtroom that as they were walking back to the car, Tori wouldn't let go of her hand. All she was wearing was her favourite Hannah Montana T-shirt. Testimony: Terri-Lynne McClintic, then 18, pleaded guilty to the murder of Victoria Stafford and is the key witness in the murder trial of Michael Rafferty, her ex-boyfriend and co-accused . Court sketch: Terri-Lynne McClintic took to the stand for the second time today as she recounted the horrific details of Victoria Stafford's murder at the hands of her and Michael Rafferty . 'She asked me to stay with her. I tried to hold on to her hand but I . couldn’t stay because I knew what was going to happen,' said the former drug addict. 'I couldn’t be there for that. I left.' As she described what happened next, McClintic broke down. She said she was overcome by an anger and rage that seemed to engulf her as she stood in the distance trying to block out the sounds of the assault. It brought back painful memories of past abuse. Of what she didn't elaborate. 'I kept having flashbacks. Sometimes it was like I wasn’t even there,' she said. 'I realized I needed to do something so I turned back to the vehicle and . . . when I saw what was going on, all I saw was myself when I was that age and all the anger and hate and rage that I’d had and blame that I still feel towards myself came boiling up out of me.' She walked back to the car, put a garbage bag over Tori's head and started to kick her. She then struck her repeatedly with both sides of the hammer on the head, she told the court. Happy child: Victoria Stafford loved Hannah Montana and was looking forward to going home that day so she could play in her newly decorated room and watch High School Musical . Parents: Rodney Stafford, father of slain Victoria Stafford walks into court for proceedings in the Michael Rafferty trial today, and mother Tara McDonald arrived at court yesterday, right . Mother: Tara McDonald's addiction to Oxycontin was highlighted during her testimony. She encountered Terry-Lynne McClintic twice before she abducted her daughter when she bought drugs from her . 'I went back to the vehicle and I savagely murdered that little girl,' she said to a stunned and horrified courtroom. They both buried the body, she recounted, before washing themselves and the car so no evidence could be found. The pair had been dating just over a month when they carried out the gruesome crime. McClintic said it was Rafferty's idea and said they would be like Bonnie and Clyde. Last week, the court heard that before she snatched Tori, McClintic went to an employment centre, filling out various forms but citing anger issues and a Grade 9 education as impediments to finding a job. Before that she had smoked marijuana, got a food voucher from church, bought groceries and shot up some Oxycontin. It was then that Rafferty showed up at her house unexpectedly. The surveillance video showing Tori walking away from school with a woman in a white puffy coat was released soon after her abduction. When Victoria Stafford was abducted, it was the first day she had been allowed to walk home from school on her own and it was for that reason she was singled out by Terry-Lynne McClintic and Michael Rafferty . Police received a tip from Tori's mother, Tara McDonald, who said she heard from a friend that it looked like McClintic. McDonald has testified she crossed paths with McClintic twice previously when she and her boyfriend bought Oxycontin illegally from her home. Ms McDonald's addiction to the painkiller has also been flagged up by prosecutors. A check turned up a warrant for McClintic's arrest on a parole violation, breach of custody and supervision. Police arrested her April 12, 2009, and she confessed to Tori's murder on May 19. She said today the whole thing was her ex-lover's idea. She recalled Rafferty urging her to kidnap a 'young female, because the younger they were the easier they were to manipulate'. As they drove past Oliver Stephens Elementary school on that fateful day, Rafferty dared her to prove she wasn't 'all talk'. Through tears, McClintic testified: 'He said it would be easy. ""They're getting out of school now. All you have to do is talk about dogs or candy or something like that"".' He had previously asked her if she thought it would be weird if he wanted to kidnap somebody. They couple had only met a month before and had sex in his car the first night they met. McClintic told the court she went along with whatever he said as she 'badly wanted to meet a good man'. The trial continues.","Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was abducted from outside her Ontario school on April 8, 2009 .

Danielle Reeves, 24, from Caterham, Surrey accepted she consumed some wine but said she 'wasn't drunk' A woman has admitted letting a toddler drown in a bath by leaving him alone while she had a 45-minute drink with a friend. Danielle Reeves, 24, had been looking after the one-year-old boy at a house in Surrey. She admitted a charge of manslaughter after dramatically changing her plea when she appeared before a judge at Guildford Crown Court. Her voice trembled as she stated 'guilty' after her barrister had asked for the charge to be put to her again. The judge ordered reports to be compiled on Reeves by the Probation Service and a psychiatrist before he sentences her later this summer. Emergency services were called to a house in September last year after the boy was found lifeless in the water. Police arrested the defendant amid suspicions she had been drinking at the time. She initially denied the allegations against her but admitted she was to blame when she appeared in the dock. Judge Christopher Critchlow was briefly told that Reeves was making her admission on the basis that she had left the youngster for around three-quarters of an hour and had been talking to a neighbour and that the boy was just out of sight. She also accepted she consumed some wine but 'wasn’t drunk.' The guilt was on the basis of 'gross negligence,' the court was told. Aisling Byrnes, defending, asked for . sentencing to be adjourned and urged Judge Critchlow to release her . client on bail again in the meantime. Trial: She initially denied the allegations against her but admitted she was to blame when she appeared in the dock at Guildford Crown Court . 'She has attended court today in full knowledge that she was going to enter a plea to this serious charge,' she said. 'She’s aware that a sentence for a case such as this is likely to be a sentence of immediate imprisonment.' She added that her client’s appointments with probationers and psychiatrists would be much easier to carry out on bail rather than in prison. Judge Critchlow agreed to postpone the sentencing and told the defence and prosecuting counsel, Ruby Selva, that he would deal with the matter on July 30. He re-admitted Reeves, of Stirling Drive, Caterham, Surrey, to bail on the same conditions as previously - a night time curfew, electronic tagging and that she does not go within 400 metres of a specific address in Redhill, Surrey or contact or attempt to contact prosecution witnesses. He added a further requirement, that she comply with the Probation Service in preparing the report.","Danielle Reeves from Caterham, Surrey accepted she consumed some wine but 'wasn’t drunk'

The parents of a young woman who died of breast cancer aged 21 are carrying on their daughter’s message that the disease can strike at any age. Sophie Cutts, from Skelton, Cleveland, lost her nine-month battle with breast cancer on September 14. Initially doctors reassured her family that she was ‘too young’ for breast cancer, but was later diagnosed with the disease and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy treatment and had lymph nodes removed. 'Special to so many people': Sophie Cutts died from breast cancer aged 21 after doctors reassured her family that she was 'too young' for breast cancer . Before her death, Sophie became an ambassador for a cancer charity warning others that the disease could develop at any time. Now her family are fulfilling her final wish by raising awareness of the disease among young people. Sophie . was looking forward to a career as a traditional screen printer after . showing exceptional talent as a textiles design student at Heriot-Watt . University in Galashiels. She . was chosen as a poster girl for the Cleveland College of Art and Design . following her successful training there and she was also planning a . idyllic life in the country with devoted partner Paul Thompson, 24. Sophie’s . mum Tracy 48, said despite the tragic diagnosis, her daughter had 'no . regrets' and felt lucky to have enjoyed the time she had with her . beloved family, including dad Craig, 49, brother Jake, 17, and Paul. Talented student: Sophie was chosen as a poster girl for the Cleveland College of Art and Design following her successful training there . She also thanked her parents 'for . everything they had done for her' in the final hours before she slipped . peacefully away in hospital. Her mum and dad said they feel 'proud' to have had her in their lives. And they are determined her legacy will live on - by warning others that breast cancer can strike at any age. Tracy . said: 'Sophie is so special to so many people. Everyone was looking . forward to seeing her go on and make a success of her life. 'People . who met her felt as if they’d known her all their lives and would say . what an amazing person she was. She was definitely unique. 'We . think she was on course for a first class degree and from January, she . had to work from home as well, which is all the more remarkable. 'Her grades didn’t suffer. She is the organiser of the family. We will be lost without her.' Getting the message across: Sophie, pictured with boyfriend Paul Thompson, became an ambassador for a cancer charity before her death to warn others the disease could develop at any time . Spreading the word: Sophie's family including (l-r) her brother Jacob, father Craig, mother Tracy and boyfriend Paul Thompson now want fulfil her final wish by raising awareness of the disease among young people . After finding a lump in her breast in January, Sophie had tests and mastitis, inflammation of the breast tissue, was ruled out. Craig . and Tracy, who herself is in partial remission from non Hodgkins . Lymphoma, praised GPs for quickly referring Sophie to hospital - even as . they tried to reassure them she was 'too young' to have breast cancer. Sophie was quickly diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and the removal of lymph nodes. Following treatment, Sophie’s tests came back all clear, leading the family to believe her ordeal was over. Days before her mastectomy, Sophie completed the Race For Life at Ormesby Hall, raising almost £400. The same day, she began planning a charity walk in Peru next year. When . she lost her hair and visited the Holistic Cancer Care Centre at James . Cook University Hospital, she also vowed to use her creative talents to . print bespoke scarves to sell and raise funds to help other sufferers. She . also was passionate to warn other young people about the disease and . visited her old school Huntcliff, in Saltburn - and others - to warn . teenage girls to be vigilant against breast cancer. Devoted: Sophie was planning an idyllic life in the country with 24-year-old Paul . Sadly, however, in July, Sophie suffered a fit and doctors found she had a secondary cancer on her brain. A month before she passed away, the family also learned the cancer had spread to her liver. Tracy, . a special needs teaching and learning assistant, said: 'She got . contacted by the charity CoppaFeel, started by a girl who was . misdiagnosed for six to eight months. 'They . asked if she would be an ambassador and go to schools when she was . stronger and say to young girls, ‘don’t let someone tell you you’re too . young’. She really wanted to do it, but was too ill. Craig, a chartered mechanical engineer, added: 'It showed how much she meant to such a lot of people at her funeral. Emmanuel Church, in Saltburn is quite big but it was absolutely jam-packed.' 'That’s what everyone has said about . Sophie. ‘But you’re too young, you shouldn’t have this’. Now, the . medical profession has got to say you don’t just get cancer in your . thirties, forties, fifties and sixties; you can get cancer any time'. Tracy . said birthdays and Christmases will not be the same without Sophie’s . parties and use of her creative talents to make bespoke gifts - . something Tracy says she did with genuine 'love and affection for . people'. Sophie loved to travel and most recently enjoyed trips to Paris and Berlin. A . poem was read out at her funeral which said: 'Don’t think of her as . gone away, her journey has just begun. Life holds many faces, the earth . is only one.' And it also includes the line: 'Nothing loved is ever lost'. Her family say they have many happy memories to keep Sophie alive in their hearts and that she is missed by many young cousins, aunties and uncles. At the end of August, Sophie went on a family trip to Cornwall, where she wrote of her wishes. Tracy said: 'We have a photo of her writing a message about her wishes on a mural at Land’s End. At that time, we thought we were still in the battle. There was a positiveness to it.' Tracy and Craig praised family and friends who rallied round to organise catering for Sophie’s funeral and the wonderful church service in her honour. They also praised staff at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough and the Holistic Cancer Care Centre on the same site. Craig said: 'She wouldn’t have had better treatment anywhere. They were amazing and couldn’t do enough for Sophie and us.'","Sophie Cutts became cancer charity ambassador before her death to warn others that disease can strike at any age .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:54 EST, 20 September 2012 . Microsoft Corp., the Hewlett-Packard Co. and other multinational corporations have avoided billions in U.S. taxes by shifting profits offshore and taking advantage of weak, ambiguous sections of the tax code, Senate investigators said on Thursday. Microsoft used 'aggressive' transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland and Singapore, in part to avoid taxes, said the report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. In one example, the report said that the Washington state-based software giant saved $4.5 billion in taxes from 2009 to 2011 by shifting assets to Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth that offers numerous tax breaks to businesses. Run around: Hewlett Packard Company headquarters in Palo Alto, California is seen while the company is said to use offshore loan transactions worth billions to run its U.S. operations . The report, released at a subcommittee hearing, also said that since at least 2008, HP has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions of dollars to avoid paying taxes while using the money to run its U.S. operations. The mammoth high tech company has its headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. 'The bottom line of our investigation is that some multinationals use our current tax system to engage in shams and gimmicks to avoid paying the taxes they owe,' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the subcommittee. Executives of both companies said they have complied with American tax laws. 'I can assure the committee that HP takes seriously its obligations to accurately follow accounting principle and to pay taxes that it owes,' Lester D. Ezrati, HP's senior vice president for taxes, told the panel. The report was released weeks before presidential and congressional elections in which one of the noisiest partisan clashes is over whether - and how - to raise revenues to help reduce federal deficits. Business practices: Microsoft Corp., their Chairman Bill Gates pictured who has a net worth of $66 billion, is also one of the companies accused of shifting profits offshore for tax breaks . Many Democrats have complained that the government is missing out on collecting billions of dollars because companies are stashing profits abroad, thus avoiding taxes. Republicans want to cut the corporate tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. companies make abroad, which they say would encourage them to invest at home. President Barack Obama has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to move jobs back to the U.S. and discourage them from shifting jobs abroad. Many in both parties say they want to overhaul the entire tax code, but there are vast differences in how they would do so. The investigators' report, based in part on material subpoenaed from multinational companies, said more than 1,000 such companies reported having more than $1.5 trillion overseas. U.S.-based companies can avoid taxes on much money earned abroad by asserting that they have invested those funds offshore or plan to do so. 'Many of these don't look great but they're legal,' Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the subcommittee's top Republican, said of the practices the report detailed. He said the findings call 'blatantly and honestly for tax reform in this country.' Defense: Sen Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who is the Senate subcommittee's top Republican, defends the business practices as being legal, even if not wholesome . The report said ways that companies reduce their tax liabilities include: . -Selling or licensing assets developed in the U.S. to offshore subsidiaries for less than they are worth, in effect minimizing the U.S. parent company's tax bill and shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. The report said Microsoft sold some intellectual property rights to subsidiaries in Ireland and Singapore for billions of dollars less than those subsidiaries earned from the assets - in effect shielding that money from U.S. taxes. -Government regulations, weak IRS enforcement and short-term laws that let multinational companies skirt requirements that they pay taxes on royalties, interest or dividend income earned abroad by subsidiaries. A 1997 Treasury Department rule letting companies decide the type of legal entity they want to be for tax liability purposes, which 'opened the floodgates' for such firms to avoid taxation, Levin said. He said in 2009 through 2011, Apple Inc. avoided $35 billion taxes on such earnings, Google $24 billion and Microsoft $21 billion. -Though U.S. based companies are supposed to pay taxes on money they borrow from a foreign subsidiary, U.S. tax laws allow exceptions, including for loans repaid within 30 days. Levin said HP used such loans to fund its U.S. payroll and repurchase its own stock. Levin said some multinationals 'have effectively and systematically been bringing those offshore profits back by the billions for years through loan schemes like the one described here, and doing so without paying taxes.' Microsoft operates in foreign markets 'in order to compete and succeed as a company,' William J. Sample, the company's vice president for worldwide tax, told the subcommittee. He said while 52 per cent of its revenue comes from the U.S., its foreign revenue is growing faster than those earned at home. Sample said the company has made 'very limited use' of tax code provisions that allow companies to avoid paying taxes on loans from foreign subsidiaries and some other transactions. 'Microsoft's tax results follow from its global business,' Sample told the senators. 'In conducting our business at home and abroad, we comply with U.S. and foreign tax laws.'","U.S.-based companies can avoid taxes on much money earned abroad by asserting that they have invested those funds offshore or plan to do so .

Betrayal of trust: Kenneth McCaskey pleaded guilty to a charge of house-breaking and theft at Edinburgh Sheriff Court . When Kenneth McCaskey started dating the boss’s daughter, he was welcomed into the family like one of their own. But it yesterday emerged that the salesman had betrayed their trust by breaking into their home and stealing a safe containing £50,000. A court heard that magazine publisher Jeremy Hitchen only realised the strong-box was missing when his three-storey townhouse was flooded. It may have been missing for as long as four months. McCaskey, 26, who had worked for the company for three years, then tearfully confessed to Mr Hitchen’s 23-year-old daughter Lucy that he was responsible. He said: ‘I’ve made my bed. I deserve to suffer for it.’ McCaskey then told her parents that he had given the safe to an unknown individual to open and that the person had taken about £30,000 from it. McCaskey, who had worked for Mr Hitchen’s The Media Company Publications Ltd, yesterday wept in the dock of Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The firm publishes Living Abroad Magazine and the Edinburgh Festival Magazine and organises the Foodie Festivals. It is based at the Hitchen family home in Royal Circus, Edinburgh. Prosecutor Karen Rollo told the court that McCaskey enjoyed a good relationship with Mr Hitchen and his wife Sue, 55. She said: 'During that time, he became involved in a relationship with their daughter Lucy. ‘Mr Hitchen based his business at his home and the accused worked for him there. Mr Hitchen’s practice was to keep money relating to the business in a safe in the house. ‘There was £50,000 which was kept in the safe. The safe was taken from the house.’ Miss Rollo also told the court that, on March 3 this year, McCaskey, of Edinburgh, contacted a colleague. Wealthy: Magazine publisher Jeremy Hitchen with wife Sue and daughter Lucy . Crime scene: McCaskey stole the family safe from their home in Royal Circus, Edinburgh, pictured . She said: ‘When the accused contacted him, he said he wanted to have a wee chat and informed him that he had robbed the bosses and stolen the safe. ‘The employee was under the belief that most of the money had been paid back and did not discuss it immediately with anyone. ‘Around about the same time, Mr Hitchen had a flood within his house and he discovered the safe was missing. ‘When the employee returned to work, he told Mr Hitchen about his conversation with the accused. The daughter of the family then contacted the accused and he admitted to stealing the safe. ‘He told her, “I’ve made my bed. I deserve to suffer for it”. He then contacted Mr and Mrs Hitchen and he confessed in full and admitted what had happened. ‘He gave an explanation that an individual who he had given the safe to open had taken most of the money – around £30,000. ‘He did say that he was sorry and that he wanted to pay it back.’ The theft took place some time between December 10, 2011, and March 5, 2012. McCaskey pleaded guilty to a charge of house-breaking and theft before Sheriff Gordon Liddle yesterday. Sheriff Liddle deferred sentence on McCaskey until November in order for the court to obtain reports about his character. Yesterday, Mr Hitchen was spotted outside his three-floor sandstone home. He was dressed casually and walking his dogs in the street’s exclusive park. At the family home, Mrs Hitchen gave no comment.","Kenneth McCaskey, 26, worked for magazine publisher Jeremy Hitchen .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:31 EST, 11 October 2012 . A hero Jack Russell saved her owners' lives by raising the alarm when a Jacuzzi caught fire. Jonathan Denby says five-year-old Pepper's barking alerted them to a blaze that swept through their home in Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria. Mr Denby, a hotel owner, said he was very proud of Pepper, who raised the alarm and alerted his wife Margaret to a ‘terrifying’ bathroom blaze. I'm all right, Jack: Margaret and her two daughters were able to flee after Jack Russell Pepper raised the alarm . Gutted: The fire started in the jacuzzi and rapidly engulfed the bathroom. The family was unaware until Pepper alerted them to the blaze . She suffered smoke inhalation which made her breathless as she dialled 999. Mr Denby, who was away at the time, said: 'The whole house could have gone. Pepper really did save the day.' Mrs Denby said she did not smell smoke as she settled down to watch television in her living room for a 'quiet' Friday night with daughters Sara and Georgina. 'I had got myself comfortable and the girls were downstairs in their bedrooms,' she said. 'I did hear a bang, which I now know was some sort of cosmetic or deodorant exploding but at the time I put it down to the weather or fireworks. Pepper obviously heard it though. 'She kept barking and I thought she just wanted to go outside, but she was very agitated and wouldn’t give up - she knew something was wrong.' Man's best friend: Owner Jonathan says the dog saved his family's life, calling the five-year-old Russell Terrier a 'hero'. Eventually Mrs Denby gave in to the canine's yapping and found the fire in her en-suite bathroom. 'I opened the door and the smoke and fumes just hit me. They singed my face. 'It was terrifying but my main priority was to get the girls out. Pepper already knew - she got herself out. 'You hear of animals saving people’s lives and that really was the case - she brought my attention to it and if she hadn’t it could have been much worse. She is a hero.' The bedroom and bathroom have been left a shell, the whole house covered in a layer of soot, and Mrs Denby lost her clothes to the fire. Warning: Fire officers say Pepper's heroics would not have been needed if smoke alarms at the home were working (stock image) It has prompted fire officers to renew calls for people to test their smoke alarms. They said that had the alarms been working in the Denby household, the response would have been faster. Mr Denby, who owns Damson Dene Hotel, in Kendal, Cumbria, was also told that had the fire started when his wife was asleep, she would have been dead without an alarm. Mrs Denby said it was ‘just an oversight’ that the detectors were not in order. 'Of course now I will get a working smoke alarm fitted very soon. I would also say to other people, you just do not know when it is going to happen,' she said.","'Pepper' would not stop barking while fire raged in bathroom .

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:38 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:05 EST, 3 October 2012 . Justine Greening was last night urged to quit the Cabinet over her role in the West Coast Main Line fiasco. Aides to the International Development Secretary insisted she had ‘acted properly at all times’ in her handling of the franchise bid during her time as Transport Secretary. But Graham Stringer, a Labour member of the Commons transport committee, said her refusal to follow up concerns about the bidding process should cost her her job. Reputation on the line: Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening (pictured) was facing calls to quit after previously shrugging off concerns about the disastrous West Coast Main Line franchise bidding process . Mr Stringer said: ‘Officials have clearly made mistakes, but the prime responsibility lies with ministers. ‘When the scale of the concerns about this process became clear Justine Greening should have called a halt to the process and called in the lawyers and accountants to go through it with a fine toothed comb. ‘I don’t think she can escape her responsibility just because she has moved department. She has cost the British taxpayer at least £40million and damaged the Government’s credibility on infrastructure. That should finish her career in Government.’ A senior Government source last night insisted that David Cameron retained full confidence in both Miss Greening and the Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, who actually signed off the controversial rail deal in her previous role as Rail Minister. The source added: ‘This is an incredibly complex process and it is totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have drilled down into the computer models – at a certain level you have to have faith in the civil servants.’ But yesterday’s events are a humiliating career setback for Miss Greening, a favourite of the Prime Minister who has been fast-tracked into the Cabinet. 'Heads must roll': Labour MP Graham Stringer (left) has called on David Cameron to sack Miss Greening after accusing her of costing the taxpayer 'at least £40million' and damaging the credibility on infrastructure . Miss Greening has long been seen as one of the Government’s rising stars. She was given the Transport portfolio last year in the mini-reshuffle that followed the abrupt departure of former defence secretary Liam Fox. At the time, supporters stressed her background as an accountant – although her skills appear to have done her little good in dealing with the rail franchising disaster. Chancellor George Osborne is said to have pressed for her removal because of her outspoken opposition to expansion at Heathrow airport, which would directly affect her constituency in Putney, south west London. But, as one of the Cabinet’s few women, she was offered another plum post at the Department for International Development. She is said to have been reluctant to . move, partly because of personal doubts about the Government’s . controversial pledge to pour billions more into foreign aid at a time of . austerity at home. Have PM's support: A senior Government source last night insisted that Mr Cameron retained full confidence in both Miss Greening (left) and the Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers (right), who actually signed off the controversial rail deal in her previous role as Rail Minister . Since her appointment, however, she has cheered Tory backbenchers by ordering a review of the millions of pounds of aid money squandered on consultants. Miss Greening was publicly dismissive of concerns about the rail franchise process and was only hours away from signing a binding deal with FirstGroup when Virgin mounted legal action. Aides last night said she had repeatedly sought and received assurances from senior officials that the franchise process had been conducted properly. Sources also pointed out that the franchise process had been started by her predecessor Philip Hammond, who is now Defence Secretary. Sir Richard Branson claimed the Department for Transport had ‘certainly made the same mistake’ with other bids and criticised Miss Greening. He told Channel 4 News: ‘The previous minister of transport should have just knocked the bid into touch some months ago but chose not to. ‘I don’t know what went on inside the Department for Transport and whether the previous minister knew all the facts or not, but certainly we appreciate the fact they acknowledged that there were major faults in the system and they have stayed in the system.’ Asked if Miss Greening was ‘incompetent’, he replied: ‘I’d rather not comment on previous ministers. I think it is rather unlikely that Justine Greening will ever come back to the department as a minister.’ Rail Minister Simon Burns denied the Government had known about the flaws in the bid. ‘It has been quite clear from the work that has been done in the department that ministers were not aware of the full extent of the problems that have just emerged. ‘They sought assurances, they sought advice, they were given assurances that procedures were robust and everything was being done correctly.’","Ex-Transport Secretary Justine Greening called on to quit the Cabinet .

David Cameron will today claim the values he learned from his disabled father can save Britain in its ‘hour of reckoning’. The Prime Minister will warn the country is in a global race and must sink or swim in its efforts to deal with the economic crisis. In an unusually personal speech to the Conservative conference, he will say ‘hard work, strong values, taking responsibility and serving others’ – qualities he learned from his late father, Ian – are needed to ensure Britain remains ‘the greatest country on earth’. Birthday night out: Today the Prime Minister will warn the country is in a global race but last night he celebrated his 46th birthday in Birmingham . Dining out: The couple arrive at the the Diwan Balti restaurant in the city to celebrate . Despite a series of crowd-pleasing . announcements that have cheered the Tory faithful, Mr Cameron will . insist the party remains on the political ‘common ground’. He will say his mission is to show that Conservatives are ‘for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay’. The Prime Minister celebrated his 46th birthday at the conference last night with his wife Samantha, who travelled up from London to take him out for a curry. He had earlier told BBC Breakfast: ‘I’m looking forward to Samantha coming back to Birmingham and I’m hoping she’s going to take me out for a balti.’ Perhaps keen to seize the opportunity for some good publicity, one of Mr Cameron’s aides tipped off a news agency photographer about where the couple would be dining. Mr Cameron had earlier posted a picture on Twitter, above, of him laughing with Foreign Secretary William Hague after being presented with a birthday cake in the shape of a caterpillar. Traditional . Tory values, he will argue, are compassionate because they are good not . just for the strong and successful in society but also the poor, the . weak and the vulnerable. ‘Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society,’ he will say. The . Prime Minister will offer a tacit acknowledgement that many voters are . still unsure what he stands for after seven years as party leader, . saying: ‘There is nothing complicated about me. ‘I . believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country. And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. This is still . the greatest country on earth. We showed that again this summer. Smiles all round: David Cameron and his wife leave the Diwan Balti restaurant . Reunited: He had earlier told BBC Breakfast: 'I'm looking forward to Samantha coming back to Birmingham and I'm hoping she's going to take me out for a balti' ‘But it’s tough. These are difficult . times, we’re being tested. How will we come through it? Again, it’s not . complicated. Hard work, strong families, taking responsibility, serving . others.’  The road to recovery following the financial crisis, the Prime . Minister will admit, is proving longer and harder than anyone . anticipated. But aides . said he believed many people had failed to realise the scale of the . threat facing Britain and other debt-laden Western economies. ‘Unless . we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show . determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it . has been in the past,’ he will tell his Birmingham audience. Close to the heart: David Cameron with son Ivan in 2004. He will use his own family¿s story as he seeks to explain what makes him tick - speaking frankly of his late son, Ivan, and his father Ian, who died in 2010 . ‘Because . the truth is this. We’re in a global race today, and that means an hour . of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.’ His father Ian, who died in 2010. In his speech he will say: ¿My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought' The Prime Minister will dismiss calls . for a ‘Plan B’ on the economy, ridiculing Labour for wanting to borrow . yet more money in a ‘massive gamble with our economy and our future’. But . he will use his own family’s story as he seeks to explain what makes . him tick – revealing that his grandfather abandoned his grandmother, and . speaking frankly of his late son, Ivan, and his father Ian, who died in . 2010. ‘My dad . influenced me much more than I ever thought. He was born with no heels . on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they’re meant to be. But . he never complained – even when he lost both those legs later in life. ‘Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child. Probably a lonely child. But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full, usually with something alcoholic in it. ‘When I was a boy ... I asked him what he was most proud of. It was simple – working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family. Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off. ‘Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story. Work hard. Family comes first, but put back in to the community too.’ Meanwhile, Mr Cameron is set to push through gay marriage laws as early as next year despite backbench dissent. He has told ministers the reform is a ‘straightforward matter of equality’ and should happen as soon as possible. MPs have been promised a free vote on the plans.","The Prime Minister will warn the country is in a global race and must sink or swim in its efforts to deal with the economic crisis .

Speaking out: Shazia Razman, 14, was shot twice at the same time as her best friend Malala Yousafzai (inset) who is now in hospital . The best friend of the 14-year-old Pakistani girl shot in the head by the Taliban yesterday vowed to defy the extremists again and return to school with her. Shazia Ramzan watched in horror as classmate Malala Yousafzai was shot beside her on their school bus, before the gunman turned and shot her too. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, brave Shazia, also 14, who was hit in the shoulder and hand, said: ‘She will recover and we will go back to school and study together again.’ As Shazia sat up in her hospital bed, . Malala was yesterday still critically ill in a hospital in Rawalpindi, . Pakistan, after being shot by the Taliban gunman as she travelled home . on a school bus in Mingora in the strife-torn Swat Valley on Tuesday. Malala, . who from the age of 11 defied the Taliban to write a blog for the BBC . championing education for girls, was targeted by the extremists, who . believe girls should be kept at home and barred from school. In hospital in Peshawar, Shazia said Malala had told classmates she might be a target but refused to hide from the Taliban. She . also described the callous way the gunman shot Malala in the head and . then turned his gun on her and another of Malala’s classmates before . fleeing. Support: Afghan students show their support for Malala who was shot on the school bus by Taliban extremists . ‘Malala told us she had been threatened by the extremists,’ she said. ‘She said she had been speaking too much against mujahideen [Taliban] and they might do something to her.’ Describing Tuesday’s attack, she said: ‘It was just a normal school day. We were coming home after our second-term exams. The bus was taking the usual route. ‘Then it suddenly stopped and two men confronted us. They asked, “Which one of you is Malala?” Some of the girls started to talk and then one of the men opened fire. All the girls started crying and shouting. Malala was hit in the head and fell to the floor unconscious. There was blood everywhere. I was in total shock. ‘Then the man with the gun fired at me and another girl and ran away.

It was chaotic because everyone was screaming and crying and Malala was lying on the floor in front of me.’ Shazia had been hit by two bullets. By yesterday, however, she was well enough to walk around her bed in the Combined Military Hospital. The third girl had comparatively minor injuries. Target: Malala had been told extremists wanted to harm her after she spoke out against them . Explaining the build-up to the attack, Shazia said: ‘Malala would talk to us about the dangers she was facing but refused to change the way she lived. She just said the extremists might do something to her because she had spoken out against them so much and they might want to harm her. ‘She knew something might happen but she never let it affect her. She refused to be anything other than a normal schoolgirl.’ Shazia said she was disgusted with the men who carried out the attack. ‘We don’t know who they were but I am sure they were the people Malala had been warned about,’ she said. As she prepared to go home to her family, Shazia said her greatest wish was to return to school with Malala – even though the Taliban has threatened to return and kill Malala. ‘With the grace of God, I am completely all right now. Malala will recover soon too, I hope. We will go back to school and study together again. ‘I am praying for Malala and praying she can join her school friends again as soon as possible. The whole nation is praying for her and I am sure she will make a full recovery.’ Shazia’s father Muhammad Ramzan, 50, who runs a bakery in Mingora, said he was horrified by the attack. ‘We have never been enemies with anyone,’ he said. ‘I don’t know who did this. Malala was outspoken and she had told her classmates something like this could happen but we never imagined it would happen in this way.’ Injured: Hospital staff assists Malala at the Saidu Sharif Teaching Hospital in the Swat Valley .

Cockfighting is gaining popularity among middle-class professionals such as doctors and dentists, the RSPCA warned yesterday. The organisation raised concerns about the growing trend after raiding two farms where inspectors found 500 birds, including 97 mature fighting cocks, and metal spurs that are used as weapons. Mark Giles and his son, also called Mark, have pleaded guilty to animal cruelty at the properties they ran in Billingshurst, West Sussex, and will be sentenced by Brighton magistrates on Wednesday. Fighting: Two prepare to do battle at a cockfight in the Philippines where the 'sport' is very popular . During the swoops, inspectors reportedly discovered 60 pairs of lethal metal spurs, some an inch-long, which are attached to the birds' feet and cause terrible injuries. Vitamin supplements and empty steroid . vials used to increase the birds' strength and stamina were also found . along with magazines which featured the elder Giles at competitions in . Brazil and the Philippines. Lethal: Two birds armed with steel spurs attached to their feet, fly at each other . RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) inspector Dave Long, who led the raids, told the Sunday Times that groups of up to a dozen men would watch four-minute bouts between birds in cockfighting pits stained with blood. He said: 'This was a breeding farm specifically for fighting cocks but it was also used for others to come and test their own birds. 'The people involved come from all walks of life, including people with respectable occupations such as doctors and dentists.' The paper reported the growing popularity of 'cockfighting chic' and the revival of a 'sport' which was banned in England and Wales in 1835. Once, small groups of men in Britain and Ireland linked by a highly secretive network, would gather to pit their fighting cocks in a battle to the death, sometimes waging thousands of pounds on the result. In America cockfighting is illegal, but has many devotees among professionals, including lawyers, police officers and doctors. A source with links to field sports, told the Sunday Times that 'five or six people' he had spoken to in recent months had bought English cocks to fight. He was quoted as saying: 'It's a kind of cockfighting chic. It seems to be a new trend. I haven't come across it before.'","500 birds found in raid by organisation - along with 60 pairs of lethal spurs .

The New York Red Bulls coach may have been brutally stabbed to death in New York City's Greenwhich Village in a tragic case of mistaken identity, police revealed today. The announcement from New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly comes as photos emerged of Michael Jones, 25, with his girlfriend. The beloved youth soccer coach from . Liverpool, England, spoke with Bryeanna Murphy, 23, on the phone just minutes . before he was attacked and his ear savagely hacked off early Sunday. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Mike Jones, 25, called his girlfriend Bryeanna Murphy, 23, several times the night he was killed . Long term: Miss Murphy had been dating Mr Jones for about a year . Detectives are looking into a fight earlier in the evening that Mr Jones' suspected killer had over a woman he met in a bar, the New York Post reports. Police believe Mr Jones had nothing to do with the woman or the fight, but was instead mistaken for the murder suspect's nightclub adversary. Officers have ruled out robbery, since Mr Jones' wallet and iPhone were still on his body. Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, according to the Post. The two men appear to exchange words and begin to argue. The suspect suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a building and pulls out a knife. He is seen slashing and stabbing the coach six times before leaving him to bleed to death. A medical examiner ruled he died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart. The killer, described as a Hispanic man between age 25 and 30, then calmly walks away. The murderer is still at large. However, police reportedly were interviewing a 'person of interest' in the slaying on Monday. Minutes before the killing, Mr Jones spoke with Miss Murphy, who had had been dating for about a year. Mr Jones and his girlfriend spent out together on Saturday night in the East Village visiting a friend's apartment. He left Miss Murphy about 11.30pm to hit the town at several upscale nightclubs with other friends. Despite the boy's night out, Mr Jones dutifully called his girlfriend several times throughout the evening -- including just before he was killed. Miss Murphy lives in Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. Mr Jones lived eight miles away in West Harrison, where he coached a youth soccer league for the New York Red Bulls. 'He . coached two of my three sons and was just a great guy. He cared about . what he did, and was very dedicated,' Mark Fischer, who oversees . referees in the Westchester league, told the Post. 'The kids loved him.' Brutal: Mr Jones' murderer is seen calmly walking away after mercilessly hacking the beloved soccer coach to death . 'He loved New York and he loved the lifestyle and he was working and hoping to get a visa so he could stay there full time,' the elder Mr Jones said. He said he and his wife received a Facebook message from one of his son's friends on Sunday telling him to call the NYPD. When the couple phoned, they found out their promising young son had been brutally murdered. Mr Jones' body was found at 4:25am, his ear lying a few feet away. Happy: Mr Jones, center, loved New York and was hoping to move to the city, his father said . Beloved: Mr Jones was well-liked by the young players he mentored as a coach in the Red Bulls' Westchester youth league . Officers . covered the ear with a plastic cup to hide it from passersby and rushed . the man to Bellevue where he was pronounced dead on arrival. 'It was a frenzy.

Starlight from eight billion years ago is set to be captured by the world's most powerful digital camera. The ancient rays have crossed countless distant galaxies to find heir way to a mountaintop in Chile where a giant sky mapping machine called the Dark Energy Camera recorded them. The light may hold within it the answer to one of the biggest mysteries in physics - why the expansion of the universe is speeding up. Scroll down for video . One of the first images from the Dark Energy Camera, showing the spiral galaxy NGC 1365, in the Fornax cluster of galaxies, which lies about 60 million light years from Earth. Although dark energy appears to account for about 75% of the energy-mass content of the universe scientists have no real idea what it is. Dark energy is arguably one of the major outstanding issues facing 21st-Century science. This mysterious force appears to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Recognition of its existence and effect in 1998 earned three scientists a Nobel Prize. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration have announced the camera, which took eight years to build by scientists on three continents, has achieved first light. The first pictures of the southern sky were taken by the 570-megapixel camera on 12 September. Professor Ofer Lahav, of University College London, who heads the UK arm of the consortium, said: 'The achievement of first light through the Dark Energy Camera brings us a step closer to understanding dark energy, one of the biggest mysteries in the whole of physics. 'The deep observations with the DES camera will tell us why the universe is speeding up and if a major shift is required in our understanding of the universe.' The camera, which is roughly the size of a phone booth, is the most powerful survey instrument of its kind, able to see light from over 100,000 galaxies up to 8 billion light years away in each snapshot. The camera's array of 62 devices have an unprecedented sensitivity to very red light and will allow scientists from around the world to pursue investigations ranging from studies of asteroids in our own Solar System to the understanding of the origins and the fate of the universe. Another test image from the Dark Energy Camera of the center of the globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which lies about 17,000 light years from Earth . A zoomed-in image from the Dark Energy Camera of the center of the globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which lies about 17,000 light years from Earth . Scientists will use the new camera to carry out the largest galaxy survey ever undertaken, and will use that data to probe dark energy by studying galaxy clusters, supernovae and the large-scale clumping of galaxies. Prof Will Percival, of Portsmouth University who co-coordinates the galaxy clustering part of the investigation, said: 'This will be the largest galaxy survey of its kind, and the galaxy shapes and positions will tell us a great deal about the nature of the physical process that we call Dark Energy, but do not currently understand.' Researcher Prof Richard McMahon, of Cambridge University, said: 'The construction of a 3-dimensional map of the galaxies just based on their positions and optical colours is extremely challenging and will require sophisticated computational and statistical techniques. 'The addition of galaxy near infrared colours from another UK led sky mapping survey, the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, will greatly improve the accuracy of the map.' The Dark Energy Survey is expected to begin in December after the camera is fully tested and will take advantage of the excellent atmospheric conditions in the Chilean Andes to deliver pictures with the sharpest resolution seen in such a wide-field astronomy survey. Over five years the survey will create detailed colour images of one-eighth of the sky, or 5,000 square degrees, to discover and measure 300 million galaxies, 100,000 galaxy clusters, and 4,000 supernovae.

"EXCLUSIVE . By . James Slack and Michael Seamark . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:06 EST, 16 October 2012 . Theresa May will today unveil a major shake-up of Britain’s lopsided extradition laws. In a victory for the Mail’s Affront to British Justice campaign, the Home Secretary will introduce rules making it more likely a UK citizen will face trial at home rather than being bundled on a plane to the US. The implementation of the so-called ‘forum’ bar – so a court hearing has to be held to decide where a person should stand trial – satisfies one of the most vocal demands of campaigners appalled by Labour’s unfair Extradition Act. Plans: Home Secretary Theresa May will introduce rules making it more likely a UK citizen will face trial at home rather than being bundled on a plane to the US . Civil liberties groups argue it could have prevented the saga of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon who faces being packed off to America for alleged crimes which took place from the UK. He hacked into US military computers from the bedroom of his north London home while looking for evidence of ‘little green men’. Mrs May has sanctioned the introduction of the ‘forum’ despite the move being fiercely resisted by the US government. A review of extradition laws by Sir Scott Baker – dubbed a ‘whitewash’ by critics – also ruled against changing the status quo. But Mrs May has decided the change is vital to restore public trust in Britain’s extradition arrangements. It will be announced in a statement to MPs today. At the same time, Mrs May will give her ruling on whether Mr McKinnon’s extradition to the US can be halted on medical grounds. The decision will be based on a psychiatric report prepared for Mrs May by Professor Declan Murphy and Professor Thomas Fahy. Taken abroad? Civil liberties groups say the 'forum' bar could have prevented the saga of Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon who faces being packed off to America for alleged crimes which took place from the UK . The study confirms there is a ‘significant’ risk of suicide which will increase if he is forced to travel to the US. The doctors say they ‘cannot offer reassurance that Mr McKinnon would not attempt to, or be successful in, harming or killing himself if he is arrested or extradited’. Mrs May halted Mr McKinnon’s extradition as soon as the Coalition came to power. The Government has been studying different medical reports ever since. The verdict could have significant political ramifications. 'Britain . was sold a pup in 2003. It’s time for this government to right the . wrongs. Gary’s ten years spent living on a knife-edge has been nothing . short of cruel and unnecessary punishment' Melanie Riley, Friends-Extradited . Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Attorney General Dominic Grieve all made specific statements in support of Mr McKinnon in Opposition. They supported the Mail’s campaign calling for Gary and those like him to stand trial in the UK if their alleged crimes took place here. The change in the rules on forum cannot be applied retrospectively to help the 46-year-old. However, it will be warmly welcomed by campaign groups, Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs. In December, Parliament passed a unanimous vote demanding the introduction of forum. Campaigners believe it will eradicate much of the bias contained in the Extradition Act, which was passed by Labour in 2003. They point to the fact not a single US citizen has been sent to Britain for a crime committed on American soil. Waiting: The student Richard O'Dwyer - who is accused of copyright offences - also faces extradition to the US . By contrast, Mr McKinnon and the student Richard O’Dwyer – who is accused of copyright offences – are being dragged in the opposite direction for offences which allegedly took place here. Christopher Tappin, a  retired golf club president from Surrey, is already in America awaiting trial on arms sale charges which he fiercely denies. Forum, which will require a change to the law, means a hearing will take place in open court to decide where a person should go on trial. Prosecutors will have to justify any attempt to send a suspect to the US for an alleged crime which took place here. The final decision will rest with a judge. Currently, British prosecutors decide in private if they think the case should be tried here. Melanie Riley of campaign group Friends-Extradited said: ‘Britain was sold a pup in 2003. It’s time for this government to right the wrongs. Gary’s ten years spent living on a knife-edge has been nothing short of cruel and unnecessary punishment.’ Earlier this year, the home affairs select committee said the UK/US extradition treaty was ‘unbalanced’ and must be urgently reformed. They called for suspects to be tried in the country where their crimes were allegedly committed unless there are exceptional reasons not to do so. To extradite a UK citizen, the US needs only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought.","Major shake up is a victory for the Mail's Affront to British Justice campaign .

The boy was airlifted to a larger . nearby hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado and was diagnosed with . influenza B and an infection called methicillin resistant Staphylococcus . aureus (MRSA.) He was placed into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator to help with his breathing. Even with a massive dosage of antibiotics, the infection 'was more than he could do. His organs started to shut down.' He died on January 17, less than a week after he started to feel sick. 'If I would have taken him to the . doctor sooner they would have said he has the flu and sent him home,' his grieving mother said. 'Nothing would have changed.

The new research, unveiled at a . conference for infectious disease specialists in San Diego, shows that . healthier children actually died more quickly from the disease compared . to children with high-risk conditions like asthma, Down . syndrome or cerebral palsy. Among . healthy patients who died, they passed away an average of four days . after the illness hit whereas children with conditions that would make . them high risk, on average, succumbed after seven days.

Though . flu shots are recommended for anyone over the age of six months, . only 51.5 per cent of children (aged six months to 17 years) were . vaccinated in 2011. CDC’s Dr Karen Wong led the research team to review influenza related deaths between 2004 and 2012. 'Of the 781 with a known medical history, 333 (43 per cent) had no high-risk conditions; of children with high-risk conditions, 57 per cent had neurologic disorders, 45 per cent had asthma or other pulmonary disease, and 22 per cent had genetic or chromosomal disorders,' according to their findings. She told NBC that getting a flu shot should be a top priority for parents. 'Because the study did find a lot of otherwise healthy kids who did have influenza-associated deaths and because we know deaths can happen fast, prevention is best, and the best prevention is the vaccine,' she said. And now the Booth family is speaking . out to encourage families to heed that advice and take every precaution . for the sake of their children. Regina Booth is now a flu vaccine advocate for Families Fighting Flu, a volunteer based advocacy group supporting families who have lost a child to influenza.

These incredible new images of Mars, taken on 6 June by the high-resolution stereo camera on ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft, show the stunning beauty of the Martian landscape - and reveal the telltale signs that water was once commonplace on the red planet, and could still be there in huge underground glaciers. They show the rugged terrain of Nereidum Montes, an area that marks the far northern extent of Argyre, one of the largest impact basins on Mars. Nereidum Montes stretches almost 1150 km and was named by the noted Greek astronomer Eugène Michel Antoniadi (1870–1944). Scroll down for video . This computer-generated perspective view was created using data obtained from the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on ESA¿s Mars Express, and shows rippled sand dunes which form on the leeward (wind-sheltered) sides of mounds and canyons . Nereidum Montes seen in broader context at the northern edge of the Argyre basin on Mars . Based on his extensive observations of Mars, Antoniadi famously concluded that the ‘canals’ on Mars reported by Percival Lowell were, in fact, just an optical illusion. The new images captured by Mars Express show a portion of the region, displaying multiple fluvial, glacial and wind-driven features. Extensive drainage patterns can be seen towards the north (lower right side) of the first images, were formed when liquid water drained into deeper regions within the area. 'On Earth, tree-like channels of this kind are usually formed by surface runoff after significant rainfall, or when snow or ice melts,' ESA said in a statement. 'Similar processes are thought to have occurred on Mars in the distant past, when scientists now know there to have been water on the surface of the Red Planet.' Several of the craters within the region, particularly in eastern parts (lower section) of the first image, show concentric crater fill, a distinctive martian process marked by rings of surface fluctuations within a crater rim, the researchers say. The ratios between the diameter and depth of the filled craters suggest that there may still be water ice, possibly in the form of ancient glaciers, present below the dry surface debris cover. Scientists have estimated that the water-ice depth in these craters varies from several tens up to hundreds of metres. Concentric crater fill can be seen in many of the craters towards the east (lower part of the image). Undulations in crater floors are commonly seen in mid-latitude regions on Mars and are believed to be a result of glacial movement. In the image above, a smooth area to the east of (below) the glacial feature appears to be the youngest within the image, evidenced by an almost complete lack of cratering. Another indication of subsurface water is seen in the fluidised ejecta blanket surrounding the crater at the northern edge (right-hand side). These ejecta structures can develop when a comet or asteroid hits a surface saturated with water or water ice, ESA scientists say. The researchers say the images could also help plan where humans could eventually visit. 'In-depth studies of regions such as . Nereidum Montes play an essential role in unlocking the geological past . of our terrestrial neighbour, as well as helping to find exciting . regions for future robotic and human explorers to visit.' Taken on 6 June 2012, the colour coding enhances the visibility of the rippling sand dunes which formed in the wind-sheltered sides of the mounds and canyons.

Taxpayer-funded translators are being used in courts at a rate of more than 10,000 times a month, figures reveal. The interpreters were called on to provide translation for 163 languages in criminal courts, tribunals and family cases. But the figures also show Applied Language Solutions, which provides the national translation service under a controversial £90million Government contract, failed to provide an interpreter on more than one in ten of the occasions the courts called for them. Courts, such as those at the Royal Courts of Justice, are using 10,000 taxpayer funded translators each month . Between the end of January, when the contract started, and the end of August there were 72,043 interpretation duties carried out. Just over half were in criminal courts, with nearly four in ten in tribunal hearings, including immigration, asylum and employment cases.

A father and son who rejected a £50,000 offer for their wheelbarrow invention on Dragons’ Den were celebrating yesterday after netting over £1million in orders during its first year on sale. Mike and Joe Smith turned down offers by 'dragons' Duncan Bannatyne and Hilary Devey who offered them £50,000 for 50 per cent of their Wheelbarrow Booster business on the hit BBC show for entrepreneurs. In one of the most heated exchanges seen . on the show, the dragons criticised the Smiths' attitude before they . declared themselves out. But now the pair are struggling to keep up with demand, predicting sales of 100,000 units a year for their invention, a canvas product which increases the capacity of a wheelbarrow by 300 per cent. Scroll down to see the million pound invention... Father and son: Mike and Joe Smith on Dragons' Den did what many before them had not - turned down the panels' offer but it was 'the right call,' Joe said . DIY giant Homebase has placed an order of 5,000 units, Tesco Direct is also listing the product and there has been significant interest from companies as far away as Australia, New Zealand, America and Brazil. Endorsed by professional gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh, the product costs £12.99. Rejected: 'Dragons' Duncan Bannatyne (pictured) and Hilary Devey offered £50,000 for 50 per cent of the Smiths' company but the pair have gone on to accept orders from Homebase and is listed on Tesco Direct . Selling out: Mike Smith demonstrates invention Wheelbarrow Booster which the panel on TV show the Dragons' Den offered just £50,000 for. They now expect to net £1.3m in sales next year alone . When the father and son went on Dragons’ Den in March, which aired last month, they were offered £50,000 for half their gardening company GreanBase but the ‘dragons’ were left reeling when Mike, 54, bluntly refused, telling them he would give away no more than 11.5 per cent of the company. Joe, 32, said: ‘I guess it could be seen as a mistake on our part but then again it may turn out to be the best thing we have done. ‘Not many people turn down the dragons, but we made the right call. ‘We had been in front of the dragons for two hours and I think my dad had just had enough of it. Selling 100,000 units a year: The Wheelbarrow Booster is a canvas product which increases the capacity of a wheelbarrow by 300 per cent . ‘He only agreed to go on the show after I asked him, he thought Sir Alan Sugar was on it! ‘For the projections we gave them, we only needed to have sold 25,000 units for them to get their money back. They really undervalued it.’ After starting off with 1,000 in stock which quickly sold out, Mike and Joe, based in Northampton,  are getting orders faster than they can produce them. Joe said: ‘We have self-financed it so far but will need outside investment when we take it to more and more countries. Stuck to his guns: Mike Smith (right) was lectured by the panel including Deborah Meadon (left) for their attitude towards the offer . 'Undervalued': The pair demonstrating their invention on the Dragons' Den believed they only needed to sell 25,000 units for the 'dragons' to get their money's worth . ‘We can't keep up with demand, to a point. This week I had enquiries about how much we would charge for 25,000, then how much for 50,000.’ The Dragons’ Den features entrepreneurs who pitch their business ideas to a panel of venture capitalists or ‘dragons’ to secure investment finance. The panel then judge how much money, if any, to invest in the invention in return for a percentage of the inventor’s company. But the ‘dragons’ do not always get their judgement right. Endorsement: The product (left) which costs £12.99 per unit, has been endorsed by professional gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh . Andrew Gordon, who appeared on the show in 2009 pitched his StableTable idea which was branded a ‘ridiculous idea’ by ‘dragon’ Rachel Elnaugh. The invention which stops tables wobbling went on to become a success and Mr Gordon has just signed a deal to distribute the StableTable in America. A buoyancy aid for children, shaped like a shark’s fin was laughed off the show in 2006, deemed ‘dangerous’ and ‘silly’ but inventor Kevin Moseley ignored their advice and registered worldwide patents and started Swimfin Ltd from his home garage. In its first year of trading, Swimfin sales reached £70,000 across nearly 50 countries and were popular particularly in Australia where it was exhibited at the AustSwim Conference.","Mike and Joe Smith rejected an offer for invention on Dragons' Den .

Another image is of the young band moments before the gig, the four young men standing behind the curtain with a crew member poking his head through a gap, as if to ask if they are ready. The candid photos show frontman Roger Daltrey singing and Keith Moon on the drums, 12 years before his death from a drugs overdose. The photos were taken after the legendary band had started making a name for themselves but before they shot to superstardom.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:19 EST, 17 October 2012 . These are the four women who have inadvertently found themselves at the centre of a public furore after Mitt Romney boasted he was given 'whole binders full of women' capable of joining his cabinet. Kerry Healey, Jane Edmonds, Jennifer Davis Carey and Ellen Roy Herzfelder were appointed to four of the 11 cabinet positions when Romney became Massachusetts governor, indicating they were handpicked from the now notorious binder he referenced during the presidential debate. But, as Romney's claim about his bizarre hiring technique is ridiculed in a slew of internet memes, the women's group he claimed he recruited to find qualified female candidates has disputed his account. The online buzz has thrust issues of . women's equality and employment - and the candidates commitment to them - to the forefront of the agenda as election day looms. In response to a question about hiring equality in Tuesday night's debate, Romney said he was so concerned about the number of women in the cabinet that he sought help from women's groups. Scroll down for video . In the spotlight: Kerry Healey, left, and Jane Edmonds, right, both served in Mitt Romney's cabinet, which he said he devised with the help of women's groups who presented him with 'binders full of women' Romney said: 'We took a concerted . effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be . qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of . women’s groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought . us whole binders full of women.' The odd claim sparked outcry and ridicule across social media - with mocking Tumblr and Twitter accounts cropping up within minutes - and among Democrats. It has also cast a spotlight on the women who featured among the pages of the binders and were eventually successful in securing one of Romney's top jobs. Three of the four women are Harvard educated and remain in public service positions - yet have continued to face tough competition, and defeat, from men. Vetted: Ellen Roy Herzfelder, left, resigned from her post as environmental affairs secretary after her appointment to spend more time with her family. Jennifer Davis Carey, right, was also on the cabinet . Kerry Healey became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid. But . at the end of the term, she ran for governor and faced in-party . competition for the spot. The Republican pair were both eventually beaten by the male . Democratic candidate, Deval Patrick. Her later appointments to executive committees came at the hands of women, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, and she continues to work for Romney in his presidential campaign. Fellow Harvard graduate, Ellen Roy Herzfelder, was appointed as secretary of the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, but left in 2005 - to be replaced by a man - to spend time with her children. Herzfelder, who had come under fire for an outstanding tax bill of $1 million for a company she set up with her family before her resignation, went on to become a senior policy adviser. Claims: Romney, pictured with President Obama at the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, said he chose the women from a 'binder' presented by a women's group . Defiant: But women's groups claim they approached Romney (pictured with running mate Ron Paul) about vetting women to get more into top positions. And after he took office, their numbers fell . Jane Edmonds was appointed as Secretary of Workforce Development under Romney and admitted that, as a  liberal Democrat and African-American, many of her friends asked why she worked for him. Binder: This image from the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus shows the cover of a binder listing women for high-level positions . But . Edmonds, now a professor at Northeastern University, rallied for him at . the Republican National Convention, saying: 'He would make an excellent . president.' Jennifer Davis Carey served as the secretary of Elder Affairs for Romney after working in the state's previous cabinet. Following his term, she became the . senior director of training and education for the University of . Massachusetts Medical School - a position she still holds. The nonpartisan Massachusetts women's coalition MassGAP - Massachusetts Government Appointments Project - has argued against the series of events leading to these women's hiring. Before the election in 2002, they appealed to Romney and his . Democratic opponent, Shannon O'Brien, to make a 'best effort' to . appoint women in proportion to the makeup of the state's population. Both campaigns agreed and the group started vetting potential candidates for the roles. 'It was an initiative of women’s organizations, not to force [Romney’s] hand, but to make it be something he had to follow through on,' Carol Hardy-Fanta said in an interview. 'He didn't go out looking for these binders.' Marissa Szabo, associate director of the Massachusetts Women’s Political Caucus, which founded MassGAP, said: 'Following the election, MassGAP formed committees for each cabinet post in the administration and began the process of recruiting, interviewing, and vetting women applicants. At odds: Vice President Joe Biden, right, said it was troubling Romney had been unable to find qualified women, while Ron Paul, left, argued he had just wanted to show he had been thorough . After Romney became governor in 2003, Kerry Healey became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid. Like Romney, she chose not to take a salary for the position. At the end of the term, she ran for governor and faced in-party . competition for the spot. They were both eventually beaten by the male . Democratic candidate, Deval Patrick. Her later appointments to executive . committees came at the hands of women, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary . Clinton, and she continues to work for Romney in his presidential . campaign. Fellow .

Following . his term, she became the senior director of training and education for . the University of Massachusetts Medical School - a position she still . holds. 'Those committees selected top . applicants for each position and presented this information to the . administration for follow-up interviews and consideration for . appointment.' Liz Levin, former chairwoman of . MassGAP, added that Romney had little contact with MassGAP and his . nominee for lieutenant governor, Kerry Healey, worked with the . organization for the project. Romney never once met with the group and members assumed he was busy, she added. Before Romney became governor in 2002, women comprised around 30 per cent of the all appointed senior-level posts in the state. By 2004, 42 per cent of new appointments by the administration were female, but the years after, it dropped to 25 per cent, Szabo revealed in a statement. In Romney's cabinet, four of the 11 posts were filled by women until one, Herzfelder, left - and was replaced by a man. And O'Brien argued that, even though there was initially some improvement, men still filled the more important jobs. 'There is certainly glaring evidence that he hasn't put women in places of extreme power,' Melissa A. Walsh, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women, said in 2003. 'He has chosen to surround himself with male chiefs.' Jesse Mermell, who was also involved in the effort to recruit female candidates, said she was stunned that Romney, who had 25 years of experience in business, needed help finding women. She added: 'All I know is that when he was elected governor, he made a promise to make his best efforts that women would be proportionate to the percentage of women in Massachusetts. 'By the time he left office, it was 25 percent. To me, that doesn't speak to a great commitment to women in the workplace.' His statement at the debate also gathered criticism from Vice President Joe Biden, who said he was baffled as to why Romney would need help finding women to employ. 'I've never had any problem when there's a job opening having as many women apply as men,' Biden told This Morning on Wednesday. Ridicule: The comments by Romney sparked a social networking frenzy and viewers created memes on Tumblr . Dig: Viewers laughed at the bizarre statement on Twitter, and Democrats also jumped on the phrase . 'There's so many qualified women walking around in Boston, Massachusetts, so many qualified women walking around every place in this country, the idea you got to go ask help to find one, I didn't quite understand what he was talking about.' Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, attempted to pick up the pieces and explain the comment. 'All he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor,' he said. 'That's really what he was saying. And by the way, he has an exceptional record of hiring women in very prominent positions in his administration and that's the point he was making.'

A bus driver has been jailed after he was caught four times over the drink-drive limit - at 11am in the morning. Witnesses noticed something was amiss when they saw Justin Snodin zigzagging towards a bus stop on the wrong side of the road on his route between Louth and Horncastle, in Lincolnshire. On a number of occasions, he even mounted the grassy verge as he sped through the winding country roads. Dangerous: Justin Snodin was driving a Call Connect Bus between Louth and Horncastle, Lincolnshire when he was caught being four times over the limit . The 40-year-old was so drunk that morning that witnesses thought he must be sick, until he stumbled off the bus to smoke a cigarette. Callum Simons was so concerned that he tailed the 28-seater vehicle in a car on the 15-mile route and called the police. He then approached Snodin when he came off the bus and asked if he was ok. Mr Simons later told police 'I asked him why he was swerving all over the road but he was unable to give a coherent reason.' 'We followed the bus. For much of the . time it was on the wrong side of the road, mounting the grass verge and . travelling at high speeds on narrow roads.' Picturesque: The bus swerved and mounted the grassy verge as it sped through the winding Lincolnshire country roads . Jim Clare, prosecuting, told Skegness . Magistrates 'The bus was being driven erratically and continually . mounting the grass verge. A witness thought the driver must be ill.' Mr Clare told the court that police arrested Snodin after he stopped in Horncastle but his one female passenger became aggressive. 'She was shouting and swearing. It was necessary for the officers to restrain her and that lady was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.' Snodin was taken to Skegness Police Station where a breath test showed he had 136 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of breath making him almost four times the legal limit of 35 mgs. Mr Clare said 'When he was interviewed he explained he had been drinking the night before but had finished at midnight. 'He didn’t believe he was over the limit and felt he was ok to drive. He did admitted he was a recovering alcoholic.' Snodin was suspended by his employers and later sacked. The 49-year-old woman passenger arrested was later issued with a police caution for being drunk and disorderly and for possession of cannabis. Snodin ,40, of Newmarket, Louth, admitted driving with excess alcohol on 17 March. He was given a 26 week jail sentence suspended for 12 months and banned from driving for three years. Snodin was also ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. Terry Boston, defending, said: 'His life has been devastated by this. He has lost his job and is living on benefits. 'He is not a criminal who is continually causing problems. He is a man who has got to his 40s and has no previous convictions of any kind. He has a clean driving licence. 'He had an enormous amount of alcohol in his body. Someone who had that level of alcohol and did not realise it he has got to be ill. There can be no other explanation.' Mr Boston said that since his arrest Snodin has been receiving treatment for his drink problem.","Justin Snodin, 40, was going from Louth to Horncastle, Lincs.

Megan was able to leave the UK while police investigated her . relationship with Forrest, the authorities will want to know how mother-of-five Mrs Wilson's passport came into her hands. They will also want to know what a young teenager was able to cross Europe pretending to be a 37-year-old woman. A UK Border Agency spokesman said that the travel company which the couple used to get to France were responsible for checking passport details - but it is unclear which agency the duo used. The shocking details emerged as it was . revealed the married man may have been planning to start a new . life in France with schoolgirl Megan Stammers. Hours after the pair were found . ‘strolling hand in hand’ in Bordeaux, extraordinary details emerged of . their eight days on the run. French . police believe they may have ‘dumped’ Forrest’s car in Paris before . travelling 400 miles by train to the city in the south-west of the . country. Once there, they say married maths teacher Forrest was trying to find work as a barman before gendarmes and British police finally tracked the pair down. They were on their way to a job interview when they were apprehended in a city centre street. Beautiful bride: Emily Forrest, pictured with Jeremy on their wedding day, has maintained a dignified silence since her husband disappeared with the school pupil . Bustling: The street Sainte-Catherine where the British schoolgirl, Megan Stammers, 15, and her maths teacher, Jeremy Forrest, 30, were found by the police in Bordeaux . Megan was left in floods of tears . after gendarmes swooped in the busy shopping area at lunchtime yesterday . to arrest Forrest, 30, on suspicion of child abduction. She . was taken into protective custody as her overjoyed family – who have . now spoken to Megan by telephone – prepared for an emotional reunion. The 15-year-old’s stepfather Martin Stammers said he was ‘over the moon’. ‘I’m . thrilled and overjoyed. The most amazing thing is the joy I feel in . here,’ he added, pointing to his heart. ‘You can’t describe the . feeling.’ Megan and Forrest . sparked an international manhunt after boarding a cross-Channel ferry . last Thursday, 24 hours after the teacher was told he was due to be . suspended. Staff at the . Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex are believed to . have alerted British police to their concerns about the relationship . between teacher and pupil. Despite . this, the pair were able to travel to France, and until yesterday the . last confirmed sighting was CCTV footage of them arm-in-arm on the . ferry. Mrs Wilson has always said that she and Megan's stepfather, Martin Stammers, 43, knew . nothing about the UK authorities being concerned about the teenager's . closeness to Forrest. French police piecing together their journey believe they then drove south from Calais and spent ‘a long stop-over in Paris’. Their . black Ford Fiesta has been found abandoned in the French capital, where . they are believed to have been spotted by a British tourist last . Sunday. A French police . source said: ‘They dumped their car close to a mainline station and . headed for Bordeaux – clearly they knew the authorities were on to them. ‘They . thought they could blend into day-to-day life in Bordeaux, with reports . that Forrest had been applying for bar jobs as recently as last night.’ The pair had been in the city – a . popular destination with British tourists, with UK newspapers widely . available – since at least Wednesday when a witness contacted police to . say they had been spotted, according to the local public prosecutor, . Agnes Aubouin. Relieved: Megan's mother Danielle (left) and her stepfather Martin Stammers (right) are thrilled she is safe . Forrest, from . Ringmer, near Lewes, was due before a judge at a private hearing in . Bordeaux last night to be formally served with a European arrest warrant . and remanded in custody. He . will appear at a public hearing in Bordeaux’s Court of Appeal on . Tuesday and his fast-track extradition back to the UK is expected within . days. According to legal . sources in Bordeaux, Megan was staying at the British consulate in the . city before returning home late last night or today. Teacher and pupil . were finally found after both sets of parents made emotional televised . appeals begging them to make contact and return home. The pair had been in the city – a . popular destination with British tourists, with UK newspapers widely . available – since at least Wednesday when a witness contacted police to . say they had been spotted, according to the local public prosecutor, . Agnes Aubouin. They were stopped by police at 12.20pm UK time in the Rue Sainte-Catherine and were split up from each other. A . Bordeaux police spokesman said: ‘They were spotted in  a street in the . city centre. A member of the public alerted  us after recognising them . from the media. ‘Megan is . safe and well and under police protection. Forrest is being held in . Bordeaux’s main police station on suspicion of child abduction.’ Thursday September 20 Megan leaves her home and tells her mother she is staying overnight at a friend’s house. She and Forrest later board the Dover to Calais ferry in his Ford Fiesta. Seen on CCTV walking arm in arm. Friday Megan is reported missing after she fails to arrive at school. One of her friends receives a text saying she has arrived in France. Saturday The pupil’s stepfather Martin Stammers appeals for her to get in touch saying: ‘We are worried and miss you terribly.’ Sunday Police watch Calais in the hope the pair will use their return tickets. Chief Inspector Jason Tingley, of Sussex Police, describes it as a ‘critical stage of the investigation’. The pair do not turn up. Megan’s family and friends make appeals on social networking sites. Officers urge Forrest or the teenager to get in touch. Monday Details emerge of a blog written by Forrest four months earlier describing a ‘moral dilemma’ he faces in a posting headed: ‘You hit me just like heroin...’ It is not known who he was talking about. Megan’s mother, Danielle Wilson, appeals to her directly, saying: ‘I don’t care what you’ve done, I just want you home.’ Megan’s family explain she had been receiving extra maths lessons from Forrest for several months but did not suspect there was anything more to the pair’s relationship. Tuesday The Mail reveals one of Megan’s friends had reported concerns to a teacher seven months before they vanished and education chiefs admit an investigation was under way. Wednesday Reports suggest police had taken possession of Megan’s phone in the week she went missing. ThursdayForrest's parents Jim and Julie Forrest appeal directly to their son to get in touch, saying: ‘We are all here for you both.  Please, please get in contact.’ BBC’s Crimewatch programme features an appeal. YesterdayMegan found ‘safe and well’ in Bordeaux. Forrest arrested. Forrest . was made a ‘garde a vu’ – a French legal expression which effectively . means that  a suspect in custody and  facing charges. A . French police source  said: ‘She is on the surface safe and well. Megan . was in tears when she was taken away from the arrested man by women . police officers. She will remain in the care of the authorities. She . will soon be returned to her family in Britain.’ Friends and neighbours of the family expressed their relief at the news last night. Neighbour Kersti Barnes, 37, said: ‘When I found out Megan was missing I was devastated. ‘It’s just absolutely fantastic that she’s back and thank  God nothing happened to her other than that she was with somebody else. ‘At the end of the day it could have been worse. I’m just absolutely elated for her parents’ sake because they are absolutely amazing people.’ Neighbour Kerry Davies, 40, said: ‘We are just glad that she’s safe and well.’ Neighbour Rick Smith, 26, added: ‘It’s good news. I always hoped she was safe, I didn’t imagine she would be in any trouble.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Megan Stammers was able to get a ferry with her mother Danielle Wilson's passport, it was claimed .

"By . Reuters Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:13 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 3 October 2012 . President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney have spent millions defining themselves to the American public using campaign ads. Now a new poll defines the elusive undecided voter: these elusive citizens are more likely to be female, white, lacking a college education and earning less than $25,000. According to Reuters/Ipsos polling data accumulated over the course of 2012, the 'undecideds' make up roughly 6 per cent of the electorate. Key voters: A new Reuters poll highlights demographic trends in undecided voters, which some analysts say likens them to 'Walmart moms' because the are mostly female who earn less than $25,000 . Given demographics, there is a slightly higher concentration of said voters in an Upper Midwest region including Ohio and Wisconsin, swing states that could determine the outcome of a close election. Even though such voters are expensive to win over and perhaps less likely to make it to the polls, they continue to capture the attention of campaigns and political analysts for their potential to tilt the result in a tight race. After a long campaign season, the undecideds have also earned scorn from some pundits and humorists, incredulous that anyone could remain uncertain after months of campaign advertising and media coverage. 'Low-information voter' is one of the more polite names attached to this group. 'This year at the debates we should skip that thing where the undecideds dial in their reaction to every little moment,' remarked television host Bill Maher, 'and instead hook up the dial to their foreheads to see if there is any measurable brain activity.' Calling the satire unfair, Romney pollster Neil Newhouse refers to the demographic tendencies found in the Reuters/Ipsos poll as 'Walmart moms.' Fifty-four per cent of undecided voters are women. 'Overwhelmingly they are concerned with their family budgets, not the national budget,' Newhouse said. 'They are concerned about putting food on the table or gas in the tank. They haven't tuned into the campaign yet because they are struggling with their daily lives. They are living one paycheck away from going off the financial cliff.' Among poll respondents who answered 10 on a 1-to-10 scale of their intention to vote, the undecided group was more likely to choose 'none,' 'other,' 'don't know' or 'refuse to answer' on a broad range of questions about the presidential candidates and national political issues. On questions about the budget deficit, same-sex marriage, healthcare and immigration, this same subset was twice as likely as all likely voters to answer 'unsure' when asked about their personal views. More of them believe the country is on the wrong track - 75 per cent, compared to 60 per cent - and they are much more likely to respond 'neither' when asked whether Obama or Romney is the more eloquent, presidential, or likeable candidate. Voting tendencies: 'Overwhelmingly they are concerned with their family budgets, not the national budget,' Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said of the so-called 'Walmart moms' 'I just don't feel like either of them are trustworthy,' said Helen Krueger, 54, an undecided voter and mother of seven from Grants Pass, Oregon, who voted for John McCain in 2008. 'I normally make up my mind and know who I'm going to vote for. This time I need to do more research.' Obama, she said, has done a 'lousy job.' Romney? 'I don't think we should be taxing the medium class and low class and letting the rich get by without having to pay (taxes), and that's what I feel he wants.' Krueger said she receives three or four automated phone calls a week from the Romney campaign. She listened the first time. Now she just hangs up. Lynette Povsha, 39, another undecided voter from Missoula, Montana, has been out of work three years and is ignoring her medical bills. She said neither candidate offers her any hope. 'The economy keeps getting worse. My electricity's been off for months. I don't qualify for (public assistance). I'm a white woman at 40 with no kids,' said Povsha, who voted for McCain in 2008 and has yet to be contacted by the campaigns this year. 'I don't see what either of these presidential wannabes can do for me. I might put Mickey Mouse down for president.' DeEntre Thompson, 38, a school bus driver from Columbus, Ohio, said he doubted either Obama or Romney could win his vote. He said he voted for Bill Clinton twice, George W. Bush twice, and 'reluctantly' for McCain in 2008. 'With the two clowns that are running, I say 'undecided' because I don't have a third option,' Thompson said, lamenting the lack of a strong third-party candidate. 'If one of them showed up at my door and paid all my bills, he could sway me. Anything short of that, no.' Experts debate whether it is more cost-effective to court undecided voters or spend the time and money getting loyal supporters to the polls. 'What's most important in this race is which party is most able to motivate its base,' said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Still, 'it could be worthwhile for the campaigns to go after (undecided voters) because in several states it's a very close race, and it could be decided by one or two percentage points.' When Ipsos looked at current undecided respondents who voted in the 2008 presidential race, the undecideds were slightly more concentrated in a region the Census Bureau defines as the East North Central, comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. Nationally, 76 per cent were white compared to 72 per cent for all likely voters. The Romney campaign is making a special effort to woo the undecideds in swing states with phone calls, direct mail, email and one-on-one contact, Newhouse said. 'They sound like voters who are up for grabs. These are encouraging demographics for us,' he said, even though Romney's overall standing among women in the Reuters/Ipsos poll is 33 per cent. The Obama campaign has an extensive ground organization that emphasizes neighbor-to-neighbor contact with undecided voters. That kind of personalized contact is the most effective way to mobilize the undecideds, said Diana Owen, a political science professor at Georgetown University, but it is also expensive. 'That being said,' Owen said, 'it's never good to write off a sizeable constituency. As we saw in 2000, it takes very few votes to switch the outcome of an election.' The poll has surveyed nearly 100,000 voters since January 1.","Undecided voters tend to be female, earn less than $25,000, and do not have a college degree .

"By . Chris Hastings . PUBLISHED: . 16:41 EST, 6 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:46 EST, 6 October 2012 . The tragic death of poet John Keats at the age of just 25 may have been due to his mother’s heavy drinking, according to a new biography. Professor Nicholas Roe has drawn upon new medical evidence to suggest that Keats – one of the main Romantic poets along with Shelley and Lord Byron – may have suffered from foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) caused by his mother’s drinking while she was pregnant. FAS is a series of mental and physical defects which can occur in a foetus which has had exposure to alcohol. Gifted: A painting of John Keats . Roe, chair of the Keats Foundation, has highlighted research by the eminent professor Brian Livesley which suggests the poet’s small head and projecting upper lip are clear symptoms of a foetal alcohol effect. The research also suggests the poet’s small stature, stocky upper torso and small lower limbs are evidence of a congenital  cardio-vascular condition. In the book, John Keats, he argues that FAS may have also left him vulnerable to disease, including the TB which killed him in Rome in 1821. He writes: ‘Keats was born prematurely because his mother drank. Aspects of Keats’s physiognomy – the small head and faded hands with swollen veins – suggest symptoms of what we would now call foetal alcohol syndrome which may have rendered him susceptible to disease.’ New research: Professor Roe has drawn on new evidence to suggest Keats may have had the syndrome . Although Keats did have some of the physical attributes associated with FAS, the claim is likely to prove controversial. Dr Simon Newell, a consultant and senior clinical lecturer in neonatal medicine at Leeds Teaching Hospital, last night remained unconvinced. He said: ‘It is true that being a small baby and short of stature is something that goes with FAS. 'But being small is much more common than the syndrome. 'Around 60 per cent of people who suffer from the condition have poor IQ and language skills and clearly that was not a problem for Keats.’ Roe’s biography charts Keats’ fraught relationship with his mother Frances, a known drinker, and examines the way this affected his work and his relationships with women. Roe also sheds light on the poet’s  celebrated, but unconsummated, relationship with Fanny Brawne, cited as an inspiration for one of his most well known sonnets, Bright Star. He is convinced the couple’s mutual attraction would have faded if it had not been for Keats’ premature death. He says: ‘I think temperamentally and pathologically the relationship with Fanny Brawne would have floundered sooner or later if he had lived. It’s a very different view from Bright Star... because I think the evidence points in a much darker direction. I think it was a relationship of dazzling intensity but at the same time full of suspicion, jealousy, resentment and bitterness.’ Roe also claims that Keats believed the failure to consummate the relationship was one of the reasons for his illness. He writes: ‘As he becomes severely ill he attributes the illness to the fact he could not express himself sexually. 'It was bound up with neurotic ideas that sexual frustration was causing his TB.’ Keats enjoyed little success during his lifetime but his poems today are among the most celebrated in the English language. John Keats, by Nicholas Roe, is published by Yale University Press.","The condition, caused by mothers drinking alcohol while pregnant, causes low birth weight and physical defects .

As his new $1.2 million limited edition Bugatti Veyron came off the road three years ago and crashed into three-feet of salt water, driver Andy House had no idea the incident was being filmed. Veering off the Interstate 45 feeder road in Texas and into La Marque lagoon, auto dealer House told police that he dropped his phone while driving and that when he looked up, he saw a pelican, swerved off the road and crashed. However, upon filing a $2.2 million claim for the totaled car, House was hit with a lawsuit scheduled to begin in Galveston this week from his Philadelphia insurers who claimed that he was committing fraud because there is no pelican visible in the video.

Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co. said that it issued the $2.2 million policy on the 2006 Bugatti, of which of only 300 were made, three weeks before the accident. Using the video evidence in their civil lawsuit, the insurance company also says that House, who owns Performance Auto Sales in Lufkin, made no attempts to brake and he 'intentionally drove the Bugatti into the lagoon to destroy the car and collect proceeds approximately twice the value of the car.' The East Coast insurance firm also claims that in addition to the video which has been viewed 3.7 million times it has an informant who alleges that House offered him cash to steal the car and set it on fire.

"By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 02:57 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 6 October 2012 . One of Britain's most highly paid police officers became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years yesterday. Sean Price was found guilty of asking a colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority chairman's daughter and subsequently lying about it. He was dismissed from his £191,905 job as head of Cleveland Police, where he had been suspended on full pay since his arrest in August last year. Sacked: Sean Price, pictured receiving the Queen's Police Medal, has been dismissed after a police enquiry . But the 55-year-old will still enjoy his full pension of up to £128,000. Mr Price was investigated following . allegations about his role in recruiting the daughter of Dave McLuckie to a civilian post. It was . claimed he used 'undue influence' to get her the job. Nicholas Long, of the IPCC, branded Mr Price 'shameful' and said he had failed the force and the public. The decision means Mr Price escapes a further inquiry into claims that he abused his force credit card and concealed the arrest of his wife, Heather Eastwood, a detective chief inspector, for being drunk and disorderly. However, he could yet be prosecuted for corruption and fraud because he is at the centre of an investigation into how Cleveland awarded small-scale contracts for maintenance work and other routine business. Detective . Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood was arrested by North Yorkshire Police . on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Northallerton on April 4 last year, before they were married. She . was released with no further action being taken, but she and Mr Price, . who allegedly knew of the arrest, are suspected of failing to notify . their employer, Cleveland Police. Circumstances . surrounding her arrest were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) by Cleveland Police . and Cleveland Police Authority in May and an investigation was launched. Ms Eastwood married Mr Price this year and is expecting their baby. Investigation: Mr Price (left) was the subject of a separate inquiry over the arrest of his wife, Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood (right) The last officer of his rank to be fired . on the charge was Stanley Parr, who lost his job as Lancashire . Constabulary’s Chief Constable in 1977, while former North Yorkshire . chief constable Grahame Maxwell left the force, but avoided the sack, . after admitting to gross misconduct in 2011. IPCC commissioner Nicholas Long said Mr Price believed his position meant he could order people to do as he wished, adding that his standards have fallen far below what would be expected. He said: 'Sean Price's attempts to mislead the IPCC investigation by lying and putting pressure on a member of staff to lie on his behalf were shameful.' 'He almost got away with his attempted deception. However, the member of staff in question showed great integrity and courage in refusing to be bullied and stood up to him by asking to submit a new witness statement to the IPCC, fully explaining Mr Price's role in this matter. 'Mr Price appeared to think his position as chief constable gave him the power to order people to do as he wished. 'A chief constable must set the standards for the police force to follow. Sean Price appears to have forgotten this and he set his own standards, which fell far below those that would be expected. 'He has attempted to intimidate and bully staff under his leadership and mislead an independent investigation. 'He has failed at that - and, most significantly, he has failed the police officers and staff he led, the police service as a whole and the public of Cleveland.' Mr Long added that Cleveland Police Authority will drop a further misconduct hearing for Mr Price relating to 11 other matters in respect of gross misconduct - but he remains on police bail pending further inquiries in relation to Operation Sacristy, an ongoing inquiry into alleged police misconduct. At a news conference at police headquarters in Middlesbrough, chair of Cleveland Police Authority Stuart Drummond said the 55-year-old chief constable was dismissed 'without notice'. Out: Cleveland Police Authority agreed in August not to renew Mr Price's contract, which expires on March 31 next year . Mr Drummond hopes to give details of the misconduct allegations that Mr Price was due to face, but which will not be subject to disciplinary proceedings as he is no longer a serving officer, once lawyers allow him to release them. 'The two aspects that have been found against Mr Price are relatively recent, around a recruitment matter,' he said. 'There are 18 other charges of gross misconduct that will not be heard relating to periods going back five or six years. 'I would hope to release details of those charges as soon as that's appropriate, and people can make their own mind up.' He added: 'The two counts that have been found against Sean Price relate around dishonesty and as a police officer that has got to be sacrosanct. 'As a member of the public, you need to have the utmost faith and trust in a police officer so I am really disappointed. 'Mr Price has let himself down, he has let Cleveland Police down and the people of Cleveland.' Stuart Pudney, Cleveland Police Authority chief executive, said that as Mr Price had already served 30 years, he was still legally entitled to claim his pension. 'He will leave with his pension,' he said. 'There will be no additional payments made to him.' Mr Price released a statement denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'Clearly, I am extremely disappointed with the result today. 'I believe the disciplinary proceedings have sadly come to an incorrect conclusion. 'When the judgment was delivered and I was offered the chance to put forward mitigation I declined - the panel was mistaken in their finding and I could not seek to argue for a lesser punishment for something I haven’t done. 'I will therefore be discussing with my lawyers over the next few days how this can be addressed.' Mr Price is the first chief constable to be given the axe in 35 years. He maintains his innocence . He added: 'It is important that the public be aware that the CPS carefully studied this file and decided there was no criminal case to answer. 'Whilst the burden of proof at misconduct hearings is of a lower standard I am still perplexed as to why a misconduct panel could have found against me in the light of the evidence presented and the obvious hurdles that were placed in the way of me being able to lay the full facts of this case before the panel.' He concluded his statement by adding: 'As chief constable I have been, and remain, immensely proud of the achievements of Cleveland Police and the dedication of its officers and staff. 'They have produced record falls in crime and disorder and won the confidence and support of the communities they serve, winning the title of police force of the year in 2011. I am confident this success will continue. 'On a personal note, I continue to deny any wrongdoing is this or any other matter.' He said he will continue with a legal claim that he was unlawfully arrested and detained.

After watching his young wife succumb to the ravages of Alzheimer's, Steve Boryszczuk faced the heart-rending decision so many carers have had to confront – whether or not to place their loved one in a care home. Filled with guilt, he eventually agreed that Michelle – at 43 one of the country's youngest sufferers – needed to be looked after by health professionals. It was only when he went through her belongings that he found a comfort he could barely have hoped for. Discovery: Steve Boryszczuk, 47, found touching diary entries written by . his wife Michelle, 43, revealing her fears about Alzheimer's after she . discovered she carried the same gene defect as her father . Michelle had kept a secret diary in . which she chronicled, among many other heart-rending emotions, her . realisation and acceptance of that fate.

Michelle had started her diary when . she learned she had early onset Alzheimer's at 39. The hand-written . pages provided some solace to her husband by assuring him that he had . followed the unspoken wishes of the mother-of-two. Her move to a professional environment . providing round-the-clock care was given implicit approval when she . wrote how she realised she would eventually have to reside in a . 'specialist unit or hospice'. Mr Boryszczuk, who gave up his job as a . lorry driver to look after his wife of 27 years and still spends up to . 12 hours a day by her bedside, has now released excerpts from the diary . to raise awareness of the condition. 'It's difficult when you watch a loved . one slip away and there's nothing you can do to stop it,' said the . 47-year-old, who lives in Wickenby, Lincolnshire.
