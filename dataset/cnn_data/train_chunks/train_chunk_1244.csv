"Mistreated: Filipino care home worker Jonathan Aquino, picured arriving at Blackfriars Crown Court, was jailed for 18 months . A nurse secretly filmed attacking an elderly Alzheimer’s sufferer in her care home bed was jailed yesterday. Jonathan . Aquino, 30, was caught when Jane Worroll suspected her mother Maria, . 80, was being mistreated and hid a camera in her bedroom. In . the harrowing images, Aquino is seen to suddenly strike the retired . school canteen manager in the face before slapping her arms repeatedly. The Filipino, who has an 18 month-old daughter, then finishes the attack by hitting Mrs Worroll in her abdomen four times. Sentencing Aquino to 18 months in jail, Judge Henry Blacksell QC told the nurse he was guilty of a ‘dreadful breach of trust’. ‘It . is distressing for anybody to have to watch what’s contained on the . footage,’ he said at Blackfriars Crown Court, central London. ‘This poor woman had been transferred to this institution in the hope that she should receive proper care and attention. ‘Quite . rightly, society in general is extremely concerned about the treatment . of the elderly and vulnerable in institutions such as this. 'They should . be able to expect better, and I am afraid those who are caught misusing . their responsibility should be held to account.’ The assaults took place at the Ash Court care home in Kentish Town, North London on June 21 last year. Mrs Worroll, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2008, had been living at the home since July 2010. She . has since been moved to another care home. After being told of the . film’s existence, Aquino, who has no previous convictions, burst into . tears and apologised. He was later sacked. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that the footage of Aquino hitting Ms Worroll was 'distressing' for anyone who had to watch it . Brinder Soora, prosecuting, said it was clearly evident that the home’s own rules were frequently breached by its care staff. Caught: Mr Aquino was caught when Maria Worroll's daugher Jane . (pictured) suspected she was being neglected and installed a secret . camera in her room . ‘Two care workers must be present when . a resident is put to bed, and bathing and cleaning should be carried . out by a female care worker,’ she said. ‘Again, . that was not adhered to. This is not a complaint lodged at Mr Aquino’s . feet – it was a problem that was clearly evident at the care home . itself.’ Despite this, it emerged that the care home had been given an . excellent rating by regulators in 2009. Speaking . outside court, Jane Worroll said: ‘Nobody as vulnerable as my mother . should ever have to suffer or endure the unprovoked attack and . mistreatment she has experienced at the hands of her supposed carers. ‘Had . it not been for my actions, this abuse may never have been exposed, as I . do not believe the existing safeguarding measures provide adequate . protection. ‘The emotional . impact this experience has had on me has been completely devastating. If . this happened to my mother and was only discovered because of a hidden . camera, what else is happening to other elderly people in care? ‘I . believe the current care system for these people needs a complete . review; we need robust strategies put in place to put an end to  this . suffering.’ A spokesman for Ash Court said staff had been shocked by the case, adding: ‘We are pleased justice has been done.’ Aquino, of Tottenham, North London, admitted common assault and ill treatment of a vulnerable person.","Jonathan Aquino hit frail Maria Worroll in the face and abdomen .

"Iain Duncan Smith will today suggest that Britain will never be able to compete on the world stage unless his welfare reforms are put at the heart of the economic recovery plan. The Work and Pensions Secretary will make a speech outlining how reducing dependency on welfare is getting more British people into work. He will say: ‘The core and point of the economic plan, the driving force, is the quality of the people who make it happen – the British people – for no plan can work unless their well-being is at the heart of it. ‘But none of this is deliverable if we don’t deal with the British domestic problem. The economy can never be where it should, holding its own in this tough world market place, unless British families play a full productive part in that plan.’ Scroll down for video . Iain Dunch Smith will make a speech outlining his welfare reforms to help the economic recovery plan . Video courtesy of Centre For Social Justice . Mr Duncan Smith will also say that half of the jobs created under Labour were filled by foreign nationals, while many Britons were ‘in a cycle of dependency’. But in the past year a million jobs have been created and three quarters have gone to Britons. It comes as analysts said that Britain is in a period of low wage growth, meaning the Bank of England could delay the expected rise in interest rates until next year. The amount that those in work are earning is not growing as fast as expected. Governor Mark Carney will present his latest predictions on the economy in his quarterly inflation report on Wednesday. Wage growth is key to boosting the economy so once this it is on track it is likely interest rates will start to rise to prevent inflation. The inflation report will give the best indication yet on whether rates are likely to rise before the end of 2014. Experts last night said the decision was on a ‘knife edge’.

"Alan Titchmarsh is embroiled in a row with a University of Winchester professor - on the subject of gay sex with teenagers . As the next Chancellor of the University of Winchester, Alan Titchmarsh will be expected at all times to uphold the institution’s good name. But, nearly six months before he takes up the post, he is already embroiled in a row with one of the university’s academics – on the subject of gay sex with teenagers. The television gardener has attacked Professor Eric Anderson, 46, who boasted in a lecture that gay sex is best, that he targets 16 to 18-year-olds, that he had already had sex with more than 1,000 teenagers and men, and that he planned to double the total even if he had to pay young prostitutes. Mr Titchmarsh, 65, says he is a committed Christian who deplores Prof Anderson’s comments and is worried about the pressure ‘impressionable’ 16-year-old boys face to have sex. He told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s not that I’m homophobic – I’ve got some very good friends who are homosexuals. But I’m talking about sex with young boys. There’s a fine line between the age of consent and the other side of it.’ However two years ago the TV presenter chuckled when the professor – a guest on his afternoon chat show – declared: ‘Men just want sex with many people.’ Prof Anderson – said to be planning a complaint about the criticism from Mr Titchmarsh – would only say: ‘I have not met Alan Titchmarsh since I was a guest on his show talking about the value of men cheating and of open sexual relationships.’ The American academic, who is married to a man, is Winchester University’s professor of Sport, Masculinities and Sexualities. He gave his lecture entitled ‘Why gay sex is best’ to the Oxford University Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender society in 2011, but it only recently came to light. As well as his boast of sex with ‘easily over 1,000 people’, he is said to have added that he enjoyed voyages on cruise ships because ‘it’s like sex tourism’. The professor, who is said to be considering complaining about Mr Titchmarsh (pictured), was a guest on his chatshow two years ago . In response to criticism he later said ‘sex should only occur between consenting adults’. But a small pressure group calling itself Because Children Matter began a campaign for Prof Anderson to be sacked. Winchester University said he had been reprimanded, but defended him as an ‘internationally renowned gay scholar’. Professor Eric Anderson says he has slept with 1,000 men and boasted of having sex with 16-year-olds . When Mr Titchmarsh was last month appointed the next chancellor, or ceremonial head, of the university, he was asked by Because Children Matter to refuse the post unless Prof Anderson was sacked. He replied that he was a committed Christian and deplored the professor’s comments, but felt it was ‘not justifiable’ to sack someone ‘because their sexual mores differ from one’s own’. However, he would have ‘no hesitation in encouraging appropriate and justified action’. Mr Titchmarsh, a married grandfather, has now told the Mail: ‘Prof Anderson was invited on to a stimulating, entertaining discussion on my show. Two years on I encounter him again. I’m now trying to step through this enormous can of worms without being bigoted. ‘He’s talking about young boys who are impressionable. Someone who is 16 isn’t magically prepared to resist pressure into sex. We have to be tolerant of everyone’s way of life, but I find it worrying.’ He added: ‘I’d also worry about people having sex with 16-year-old girls.’","Alan Titchmarsh slammed Professor Eric Anderson over views on gay sex .

"This is the moment a foul-mouthed rail fare cheat was on the receiving end of some rough justice, after being bundled off a train by a passenger. Footage of the teenage troublemaker being thrown off a train by a fed-up fellow traveller on the  ScotRail service between Edinburgh and Perth has become a viral hit after being uploaded to You Tube. It begins when a conductor is told the teenager doesn't have a ticket and tells the driver of the train to stop until the youngster gets off. Scroll down for the video . Is there a problem? After the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager (his white beanie hat can just be seen popping over the seats), the 'big man' stands up and approaches the conductor . Time to move on son: The burly passenger looks down on the teenager and offers the conductor his assistance . When the youth refuses a shouting match ensues until a passenger, later referred to as 'the big man' leaps to his feet and frogmarches him off the train - and keeps pushing him off when he repeatedly tries to re-board the service. A two-and-a-half minute video clip - ‘Scotrail No Ticket’ - was posted three days ago and has already been viewed almost 200,000 times. In the clip, the white-haired ScotRail worker tells the youth: 'I’ll sit here all night pal. I’m getting paid for this but they (the passengers) will start moaning.' The clip begins by showing the ticket inspector demanding the youngster leaves the train. He says he only has a single ticket to travel in the opposite direction. The youth responds by swearing back at him . The ScotRail worker then tries to embarrass the non-payer in to leaving . 'Fare dodging' passenger Sam Main, 19, has defended his behaviour after being tracked down by a local paper. He told the Edinburgh Record: ‘I had been out celebrating after an exam and I was half asleep on the train. ‘I did have a ticket but I must have handed over the wrong one to the conductor. The next thing I know this big guy is manhandling me to the door and throwing me off. University student Sam, who is studying surveying, added: ‘I couldn’t believe it when the footage turned up on YouTube.' He said he still has cuts and bruises over his cheeks (pictured above) and legs. The video continues with the lad . protesting his innocence and claiming that he showed the ScotRail . employee his ‘f*****g ticket’ while a group of stunned young children . sit close by with their furious mother. But the conductor adds: 'No you have not. Stop swearing.' The video goes on to show the boy, wearing a beanie hat, produce a single ticket that allows travel in the opposite direction. The . conductor repeats his previous threat telling the youth: 'No you are . off, we will sit here all night. Why should they pay and not you?' It is at this point that a tall, heavyset passenger gets up, approaches the pair and asks ‘Is there a problem here?’ before declaring ‘No problem - right you, off’. He then grabs the lad by the scruff of his neck and bundles him off the train, trying not to clatter into other passengers. The teenager tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to barge his way back on before the train doors close. As the large man heads back to his seat the carriage erupts into applause and one passenger is clearly heard saying 'Cheers, big man'. A ScotRail spokesman said: 'While we welcome the public’s support of our zero-tolerance stance on anti-social behaviour, our staff are trained in conflict management and we do not expect members of the public to take matters into their own hands. 'We are investigating the incident, which appears to show a person travelling without a valid ticket, refusing to pay for the journey, and swearing at a staff member in full view of customers.' Once at the train doors, the 'big man' and the ticket collector heave the youngster off the carriage . And out you go: The passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform. Each time he tries to get back in, he pushes him back out again . The ticket inspector waves away any further protests by the teenager .","Teenage 'fare dodger' Sam Main, 19, comes forward to defend his behaviour, saying he did have the right ticket and was 'manhandled' by the 'big man'"
"Women who go up one dress size every ten years are a third more likely to develop breast cancer, British research shows. Experts say there is a strong link between the amount of fat stored around the waist and the risk of tumours developing. The study by University College London academics also found that women who go up two dress sizes in a decade are 77 per cent more likely to develop the illness. A study found women who gain a dress size every ten years are a third more likely to have breast cancer . For some time researchers have known that being overweight increases the risk of breast cancer. They say that fat tissue releases the hormone oestrogen, which triggers the development of tumours. Now this latest study has shown that gaining weight around the stomach – rather than on the upper arms, thighs or bottom for example – appeared to be particularly harmful. The UCL researchers think that this type of fat produces more oestrogen than that stored elsewhere on the body. They said that after further checks, their findings could present ‘a clear and simple message’ for women that even gaining a modest amount of weight greatly increases the risk of cancer. Around one in eight women will develop breast cancer and there are 50,500 new cases in the UK every year. The study, published in journal BMJ Open, looked at the records of 93,000 women in their 50s and 60s who had all been through the menopause. This study has shown that gaining weight around the stomach appeared to be particularly harmful . Each had to complete a detailed form about their lifestyles, which included questions on height, weight, smoking and drinking habits, current dress size, and what it was when they were 25. Researchers tracked them for two years and recorded how many had developed breast cancer. They found that going up a dress size was the single most important lifestyle aspect in determining whether a woman got breast cancer. Calculations showed that going up one dress size every ten years between the ages of 25 and 65 increased the risk by 33 per cent and going up two dress sizes in a single decade raised it by 77 per cent. On average women were a size 12 when they were 25, but by the time they were in their 50s or 60s had gone up to between a 14 and 16. Only 25 per cent stayed the same or became slimmer between their 20s and 50s or 60s. The researchers say that if women dropped a dress size in ten years, their chances of breast cancer would go down by 33 per cent. However, experts said the research was unreliable because it depended on women’s memories and dress sizes remaining the same across the decades. Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Evidence tells us the most important things you can do to reduce breast cancer risk, especially after the menopause, is to keep a healthy weight, be physically active as often as you can and cut down on alcohol.’ But Simon Vincent, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘This study highlights an easy way to monitor your weight gain over time.’","Experts find strong link with amount of fat stored at waist and tumour risk .

"Donald Sterling’s wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that V. Stiviano was at his Beverly Hills mansion yesterday. The episode has sparked speculation that the disgraced former NBA owner is back together with his ex-assistant. When Shelly learned of the tryst she told Beverly Hills police that Stiviano had broken into Donald’s home. Scroll down for video . Donald Sterling’s wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that V.Stiviano (right, with Sterling) was at his Beverly Hills mansion yesterday . Shelly (left) had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills . However, police were told by Donald that the model was an ‘invited guest’, according to TMZ and she stayed in the property after they left. In August Stiviano claimed that the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his 'beard' so no one would suspect his true sexuality. Stiviano, who gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling, made the bombshell allegation in documents filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court in answer to a prior lawsuit filed by Sterling’s wife, Shelly. In her original lawsuit, Shelly had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for sexual favors. Stiviano denies those allegations and even claims that Shelly Sterling was well aware of the exact nature of the relationship between Donald Sterling and Stiviano. ‘V.S. was D.T.S’s beard for three years prior to the filing of suit,’ the answer claimed. Stiviano gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling . ‘V.S. is informed and believes that (Sterling) is a homosexual and enjoys sexual acts and or sexual congress with males.’ The answer said that Shelly Sterling was ‘acutely aware of his orientation and condoned’ his behavior, including his decision to give ‘gifts, money and other properties’ to Stiviano for her public companionship, reports the Daily News. Stiviano also says that she ‘was not ever a sexual partner’ of Donald Sterling. She also states that the gifts are considered separate property, not 'marital or community property,' because they were purchased with funds earned by Donald after separation or 'estrangement' from her wife. Stiviano also filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday. She claims they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald. 'She’s delusional,’ Sterling’s lawyer, Max Blecher, told The Daily News. The drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling berating Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5 million. Shelly, his wife of 58 years, then took control of a family trust and negotiated a record $2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Shelly Sterling said she was initially given her husband's blessing to sell the team and he praised the deal she reached. When it came time to sign it at the end of May, however, Sterling said he would not sell and would sue the league. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers at the end of August.","V.

"It was billed by those who took part as the ‘road trip to end all road trips’. Taking in a private island, one of the finest hotel suites in the world and several hundred surgically-enhanced young blondes, it did not disappoint. In fact Prince Harry’s ten-day holiday bore an uncanny resemblance to the hit film The Hangover in which a stag party trip to Sin City ends up with one member losing a tooth and another finding himself saddled with a baby – all while a tiger prowls round their hotel room. Chilling out: Prince Harry relaxes with his friends at the Sin City swimming pool. The holiday was billed by those who took part as the 'road trip to end all road trips' Perhaps the writing was already on the wall as Harry and his pals excitedly packed their bags in preparation little over a week ago. Accompanying the third in line to the throne were two of his closest friends – Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, 25, and 30-year-old Arthur Landon. The latter is the son of the infamous ‘White Sultan’, Brigadier Tim Landon, one of Britain’s richest and most secretive men. The brigadier, who died from lung cancer five years ago, amassed an estimated £500million fortune as an adventurer and arms dealer in oil-rich Oman. His Ampleforth College and Bristol University-educated son and heir has since been named as the 397th wealthiest person in Britain with a personal fortune estimated at £200million. According to close friends, Arthur posted a picture of his ‘dubious’ suitcase on his Facebook site which included the following list: ‘2x flip flops, 3x board shorts, 8x fancy-dress outfits, 1x toothbrush, 1x toothpaste, 10x awesomeness.’ Among the fancy-dress outfits were Captain Britannia, a storm trooper and what appears to be a gas mask. The group took over a £1,000-a-day VIP bungalow at the MGM Grand Hotel for one of its infamous Wet Republic pool parties. These raucous alcohol-fuelled events are popular in Vegas and involve several thousand young people attempting to get as drunk as humanly possible while pulling members of the opposite sex . Skippy, the other member of the unholy trinity, is known as Harry’s ‘wingman’. The son of a Beaufort Hunt field-master, Bristol University economics graduate Tom is inseparable from Harry. According . to friends the two ‘egg each other on shamelessly’: just look at who . was by the prince’s side when he threw himself into a nightclub swimming . pool in Croatia last summer. Skippy . isn’t particularly shy himself at stripping off and as a fellow . redhead, bearing a passing resemblance to Sherlock star Benedict . Cumberbatch, is not averse to sharing the attentions of Harry’s many . female admirers. Accompanied . by the prince’s new romantic interest, blonde beauty Cressida Bonas, . daughter of a four-times married and divorced aristocratic 60s . ‘It-girl’, the group flew out first class en route to Sir Richard . Branson’s private British Virgin Island paradise of Necker. They . enjoyed a week-long holiday to celebrate his son Sam’s birthday (a . spokesman for Branson confirms the trip but insists that Harry paid for . his own flight). Friends . say that within hours Arthur Landon had posted a picture on Facebook of . the prince apparently passed out in the sand with the words: ‘Necker . island – Perfect Start.’ Little . is known about the rest of the holiday – suffice to say it involved . sun, sea, sand and plenty of booze – but last weekend the boys turned up . minus Miss Bonas in Las Vegas, which Harry had been keen to revisit . following a trip last year with his Army pals. Chilling out: The Prince relaxes dances in the water with a vest on reading 'Lauren's Bachelorette' that he appears to have borrowed from another party-goer . The . group were put up at the five-star Wynn casino complex in a . three-bedroom Wynn Encore Tower suite which costs a cool £5,100 a night. St James’s Palace has . not disputed suggestions that the accommodation was offered as a . ‘freebie’ or at a significantly reduced rate – not that most members of . the party couldn’t afford it. The prince’s security detail enjoyed their own room next door courtesy of the British taxpayer. Offering . unparalleled views of Sin City’s famous Strip, the duplex measures . 5,829 square feet and, as has memorably been shown, boasts its own . billiard table. The . group wasted little time in hitting the hotel’s casino that night where . Harry was seen profusely apologising to staff after accidentally . smashing his cocktail glass and spilling his drink on one of the gaming . tables. Afterwards they . were seen playing the dice game craps. And then, within hours, they had . apparently met some ‘hot chicks’ and were playing naked billiards. Bevvy of beauties: A host of girls line up at the Sin City pool party all wearing the same group T-shirt as Prince Harry . It . is not clear who are the girls featured in the nude pictures, but it is . suggested that he might have bumped into them in either the Wynn casino . or the nightclub XS. There . is little doubt over the location, though, as the distinctive checked . carpet can be seen both in the grainy mobile phone photos and in . pictures on the hotel website. It is understood that the naked . snaps were passed on to the US gossip website TMZ by a member of the . party – not one of Harry’s friends – before being posted in the early . hours of yesterday UK time. The following day they took over a . £1,000-a-day VIP bungalow at the MGM Grand Hotel for one of its infamous . Wet Republic pool parties. These . raucous alcohol-fuelled events are popular in Vegas and involve several . thousand young people attempting to get as drunk as humanly possible . while pulling members of the opposite sex in the fierce sunshine. Taking in the scenery: Harry's attention is drawn to a pneumatic blonde poolside at the MGM Grand's Wet Republic party . By . the end of the day, say those with intimate knowledge of such events, . the pools contain more urine than water and couples are openly having . sex. Harry’s bungalow came with a flat-screen TV and gaming system, chaise longues (with reversible headrests for when the sun is facing the other way), a fridge, a private spa area and bathroom as well as a ‘misting system’ spraying out filtered water to cool down overheated guests. Outside was a private Jacuzzi from which Harry and his group watched the action and chatted to a group of girls who had taken the place next door for a ‘bachelorette’, or hen party. Waiters offered a menu including £65 pitchers of ‘dragonberry’ mojitos and even a £13,000 15-litre bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. Harry stripped to a pair of flowered surfing shorts and thong-style necklace, sporting a white fedora to shade his face from the sun. The excited ladies next door were soon posting pictures on Twitter of them posing with the prince, whom they described as a ‘gentleman’. Sheepish: Prince Harry hugs a mystery blonde and . appears to send a text on his mobile phone as he is spotted in a Los . Angeles car park just an hour after naked pictures of him cavorting with . strangers in a Las Vegas hotel emerged online . Bashful: Wearing a blue shirt and cream-coloured panama hat, the prince appears far less confident than he did in the pictures of him in Las Vegas . Keeping quiet: Harry refused to comment when quizzed about the risqué snaps which were taken in a Vegas hotel suite on Friday night . ‘He asked, “Which one of you is single?”,’ said one. ‘And he was sticking out his tongue acting really loud and goofy.’ The prince apparently promised to visit the girls that night. Much to their disappointment he didn’t show. The following day he and his friends were at another pool party, at the Encore Beach Club, taking a bungalow with its own infinity hot tub. The prince’s night rounded off with a visit to XS – where other VIP guests included US Olympic gold medallist swimmer Ryan Lochte. Harry being Harry, he couldn’t resist challenging him to a race in the pool, throwing himself into the water still in his jeans. He was soon joined by the fully-clothed swimmer, who only just beat the prince in the contest thanks to a reveller grabbing his leg as he tried to kick off. Afterwards a group of Essex boys from Southend-on-Sea took to Twitter to boast about their ‘legendary night’. ‘Just spend my night with prince harry and ryan lochte, life doesn’t get any f****** better!!!!!’ said Adam Aley, before claiming that Harry jokingly suggested they all commit a sex act on each other in celebration when he stole a giant inflatable swan for him. ‘He kissed me on the lips. Ha Ha!. I can’t describe how this night was with harry!! I thru him in the pool. Legend!!! x’ When another member of the group, Tom Sims, was asked by the Mail if he would talk about the night, he replied rather touchingly: ‘No sorry!! He was so nice to us I’m not willing to speak about our night out!! We promised that we would savour the night as a memory! Best night of me life.’ What a shame for the prince that more of his new-found ‘friends’ weren’t equally discreet.","Holiday was billed by those who took part as the 'road trip to end all road trips'

"Very few ancient crafts are beyond the power of modern science - almost every single one has been bettered by industrial processes. The painstaking process of creating a samurai sword - reforged hundreds of times by hand - is one. Another - until now - has been the Stradivarius violin. Scientists puzzle over why the 650 Stradivarius violins still in existence sound so good - but after two years of CT scanning, and computer-aided carving, scientists have 'recreated' one for the first time. A precise replica of a Stradivarius violin from 1704, made using X-ray images . 'Blind' tests have shown that Stradivarii are not always the best violins in existence - but their consistently high sound quality still baffles experts. Some believe it's due to unique woods used by Antonio Stradivari, or to shaping or wood thickness in particular parts of the instruments - others believe that its due to chemical processes used to treat them. The original violin - normally stored in the US Library of Congress - next to the replica, carved using computer-controlled equipment from CT scans of the original . CNC equipment carves ultra-precise models using 3D 'scans' - and can produce a near-perfect replica based on scans of an original object. Even so, the replica was finished by hand . A new study by the Radiological Society of North America might help unravel the mystery of the violins - without destroying the precious instruments in the process. Most Stradivarii are stored in museums, and are never played. This summer, one of the instruments sold at auction for $15.9 million. The team from the RSNA used advanced computer X-Ray tomography imaging to create a 3D 'scan' of the violin - both inside and out. The CNC equipment worked from a 3D model created from 1,000 X-Rays to replicate every nook and cranny of the instrument . The 1704 violin was then reconstructed using computer-aided machine tools. 'CT scanning offers a unique method of  imaging a historical object - in a non-invasive way' said Steven Sirr, M.D., a radiologist at FirstLight Medical Systems. 'Combined with computer-aided machinery, it also offers us the opportunity to create a reproduction with a high degree of accuracy.' Antonio Stradivari, an Italian who lived from 1644 to 1737, is regarded . as history's greatest violin maker. Of the estimated 1,000 violins . Stradivari made, about 650 still exist and are highly prized for their . unique sound quality. There are many theories but no simple explanation . for the superiority of the Stradivarius. Some believe it's simply the wood Stradivari used. Many factors influence a . violin's sound - from the qualities of the wood to the instrument's . shape, degree of arching and wood thickness. To create a violin with the same characteristics as the 1704 instrument known as 'Betts' Dr. Sirr worked with professional violin makers John Waddle and Steve Rossow of St. Paul, Minnesota.'We have two goals: to understand how the violin works and to make reproductions of the world's most prized violins available for young musicians who can't afford an original,' Dr. Sirr said. The original violin was scanned with a 64-detector CT, and more than 1,000 CT images were converted into 3D image files, which can be read by a computer-controlled tool called a CNC machine - a carving device controlled by computer code. The CNC machine, custom-made for the project by Rossow, then carved the back and front plates and scroll of the violin from various woods. Finally, Waddle and Rossow finished, assembled and varnished the replica by hand.'We believe this process of recreating old and valuable stringed instruments may have a profound influence upon modern string musicians,' Dr. Sirr said. One of the X-Ray scans used to recreate 'Bettsy'. In total, 1,000 images were used . The Betts Stradivarius is held in the U.S. Library of Congress. Dr. Sirr, an amateur violinist, first scanned a violin with CT out of curiosity.'I assumed the instrument was merely a wooden shell surrounding air,' he said. 'I was totally wrong. There was a lot of anatomy inside the violin.' This revelation may help not only to build cheap reconstructions of the violins - but help design new generations of instruments. After he shared those first CT images with Waddle in 1989, the two spent years scanning more than 100 violins—including 29 valuable instruments pre-dating 1827—and other stringed instruments to better understand their composition.'Just like human beings, there is a wide range of normal variation among violins,' Dr. Sirr said. 'When you are looking at an instrument that is hundreds of years old, you will see worm holes and cracks that have been repaired.' There is also damage from being exposed to all kinds of conditions, from floods to wars.' For owners of authentic Stradivarius or other prized violins, CT imaging not only provides a definitive form of identification, it helps establish a pedigree that may increase the value of their investment. Most are collectors items, sold at auction for huge sums, or stored in museums. Dr Sirr's process may also help preserve the remaining Stradivarii. 'CT is useful in measuring wood density, size and shapes, thickness graduation and volume measurements,' Dr. Sirr said. 'It also provides detailed analysis of damage and repair.'","Discovery could pave way for cheap reproductions .

"Parents are being warned of a cancer-scare involving fake accessories for loom bands after tests revealed some imported batches were laced with deadly levels of chemicals. Safety officials have issued the stark message after intercepting rogue consignments of the bands and plastic trinkets sold with them which were headed for British shelves from the Far East. Scientists carried out rigorous tests on several loom band 'charms', accessories attached to necklaces and bracelets made from the colourful elastic bands, and each one was found to have dangerous levels of phthalates in them. Scroll down for video . Several packets of loom band 'charms' which were cheaper than the original and sold in 'unofficial' box sets were found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemical phthalates (file picture of genuine loom bands) The chemical is used to make plastics more safe and pliable but it is also a known carcinogen and its use is strictly controlled - particularly in toys that could go in the mouth. The legal limit for phthalates is 0.1 per cent by weight of the plasticised material in toys and childcare articles. Sixteen packets of the charms that came in cheaper, 'unofficial' box sets of loom bands - the latest playground craze - were randomly tested from bigger batches which had arrived into the UK from manufacturers in the Far East. They had either been sent for testing by responsible import companies or intercepted by Trading Standards on their way to high street shops. All of the 16 packets of charms tested contained more than the accepted 0.1 per cent level - with two having more than 50 per cent. The batches they came from could not be issued with safety certificates which meant they could not be distributed to high street stores. Safety officials are now urging parents to be vigilant when buying loom bands and charms, with the advice to only buy packets with the 'CE' safety mark from reputable retailers. Importers and retailers are also being encouraged to send their loom band charms to them for testing if they haven't already done so. The Birmingham Assay Office, an independent company which tests the safety of toys, carried out the investigation. It provides importers and retailers with test reports confirming whether a product has passed or failed. Phthalates are used as a softener in PVC and can be found on textiles, coated leather and more commonly plastic-type articles. They can migrate from plastic into the body if it comes into contact with saliva or sweat. Marion Wilson, from the Birmingham Assay Office, said: 'The problem we found was not with the bands but with the charms that are sold with them. 'Out of the 16 packets we tested every single charm failed because of the high levels of phthalates in them. Loom bands have soared in popularity in recent months and have been sported by the likes of Prince William . 'It's not to . say every packet of loom bands out there is affected but there are . plenty of products on the market that could be dangerous. 'We . rely on manufacturers coming to us to get their products tested and . many of the major retailers will only agree to stock products that are . certified by our laboratories. 'The worrying thing is the charms are the bits that are most likely to end up in children's mouths. 'Loom bands are the big craze at the moment and they are flooding into the country from all over the world. 'We have no idea how many of them are being tested and how many are going into circulation containing dangerous substances. 'We . don't want to be seen to be scaremongering but we are here to protect . customers so when something like this comes up we need to raise . awareness of it. 'We . would urge importers not to take any risks. Send products to our . laboratory for testing and protect people's health and your reputation.' Mother-of-two Laura Haugh said she was horrified by the news and would now stop her children James, five, and Lucy, three, from playing with loom bands. Mrs Haugh, 36, who runs the parenting website MummyPages.co.uk, said: 'It is extremely worrying news. Loom bands are the latest craze and children want to play with them but people really need to know about their risks. 'If they are dangerous then they do not belong in the home. I certainly won't be buying any more for my children and I will be alerting other parents of this potential danger. 'In light of these tests I would advise parents to find something else to entertain their children. There are lots of other toys on the market that are safe to play with.' The discovery has also prompted concerns from Trading Standards, which is struggling to police the millions of packets of loom bands flooding into the UK as the craze continues. Robert Chantry-Price, a lead officer for product safety at the Trading Standards Institute, said: 'The regulated level for phthalates in the UK is fixed at 0.1 per cent. 'When it comes to the risks they pose, it's a question of how long you are exposed to them. 'If you touched and played with a toy with phthalates in for 10 minutes, it probably wouldn't be a problem at all. 'But kids make these loom bands into bracelets and wear them for long periods so often there is direct skin contact 24 hours a day for several weeks. 'Children's skin also absorbs toxins more easily than adults. Phthalates are carcinogenic, mutagenic and cause reproductive problems. 'We don't know the true extent of the problem. Tests are being done on the precautionary principle but we have no idea what is already out there. 'Loom bands and their charms are very cheap to make. They are flooding into Britain in their millions and and it is very hard to keep tabs on them. 'With the chemicals in them, the first thing you might know about it is when you start seeing birth defects 20 years down the line when children have kiddies themselves. 'I would warn parents to be vigilant about loom bands - only buy from respected shops, not off market stalls, and look for a UK distributor's address on the packing as well as a CE mark. 'Don't allow your children to put them in their mouths.' Loom bands are largely made in China, the Far East, India and Vietnam. The new craze - where children spend hours twisting the colourful rubber bands into bracelets and jewellery - is popular around the world. Looms bands are simple, colourful, rubber bands which are weaved together to make friendship bracelets. They were invented in the U.S. last year by father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng. Since then, his company, Rainbow Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, crochet hook and bands – worldwide. The latest fashion accessory and playground craze has been seen on the arm of a number of celebrities including presenter Fearne Cotton, David Beckham, One Direction's Harry Styles and pop star Miley Cyrus. Even the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been spotted sporting the sought-after arm candy. In recent weeks, sales of loom bands have gone through the roof and they now occupy the majority of spots in Amazon's current best-selling toy chart. In addition to jewellery, loom bands can be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, phone cases and even shoes. Sales of loom bands soared earlier this year when the Duchess of Cambridge was sported wearing one . Anna Protherough, senior buyer for children at Hobbycraft said: 'The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon. 'We began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been flying off our shelves.' However, in light of the craze, medical professionals have raised concerns about the safety of the bands. It comes after a number of children were harmed playing with genuine loom bands, including one boy who nearly lost two fingers after the bands wrapped tightly around them and another who was left blinded when one hit him in the eye. Last month, Dr Anne-Marie Houlder, chair of Stafford and Surrounds Clinical Commissioning Group, warned of the dangers. She said: 'Kids obviously love playing with them but having seen the article that has hit the press, where a child had fallen asleep with some wrapped round his fingers, I would just urge parents to be vigilant. 'They could be a choking hazard or cause circulatory problems if children swallow or wrap them round their fingers for any length of time.' While genuine loom bands contain acceptable levels of phthalates – which is 0.1 per cent by weight in the UK and U.S – several counterfeit products, predominantly charms to attach to the bands, have emerged with far higher levels of the chemicals. Tests by the Assay Office in Birmingham found some batches of charms heading for British shelves contained as much as 50 per cent of phthalates. The rise of counterfeits has even prompted Rainbow Looms to issue a warning about fake products. The firm which started the craze said: Tthere are many fake/counterfeit Rainbow Loom products available online and at stores. 'Some fake products possess the same name as genuine Rainbow Loom products but these counterfeit products are unsafe for children and have not been tested in accordance with U.S. Toy Safety Standards (may contain lead and other dangerous substances).' It also warned that products could be of inferior in quality. There are fears the products – including those intercepted and tested by the Assay Office in Birmingham – are being imported to the UK from the Far East.","Tests revealed some loom band 'charms' contained high levels of phthalates .

"John Whelan was banned from driving for six months . A man was arrested in his vintage convertible for driving at five mph after drinking seven bottles of cider. John Whelan had been in the pub all day when he got behind the wheel of his £20,000 TVR Chimaera . In a bid to go unnoticed, the 25-year-old planned to drive the 200 yard stretch to his work's car park in Brecon, mid Wales, at a snail's pace to avoid police attention. But when officers pulled the quantity surveyor over, he gave a reading of 109 microgrammes of alcohol - more than three times the legal limit of 35. Whelan was banned from driving for six months and fined £660 at Brecon Magistrates Court. He was also told to attend a drink driving rehabilitation course. The court heard how Whelan had been watching the football with friends in the pub when he downed seven bottles of Mangners cider. He decided to move the car - which can go from zero to 60mph in just five seconds - to his office's car park for the evening. A by-passer noticed the bright yellow vehicle crawling up the country road and called police. Prosecuting Lisa Jones said: 'He was located by police who’d been contacted, not because he was driving too fast or swerving across the road, but because he was driving too slowly at 5mph. 'He was full compliant at the road side and was arrested following a positive road side breath test.' The 25-year-old said he now may move to a city with better public transport. The 25-year-old had been driving his £20,000 TVR Chimaera while more than three times over the legal limit . Defending Carl Millar said: 'He is a self employed quantity surveyor who relies on his car - his current contract covers a 100 mile area. 'Whelan’s future is somewhat unknown, he may move to London as the public transport system is better there or he may return home to Ireland.'","John Whelan was three times the legal limit when he drove 200 yard stretch .

"This is the unusual orphaned lamb who understands the true meaning of being a sheep dog. Timmy was just weeks old when he realised that his ambition was not to frolic in the fields with his woolly friends - it was to be a puppy. Now he lives in a kennel, eats dog biscuits and likes nothing more than a long walk in the countryside with his owners. Now that just takes the biscuit! Timmy the sheep was taken in by Samantha Perry and her husband Eric, pictured, and raised on their smallholding alongside the couple's seven dogs . Baa-king: Timmy looks rather funny eating dog treats with his canine friends . Walkies! The 18-month-old was bottle-reared by the Perrys and slept in a kennel while growing up . Timmy was bottle-reared by Samantha and Eric Perry at their smallholding in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, from after he was orphaned at just a few days old. The 18-month-old, 200lb animal was originally allowed in the house, and now lives outside in a kennel along with six dogs belonging to the farm. Mrs Perry, 42, said: 'Timmy definitely thinks he’s a dog - he always has. 'He will eat absolutely anything we give him but his favourite food is dog biscuits. He absolutely loves them. When we take the dogs for a walk, he thinks nothing of coming along with us. Unique character: Mrs Perry said the 200lb animal is very popular with children in the village of Aston-on-Trent . Fish out of water: Timmy chose to act like a dog, but he could just as easily have decided to mimic the farm's donkeys, geese, ducks or cats . 'He’s become quite a popular figure with the people in the village, especially the children. They seem to love him.' Clover Leaf Farm is also home to a Yorkshire terrier Poppy, seven; Shih tzu Daisy-May, five; three-year-old Cairn terrier Tyson; Jack Russell Sapphire, two; and Jack Russell/Yorkshire terrier cross Barney, also two. They have now been joined by Pandora, a nine-month-old Chihuahua. And the menagerie does not stop with Timmy and the dogs. Peculiar pet: Timmy was  raised alongside the couple's six dogs, who include a Yorkshire terrier, Shih tzu, Cairn terrier, Jack Russell and a Chihuahua . Born to be different: The couple's grandson Oliver Perry feeding Timmy and another lamb when they were young . The Perrys also have three donkeys, including nine-week-old Marley, geese, ducks and cats. Mr Perry has owned the smallholding for 20 years and they have lived there for 10 years. Mrs Perry said: 'Bearing in mind Pandora is only nine months old, she took to Timmy straight away and he is great with her and all the other dogs, just getting on and doing the things they do. 'I suppose some people might see having a pet sheep as a bit strange but we don’t see it that way. To us, he’s just part of the farm. 'The fact that he thinks he’s a dog at the same time just adds a little eccentricity. 'The other dogs accept him as one of theirs and he seems perfectly happy. 'We are used to all these animals running around anyway so why not have a sheep joining in the fun, too?'","The 18-month-old eats dog biscuits and takes walks with his owners .

"Once upon a time an American family’s home was their castle and the bigger the better, but growing concerns about meeting mortgage payments and the environmental impact of large houses has helped fuel a new movement of people who are happy to live small. The Tiny House Movement is a growing group of people who are happy to downsize the space that they live in and enjoy simplified lives as a result. While the average American home is around 2600 square feet, the typical small or tiny house is around 100-400 square feet. Scroll down for video . The Tiny House Movement is a growing group of people who are happy to downsize the space that they live in and enjoy simplified lives as a result . Buyers can be anyone from millennials and newlyweds who want to avoid the 30-year mortgage path to retirees who are downsizing and simplifying for a more carefree lifestyle . Large homes come at a cost and most Americans spent between 1/3 and 1/2 of their income on keeping a roof over their heads, as a result 76 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. To escape the cycle of debt that increasing comes with the large house and the white picket fence, some people are attracted by the simplicity of the Tiny House Movement. One company at the heart of the movement is the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company, which teaches workshops all over the country on how to build tiny homes. The Sonoma, California, company also offer tiny house floor plans and build homes for people who want their ‘houses-to-go’ ready-made and delivered.

"Violence: President al-Assad has been supplied with Russian cruise missiles . Russia last night admitted it had defied the West and supplied Syrian president Bashar al-Assad with a batch of cruise missiles. Despite warnings today that the country was in civil war and ongoing concerns over terror tactics used against civilians, Moscow will also go-ahead with training the dictator's troops to use the state-of-the-art weapons. 'Supersonic anti-ship Yakhont cruise missiles have been delivered to Syria,' said an informed Russian source. A total of 72 missiles were ordered by Damascus, but Moscow did not make clear how many had been delivered in the recent past. 'These arms will make it possible to defend Syria's entire coastline against a potential attack from sea,' said another source. Israel fears the cruise missiles could fall into the hands of Hezbollah militants in neighbouring Lebanon. The US also sought to halt arms sales to the Syrian ruler after his bloody crackdowns on street protests. Moscow insists that a deal on the missiles and radar equipment, signed in 2007, is legal under international law. With instability growing in the region, Moscow may have calculated that by arming the dictator, it reduces the chances of Western intervention in the country. The revelation came as  the U.N.'s top human rights official warned today that Syria has entered a state of civil war with more than 4,000 people dead and an increasing number of soldiers defecting from the army to take up arms against the the president. Syrian president Bashar Assad has been trying to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule, but the violence has only intensified. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said the death toll for the revolt stands 'at 4,000 but really the information coming to us is that it's much more than that.' Heavy arms: A cruise missile similar to those shipped to Syria by Russia takes off during a test flight in the desert . 'As soon as there were more and more defectors threatening to take up arms, I said this in August before the Security Council, that there's going to be a civil war,' Pillay said, speaking today in Geneva. 'And at the moment that's how I am characterizing this.' The scathing criticism from Pillay comes as the pressure piles on Assad from home and abroad. The European Union imposed fresh sanctions on Damascus today, while the Syrian opposition called a general strike inside the country. The recent spate of economic sanctions from the EU, the Arab League and Turkey are punishing Syria's ailing economy, a dangerous development for the government in Damascus. Syrian business leaders have long traded political freedoms for economic privileges in the country, where the prosperous merchant classes are key to propping up the regime. But the sanctions, coupled with increasing calls for strikes, could sap their resolve. Demonstrators wave green, white and black flags during a protest march against president al-Assad in Khalidieh, near Homs, earlier this week . Support for the regime: A Syrian woman holds up a copy of the Muslim Koran next to a Christian icons, during a rally against sanctions imposed against by the Arab League . The new EU sanctions target 12 people and 11 companies, and add to a long list of those previously sanctioned by the EU. The full list of names of those targeted will not be known until they are published in the official journal of the EU tomorrow. The 27-member bloc also imposed some sanctions on Syria's ally Iran in the wake of an attack this week by a mob on the British Embassy in Tehran, the Iranian capital. British Foreign Secretary William Hague accused Iran of supporting Assad's crackdown, saying 'there is a link between what is happening in Iran and what is happening in Syria.' The sanctions came as Syrian troops stormed a village in the central province of Hama, killing at least six people - the latest in what has become daily violence and bloodshed in the country. It was difficult to gauge how widely Syrians were abiding by Thursday's strike, which activists announced on an opposition Facebook page. The regime has sealed the country off from foreign journalists and prevented independent reporting. Syria warning: U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay . Residents in Syria's two economic powerhouses - the capital, Damascus, and the northern city of Aleppo - reported business as usual Thursday. But in the flashpoint city of Homs, a resident said that most of the shops were closed, except for those selling food. Homs has been one of Syria's most volatile cities, with increasing clashes between troops and army defectors. 'Few people are in the streets and only about 20 percent of students went to schools and universities,' said one resident, who asked that his name not be made public for fear of government reprisals. A video posted online by activists showed mostly closed shops in the Damascus suburb of Zabadani, which also has seen large anti-regime protests. Despite the recent diplomatic squeeze and Thursday's strike, the government has shown little sign of easing its crackdown. The Local Coordination Committees activist group said security forces swept through the village of Traimseh in the central province of Hama. The group said six people were killed, without giving further details. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said six people were killed and nine wounded in Traimseh. It added that the operation was continuing in the village. Earlier today the government took local journalists on a trip to the village of Kfarbo in Hama province, where they spoke to the family of a nine-year-old boy who was shot dead in Homs three days ago while he was buying cookies from a shop. 'He was holding a biscuit in his hand not a pistol,' said the child's mother, Georgina Mtanious al-Jammal. 'They have burned my heart.' She blamed 'armed terrorists' for killing her son. The shooting is particularly resonant in Syria because the boy, Sari Saoud, was from a Christian family. Christians and other religious minorities in Syria generally support the regime because they feel it offers them important protections. Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, and many minorities fear they will be marginalized if a Sunni regime takes over. Assad and the ruling elite are from the tiny Alawite sect.","Death toll in Syrian conflict stands at 4,000 ."
"The nation held up by the Liberal Democrats yesterday as a shining example of how to win the war on drugs is far from the unqualified success story they make out. For the number of children using drugs in Portugal has more than doubled since the country’s laws were liberalised, the latest figures show. A decade after the law was relaxed, nearly a fifth of 15 and 16-year-olds use drugs – well over twice the number in the years before decriminalisation. The controversial Home Office report commissioned by the Liberal Democrats states: ‘It is clear that there has not been a lasting and significant increase in drug use in Portugal since 2001.’ But the evidence suggests otherwise. Injecting: A young drug user in a Portugese slum with a needle hanging out of his arm and cigarette in hand . The most recent independent report on what is happening in Portugal shows that in 1995 eight per cent of Portuguese teenagers had tried drugs. In 1999, when laws began to be relaxed, it was 12 per cent. But after decriminalisation in 2001, it rose to 18 per cent in 2003 and 19 per cent in 2011. The picture for cannabis use is similar. In 1995, only 7 per cent of Portuguese teens had tried the drug but by 2011 the figure was 16 per cent. The report, by the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, looked at 100,000 15 and 16-year-olds across Europe. Its most alarming finding covers children under 13 in Portugal. In 1999, 2 per cent had tried cannabis. By 2003, that had risen to 4 per cent and remained at that level in 2011. The Home Office report based its contrary findings on evidence from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the EU drugs watchdog, which is based in Lisbon. But even the watchdog’s verdict on Portugal is contradictory. It has not endorsed Portugal’s own drug abuse figures from a 2012 survey, saying the results are not yet available. But it adds that the country’s survey of children’s health ‘indicates an increase in the prevalence of cannabis use in the period 2006-10’. The EU watchdog endorses ESPAD’s verdict. ‘The most recent ESPAD study corroborates the findings, showing an increase in consumption of illicit substances since 2006,’ its report on Portugal says. ‘This trend is observed among both male and female students.’ However the Home Office report accepted, without qualification or reference to other sources, the Portuguese government’s figures produced by Portugal’s drug control agency SICAD. Legalised: A report has revealed that since drug laws were relaxed in Portugal, the number of children using drugs has more than doubled with nearly a fifth of 15 and 16-year-olds using drugs . It says that among all Portuguese adults the proportion that had used cannabis in the last year was 3.3 per cent in 2001, 3.6 per cent in 2007 and 2.7 per cent in 2012. On the basis of these figures, the Home Office report said: ‘Following decriminalisation in Portugal there has not been a lasting increase in adult drug use.’ There is, however, a question over the figures. The director of SICAD is Dr Joao Goulao, an influential political figure widely hailed as the architect of decriminalisation. He is publicly proud of the ‘success’ of his policy and boasted in 2012 of frequent visits by ‘politicians, doctors, experts and journalists from around the world’. Critics say he has an interest in publishing figures to back his case. Kathy Gyngell, research fellow for the right-leaning British think tank Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘The same man who introduced the policy is responsible for producing the figures. ‘Dr Goulao clearly has an interest in making the figures look good.’","Liberal Democrats held up Portugal as shining example on 'drugs war'

"It is a battle to send a drone supersonic - and pits China against Britain. Experts have claimed that China's drone, called Dark Sword, is under secret development. It was unveiled in 2006 at an airshow, but has since disappeared from public view. Scroll down for video . The Dark Sword - known in Chinese as ""Anjian"" -made its debut at the Zhuhai Airshow in southern China's Guangdong province in 2006 - and is now believed to be a classified project. However, it has now reappeared in a report on the the website of the country's national broadcaster CCTV. The Dark Sword - known in Chinese as ""Anjian"" -made its debut at the Zhuhai Airshow in southern China's Guangdong province. The model was subsequently exhibited at the Paris Air Show - but was then never heard of again. Some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons, while others believe the development of the drone is now being kept secret as it is undergoing further research and testing, according to CCTvV . Chinese aviation expert Fu Qianshao told CCTV that while he does not know the status of the Dark Sword project, the drone could become the world's first supersonic UAV if it proves a success. He said he would not be surprised if the project is still ongoing in secret as a lack of transparency is nothing new for the aviation industry and is an approach commonly taken by the Americans. The craft has 'less emphasis on stealth in comparison to other 601-S UAVs, but instead, more emphasis is on maneuverability,' according to reports. However, the developers have stated that the primary focus of Dark Sword is to develop it into a hypersonic UAV, in order to fulfill the requirement of a low-observable, high maneuverability, hypersonic UAV to support tests conducted for Chinese air defense and air-to-air weaponry . The drone will be pitted against BAE system's Taranis in the supersonic race. Earlier this year Britain’s next generation military drone has ‘surpassed all expectations’ in its first test flight. Taranis, which is named after the Celtic god of thunder, is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. BAE also announced its Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle demonstrator Taranis has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing. During tests, Taranis (pictured) flew in a fully 'stealthy' configuration, making it virtually invisible to radar . Taranis is the UK's next generation military drone, named after the Celtic god of thunder. It is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. The autonomous vehicle made its first test flight in August, when it took off, rotated, climbed and landed at various speeds and altitudes. BAE Systems which made the aircraft, described it as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’. Taranis cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry. The drone is around the same size as a Hawk fighter jet and is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies. The pilotless combat aircraft made ‘a . perfect take-off, rotation, “climb out” and landing on its first . flight,' according to BAE systems, which made the drone. The British defence firm described its largest drone as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’ and test pilot Bob Fraser tried it out for a 15 minute flight at ‘an undisclosed test range’ in August. The advanced weapon, which could spearhead the fight against terror in Africa, cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry. It made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, the company said. Taranis is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies, but only a select group have a lot of access to the secret aircraft. ‘Taranis is providing vital insights that will help shape future capabilities for our Armed Forces in coming decades. 'Its advanced technology is testament to the UK's world leading engineering skills that keep Britain at the cutting edge of defence,’ Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology said. Taranis (graphic pictured) is named after the Celtic god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. During tests, Taranis also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position . Military chiefs believe Taranis’ ground-breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from British bases and attack targets worldwide. But the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control. Experts have previously warned that the new technology would potentially lead to a nightmarish scenario of out-of-control robots waging war on humans and have even called for a global ban on autonomous technology. The new drone has made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, BAE Systems said . Britain’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground, but Taranis will follow a set flightpath using on-board computers to perform manoeuvres, avoid threats and identify targets. Only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller. ‘This is a very dangerous move. 'Once it has been developed, who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it,’ Professor Noel Sharkey, a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at Sheffield University, said last January. Last year David Cameron warned that the fight against terrorism in North Africa could last decades, meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region. British Forces operate armed drones in Afghanistan, where they target Taliban insurgents and the UK Government has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles.","Drone was shown off at airshows until 2006 - then disappeared .

Martin, just 17 years old, was fatally shoot on Feb 26, 2012 in Sanford, Florida. George Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch volunteer who fatally shot him, was acquitted by a jury of second degree murder and manslaughter charges in July. The reaction to the verdict led to protests and marches of people contesting the 'stand-your-ground' law, which is a type of self-defense law that gives someone the right to use deadly force to defend themselves.

Their . oldest daughter Charlie, 20, lives with her boyfriend and has two . children of her own, while another daughter Ashley, 18, no longer lives . at home. The couple claim they have endured death threats and constant abuse since the work was approved last October. He told crews: 'It’s got nothing to do with anyone whether I can support my kids or not. If we need support that’s why we have a social service system surely. 'What is the problem. We are a large family. We don’t bother no-one. We are entitled to live anywhere as well as anyone else is.

She said: 'It is irrelevant how many children I have. It is my choice to have as many children as I have' 'I ain’t going to be dictated to, nobody in their life is going to be dictated to and told how many kids you can have. 'That’s not right. It’s p****d me off so much with all the c**p people keep writing and making up, do you know what I think I’ll have another one.' Earlier he said: 'If I had my way, no, I wouldn’t want more, I’m getting a bit old now. If Mandy had her way I think Mandy would want another one.' But speaking about how easy it was to have children, he went on: 'You go to bed at night and it just happens doesn’t it.' Miss Ball added: 'It is irrelevant how many children I have. It is my choice to have as many children as I have.' Mr Fisk - a former security guard and fencing contractor -  moaned that Ipswich Borough Council had made his family stay in their home during the construction work earlier this year. Speaking at the time of the work, he said: 'The noise is horrendous really, I would have thought they’d have moved us while they were doing the work. With the newborn baby it’s a bit much. Miss Ball added: 'I am looking forward to it being done, but it’s just the c**p that you have to put up with while it’s being done.' Mr Fisk said he had also been forced to set up surveillance cameras outside his home because of fears for his family’s safety. The couple live with their children Sadie, 16, Daniel, 14, Lauren, 13, Callum, 11, Kyle, ten, Elektra-Mae, five, Serenity, four, Jayden, three, Starlight, two, 14-month-old Neatheus and their six-month-old baby girl Sotin Tia . He has also given personal cameras to his partner and children so that they can film anyone making threats towards them. He said: 'What the hell? I have had threats saying they’re going to petrol bomb us and murder my family. I’m quite disgusted with it, to be honest. 'On the street we have had verbal abuse, people shouting out, we have had cars pull up shouting out* fingers stuck up at Mandy.' Ipswich Borough Council had estimated that the work to knock the two council houses together would cost £6,000 - but the conversion bill rocketed to £15,000 due to the chimneys of both houses having to be removed to join the homes together. Underpinning work was also carried out to strengthen the houses because of the partition walls being knocked through. Some of the children on holiday in Great Yarmouth. The huge family are expected to be able to move into their large home within two months . Tim Fisk says he cannot work because he has to care for his son, who is blind in one eye and has serious learning difficulties . A wet room bathroom was also installed for the couple’s son Daniel, 14, who is blind in one eye and has serious learning difficulties. More than 80 residents had signed a petition objecting to the pair of three bedroom homes being knocked together after the council revealed its plans last October. One near-neighbour said there is still a lot of bad feeling around the area, from people who think they don’t deserve such a big house. The couple have previously answered criticism about their spending by saying they were living off a compensation payout from Ipswich Hospital after Miss Ball lost a baby boy during childbirth in 2008 due to an alleged medical blunder. Mr Fisk said: 'That is why I can afford to buy stuff for my kids. I don’t get taxpayers’ money. I am not a dole scrounger.' Mr Fisk is unable to work as he is a full time carer to his son Daniel. He also claimed that he was having to care constantly for his partner who has suffered from severe depression since losing her baby in 2008. He said that she had carried on having even more babies as a way of coping with her grief. An Ipswich Borough Council spokesman said: 'It was decided that knocking two homes into one was the most cost effective way of meeting this family’s housing needs.'","Tim Fisk and Mandy Ball had their seven bedroom home specially created .

"A Columbia University Dental School student only weeks from graduating disappeared this week - and police believe fear she may have taken her own life. Jiwon Lee, 29, hasn’t been seen since leaving her apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side Tuesday night around 8.30 p.m., police said and her family believe foul play is involved. Investigators allegedly found a suicide note on a desk in Lee's apartment written out to her family. Dead: The body of Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the Hudson River in New York on Saturday . Jiwon Lee had previously tried to take her own life with pills, an NYPD official told MailOnline. 'She wrote them all a letter that it was not their fault, she gave up on life,' said the cop. Police are not sure how long ago the note was written, but do see it as an ominous sign. Lee last spoke with her brother and . another person, whose phone number has since been disconnected, before . she went missing, a friend told Gothamist. The call lasted for half an hour until . just before the last contact her phone had with a local cell tower, her . brother Matt Lee told MailOnline. The number tracks to Sacramento, . California, and she had spoken with the person previously. Well respected: Jiwon Lee was recently the president of the American Student Dental Association . 'This Is very unusual for her, she’s never disappeared and not let someone know,' said the brother. 'She’s never done anything like this... we don’t think it is anything she did herself that has caused her to be missing.' The five-foot-two, 120-pound student has black hair and black eyes, she was last seen by her roommate at their West 98th Street apartment. Police last tracked her cell phone to West 179th Street, near the George Washington Bridge, through pings from cell towers, friend Kimberli Leal told MailOnline. It last contacted that tower at 9.33 p.m., her brother said, adding that there was no reason he was aware of for her to be in that area. 'We’re hopeful that it has nothing to do with the bridge,' he said. The worried brother lives on West 175th Street, and loved ones believe she may have been on her way to see him, but he was not expecting her, he lamented. Police have searched the area with dogs and divers but have come up empty, said Matt Lee. A review of bridge surveillance footage also showed nothing, but the police source said that doesn't mean she didn't access the pedestrian walkway. Nowhere to be found: Jiwon Lee hasn't been seen or heard from in almost a week . Where she was last seen: Miss Lee went missing after leaving her apartment at 8.30pm on April 1 . Investigators and loved ones have spent . days combing the area for signs of the missing part-time comedian. They . have also created a Facebook page to aid in the search. A search of the harbor also has not turned up any trace of the missing woman, he added. ‘We’re hoping for the best,’ said Leal, ’we’re really just hoping for the best.’ A group of friends has gathered every day to post signs in the areas around her apartment, where she went missing and by Columbia University Medical Center, said Leal. ‘We really need to find her,’ she added. 'She’s an amazing individual, very high achieving, very caring about others,' her brother said. 'We just want her to come home.' Jiwon Lee was, until two weeks ago, the president of the American Student Dental Association, according to Jonathan Shenkin. Mysterious: Jiwon Lee went missing from her Upper West Side apartment to a neighborhood about 70 blocks north, near the George Washington Bridge . ‘Jiwon is an exceptionally well respected leader in this nation in the dental community,’ he told MailOnline. ‘People adored her from the moment they met her.’ She had just passed her board exams and was expecting to graduate in May, according to Leal. The soon-to-be dentist wasn’t outwardly having any personal problems in the days and weeks leading up to her disappearance, Leal said. ‘Everything was fine.’ The well-rounded student also taught math to middle school students in the city through AmeriCorps, according to the Columbia Spectator. A GoFundMe site has been set up to help raise money to hire a private investigator. Money raised will also be used to provide a reward to anyone who comes forward with information leading to Jiwon Lee. Anyone with information is urged to contact NYPD Crime Stoppers.

"The Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured), set out claims detectives were bugged by intelligence agencies whose alleged malpractice they probed over the abduction of Libyan dissidents . Britain's security and intelligence agencies were last night rocked by claims that they bugged Scotland Yard detectives who were investigating the agencies’ own alleged malpractice. A Yard spokesman yesterday confirmed that police are investigating the allegations – which stem from documents disclosed in court by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. If substantiated, the claims – set out in a letter to Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe from Cori Crider, a director of the human rights charity Reprieve – would mean that one arm of the State supposed to keep the country safe from terrorism spied on another, the Metropolitan Police. It focuses on the case of two Libyan dissidents, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al Saadi, who were abducted from China in a joint operation by MI6 and the CIA in 2004, then sent back to Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya. The Met launched Operation Lydd, an inquiry into their treatment, in 2012, when documents seized from the Libyan security HQ revealed that UK agencies were partly responsible. It is investigating whether British officials involved in the abduction committed crimes under English law. A preliminary file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in October. But according to the letter from Ms Crider, Operation Lydd has been spied on. Behind her claims lie documents which emerged in a court hearing last month, at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). In these, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ made the disclosure that in cases such as those of the Libyan dissidents, they routinely bug lawyer-client conversations. Reprieve and solicitors Leigh Day are representing Mr Belhaj, who in addition to making a criminal complaint, is trying to sue the British Government. The lawyers believe their conversations with him have been bugged, Ms Crider said yesterday, which means the agencies will also have picked up crucial details of Operation Lydd. n her letter, she claims the documents revealed at the IPT show the agencies have apparently felt free to ‘collect communications regarding the evidence that is at the heart of Operation Lydd’. It adds: ‘If MI6 officers (or others) intercepted our contacts with police… we are concerned about the safety of potential witnesses and the risk of improper “tip-offs”.’ Ms Crider said some witnesses had come forward on terms of strict confidentiality. They would ‘fear for their lives’ if it turned out the inquiry had been bugged. The MI5, MI6 and GCHQ (pictured) admitted in cases such as those of the dissidents Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al Saadi, who were sent back to Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya, they routinely bug lawyer-client conversations . She added: ‘It seems blatantly obvious that those under investigation by the police for serious crimes should not have access to the details of that investigation. Yet that is just what we fear may have happened here.’ Lawyer-client communications have been regarded as immune to official scrutiny for centuries. A Government spokeswoman, speaking on behalf of the UK agencies, said she could not comment because the IPT case is ongoing, but added: ‘The Government is clear that under no circumstances would it be acceptable for any public authority to rely on legally privileged communications to gain an unfair advantage in litigation.’","Detectives were probing alleged malpractice by the intelligence agencies .

When Youngbin Chung, 20, was a teenager he spent a worrying ten-hours-a-day playing the video game League of Legends in his San Francisco bedroom. Such was his addiction to the game that his parents feared he would fail his high school diploma. Little did they know his passion for gaming would lead, a few years later, to a $15,000 a year scholarship at a private university in Chicago . He now leads a team of headset-wearing players into virtual battle in a darkened room at the Robert Morris University, as part of his computer networking course. 'I never thought in my life I'm going to get a scholarship playing a game,"" said Chung, one of 35 students attending Robert Morris University on the school's first-in-the-nation video game scholarship. Once regarded as anti-social slackers or nerds in a basement, gamers have become megastars in what are now called esports. In professional leagues, they compete for millions of dollars in prizes and pull in six-figure incomes for vanquishing their enemies in what have become huge spectator events packing tens of thousands into sports stadiums around the world. Games have evolved from the days of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong into something much more complex. They demand hyper mental acuity and involve multiple players communicating with each other in teams, plotting strategy, predicting opponents' moves and reacting in milliseconds. Robert Morris, a not-for-profit university with about 3,000 students, believes those are not so different from the skills one uses on a football field or a basketball court and that spending money to recruit these students, too, will enrich campus life and add to its ranks of high-achieving graduates. 'It's coming; it's coming big time,' Associate Athletic Director Kurt Melcher said of the esports trend and what he's sure is its looming recognition by a bigger chunk of the collegiate sports world. Hundreds of other colleges and universities have esports clubs, but Robert Morris is the first to recognize it as a varsity sport under its athletic department. The scholarships, which cover up to half off tuition and half off room and board (worth a total of $19,000 in a typical three-quarter academic year) are for a single game, League of Legends, in which teams of five on five use keyboards and mouses to control mythical fighters battling it out in a science fiction-like setting. The first practices started last month in a $100,000 classroom outfitted with an expansive video screen, computers and an array of eye-dazzling gaming paraphernalia. It was Mr Chung's passion for video game League of Legends (pictured), which he played for up to 10-hours-a-day in his San Francisco bedroom as a teen, that led to his $15,000  university scholarship . The space is dimly lit and window blinds are drawn to keep glare off monitors. In the darkness, dozens of students wearing microphone headsets flit fingers and thumbs over the controls with blistering intensity and concentration. Death comes in a multitude of forms and is often sudden. Accordingly, the hum of game chatter is punctuated by the occasional whooping cry of victory or anguished sigh of defeat. The Robert Morris Eagles will play teams in two leagues that include the likes of Harvard and MIT with hopes of making it to the League of Legends North American Collegiate Championship, where the members of the first-place team take home $30,000 each in scholarships. Melcher dreamed up the scholarship idea while searching online for the video games he used to play. Some soccer players were bemused, but he said there was no real pushback from the university, which already has scholarships for everything from bowling to dressing as the mascot. Some 27 million people play League of Legends each day, according to developer Riot Games Inc. This year's professional championship is Oct. 19 in Seoul at the stadium South Korea built to host the 2002 soccer World Cup. The 45,000 seats are expected to sell out. The top team will take home $1 million. The traditional sports world is still trying to figure out what to make of the phenomenon. ESPN has dabbled in esports coverage, but network President John Skipper recently declared it a non-sport. 'It's not a sport,' he said at a conference in New York. 'It's a competition, right? I mean, chess is a competition, and checkers is a competition. ... I'm mostly interested in doing real sports.' Still, he added, 'You can't really ignore it.'","Youngbin Chung, 20, studies computer networking with $15,000 athletics scholarship at private university in Chicago .

"A man has been charged with murder after a married couple were subjected to a 'violent and sustained' attack in their £750,000 home. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, appeared at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill today on two counts of murder. Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, 54, were found dead at their Surrey home shortly after midnight on Thursday after police received a call from Mrs Kettyle's 16-year-old son, Timothy. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, (right)  has been charged with murder after the bodies of married couple Patrick (left), 55, and Gillian Kettyle, 54, were discovered at their Surrey home on Thursday . Police confirmed that Bruzas knew Mr Kettyle (pictured) and his wife, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Bruzas was found less than five miles from the scene of the murder . Their deaths sparked a police search for Lithuanian builder  Bruzas, 38, who was found later in Oxshott - less than five miles from the scene and arrested on suspicion of murder. A clean-shaven Bruzas, from Walton-on-Thames, wore a navy sweater and grey tracksuit bottoms when he appeared in the dock today, flanked by two guards. The Lithuanian builder spoke only to confirm his age and address during a brief appearance. Kristina Bruziene is reportedly the estranged wife of Bruzas. She was employed by the dead couple as a secretary in 2012 . He has been remanded in custody to appear before Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday. Police confirmed that Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm after the builder introduced them. Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius. He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007. Bruzas was known by his neighbours as a quiet man who worked hard to support his family. The full results of the post mortems, as well as formal identification of the couple, are expected next week but the initial cause of death has been established as stab wounds. Detective Superintendent Nick May, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said they were killed in a 'significant, violent and sustained' attack. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said after their murders: 'This is a tragic incident which has shaken the close community in Fetcham.

Smart-a**** little b******.' He said: 'I've been in the Cabinet, I'm an award-winning broadcaster, I'm a Queen's Counsel — you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?' But today Mr Mellor, who was forced to abandon his ministerial career after an affair in 1992, made an on-air apology. Opening his show on LBC, he said: 'I can't think what possessed me to lose it with that cabbie the way I did. 'OK, I had a case but I threw it away by the way I spoke and I'm really, really sorry about that and I especially want to apologise to you, our listeners for trying your patience and risking my own credibility with you by speaking the way I did. 'Anyway, it's water for me at the next celebratory lunch, I've definitely made that decision. 'Ironically, I'm one of London taxis' best customers and I thank a lot of them for speaking up for me, like Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association who said and I quote ""I've picked him up myself. He's actually a very nice guy. 'Despite everything he's said, he's not a bad guy. Unfortunately for him he got recorded."" 'Well there's a career in broadcasting awaiting you, Steve, because I couldn't have put it in a more succinct way myself, so I thank you for that. 'I would like to show my appreciation for the London cabbies that I have used for 40 years by making a substantial donation to their Christmas appeal for underprivileged kids.' Mr Mellor has said he regrets losing his temper but maintained the taxi driver provoked him. His career as a minister was ended by scandal including an affair, reported in the Mail in 1992 . During the show, which discussed David Cameron's speech on immigration, guest Nigel Farage told him: 'In life we all get things wrong and you have learned that more than anyone. 'You have just said sorry and that shows contrition and accepted you did something that was wrong.' In response, the 65-year-old barrister and radio presenter said: 'I couldn't defend myself, so I should chuck in the towel. I said something and then I was front page news, little me.' In the infamous rant, Mr Mellor, who was branded a 'snob', also told the taxi driver he had 'ruined' his 'wife's' day - although he is not married to Lady Cobham. The incident occurred after Mr Mellor left Buckingham Palace with his partner, Lady Penelope Cobham – chairman of VisitEngland – after she had just received a CBE for her services to tourism. But on his show today, Mr Mellor received support from Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association. He said: 'When the story kicked off, I was amazed at how many taxi drivers were calling to offer support to you who felt you had been wronged.' Mr Mellor replied saying: 'Thanks for your support. It's not been a good week and I can't defend what I have said. But the driver (I had) was so much different from the guys I travel with regularly.' Mr McNamara said: 'That's exactly it. I would prefer it if someone told me the way. It was a one-off. It was two grown men having a row.' The former minister then muttered under his breath: 'Yes, and it's front page news...' David Mellor is a well known as a Chelsea fan, pictured in the director's box with former chairman Ken Bates . Mr Mellor became a radio broadcaster after losing his seat in the House of Commons in 1997. He resigned as heritage minister in 1992 and blamed his departure on a constant barrage of stories in the media. He was in the 'last chance saloon' after his affair with mistress Antonia de Sancha, who sold her story to the News of the World and said Mr Mellor had sex with her while she wore a Chelsea strip. But Prime Minister John Major continued to support him until it emerged that Mona Bauwens, the daughter of a senior member of the Palestine National Fund, had paid towards Mellor's holiday to Marbella in Spain. He then quit in September 1992.","Former minister apologised on his LBC show for foul-mouthed tirade .

"Australian travellers flying with Virgin and Qantas could soon connect their laptops, tablets and smart phones to wireless internet. National Broadband Network (NBN Co) plans to make its satellites available to the two major Australian airlines in a bid to allow passengers to connect their personal devices while in flight. NBN Co chief executive Bill Morrow said the company was in talks with Qantas and Virgin Australia but did not indicate the pricing or when it is expected to roll out, according to Sydney Morning Herald. National Broadband Network plans to make its satellites available to Qantas and Jetstar Australia . The $620 million Ka-band satellites currently cater for the three per cent of rural and remote areas of the country that does not have access to high-speed broadband services. More than 124,000 farms, homes and businesses nationally, including more than 22,000 premises are currently connected to the services over the NBN's fixed wireless network. Meanwhile, Qantas have announced that passengers can use their personal devices  in flight mode, for the duration of each flight, providing uninterrupted access to work and entertainment. 'On all A380, B747-400 and A330-300 aircraft you can send and receive text messages, make inflight telephone calls and perform seat to seat calls all from the comfort of your seat with our inflight telecommunication service,' Qantas said on its' page. Australian air travellers could soon connect their laptops, tablets and smart phones to wireless internet . Qantas was approved to revise its personal electronic device policy by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in August following new guidance on the safe use of personal electronic devices inflight. Qantas Domestic Chief Executive Officer Lyell Strambi said the changes were an exciting development in customer experience for the airline. 'We're delighted to give Qantas customers the freedom and flexibility to use their personal electronic devices from the moment they board the plane until they disembark,' said Mr Strambi. 'Whether customers choose to listen to music, read their e-books or review work documents the introduction of gate-to-gate electronic access on Qantas flights is an exciting development to an already exceptional inflight entertainment service. National Broadband Network plans to make its satellites available to Jetstar Australia . Qantas was the first Australian airline to introduce Inflight Entertainment and provide wireless devices on board . 'Qantas was the first Australian airline to introduce Inflight Entertainment and provide wireless devices on board so it's great to be able to capitalise on these features for our customers. 'Qantas has conducted rigorous testing to assess the impacts of electronic devices on the safe operation of aircraft. We are confident that these devices are safe to be turned on, but in flight mode, for the duration of each flight.' Until August this year, devices in Australia were required to remain off until the seatbelt sign turned off, meaning passengers were unable to use them while the aircraft was taxiing to the runway or through much of the climb or descent.","National Broadband Network plans to make its satellites available to Qantas and Virgin Australia .

"A three-bedroom semi detached house was rented for up to £40,000 a year by rogue landlords despite having a tree poking through the wall in one of its rooms. The property in Clapham, south London, is among a handful which slipped through the hands of Lambeth council in the 1970s when local authorities did not have enough money to refurbish them. Passed on to housing associations and cooperatives, it eventually fell into the hands of a rogue landlord who has illegally extended the property into the garden, failing to chop down a large tree. Worryingly the landlord, who has not been named by authorities, used the tree's branches as a router for electricity for its eight tenants. Council officials discovered that a property in Clapham, south London, had been extended around a tree in its back garden which landlords failed to chop down when expanding, instead opting to use its branches to route electricity . The 'appalling' conditions were discovered by the council when officials visited the site to take back ownership of the run-down house. 'The conditions the people in this illegal HMO were living in were truly appalling, and represented a genuine danger to life and limb,' said Councillor Matthew Bennett. 'It is shocking that someone can make money exploiting people by illegally renting out such dangerous accommodation with no regard for the safety of the people living there. 'We have 21,000 people on our housing waiting list, 1,800 families in temporary accommodation, and 1,300 families who are severely overcrowded. 'With this housing need, it would be irresponsible to spend our money refurbishing shortlife properties which are in a very poor state of disrepair – particularly when they are being misused for these exploitative and illegal purposes.' The house, which has been illegally converted into flats, had only one bathroom with a single bath and filthy toilet for occupants to share. It is located on a quiet residential street in south London where the average property costs £715,000. Experts estimated the property in a leafy, residential street, was earning landlords up to £40,000 a year by renting each of the rooms out . Each of the tiny rooms was being rented individually, it is thought, for around £100 a week. Originally the property was a three-bedroom house . Officials found spare mattresses, wood shavings and cardboard boxes scattered around the property when they turned up to repossess it . A disused microwave, ladder, chairs and scraps of wood lie in the house's garden for council officials to clear up after it was vacated . The only bathroom in the run-down property had just one filthy toilet and grubby bath for all eight of its occupants to share . A bundle of clothes lie in the corner of one of the bedrooms beside a discarded mattress. The property is thought to have been run by rogue landlords whose hands it fell into after being given to housing associations and cooperatives in the 1970s . Council chiefs slammed the landlord for maintaining the property to such low standards describing it as a 'risk to life and limb' Though very little detail about the landlord and tenants is known (all had fled by the time authorities arrived at the property), experts estimate that each room may have been let out for around £100 a week - pulling £41,600 a year. It is one of 1,200 properties that were licensed to housing associations and cooperatives in the 1970s on a short-term basis when the council didn't have the funds to refurbish them to a high-enough standard. Forty years after falling into the hands of negligent owners, the flats and houses are being reclaimed by the Government. Last week electricians discovered another of the 'short-life' properties had been rerouting its electricity to other people's metres. Experts said it was one of the most dangerous sites they had seen in 35 years and that it was a miracle no one in the property had been electrocuted. Lambeth Council is considering launching legal action against the landlord. The property on Clapham's Rectory Gardens (pictured) in south London is one of more than 1,200 which fell into the wrong hands decades ago .","Property in Clapham, south London, converted from three-bedroom house to an eight-bedroom block of flats .

"A 300-year-old horse chestnut tree in the grounds of the country estate where prime minister Benjamin Disraeli lived has been declared the largest in the country. The veteran tree on the National Trust's Hughenden estate in Buckinghamshire has a girth of 7.33 metres (more than 24ft), clinching its status as the largest horse chestnut tree in the UK on the National Tree Register. The Hughenden tree, which stands in 275 hectares (680 acres) of parkland on the estate, has taken the crown from a horse chestnut in Whitchurch, Hampshire, which is 13cm (5 inches) smaller at 7.2 metres (more than 23ft). Hughenden Manor ranger Steve Kirkpatrick (left) and volunteer ranger Chris Raymond measure the largest horse chestnut tree in the country at Hughenden estate, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire . Steve Kirkpatrick, National Trust ranger for Hughenden, said the tree had reached such a huge size because it had been allowed to grow unhindered, was planted in good soil and had benefited from plenty of nutrients as it was on a flood plain. He added: 'It's impossible to date precisely but it's certainly over 300 years old, so it pre-dates many of the other trees at Hughenden which were planted by our former prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, who lived here for 33 years in the 19th century. 'Disraeli loved trees. He famously said: 'when I come to Hughenden I pass the first week sauntering about the park examining all my trees, and the second examining my books'. 'He loved to plant trees around the estate and during his time here tripled the size of the parkland.

The tree pre-dates many of the other trees at Hughenden which were planted by our former prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, above, who lived here for 33 years in the 19th century . 'Although few remain now, the landscape still reflects what he set out to do in terms of creating a parkland full of wonderful specimens to include cedar of Lebanon and Deodar cedar.' The National Trust said the chestnut was one of a number of 'national champion' trees in its care, including the tallest Scots pine in the country, at Cragside in Northumberland, and the tallest oak at Stourhead in Wiltshire. The Trust looks after more than 30,000 notable or veteran trees - ones which because of their age, size or condition are of exceptional value to the landscape, culture or conservation - across its woodlands and estates.

"This was the scene at a Cornish beauty spot this morning after walkers discovered a 20ft long whale washed up on a beach. The decomposed carcass of the huge mammal was found at the popular holiday destination of Pentewan Sands near Mevagissey in Cornwall. Stunned dog walkers could be seen stopping to take pictures of what is believed to be a dead juvenile Minke whale.

A spokesman from Falmouth Coastguard said it was alerted to the discovery about 3pm today . Although it was in an advanced state of decay, it was a rare opportunity to witness the size of the seagoing giants up close. A spokesman from Falmouth Coastguard said it was alerted to the discovery about 3pm today. Their colleagues at Mevagissey dispatched a team to the beach this afternoon to take measurements and a report is due to be sent to the Receiver of Wreck. The spokesman said it was the responsibility of the owner of the beach to dispose of the carcass, adding that it was not yet clear what kind of whale had been washed up. Although it is relatively rare for them to be washed up on British beaches, Cornwall is no stranger to whale sightings. Stunned dog walkers could be seen stopping to take pictures of what is believed to be a dead juvenile Minke whale . A Coastguard team has been dispatched to the beach this afternoon to take measurements - a report will then be sent to the Receiver of Wreck . A steady stream of onlookers arrived at the beach today to catch a glimpse of the giant 20ft whale . Two years ago, a full size adult Fin whale weighing 65 tonnes washed up alive just along the coast at Carlyon Bay. Sadly however, despite the efforts of volunteers the mammal had to be humanely destroyed. According to the whaledolphintrust.co.uk, Minke are the smallest of the baleen whales found in UK waters, measuring between seven and ten metres when fully grown. They can be found in seas across the Northern hemisphere, except in the Arctic Ocean, and are often seen off the coasts of Ireland and Scotland.","Carcass of what is thought to be juvenile Minke whale washed up on beach .

"A 'delusional murderer' who killed his in-laws with such ferocity that he showered his estranged wife and three-year-old daughter in blood will be put to death on Wednesday despite opposition. Scott Panetti was heavily armed with his head shaved and wearing camouflage when he shot and killed his in-laws at their Texas Hill Country home in 1992. But his attorneys want to get him off death row, or, in the very least, get his execution date on December 3, postponed so that he can undergo further psychological testing. Delusional: In this Nov. 19, 1999 file photo, Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti talks during a prison interview in Huntsville, Texas, where he is on death row for the 1992 murder of his wife's parents . His legal team want to determine if he's competent to be put to death. Yet no one disputes that he is highly dangerous and delusional. Panetti himself acknowledged during his 1995 capital murder trial that he had killed Joe and Amanda Alvarado. Dressed as a cowboy, he acted as his own attorney, believing only an insane person could prove an insanity defense. Jurors convicted him and sentenced him to death, and he is scheduled to die on Wednesday. However, Panetti's attorneys believe his case raises questions about the legality of executing the mentally ill — an issue the U.S. Supreme Court has previously considered. Kathryn Kase, one of his lawyers said: 'From our perspective, this has been like a slow-moving train wreck since 1995.' A diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, Panetti had been hospitalized for mental illness more than a dozen times in the decade leading up to the September 1992 killings of the Alvarados. A 2007 Supreme Court review of Panetti's case tweaked the criteria for executing those with severe mental disorders. It required inmates to not only know that they are being punished, but to also have a 'rational understanding' of their punishment. Providing little guidance other than requiring a fair hearing for presentation of psychiatric evidence to consider insanity claims, the justices returned Panetti's case to lower federal courts, which ultimately found him competent. Execution: Panetti's execution is set for December 3, but his attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing . Seven years since his last mental evaluation, Panetti is showing increasingly aberrant delusional behavior on death row. Kase, who visited him a few weeks ago believes his punishment is part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the Gospel. 'He cannot appreciate why Texas seeks to execute him,' Kase said. 'You have to have a rational as well as factual understanding of why you're being executed. 'In Mr. Panetti's case, his understanding is the state wants to prevent him from preaching the Gospel on death row and saving their souls. And clearly that's not factual or rational.' Prosecutors argue that Panetti's claims are without merit and that defense attorneys have had years to arrange new evaluations. Lucy Wilke, an assistant district attorney in Gillespie County, where Panetti was tried, said that as recently as November 4, Panetti discussed Election Day politics during a prison visit with relatives. 'At the very least, it is clear that Panetti is oriented to time and place, a fact which his lawyers have disputed,' she said in a filing last week to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. It has refused to stop the execution and Panetti's case now is back before a federal appeals court. Court-appointed medical experts for the state have long said they suspect some of Panetti's bizarre behavior was contrived. Panetti recently declined to be interviewed. He said: 'I respectfully decline, Acts 28.' The Biblical chapter in the Acts of the Apostles includes a reference to St. Paul as a prisoner of the Romans and of Paul successfully teaching the Gospel.","Scott Panetti killed his in-laws at their Texas Hill Country home in 1992 .

Much of England and Wales enjoyed a milder night, with minimum temperatures of 7 and 8C across large parts of the country. Bournemouth and Southampton were warmer still at around 11C at 6am today. However a large, frosty front will sweep over the country next week after dumping the first of the winter snow in Scotland. 'While all the cloud maintains itself in northern parts, there are outbreaks of showery rain in the north and subsequently the temperatures are more suppressed as it pushes its way south eastwards (over England and Wales), weakening all the while,' said Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl. 'We'll see some mist and fog developing across central and south eastern England where it'll be a dull, dull start tomorrow. 'Some fog may linger while further north it brightens up later. The colder weather won't show its hand until Monday, pushing south eastwards increasing the risk of frost.' The weekend will be warmer than average for the time of year but temperatures will start to drop towards the December average of 6C from Monday. Met Office meteorologist, Greg Dewhurst, added: 'We could possibly see a little bit of snow on the highest ground of the Highlands on Monday night from incoming showers. 'Elsewhere, most places will be cold and dry and there will be some mist and fog about too.' Forecaster Nicola Maxey said: 'On Saturday we are looking at highs of 13C or 14C during the day, which we will see in the south of England. We may possibly even see 15C.

"The '25 O' plate is sought-after as it is ideal for some of the most valuable classic cars ever built . A classic car dealer gave the treasury a welcome boost yesterday by forking out record-breaking £650,000 on two registration plates. John Collins paid a staggering £518,480 for '25 O' and a further £130,000 for '250 L' at the DVLA auction. The '250 L' plate is likely to go on his 1964 Ferrari 250 Lusso which is currently on the market for £2.25 million. But it is the '25 O' plate which will be most sought-after as it is ideal for some of the most valuable models of classic cars ever built. This includes the £10 million Ferrari 250 GT SWB, £20 million Ferrari 250 TR and £35 million Ferrari 250 GTO. Bidding on '25 O' started at £50,000 and soon shot up to £75,000 as wealthy businessmen and collectors battled it out. It soon exceeded £250,000, then £270,000, and £300,000 and with auctioneer Dave Hawes eventually smashing the hammer down at £400,000. When VAT and buyer's premium is added, the final cost for the plate was a whopping £518,480. This is thought to be a British record for a registration plate bought publicly with the auction room stunned at the result. Mr Collins will be putting the plate on an ultra-special, 1961 Ferrari 250 SWB. The plates were auctioned off in Glamorgan on Thursday for the DVLA and, despite their desirability, were offered with incredibly low reserves.

It was the second of a three day sale with more than £1.3 million spent on Wednesday. All of the hammer price and the tax on the buyer's premium goes to the treasury while the buyer's premium goes to the firm with the contract for DVLA auctions. Mr Collins, who runs Talacrest, in Ascot, was involved in a fierce bidding war for the two plates with interested parties bidding over the phone, online and in the showroom. The most expensive number plate ever sold by DVLA was 1 D which sold for £352,411 in 2009.","John Collins paid a staggering £518,480 for the '25 O' number plate .

"Hotel room prices across Europe have fallen by 13 per cent over the last month – except in the UK, where they have increased sharply in some cities. Italy and Spain have seen some of the biggest price cuts as the month-to-month cost of a one-night stay has dropped by an average of £13 across Europe. Venice topped the list of bargains as the average price of a hotel room in October (£194) plunged 44 per cent to £109 for bookings in November – reflecting savings of £85. The average price of a hotel room in Venice in November is nearly half of what it was in October . Savings: The month-to-month cost of a one-night stay has dropped by an average of £13 across Europe . It was followed by Florence, where visitors to the Tuscan capital are paying 32 per cent less (£131 in October to £89 in November). Rome was third on the list, followed by Barcelona and Prague. Lisbon, Paris, Athens, Seville and Bilbao rounded out the top ten. The study by hotel price comparison website Trivago analysed prices in 50 cities and found that prices have dropped an average of 13 per cent across the continent.

"Nicola Sturgeon opened the memorial ceremony today in prayer for the ten who died in the Clutha tragedy in Glasgow a year ago on November 29 . Nicola Sturgeon led a congregation today at Glasgow Cathedral as hundreds gathered to pay tribute to those killed in the Clutha helicopter crash, one year on from the tragedy. Scotland's First Minister opened the memorial ceremony in prayer while Bernard Higgins, Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland, shared a reading from the book of Revelation. Ten people died and many more were injured when the police helicopter, a Eurocopter EC135, crashed on to the roof of the Clutha pub in Glasgow on November 29 last year. Hundreds of people packed into pews for the ecumenical service this afternoon. Delivering the ceremony's sermon, the Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow Philip Tartaglia said the night tragedy struck at the bar began like any other Friday evening. Ska band Esperanza was playing and more than 100 people had packed into the popular Stockwell Street venue to see them perform. Later, at about 10.25pm, disaster struck. The Police Scotland helicopter which had been flying overhead dropped through the single-storey building below after both engines failed. Pilot David Traill and his passengers, police officers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins, lost their lives. Those killed in the pub were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee. Some 32 people were taken initially to hospitals across the city. Joe Cusker was pulled from the wreckage alive but later died in hospital. 'They have never been forgotten, especially not by those who love them most and who miss them most sorely,' Archbishop Tartaglia said. 'I can never pass by the Clutha Vaults without remembering them and recalling what happened, and whispering a 'Hail Mary' for the dead, injured and bereaved.' Audience members stood as one, as members of the mourning families lit candles in memory of their loved ones. The solemn churchman added how the tragedy had drawn his homeland together. 'Out of this tragedy we are called to be better, more compassionate, more understanding human beings,' Archbishop Tartaglia said. 'And I would hope that we could turn that memory into a legacy, a legacy which would honour the victims of the Clutha Vaults tragedy, so that we can say once and for all that their deaths contributed to Glasgow and Scotland becoming a better place for everyone.' Archbishop Tartaglia called for his countrymen to honour the Clutha victims' memory by making Scotland 'a place where we can all freely give what we are best at giving, according to the law and with respect for everyone's legitimate liberties, without fear and without the suspicion that we do not belong or that we are not welcome'. A man looks at floral tributes in front of the Clutha pub in Glasgow while the service was held to mark the first anniversary of the tragedy. The police helicopter crashed through the roof after its two engines failed . A child lays flowers at the memorial site for the tragedy. The crash claimed the lives of three police personnel in the Eurocopter EC135 and seven patrons in the pub which was packed for a performance by a Ska band . A family leave a heartfelt message on a floral tribute at the now closed Clutha pub. More than 100 were inside the single-storey building at the popular Stockwell Street venue when tragedy struck last November 29 . 'There is a feeling around that we are in a special moment when we can shape a new Scotland,' the Archbishop added. 'In our country, no one should feel less Scots because of any part of their identity, personal, cultural or religious. We are all equal in Scotland, all welcomed, all valued, and above all, all free to express our views and follow our consciences. 'This, I suggest, would be a Scotland which would make St Andrew applaud, would make the Clutha Vaults victims smile with pride and would make us all happy.' Nicola Sturgeon (pictured front right) was joined by politicians, friends and family in today's memorial for the tragedy. Gatherers stood as one while members of the mourning families lit candles in memory of loved ones .

"The Hard Rock Cafe's number one fan has spent more than £30,000 in his quest to visit every one of the rock 'n' roll themed restaurants in the world. Kay Kalkbrenner, aged 28, has made it to 243 of the Cafes on five continents in locations as far flung as Kazakhstan and Cancun. But after years of travelling and tens of thousands of pounds, Kay admits he has become so fed up of burgers and chips he now doesn't even order a meal. Scroll down for video . Kay Kalkbrenner has travelled to 243 Hard Rock Cafés around the world in his quest to visit them all . From Canada to Kuwait, Kalkbrenner, aged 28, has spent thousands of dollars in hopes of achieving his goal. Pictured: Johannesburg, South Africa . He's travelled five continents in the last 15 years - often missing family occasions and using up his annual leave. Pictured: Kalkbrenner in front of the Buenos Aires branch . In his bid to visit all the restaurants, Kay has missed family occasions, paid thousands for long-haul flights and regularly uses up all of his annual leave. But he doesn't regret his unusual quest. Kay said: 'I love the Hard Rock Cafes because it gives you a good excuse to travel, but the best part is the people. 'The other collectors are all great, friendly and helpful - they make it worth it.' Kalkbrenner poses for a photo in front of the Hard Rock Café Kuwait . During a family trip to Canada as a teen, Kalkbrenner managed to tick off both the Toronto (left) and Niagara Falls (right) locations . Kalkbrenner admits that while he loves the cafés, he is getting a bit tired of the food. Pictured: Hard Rock Café Cardiff . Kay, originally from Frankfurt, Germany, is always planning his next trip and is constantly on the lookout for new openings. He takes up to ten trips a year and a single visit can cost up to £1,500. He has just returned from a two week tour of Asia and is currently in Kazakhstan to visit the chain's new restaurant in Almaty. Kay visited his first Cafe, aged just eight years old, while in Miami with his parents in 1994. But it wasn't until a trip to Hong Kong in 1997 that his obsession truly began. While on holiday his family chanced upon a local Hard Rock Cafe. Inside he noticed a sign for the second restaurant on the island and convinced his parents to take him to the other branch. During family holidays he visited branches in London, Florida Key West and Orlando. And after finishing school he even got a job with an airline so he could see the world's Cafes without blowing his wages monthly wages. The Frankfurt-native admits that he is always on the lookout for a new opening. Pictured: Kalkbrenner in Myrtle Beach, Florida . As a child, his family helped fuel the obsession, bringing him to Key West (left) and San Francisco (right) On family vacations to London (left) and Orlando (right), Kalkbrenner began collecting key rings at each branch . Kalkbrenner visits a branch in the American capital of Washington, DC . Since then, he's spent more than £31,000 (€40,000) travelling from his native Germany to exotic Hard Rock locations - where he always buys a key ring. In just one year, he went to the USA, Mexico, Japan, and on a cruise through the Caribbean, clocking up more than 22 Hard Rock Cafes. Even when he can't take extended periods off work from his job for a travel company, he spends every weekend travelling around Europe to tick off the restaurants closer to home. But Kay's favourite branches aren't even in the chain's native United States - he loves the locations in Tenerife, Beirut, Cancun, Seoul and Kuwait. At his home, he has a room dedicated to his mission including a huge wall map with pins to show every restaurant he has visited, thousands of pictures of him, all of the 1,500 key rings he has purchased and one giant master spreadsheet so he can keep track of all the places he has been. But even Kay admits that his friends don't understand his obsession and have tried to get him to stop. Interestingly, Kalkbrenner's favourite branches aren't even in the chain's native United States. Pictured: Kay in Bogota, Venezuala . When Kalkbrenner can't get long periods of time off of work, he travels around Europe, visiting branches that are closer by. Pictured: Hard Rock Cafe and Shop in Athens, Greece . Kalkbrenner admits that his friends don't understand his obsession. Pictured: Hard Rock Hotel in Albuquerque, New Mexico . Kalkbrenner says that his mission to visit every Cafe really just gives him a great excuse to travel. Pictured: Kay in Acapulco . In just one year, Kalkbrenner visited over 22 locations - most in the Caribbean - like this Aruba branch . He said: 'Most of my friends don't really understand why I do it and why I spend so much time and money on my hobby. 'I think only other collectors and fans can really understand. 'My family likes my hobby very much - they appreciate that it's helped me come across so many amazing places in the world.' 'I never thought I'll make it to Colombia,' he explained, 'Now I have been there twice already.' 'I'd never even heard about Guam, Saipan, or Kota Kinabalu before. 'Who knows where the next Hard Rock Cafes will open up but I'll make it my mission to travel there.' The only downside? 'The food is almost the same everywhere in the world and a bit overpriced,' he admitted. 'The decor and memorabilia is nice to see but for me not so important. 'I don't walk around the cafe and take  pictures of all the memorabilia but I know there are people out there doing that as they're interested in that. 'It's more a chance to see the world that I'm interested in and a chance to tick another Cafe off my list - I'm a collector at heart!'","Kay Kalkbrenner of Frankfurt, Germany has spent years visiting the cafes .

"Passengers may one day be able to hitch a ride on a plane with their thumb as carriers consider new ways to trim airport waiting times. Despite privacy concerns and fears the data could be stolen by hackers, the parent company of Alaska Airlines is testing a system that uses fingerprint scans to identify travellers with the goal of using it to speed up the process of getting from the check-in counter to the gate. If the ‘e-thumb’ system is implemented, the Seattle-based airline would become the first in the US to use biometrics for things such as boarding passes, entry into airport lounges or in-flight purchases, Bloomberg reported. Pioneer: Alaska Airlines could become the first carrier in the US to use biometrics to identify travellers . Fingerprint scans could replace government-issued identification documents such as passports or driver’s licences to reduce queues. Alaska Air Group began using the technology, which uses human physical characteristics to identify a person, at a frequent flier lounge in Seattle in August. The pilot project does not store images but uses an algorithm that converts reference points on a fingerprint into an encrypted code that cannot reconstruct the original image, Bloomberg reported. But the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the technology poses significant risks for privacy and security, and could be vulnerable to hackers. Under your thumb: Fingerprint scans could be used as boarding passes or to gain access into an airport lounge . The system faces a few hurdles before it can be implemented for commercial use. It must go through rigorous approval process and Alaska Air must convince the Transportation Security Administration and other aviation authorities that the system cannot be defeated and personal information will be kept safe and secure. Sandy Stelling, Alaska Airlines’ managing director for customer research and development, told Bloomberg: ‘We’re already in discussions of how we extend this, where we go next. Is it the boarding door? Is it the bag drop? ‘Obviously we have to line up a number of partnerships to make that happen. The customer response has been that strong. We don’t want to take our foot off the gas.’ UK arrivals with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan . Fingerprint scans are not unusual in airports. Currently in the UK, passengers with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan when they arrive at passport control. A similar program is used in the US. Passengers who are flying between the UK and Ireland require a facial biometric image to verify their identity. In 2008, the former British Airports Authority was forced to scrap plans to take fingerprints of passengers using London Heathrow’s Terminal 5 following warnings that such checks could be illegal. BAA had planned to fingerprint both domestic and international travellers transferring to domestic flights at Heathrow. That same year, Scandinavian Airlines began allowing passengers with luggage to board domestic flights with a scan of their index finger.","The 'e-thumb' system could be used for boarding passes or lounge entry .

"The women paid 62p an hour in Mauritius making £45 ‘feminist’ T-shirts earn less than the ‘living wage’ set by the government of the Indian Ocean island. After our revelations last week about the ‘sweatshop’ conditions endured by workers producing the garments, The Mail on Sunday has discovered that the women’s pay falls far short of the £1.47 an hour set by the official statistics office, and designed to provide a decent, basic level of income. Unions and campaigners last night condemned high street chain Whistles and Left-wing women’s rights group The Fawcett Society for refusing to withdraw the T-shirt, made by women living 16 to a room. The women paid 62p an hour at the CMT factory (pictured) in Mauritius making £45 ‘feminist’ T-shirts earn less than the ‘living wage’ set by the government of the Indian Ocean island . Whistles was described as ‘sticking its head in the sand’ by one major union following The Mail on Sunday’s revelations about the conditions in which the ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirts are made at the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile [CMT] workcamp. The new revelations came as: . Labour leader Ed Miliband, his deputy Harriet Harman, and Nick Clegg were all photographed for Elle magazine in the shirts. After our exclusive story last week, the shirts were withdrawn from sale in Whistles while it conducted an investigation. Two days later, the shirts were back on shelves when the store, the charity and the magazine all declared they were satisfied the factory conditions at CMT conformed to ‘ethical standards’. Significantly, the statement did not contradict the women’s rate of pay or living conditions, it merely said they are paid above the minimum wage and had union representation. But even the Mauritian government’s director of labour, Edley Armoogum, admitted: ‘The minimum wage has not been reviewed since 1984, it has only received small increases in line with inflation. 'Wages need to increase, they are outdated.’ Yet The Fawcett Society – which vows to fight against low and unequal pay for women – triumphantly tweeted: ‘Latest T-shirt update: evidence we have seen categorically refutes assertion they were produced in a sweatshop.’ Later they added: ‘Oh well, guess we’ll have to get by without those 11 million Daily Mail readers, aww shucks!’ 'Satisfied': Whistles say they are happy with conditions at the CMT factory despite the poverty wages . The Mail on Sunday understands that no one from Whistles, Elle or The Fawcett Society has travelled to Mauritius to investigate our story, although Whistles indicated yesterday that an inspection is planned by a ‘senior member’ of its team. Instead, the company relied on an audit of conditions, carried out last month. The Fawcett Society said they were initially assured that the 300 T-shirts would be produced in the UK and were ‘surprised’ to discover they were produced in Mauritius. International trade union IndustriALL added: ‘Whistles is sticking its head in the sand. The government-mandated minimum wage has not been revised for 30 years. It’s currently 4,300 rupees a month [£86] which is below the poverty line It is no surprise that women work enormous extra hours to supplement their poverty wages. 'A company sourcing from a factory with any indication of exploitation should not try to hide behind a smokescreen.’ CMT boss Francois Woo last week confirmed that the migrant women from Bangladesh, India and Vietnam were paid £120 a month basic wage – equivalent to 62p an hour. The company claims that the dormitory accommodation and three meals a day they provide effectively brings the women’s salaries up to £210, but even that falls far short of the £290 voluntary living wage set by the Mauritian government. To achieve that, the women should be paid £1.47 an hour – not 62p. The claim by Whistles – whose chief executive Jane Shepherdson is believed to earn £300,000 a year – that the workers had union representation was also questioned by Jane Ragoo, president of the island’s Trade Unions Consultative Congress. David Cameron was mocked for refusing five requests from women’s magazine Elle to pose for a photograph in the ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirt. Yet last week, The Mail on Sunday found leading figures from Whistles, The Fawcett Society and Elle were just as reluctant to be photographed in their own T-shirt – despite continuing to sell them. We, too, made five requests each to Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson, Elle editor-in-chief Lorraine Candy, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive Miranda Seymour-Smith and her deputy Eva Neitzert. Blanked: Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson, with her husband, ignores the MoS reporter . Shirty: Elle editor-in-chief Lorraine Candy (left) and the Fawcett Society’s deputy chief executive Dr Eva Neitzert (right) ignored requests for comment . Ms Candy refused to pose, while the others ignored our requests. We also called at Ms Shepherdson’s and Ms Candy’s North London homes, taking a T-shirt along with us, but the answer was still no. Emerging from her smart townhouse with her husband, Ms Shepherdson refused to answer any questions about the issue, or acknowledge our reporter. ...and the questions they won't answer . After The Mail on Sunday report last week, The Fawcett Society, Elle and Whistles issued statements saying they had seen evidence that stated the ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirts were made in ethical conditions. A further statement came from Whistles yesterday. Pointedly, however, there was no mention anywhere of the 62p-an-hour pay rate – or the fact the workers sleep 16 to a dorm. Here, we print crucial questions we put to The Fawcett Society, Whistles and Elle magazine following that statement, with their responses: . Do you think it is ethical to pay workers 62p an hour to make a £45 T-shirt? Whistles: ‘All employees are paid above the government-mandated minimum wage.’ Do you think it is ethical that the women must sleep 16 to a room? Response: No comment . Do you think it is ethical that the woman are encouraged not to leave the site between shifts, as factory boss Mr Woo told us? Response: No comment . The Mauritius government has set a ‘living wage’ of £1.47 an hour. The workers are paid less than half this. Is this ethical? Response: No comment . After the MoS report, The Fawcett Society and Whistles implied that conditions are acceptable. Did any of your representatives go to Mauritius in the past week to gain this information first hand? Whistles: ‘We are undertaking a further independent review and a senior member of the Whistles team will conduct a detailed site inspection and talk to employees at the factory.’ The only union within CMT is the Textile Manufacturing and Allied Industries Workers Union, which official figures show has 1,052 members in the whole of Mauritius. That is just eight per cent of the 13,000 CMT workers, even if it had no other members elsewhere. Legally a union can only demand collective bargaining power if it represents 30 per cent of staff, but companies can grant the same right to smaller unions. The union is led by Fayzal Ally Beegun, who accompanied the MoS on our tour of the factory last week. At that time, he described the conditions as a ‘sweatshop’ and condemned the pay and conditions. Since then, our efforts to contact him have been in vain, but CMT issued a letter he wrote claiming the quotes attributed to him were ‘totally false’. How MoS revealed the truth about the T-shirts . Jane Ragoo said the CMT has stopped her approaching foreign workers about joining an independent union. She described the accommodation complex as ‘like a prison’. In a statement last week, Mr Woo denied the factory was a ‘sweatshop’, and claimed the women who represent 80 per cent of his workforce had access to leisure facilities. But on our tour, it was only in the men’s block that we saw a gym, library, TV room and sports pitches. Security guards at a CMT factory in Curepipe yesterday herded workers inside their dormitories to stop them from talking to our reporters. Neighbour Lallman Lutch, 62, told us: ‘Normally the women are allowed outside on Saturday but my friend told me they were locking them in to stop them talking to journalists. They say it is like a prison.’ CMT has a chequered history, but says it has improved conditions in recent years. In 2005, riot police fired tear gas as 300 Chinese workers protested that a colleague had been effectively worked to death. Whistles said it had nothing to add to its statement last week insisting it was ‘committed to ethical sourcing’ adding that an audit last month found that ‘all employees are paid above the government-mandated minimum wage; employees are paid according to their skills and period of service; there is no forced labour; there is a policy for freedom of association and collective bargaining; there are regular workers’ meetings.’ The Fawcett Society and Elle refused to answer our questions.","Women are paid 62p an hour in Mauritius to make £45 'feminist' T-shirts .

"Oscar Pistorius made a secret phone call to one of his ex-girlfriends shortly before he shot Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day last year. The convicted killer spoke to Jenna Edkins, 25, for nine minutes on the evening of the killing, a new book reveals. Pistorius and Edkins were in an on-off relationship for five years, and he is believed to have still been seeing her and another woman when he met Miss Steenkamp. Scroll down for video . Secret call: Oscar Pistorius spoke to ex-girlfriend Edkins, 25, who was called Babyshoes in his phone, for nine minutes on the eve he shot Reeva Steenkamp . The Paralympian has been convicted of culpable homicide, escaping the more serious charge of murder for shooting his 29-year-old girlfriend on Valentines’ Day 2013. But at sentencing next month, he could simply be fined - avoiding a 15-year jail term – after Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled there was a lack of evidence to suggest he planned the killing. During the course of the trial, Pistorius has been exposed as a paranoid love cheat who had multiple affairs behind Reeva Steenkamp's back during their relationship. It has been revealed that the 27-year-old double amputee started dating Miss Steenkamp when he was still seeing Miss Edkins, a banker from Johannesburg, and another woman. Mobile phone data uncovered by South African journalists Barry Bateman and Mandy Wiener during the research for their forthcoming book Behind The Door, show that Pistorius was on the phone to Miss Edkins on the eve of the killing. Guilty: Pistorius, 27, shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, four times at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year . The Paralympian athlete has been found guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge roughly equivalent to manslaughter, and will be sentenced on October 13 . Support: Miss Edkins, pictured with Oscar Pistorius in December 2008, took to Twitter to defend the killer the day after he shot Reeva Steenkamp . Miss Edkins, who was stored in Pistorius’ phone book as ‘Babyshoes’, is one of the few former lovers to speak out in support of the Paralympian after the killing. Police did not discover the nine-minute phone call, and Miss Edkins never gave a statement to the authorities, The Mirror reports. Miss Edkins has only posted five times since setting up her Twitter account in 2009, four of those are in support of Pistorius, all written on February 15th last year, the day after he shot Reeva Steenkamp. ‘People must stop jumping on the bandwagon with such hurtful allegations.

Love and thoughts to Reeva’s family.’ The final post firmly defends Pistorius, reading: ‘I would just like to say , I have dated Oscar on off for 5 YEARS, NOT ONCE has he EVER lifted a finger to me , made me fear for my life..’ Unfaithful: Pistorius was already seeing Miss Edkins, as well as another woman, 20-year-old student Sam Taylor, when he started seeing Miss Steenkamp . In a recent interview, the mother of one of Pistorius’ ex-girlfriends, Sam Taylor, said: ‘Sammy once saw a Facebook profile picture of a woman called Jenna Edkins sitting on Oscar’s bed with Kola, the puppy that Sammy and Oscar had bought together. ‘He always denied he was having any contact with Jenna, but the picture proved otherwise.’ Miss Taylor split from him after a year-and-a-half when she found he had been cheating with Miss Edkins and ‘a lady from New York called Anastasia,’ believed to have been Anastasia Khozissova. She said their relationship was tempestuous, with Pistorius often “screaming” at her. It also emerged during the dramatic six-moth trail that Ms Steenkamp sent Pistorius texts complaining about his treatment of her just weeks before she was killed. One said: ‘Every five seconds I hear how u dated another chick. ‘You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long-term boyfriend.’ The athlete will be sentenced at a hearing on October 13.","Oscar Pistorius called Jenna Edkins on eve of killing Reeva Steenkamp .

"The Mail on Sunday’s T-shirt investigation took a sinister twist last week as our journalists were spied on and followed by security guards from the CMT factory. The men, among them drivers for factory boss Francois Woo, tailed MoS reporter Ben Ellery and photographer Craig Hibbert for hours along the island’s palm-fringed roads. At one point they were even lying in wait when the journalists arrived at a secluded riverside hotel they had checked in to only hours before. Camera shy: MoS photographer Craid Hibbert’s shot of the henchmen following him and reporter Ben Ellery . Though the burly guards made no approach to the MoS journalists, it was clear their aim was to monitor their movements and to intimidate any factory workers who may have wanted to speak out. Ellery and Hibbert first became aware they were the subject of unwelcome attention on Thursday when they visited a CMT factory in a sprawling industrial estate in Phoenix, just outside the island’s capital Port Louis, at noon. They had planned to speak to more of the migrant workers about their working conditions at the plant. Seeing four guards on the razor wire-topped gate, the pair waited at nearby food stalls, hoping the workers would go there for lunch. However, they were told by a local shopkeeper that the only workers who leave the complex at lunchtime were Mauritians, rather than their colleagues from Bangladesh, Vietnam and India. One of the CMT factory guards is pictured lurking in the shadows . The journalists began talking to the Mauritian factory workers and within minutes a team of security officers began to station themselves around the stalls, setting an intimidating atmosphere sure to keep workers from talking to our journalists. Ellery and Hibbert got back in their car and drove away while the guards looked on. The MoS team visited a union office in Port Louis. Afterwards, when they got back in their car, they spotted a grey BMW parked further up the street with two of the guards sitting in it. The car started following the journalists, sticking close though several turns in busy traffic. At one point the MoS car made a quick turn, shaking off the watchers, then went back around the block to find the confused guards parked at the side of the road, looking in all directions as the traffic sped by. Hibbert quickly pulled in front of them blocking them in, and got out of the car to photograph the men. Suddenly the security team became shy and pulled down the car’s sun visors to obscure their faces, then unhooked the visors to shield themselves. One of them attempted to take a photograph of the journalists using his mobile phone before reversing the car out of the tight spot and driving off. Five minutes later, the journalists realised the same car was behind them again. Once again, they made a few quick turns, confirming they were being tailed, before losing them down an alleyway. That evening the journalists returned to Port Louis only to find one of the men who had been following them earlier standing in the shadows outside the hotel with another man. Ellery said: ‘We were particularly shocked as we had only changed hotels hours before and made sure we hadn’t been followed. 'By this time we started to feel uneasy and asked the parking attendant about the men. He told us that they were drivers for Francois Woo.’ The boss: The men included drivers for the boss of the CMT factory, Francois Woo (pictured) The journalists had planned to speak to more of the migrant workers about their working conditions at the CMT plant (pictured) Pictured are some of the many Bangladeshi workers in the CMT factory in Mauritius where the T-shirts are made . However there was no sign of Mr Woo in the hotel, and reception staff confirmed he was not a guest nor having a meeting there. The men lurked outside the hotel until 11pm. The following day when the MoS team returned to the factory in Phoenix, one of the men was waiting inside the compound. When asked, he denied following them the previous day. According to global union IndustriALL, such sinister activity is not uncommon in Mauritius. A spokesman said: ‘Union leaders have their phones tapped and are followed by the secret police. ‘It is not uncommon for factory managements to establish unions that they control in order to mask their poor labour practices.’","Women are paid 62p an hour in Mauritius to make £45 'feminist' T-shirts .

"A British plane passenger held up in an Ebola scare at a Las Vegas airport decided to tweet about the unfolding events as only the British know how - with a heavy dose of sarcasm. Sasha Sabapathy, a social media manager at digital marketing company Deep Focus, was on the Delta flight travelling from New York's JFK to Las Vegas when stewards said two passengers from Africa had fallen ill this morning. Emergency services immediately quarantined the plane and its passengers, including the sharp-tongued former Bristol University student who took to Twitter to vent her frustration at the lack of information. 'Ok so Delta just told us the sick person just came from Africa. This is def (sic) an Ebola scare. No one will say Ebola tho (sic) it's like Voldermort', she tweeted. Chaos: Emergency services surround the Delta flight from New York's JFK that landed this morning at Las Vegas' McCarren Airport after a passenger from Africa complained of being ill . Angry: Sasha Sabapathy, a social media manager and former Bristol University student, was on the flight at the time, and took her frustrations to Twitter . After being in quarantine for a bit longer, she starts to get indications that the passengers do not have Ebola. As her impatience grows, she messages the Delta Airline assist page directly and asks if the passengers can have free alcohol. They reply saying: 'Sorry for all the trouble. Can you pls follow and DM your confirm number?' McCarran spokeswoman Christine Crews told My News 3 the flight was quarantined at the gate 'after reports that a passenger who had recently traveled in Africa vomited on board the aircraft. A spokesman for Delta Airlines told Fox News the passenger handed a flight attendant a note saying that person was not feeling well. Delta said the situation was not a 'communicable disease' event. Here are a selection of her tweets: . Shocked: MissSabapathy starts her commentary with a reference to Harry Potter when Delta announces that two passengers are ill . Annoyed: She continues her online dialogue of events inside the plane, but begins to get indications that they may have Ebola . Rant: In her third run of tweets, she criticizes the CDC for not reacting fast enough, and even messages Delta directly asking for free alcohol to 'numb the experience' Firefighters, health officials and CDC officials responded and determined after a thorough assessment that the passenger did not meet the criteria for Ebola. Last weekend, a sick passenger who landed at Newark was checked out for Ebola but turned out to be asymptomatic. The more than 200 passengers on board were initially held on the plane as medical personnel responded before they were allowed to leave. Yesterday, Hazmat teams rushed on to a plane from Philadelphia in the Dominican Republic after a man sneezed and yelled: 'I have Ebola!' The American passenger, who does not have Ebola, was detained by four officers and taken to the airport's medical center in Punta Cana as he declared: 'I ain't from Africa'. The remaining 255 people were forced to stay on board for two hours until he was cleared, despite airline staff insisting they believed it was a poor-taste joke.

"'Chubbs': Irfan Naseer researched bomb-making methods online . Britain was yesterday warned of a new generation of terrorists inspired by  the internet. In a worrying first, three men convicted of plotting an atrocity to eclipse 7/7 were not recruited by radical preachers, but influenced by extremist rantings online. They made their own way to Pakistan where they were easily able to locate and join Al Qaeda training camps. On their return they set about raising cash, recruiting suicide bombers and building a new and deadlier type of rucksack bomb. Irfan Naseer, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali wanted to create a new landmark date of horror that would surpass the 2005 London bombings as ‘revenge for everything’. They plotted to use bombs and guns, attach knives to cars and drive them into crowds – a tactic they called ‘the Ultimate Mowing Machine’ – and smear poison on car door handles. The group were inspired to mass murder by the internet rantings of US-born Yemeni extremist Anwar Al-Awlaki. And their sophisticated plot provoked fears at the highest levels of Government about a wave of self-starting ‘Nike’ terrorists, so called because of Al-Awlaki’s rallying cry of ‘just do it’ – the sportswear company’s catchphrase. 'Little Irfan': Birmingham born Irfan Khalid travelled to Pakistan for terror training . Security experts are alarmed at the ease with which two of the men, Naseer and Khalid, made contact with Al Qaeda command in Pakistan. They fear other fanatics have been self-radicalised and could decide unprompted to launch suicide missions in Britain. In previous cases, terror suspects have been recruited or radicalised by Al Qaeda operatives in Britain before being sent overseas for training. Fortunately, the gang made several mistakes, and in a reference to the black comedy film about bungling suicide bombers, Ali told his estranged wife Salma Kabal: ‘Oh, you think this is a flipping Four Lions. We’re one man short.’ The gang, who lived on benefits, tricked members of the public into funding the operation by posing as street collectors for Muslim Aid during Ramadan. They raised more than £12,000 but lost £9,000 in just five days after gambling on the stock exchange in an attempt to boost their coffers. And Naseer, 31, bought an instant cold pack in the mistaken belief it contained ammonium nitrate, which can cause explosions. Yesterday the trio were convicted of terrorist offences at Woolwich Crown Court. It can now be revealed that: . 'The joker': Ashik Ali joked that the terrorists were like the cell depicted in the comedy film 'Four Lions' The plot was smashed in the biggest security operation since the 2006 attempt to smuggle liquid bombs on planes destined for the US. Counter terrorism police and MI5 arrested 11 men and one woman across Birmingham in September 2011. They were all brought up in first generation Pakistani and Bangladeshi families. Police and MI5 carried out a huge bugging operation which recorded the gang’s damning comments. Scroll down for video . Plot: Irfan Khalid and Irfan Naseer arrive at Birmingham airport before heading to Pakistan for terrorist training . Training camps: Khalid and Naseer (pictured with the trolley) were caught on CCTV going back and forth to Pakistan from Birmingham Airport to receive instruction on plotting their attack on Britain . Collecting for terror: Irfan Naseer left and Irfan Khalid holding bucket undertake bogus charity collections in Birmingham to secretly raise funds for their bombing campaign .

Charity funded terror: The men posed as . fundraisers for a Muslim charity (left) then used the cash to pay for . bomb devices such as this alarm clock (right) The hidden devices revealed how the . men worshipped the 7/7 bombers and the internet writings of Osama Bin . Laden, boasting their attack would be ‘another 9/11.’ A radio debate was held this morning on how to tackle the problem of extremism in Birmingham. Marcus Beale, Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘There's been some unfair criticism of our communities in Birmingham around their contact with the police over this issue. ‘There was some reporting that came to us around some of these individuals, around how they were trying to collect money with buckets on various streets. I’d very much welcome people coming up to us and telling us. ‘The case is a really timely reminder that the terrorism threat is sometimes pretty close to home. As any threat, it will adapt and change as time goes by.’ Jahan Mahmood, who works with young Muslim men in Birmingham on anti-radicalisation projects, told BBC Radio 4: ‘There has been a breakdown of trust for a number of reasons. This community has done a lot in tackling extremism. ‘In the past we have worked together. We've been trying to rebuild relationships. It's not been easy but we are working at a better level now and I'm sure if we continue we will be able to rebuild our ties with police. ‘I've often heard young men talk about Afghanistan and there's a lot of bravado. Everybody wants to give someone close to them the benefit of the doubt. Do they really understand the potential dangers of going to Pakistan? ‘We need to get to the people out there who sometimes are not engaged in their own communities. It’s difficult to reach them. It’s like a sub-culture within a culture. Nobody wants to be seen having any relationship or connections within that.’ They . were also inspired by Al-Awlaki, a key figure of Al Qaeda In The . Arabian Peninsula, who was killed in a drone strike 12 days after their . arrest. Officials named Al-Awlaki the architect of ‘just do it’ terrorism after he wrote an article in Inspire, an English language . online magazine he co-founded in 2010. The . fanatic said: ‘Assassinations, bombings, and acts of arson are all . legitimate forms of revenge against a system that relishes the sacrilege . of Islam in the name of freedom.’ One . of the gang’s possible targets was a military base, probably in the . West Midlands, in April or May 2012, around the time the Royal wedding . took place. The Olympics could also have been targeted. Trial judge Mr Justice Henriques told the three men they will all face life in prison after the guilty verdicts yesterday. He told Naseer: ‘You are a highly skilled bomb maker and explosives expert. Your mindset was similarly manifest. ‘You . sought to persuade others that a terror plot here in this country was . by far preferable to fighting jihad abroad. You were seeking to recruit a . team of somewhere between six and eight suicide bombers to carry out a . spectacular bombing campaign, one which would create an anniversary . along the lines of 7/7 or 9/11.’ Naseer . was convicted of five counts of preparing terrorist acts, Khalid of . four and Ali of three. They will be sentenced in April or May. They . were joined in the terror cell by law graduate Rahin Ahmed, 26, who . became their chief financier as they used fluorescent jackets and . charity buckets to cheat the public. A fifth man, Mujahid Hussain, 21, was convicted of joining the terror plot, raising money and collecting terrorist information. Four . further men, Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Shahid Khan, 21, Naweed Ali, 24, and . Khobaib Hussain, 20, admitted travelling to Pakistan to further the . terrorist plot.

Prosecution: Ashik Ali was taken from the car and is detained along with the two other men who were all found guilty of terrorism offences at Woolwich Crown Court today . [caption . Police received no intelligence from the Muslim community in Birmingham about the terror cell, even after relatives of four of the gang discovered they had travelled to Pakistan. The only time police were contacted about any of them was over an allegation of aggressive fundraising, concerning their charity street collections. The lack of information raises questions over Prevent, the Home Office’s strategy to combat violent extremism, which has police community engagement at its core. Detective Inspector Adam Gough, senior investigating officer in the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit, said the extended families of Ishaaq Hussain, Shahid Khan, Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali ‘became aware’ the men had gone to a terror training camp when Khan called home.Although the families immediately pressured them into returning, none contacted police. Police and security services were aware the four were travelling, and they had been recorded talking about getting their families into paradise through their martyrdom. But officers decided against stopping them at that time to preserve the surveillance operation. According to detectives, none of the men received any terror training as they left the camps after a day. Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said that while the ‘ideal’ scenario would have been for the relatives to inform police of what had happened, the families had ‘tried to do their best to bring them back and stop them from getting into harm’.

"Banksy cancelled Wednesday's work due to 'police activity' but he was back painting the streets of New York today, with a fresh piece on the side of a Hell's Kitchen stripclub. The graffiti - a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers as though he's just been stood up - was discovered early this morning on the roller door at the Hustler Club at 641 West 51st Street. His caption reads: 'Waiting in vain... at the door of the club.' Scroll down for video . Back to work: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's work due to 'police activity' but he was back brightening up the streets of New York today, with a fresh piece, pictured, on the side of a Hell's Kitchen strip club . Club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it. According to the Gothamist, Wright has been letting Banksy fans pose with the piece 'if (they) ask him nicely.' Today, is the 24th day of the British street artist's month-long open-air residency in New York City, Better Out Than In. There are only 7 days left. The Hustler Club's New York Marketing . Director, Steve Karel, told Gothamist this afternoon: 'We're honored . that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt's Hustler Club New York to share his . art. Honored: 'Honored' club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determined how best to preserve it . 'We respect the art and artist; while we'd love to leave the work in place, it's required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future—hopefully inside of the club.' Bansky revealed NYPD officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day. The world-renowned street artist cancelled Wednesday's artwork after New York officials urged people to file . complaints against the London-based man of mystery and boosted NYPD patrols looking for graffiti. The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: 'Today's art has been cancelled due to police activity.' On hiatus: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's artwork, it remains to be seen if he will resume his month-long one-man show . Early rumors swirled around the city . that the anonymous artist had been arrested, but those were shot down by . an NYPD spokesperson who spoke to Gothamist. The . website has announced the locations of each day's work for his 'Better . Out Than In,' graffiti spree across the city this month. No further details were given. Just last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg bemoaned Banksy's month-long 'residency' on the city's streets. 'Nobody's . a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,' the mayor told media. 'I . just think there are some places for art and some places where… no art.' Street sculpture: British street artist Banksy's October 22 addition to his New York residency was this foam and cement sphinx in Willets Point, Queens, though it wasn't there long . 'Running . up to somebody's property or public property and defacing it is not my . definition of art,' the billionaire mayor continued. 'Or it may be art, . but it should not be permitted, and I think that's exactly what the law . says.' Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s month-long street show. Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader's work. When a painting of a beaver popped up on an east New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it. But he might be getting the richest from the found art. WATCH MORE AT THE UNDERGROUND FX . 'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' Veles told the New York Post. Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but 'I don't want to say more,' he said. Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside. As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled 'all the way!' in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off. Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum . Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said. One of Veles' workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars. 'You don't own it,' screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd. 'Are you looking to start something,' the worker said in Requena's face. 'I don’t want to fight,' said Requena. 'We just want to take pictures and you're blocking it.' Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces. For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.' On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled  'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St . Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting . Banksy's Monday offering to the streets of New York is this picture of a young boy writing graffiti in the South Bronx, 153rd Street and Elton Avenue, while being served by a waiter in tails .

"A Sydney teenager may have fled Australia with his three brothers to join the Islamic State (IS) in Syria, but it appears the organisation will have to wait until he's got all his school homework done before he can give them his full attention. It's anyone's guess what sort of homework he's brushing up on now for the Syrian jihad, however after telling his parents he and his three brothers had won a holiday to Thailand, 17-year-old Mohamed K, also asked one of his teachers for homework to take with him because he didn't want to fall behind in his studies. The Australian reported that the request may have been a way of covering his tracks, but the boy's actions were so out of character sources close to his family have questioned whether he knew he was travelling to Syria with his brothers at all, and that they may have tricked him into going. You need to do your homework on this: A fighter from the Free Syrian Army (left) and one from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (center), join forces to fight Islamic State group militants in Kobani, Syria . Instead of going on holiday the four left Sydney on November 8 and flew to Thailand before travelling to Turkey, and from there it's believed they crossed into Syria to join IS. Known only as the 'K brothers', because The Australian has elected not to name them, the four siblings are aged between 17 to 28 years old. Mohamed K is the youngest of the four. Milad K is the eldest, while the middle boys are Moustafa and Karim.

'His (sic) a winner at the end of the day im (sic) so proud of him. Wish i had the chance to go yo (sic) syria,' he said.

The youngest Mohamed K may have only been a student, but Mr K said that the eldest brother Milad had given up an $80,000-a-year job with RMS, and had separated from his fiancee who he had planned to marry next month, to go to Syria instead. The two other brothers Moustafa and Karim were unemployed. A fifth brother is still living in Australia.

"Roger Bolton, of Radio 4’s Feedback programme, said that some secular teachers are also ‘unsympathetic to religious education’ Fear of ‘offending’ different faiths means pupils are not being taught the true meaning of Christmas in schools, according to a BBC presenter. Roger Bolton, of Radio 4’s Feedback programme, said that some secular teachers are also ‘unsympathetic to religious education’. As a result, many pupils are not learning the crucial fact that Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus. A lack of understanding of Christianity is also preventing youngsters from gaining a proper understanding of religious imagery in literature and drama as well as European art. This ‘ignorance’ in schools is being compounded by broadcasters’ reluctance to tackle ‘faith issues’ in children’s programmes. Mr Bolton, who previously presented Sunday, Radio 4’s main programme for religious news and current affairs, condemned the trend in a ‘viewpoint’ piece written for this weeks Radio Times. He said the Band Aid single, Do They Know It’s Christmas? would be better renamed for school children as ‘Do They Know What Christmas Is?’ He said: ‘Older readers might think this is a redundant question, but I’m afraid it’s not. ‘In some schools in this country, little is taught about the true meaning of Christmas, possibly because secular staff are unsympathetic to religious education or because of the fear of offending those of other faiths. ‘And broadcasters aren’t doing much to remedy this ignorance. It is difficult to find any children’s programmes that regularly deal with faith issues.’ Mr Bolton said there were ‘exceptions’ such as On Angel’s Wings, a BBC1 animation this Christmas, which is based on War Horse author, Michael Morpurgo’ s picture book. It tells the Christmas story from the point of view of a young shepherd boy. ‘But there is little else in prospect, and the consequences of this lack of coverage are becoming evident,’ he said. The presenter pointed to a Bible Society survey published earlier this year that claimed a quarter of children had ‘never read, seen or heard of Noah’s Ark’. Fear of ‘offending’ different faiths means pupils are not being taught the true meaning of Christmas in schools, according to a BBC presenter . A similar proportion was ignorant of the Nativity; 43 per cent had never heard of the Crucifixion, and 53 per cent had ‘never read, seen or heard’ of Joseph and his coat of many colours. Mr Bolton wrote: ‘Does this matter? I think it does, for both cultural and communal reasons. ‘The United Kingdom cannot be understood without appreciating the role Christian culture has played in its development, from the introduction of the parish system to the replacement of a monarch (James II) because he was a Roman Catholic. ‘In the time of Henry VIII what one believed about the doctrine of ‘transubstantiation’ was literally a matter of life and death. ‘Our 17th-century Civil War was fought in large part over the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings. ‘Without a knowledge of Christianity, what will our schoolchildren make of much of our finest literature and drama, filled as it is with Christian imagery? Or much of the finest European art?’ A lack of understanding of Christianity is also preventing youngsters from gaining a proper understanding of religious imagery in literature and drama as well as European art . Mr Bolton said the Band Aid single, Do They Know It’s Christmas? would be better renamed for school children as ‘Do They Know What Christmas Is?’ He added: ‘It is also vital that children of other faiths learn about Christmas. How can they begin to integrate into our country if they know little of the faith still at its heart? ‘Of course, the reverse applies, too. How can they feel welcome in this country if we make no real effort to understand what is often the most important thing to them and their families – their faiths?’ A better understanding of faith ‘would also do politicians no harm when they come to debate whether or not to intervene in parts of the world where religion is still a matter of life and death’. Mr Bolton is trustee of the Sandford St Martin Trust Awards, which are given to encourage better coverage of religious and ethical issues in broadcasting. Due to concerns about a lack of understanding of Christianity, it is introducing a new category in 2015 for children’s programmes. The trust has previously given awards to programmes made about Jewish and Islamic subjects, and to programmes made by atheists. Mr Bolton added: ‘Our roots, however, are in Christianity, like the UK as a whole, and while I will certainly buy the new Band Aid 30 single, Do They Know It’s Christmas? I also want all our children to know what Christmas really means.’ A BBC spokesperson said the corporation’s children’s programming ‘reflects different religions and cultures throughout our programming across the year’ and that religion was ‘at the heart of the Christmas schedule’.","Radio 4's Roger Bolton criticised teachers who dodge subject of Jesus .

"The first of 600 U.S. soldiers have arrived in eastern Europe as a Pentagon spokesman declared the mission was sending a 'message to Moscow'. But the Nato drills prompted a backlash from Russia, which sent its troops on exercises along the Ukrainian border today and declared: 'We have to react somehow'. The escalation of east-west tensions comes amid a slowly rising death toll in Ukraine, where the government renewed its crackdown today on pro-Russian militants leaving at least five shot dead. Drills: 150 U.S. troops have arrived at an air force base in Swidwin, Poland, prompting a Kremlin backlash . Marching out: There will be 600 U.S. Nato troops spread between Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania . Inspection: Polish Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak walks in front of the first U.S. troops to arrive yesterday . Around 150 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived yesterday at an air force base in Swidwin, western Poland, as the U.S. stepped up its presence in eastern Europe. Flying to the region from their previous posting in Italy, they were met by Polish troops in similar red berets and the nation's defence minister. Within a few days there will be 450 more American Nato troops spread between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Americans insisted the military exercises will not be a precursor to intervention in Ukraine, which is not a Nato member, and they could last until next year. But Rear Admiral John Kirby, a top Defense . Department spokesman, said the deployments sent a strong message to Nato allies about U.S. commitments to the alliance following events in . Ukraine. 'If there's a . message to Moscow, it is the same exact message that we take our . obligations very, very seriously on the continent of Europe,' he added. Gathering storm: The U.S. troops (pictured) have prompted the Kremlin to mount new military drills . Warm welcome: Polish troops in green assembled in Swidwin (left) including General Adam Josk, the commander of the 6 Airborne Brigade in Krakow, pictured with the U.S.  Brigade commander Michael Foster . Reinforcements: The U.S. paratroopers could be taking part in the joint exercises until next year . But Russia has insisted the build-up may violate the Founding Act, a 1997 agreement between . Moscow and Nato. Today Russian Defense . Minister Sergei Shoigu reacted by ordering new military exercises in Russia's . south and west, along the Ukrainian border. The latest exercises - which add to the tens of thousands of troops already massed on the border - will involve . ground and air forces. 'We have to react to these developments somehow,' he said. Mr Shoigu quoted unspecified sources claiming Kiev has deployed more than . 11,000 troops and 160 tanks against just 2,000 pro-Russian insurgents. Today Russian President Vladimir Putin added: 'If the Kiev government is using the army against its own people this is clearly a grave crime.' The U.S. and Nato have insisted their troops will not intervene in Ukraine despite Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and a . buildup of Russian forces on the border. But they are 'temporarily' boosting their presence in eastern . Europe in a drive to reassure allies that they would have protection against any Russian aggression. Touching down: The troops will be assembling in four Baltic states over the next few days . Working together: The Polish troops (in green) and Americans (in grey) marched in the same ceremony . Reactions: Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said the deployments, praised by Poland, Estonia and Latvia, would 'strengthen our readiness for collective defence and will add to ensuring safety of our people' Relaxed: Polish General Adam Joks with Michael Foster, Commander of the U.S. army's 173rd Airborne Brigade . Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all have their own Russian-speaking . minorities and governments there are worries the crisis in Ukraine could spread. The . Latvian government welcomed the move, calling it a 'fast and . practical response.' Estonian Defence Minister Sven Mikser added it 'significantly increases the security of Estonia.' And Lithuanian President Dalia . Grybauskaite said the deployments would 'strengthen our readiness for . collective defence and will add to ensuring safety of our people.' Poland, which only emerged from . Soviet-imposed communism in 1989, has also called for a strong presence of western troops. The exercises run in month-long rounds in what the Pentagon calls a 'persistent rotational . presence' that stops short of permanently basing troops in the Baltic states. The American frigate USS Taylor has also returned to the Black Sea, just as the guided-missile destroyer USS Donald Cook prepares to leave in the next few days.","Nato soldiers will be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania .

"A top girls' private school headteacher has said pressure from parents is leaving pupils unable to deal with failure. St Paul's Girls' School head Clarissa Farr said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and were frightened of how this would reflect on themselves. She described the fathers and mothers of some children 'snowplough parents' who were overprotective and would clear the way in front of their children so nothing would go wrong. The 'High Mistress' of St Paul's Girls' School said many parents refused to accept their children coming in second place - and claimed they were 'frightened' of anything that might result in failure . They also treated school like a 'bespoke, commercial service' and had a Darwinian approach to life and anything less than 11A*s was an 'utter disaster'. Speaking at the Girls' Schools Association conference this week, she said that parents were guilty of 'affluent neglect' by not showing enough attention to their children in the evenings. 'Their children will succeed above all and they're not at all on board with the idea of school as a community, learning to come second or that learning to give ground is an important part of education.' She added: 'Parents have very high aspirations — they have a kind of ticking, frenetic anxiety — even the ones who are delightful to deal with are on edge because they haven't really got enough time to have the conversation they're trying to have with you. 'Anything that might result in success not happening for their son or daughter, in however small an arena, they're very frightened of.' The independent school in West London is one of the most academic schools in the country and charges up to £22,500 a year - their headmistress said pushy parents meant their children would not cope with failure . Mrs Farr's West London independent school charges parents up to £22,500 a year. Its decorated alumni include broadcaster Susanna Reid, Alexandra Shulman, the editor-in-chief of Vogue and Harriet Harman, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. The head, known as the 'High Mistress' at the school, said parents made things as easy as possible for their children which left them over-protected and unable to cope with failure, The Times reported last night. She added: 'Again at the more extreme ends I've certainly noticed an increase in the expectation among parents that what is arranged for their daughter will be specific and bespoke. 'If she happens to speak a language that you don't offer, it will be expected that you provide appropriate tuition. 'Something that shocked me quite a lot, and I've seen it more in the last few years, is the naked impatience with the idea of putting other people first that you see coming from parents. 'I think that's a growing trend among city parents who have a sort of Darwinian attitude to their children's education.' Clarissa Farr (pictured) said parents at the prestigious public school had a Darwinian approach to life and anything less than 11A*s was an 'utter disaster' and wanted to shield their children from failure . Teachers at city schools also had to be trained how to deal with high-achieving people used to getting what they wanted, The Times reported. Mrs Farr added: 'They are over-protected. Snowplough parents is a great description: clearing everything away in front of the child so that nothing can go wrong, self-esteem valued above all other attributes, anything that might threaten self-esteem must be moved to the side. 'Protection from failure: not being selected for a play or the first lacrosse team etc or having the utter disaster of getting only 10 A*s instead of 11. 'A lack of perseverance — when they do come up against some failure or difficulty they don't have the equipment to deal with it because parents have prevented this.' But the head praised some of her pupils for their awareness of current affairs and said many were doing community work. She said: 'There's a lot to be proud of. They've seen these cataclysmic, economic environmental and political events playing out in their world, in a context where accessibility of information means it's right up in your face. That's changed the way they look at life.'","St Paul's Girls' School head said parents put pressure on their children .

"Cut off by the Nazis, 340,000 Allied troops were evacuated from northern France during the 'Miracle of Dunkirk' in 1940. But somehow, James May got left behind. Undaunted, the 20-year-old soldier stole a car and managed to evade the Germans, eventually finding a skipper six days later to sail him home. Four years on, he was back - storming the beaches of Normandy as part of Operation Neptune - and lived to tell the tale. Now aged 93, he has finally been awarded his campaign medals - almost 68 years after peace was declared. Reluctant hero: James May, 93, pictured with his medals at home in Dunkeswell, Devon - he didn't collect the medals for 68 years, but says he is proud to have them now . Despite his . heroism, Mr May prefers not to dwell on his wartime experiences - and it . was not until a neighbour in his home town of Dunkeswell in Devon asked . to see his war medals that he felt the absence of them. As a young man . after the war ended, he had never bothered to claim them. After discovering this, the neighbour began the process of applying for them on Mr May's behalf. The six campaign medals due to him were the 1939-45 star, the War Medal, the Defence Medal, the France and . Germany star, the . Normandy Medal and the Dunkirk medal. Now that he has received them, Mr May said he is proud to have the reminder of his loyal service in - and lucky escape from - two such seminal historic events of the last century. 'I was just 20 years old in 1940 - I wasn't interested in medals but I'm proud now that I have got them,' he revealed.' Mr May said that he left London and joined the Royal Army Service Corps in 1940 as a driver with the British Expeditionary Force. He was stationed in France and was meant to evacuate with other Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbours of Dunkirk as part of 'Operation Dynamo', intended to rescue the British, French and Belgian soldiers who had been cut off by the encroaching German invaders. Honoured: Mr May's medals including the 1939-45 star,  the France and Germany star, the War Medal, the Defence Medal, the Normandy Medal and the Dunkirk medal . Brave troops: Vessels for the invasion of Normandy, seen from deck of the HMS Warspite . But while nearly 340,000 troops were rescued by a band of 850 ships - many of which were privately owned and included motor yachts and fishing boats - May was not one of them. Left behind, the soldier went on the run across Nazi-occupied France in a stolen car with six of his army comrades. Six days later the group found a . skipper who agreed to sail them back home. On the way they were still under threat, and were shadowed . by a German U-boat before they finally came ashore on the English . coast. After two years . serving in Northern Ireland, he returned to France for the Normandy landings in . June 1944 - also known as Operation Neptune, the invasion began on D-Day, 6 June 1944, and ended on 30 June 1944. The landings were undertaken in two . phases - an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after . midnight, and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of France . starting at 6.30am. In total, more than 160,000 soldiers attacked along a 50-mile stretch of coast. Normandy: The landings were undertaken in two phases, an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of France starting at 6:30 am . The Allies swiftly established a firm foothold in Normandy, and Mr May was part of one of the great turning points for Allied fortunes in World War Two. His role was as a driver of one of the DUKW amphibious landing vehicle known as . 'ducks'. 'It was just luck I suppose, surviving . the war,' said Mr May. 'I was a duck driver on D-Day and when they fired the big gun . on the back the thing nearly went over.' He remained in the Army until 1946. After being demobbed Mr May began working in sales, married his wife Elsie, and retired to Devon with her more than 30 years ago. Stoic: 'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him,' said Mr May's neighbour . Next-door-neighbour Jim Greenshields helped Mr May obtain his six campaign medals after a chat revealed that Mr May had nothing to show for his time in the Armed Forces. 'I used to chat to him about the war - he has been through quite a lot but doesn't really want to talk about it,' said Mr Greenshields, a flying instructor at Dunkeswell aerodrome. 'It is amazing that he was at D-day and Dunkirk - not many can say that, as I would imagine the odds of surviving both are pretty slim.' But Mr Greenshields said that his neighbour was not one for fuss, and preferred to be stalwart about the medals. 'He is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal, but I could see what it meant to him.' Hailed . by Winston Churchill as a 'miracle of deliverance', the evacuation of . Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk is one of the . best-known episodes of the Second World War. After . British, French and Belgian troops became cut off by the advancing . German army, some 850 ships sailed to France to rescue them. They . included the 'famous little ships of Dunkirk', a flotilla of about 700 . merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and lifeboats. Between May 27 and June 4, 1940, around 340,000 soldiers were rescued, including almost 200,000 British troops. The . mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, incurred significant losses, . however, and Churchill warned afterwards: 'Wars are not won by . evacuations'. The . British premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the Allied . operations in Western Europe prior to the evacuation had been a . 'colossal military disaster'. Nine . Allied destroyers - six British and three French - were sunk during . Operation Dynamo, and more than 100 RAF aircraft were lost in the . fighting.","James May, then 20, missed last boat home in 1940 as the British retreated .

"Migrants arriving from the European Union could be required to register with police as part of the immigration reforms announced yesterday by David Cameron, it has been reported. Mr Cameron hopes that the new packet of measures, which the Tories say they will implement if they regain power in the general election in May, will work to cut overall levels of immigration by making it harder to stay in Britain without a job. But critics were quick to point out that it would be difficult to monitor and deport any out-of-work migrants - arguing that they were unlikely to appear on official databases. Scroll down for video . Reform: Mr Cameron hopes that the new packet of measures he announced during a speech yesterday (pictured) will work to cut overall levels of immigration by making it harder to stay in Britain without a job . Now the Daily Telegraph has reported that the solution might be in a controversial scheme that would see migrants being forced to register at a police station on their arrival. Setting out his plans yesterday, Mr Cameron said that unemployed EU migrants will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. The Prime Minister believes it could dramatically reduce Britain's appeal to workers in central and eastern Europe, who are able to top-up their incomes with in-work benefits like tax credits. But questions were raised over how authorities would keep track of whether migrants gained employment, stating that it the proposed deportations wouldn't be possible without this information. The answer might be requiring immigrants to sign in with police on their arrival, an unnamed source has told the Daily Telegraph. The policy would mean that an individual could be monitored - and deported from the UK if they were still unemployed after six months. FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer . Deportation if they do not get a job for six months . Other measures include: . Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU . Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK . Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals . Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels . The source said: 'We are considering all options. And requiring migrants to sign in and register is one of the things we are looking at.' The practice is common in a number of other countries, and minister believe it would be straightforward to set up a similar scheme here. Mr Cameron has abandoned an attempt to impose a limit on the number of people who can come to Britain, despite latest figures showing a record rise in EU immigration. Aides concede the idea of a cap or an 'emergency brake' if the number of migrants from individual countries suddenly soared, were too complex to implement. Several senior EU figures had warned it would be illegal and breach the fundamental right to free movement across the continent. Today Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond denied that Mr Cameron 'backed off' his plans in the face of pressure from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Hammond acknowledged that ministers had consulted with other EU member states ahead of Mr Cameron's long-awaited speech. However, he rejected reports that the Prime Minister had dropped plans for a cap following the intervention of Mrs Merkel, who has made no secret of her opposition to any measures which undermine the principle of the free movement of labour within the EU. He said: 'I don't think that is right. What is right is that we have sought to work with our partners in the European Union to understand the best way of delivering a reduction in immigration numbers from the EU in to the UK.' Instead, Mr Cameron has focused on a package of measures limiting access to benefits which is much more draconian than anything proposed to date by Labour or the Lib Dems. Yesterday in a speech at a JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Cameron announced the measures intended to make it more difficult to stay without a job. Doubt: Critics were quick to point out that it would be difficult to monitor and deport any out-of-work migrants - arguing that they were unlikely to appear on official databases. Above, Mr Cameron speaking yesterday . He said that, a new fund will also be promised in the Tory General Election manifesto to help areas worst affected by dramatic influxes of immigrants. He believes it could dramatically reduce Britain's appeal to workers in central and eastern Europe, who are able to top-up their incomes with in-work benefits like tax credits. The Prime Minister demanded the new rules to apply to countries joining the EU, ensuring their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed. The reform would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. At least seven countries, including Turkey, have suggested they want to join the EU. Mr Cameron made clear that without agreement on allowing the UK to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to EU migrants, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. The Tory leader has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the next election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He said: 'It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country. 'People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control.' While his proposed curbs on benefits will apply to existing EU countries, he wants to go further for new member states. The PM insisted that if his renegotiation of EU membership is a success he will campaign to keep Britain in.","Scheme would force migrants to sign in with police station upon arrival .

'In all the seats that we needed to do well in, in order to hang onto - the drift is going away from us,' he told the Seven Network. 'We're heading towards a Labor win. I think they'll be a lot of soul-searching after this.' Victorian Labor Party leader Daniel Andrews and his wife Catherine cast their vote for the Victorian State election in Melbourne, Saturday.

Health Minister David Davis said the Liberal Party remained hopeful of gaining ground when postal and pre-polling votes are counted. 'This is a situation where about a third of the votes are not counted and will not be counted tonight. In that circumstance we need to be careful about making hasty judgments,' Mr Davis said. Spirits were low at the Liberal party post-election event at Melbourne's Sofitel, where a thin crowd had been served smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches while they watched the count.

Former federal treasurer Peter Costello said the Napthine Liberal government had suffered because it had failed to properly sell the East West Link plan. 'If the government was going to be re-elected and win the election it had to make that the dominant issue of the campaign,' said Costello. But Costello, and others, said there were also federal issues at play. 'I think the last federal budget was clearly toxic in Victoria,' he said. When Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten introduced the new Premier at a Labor party function, he said the win was a clear message for Tony Abbott. 'They said this couldn't happen. They said that a first term government couldn't lose. We are witnessing history in the making. This is a sensational outcome,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne.

Shorten said Victorians were sending a strong message to Prime Minister Tony Abbott with their votes in the state election . Former Victorian community services minister Mary Wooldridge also said the Abbott budget had 'been significant' and cited the rise in petrol tax and cuts to the ABC as particularly unpopular with Victorian voters. Labor focus groups showed concern over university fee deregulation was another key issue, and one senior Labor source said voters often mentioned their concerns about the Abbott government, but no strong anger against the Napthine government. Federal Labor frontbencher and Victorian senator Kim Carr told reporters that car-making electorates and fruit-processing areas like Shepparton had swung away from the coalition because of a lack of industry support - but agreed the Abbott budget was also a big factor.","Denis Napthine has conceded defeat in the Victorian election and announces he will step down as leader of the Liberal party .

"The sister of a Malaysian student allegedly enslaved by an extreme Left-wing sect for decades has today flown into Britain to see her 'before either of us dies'. Retired teacher Kamar Mautum says one of . the three captives freed last month is her sibling Aishah Wahab, who . disappeared after joining the Maoist faction based in Brixton, south London. She has landed at Heathrow with documents said to prove the captive is her sister and now hopes to see her for the first time in at least 30 years. Scroll down for video . Flying in: Malaysian Kamar Mautum, a retired teacher, arrives at Heathrow from Kuala Lumpur, she believes her 69 year old sister, Aishah, right as a child, is one of the women allegedly held captive in South London . As she boarded a flight from Kuala Lumpur to London last night to be reunited with her sister, now aged 69, Mrs Mautum said: ‘I have felt so choked without her for years and years. ‘She was so talented; she was the apple of my mother’s eye. She asked for her on her deathbed.’ Miss Wahab is believed to have suffered a stroke while she was allegedly held captive by sect leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and his partner Chanda, who were arrested in Brixton, South London last week. Her sister added: ‘This has been a dark age for her and for all of us. I will do anything to bring her home. I want to see her before either of us dies. I am not sure if she will remember me but I am hopeful she will. ‘I hope her health is OK and she is receiving all the help she needs.’ Slavery case: Maoists Aravindan Balakrishnan, left, and his wife Chanda, in the wheelchair outside a 1997 inquest into the death of commune member Sian Davies . Aishah’s eldest sister, Hasnah Abdul Wahab, 88, said: 'I will hug her and cry if she comes back home'. She told AFP at her Malaysian home: 'I thank Allah - he has realised my prayers to meet Aishah before I die. 'We have been looking for her for a long, long time.' Neighbours said today that over a number of years they may have seen the 'slaves' standing at windows for hours on end and one would sometimes hold notes. Charlotte Watts, who lived near where Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda lived in Brixton, told the Evening Standard: 'Because (the window) was so high up and (the notes) were in Biro, I could never read what they were saying, so I feel desperately sad if she was trying to communicate something.' In shock: Aishah's sisters  Kamar Mautum, left, and Hasnah Abdul Wahab, right, say their prayers have been answered and they hope to bring their sibling home to Malaysia . Miss Wahab won a . Commonwealth scholarship to study surveying in the UK and moved here in . 1968 with her fiance Omar Munir. But she soon became involved in . extremist politics and turned her back on her middle-class upbringing. Cult leader: Aravindan Balakrishnan, also known as Comrade Bala, pictured in 1997, convinced his followers he was Jesus Christ, a man who rejected his doctrine said today . Attracted . to Balakrishnan’s group, Miss Wahab was so in awe of leader ‘Comrade . Bala’ that she and Omar rowed over her ‘loyalty’ to him and eventually . split, throwing her engagement ring in the Thames. The Malaysian government is said to have been wary about her returning home because of her politics. Miss Mautum said their brother, who lived in London, discouraged visits by his Maoist sister. ‘Aishah’s attitude was, “if you don’t want me, fine”. And then she disappeared,’ said Miss Mautum. The family later asked a prominent Malaysian radical, Ishammuddin Rais, to help find her, without success. Balakrishnan’s group eventually folded but Miss Wahab is believed to have remained one of his few followers. A former member claimed she ‘cut herself off from everybody’, adding: ‘She remained with them, was financially dependent on them, had no friends – she became more and more reliant on them.’ Video footage of Aishah emerged last night after she was filmed in the doorway of a south London property, shouting at a man who has asked to speak to Comrade Bala. The ITV report says that a Malaysian woman, seen wearing glasses and a plaid shirt, is believed to be Aishah. Last night a picture of Aravindan Balakrishnan - the Maoist 'sect leader' accused of keeping three 'slaves' captive for more than 30 years - was seen for the first time. The 73-year-old is accused with his wife Chanda, 67, of holding three women as slaves for three decades. The women are set to be formally interviewed by police today, according to reports. One of the women rescued from a Brixton council flat last month was the daughter of a renowned Bletchley Park codebreaker during the Second World War, it was also revealed. Investigation: Police stand guard at the property in Brixton, south London, and are following many lines of inquiry including links to 13 addresses across London . Josephine Herivel, 57, was allegedly held . captive by the couple along with 69-year-old Aishah Wahab, a Malaysian . student who came to Britain to study in 1968. Another woman, Sian Davies, who died in 1997, was a high-flying law student who studied at Cheltenham Ladies’ College before being ‘brainwashed’ by the militant communist collective in the 1970s. She is believed to be the mother of the third alleged slave, 30-year-old Rosie Davies, who is said to have spent most of her life locked up. Mystery: Sian Davies . died after in 1997 after falling out of a bathroom window . in the house the communists were living in in Brixton . Youngest victim: Rosie Davies' mother is believed to have fallen from a bathroom window and died . Yesterday her cousin Eleri Morgan said she bore a ‘striking resemblance’ to the youngest alleged slave, Rosie. The 64-year-old retired teacher, who has called for her cousin’s death to be investigated again, said: ‘She had everything going for her, such a promising and bright future. She met Comrade Bala and his wife whilst at university in London and I don’t know why, but she got sucked into his warped way of thinking and she became brainwashed.’ A total of 47 officers are now working on the inquiry, launched after one of the women - a 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irishwoman and a 69-year-old Malaysian - contacted staff from the Freedom . Charity last month, and eventually left the house in Brixton, south London, where they said they were being held. Police agreed to wait until last week to arrest the suspected captors, said to be Maoist activists Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife, Chanda Pattni. Commander Steve Rodhouse also said his team have requested court papers from the inquest into the death of Sian Davies, who was fatally injured when she fell from a window of a house used by the political group in Herne Hill, south London.

"Police shot and killed a 72-year-old man while searching the wrong home. Fort Worth, TX., police have blamed poor lighting after responding May 28 to a burglary alarm, searching the wrong home and shooting dead beloved husband Jerry Waller, according to an affidavit. The city of Fort Worth has had more than one incident involving misidentified homes this year, the second resulted in the wrong house being bulldozed. Mr. Waller’s home is across the street from the home the police should have been responding to, according to reports. Loving husband: Jerry Waller, 72, pictured with wife Kathy, was shot and killed May 28 by Fort Worth Police investigating a robbery at the wrong home . ‘Due to poor lighting conditions, and officers attempting to arrive on the scene undetected, [officers] inadvertently began searching 404 Havenwood Lane, directly across the street from 409 Havenwood Lane,’ according to an affidavit. The lack of lighting in the neighborhood confused officers B.B Hanlon and Arpie Hoeppner, both in their first year with the department. ‘There is no lighting around the home and the officers had only the use of their flashlights, they encountered a subject who was armed with a handgun standing near the corner of the home,’ the affidavit continued.’ What happened next was heard via police radio transmissions obtained by NBC DFW. A family devastated: Waller was shot by Fort Worth police as they searched his home for burglars in the dark using only flashlights . ‘The guy came out with a gun and wouldn’t put the gun down,’ Officer Hanlon said. ‘He pointed it at [Officer] Hoeppner, Hoeppner fired [his gun],’ the officer added. Both officers assert they identified themselves as police and asked Waller to put his gun down. Waller instead pointed his firearm at the officers, causing them to fire in self-defense, killing him in his garage. ‘We were disturbed by suggestions that the police may have felt threatened by a man in his own garage faced with unknown trespassers yielding flashlights,’ Waller’s daughter Angie told media the following day. Waller’s widow Kathy told NBC DFW she was ‘disgusted’ and called the rookie cops ‘trigger happy,’ Right home: This is the house that cops should have been searching . Wrong home: Waller's home, pictured here, is across the street from the home police should have searched . Mr. Waller grabbed his handgun after seeing lights outside their bedroom, she heard yelling immediately before her husband was shot dead in their garage, she added. Only a few weeks after this incident, on July 12, the city of Fort Worth demolished the wrong home, according to local reports. Sent to demolish a crumbling lakefront home, sub-contractors hired by the city instead demolished an antique-filled, treasured lake house handed down through generations of a family while the dilapidated home next door continued to fall apart in plain sight. Nothing left: This concrete slab used to be a treasured family lake house - until the city of Fort Worth demolished it by accident . The homeowner found out when he pulled up to the home on his way to a charity event and saw nothing except for a concrete slab – everything was gone, he told CBS DFW. The city has declined to comment on either case publicly, other than to say it is investigating both issues.","Jerry Waller was shot dead in his garage .

"The Pakistani home of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, the place where he was killed after the biggest manhunt in history, is no more. Pakistan security forces completed the demolition of bin Laden's compound on Sunday, erasing a symbol of humiliation for Pakistan's military that has marked one of the most difficult periods in U.S.-Pakistan ties. Bin Laden was killed in the house in Abbottabad on May 2, 2011 by U.S. commandos in a daring night raid that left the Pakistani military angry it had not been consulted. While much of the world cheered the death, Pakistan fumed over what it called a violation of its sovereignty. Scroll down for video . Historic: Pakistani youngsters play cricket on the rooftop of their house near the compound of Osama bin Laden, which has been completely demolished by authorities in Abbottabad . Good riddance! Osama bin Laden's former hideout where the Al Qaeda planned terror attacks is demolished by diggers... and not a day too soon . Bin Laden's lair: Local residents watch as the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the al Qaeda leader spent his last days is slowly demolished . 'The process of demolishing the . compound on Saturday evening has been completed on Sunday night,' a . senior security official in Abbottabad told Reuters. 'The whole structure of the building . has been razed to the ground. It actually took some time as the process . of demolition and removing the wreckage was going on simultaneously.' Why Pakistani authorities decided to demolish the structure now is unclear. Pakistan was outraged by the covert American raid in the northwestern town of Abbottabad because it was not informed beforehand - a decision the U.S. explained was driven by concerns that someone in the government might tip off bin Laden. The terror leader's death was cheered across the globe, but many Pakistanis were angry that the U.S. violated its territory and that its troops were powerless to stop American soldiers from attacking a compound located next to the country's elite military academy. The backhoes - heavy machines with strong crane-like digging arms - have torn down the tall boundary walls around bin Laden's compound and have destroyed more than half of the main building, where the al-Qaida chief lived for years with his wives and children. Army soldiers who were guarding the compound Saturday night handed authority over to the police in the morning and left. Work continued Sunday morning but halted around midday for unknown reasons. Work begins: Pakistani security personnel start the demolition of the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011 . Pakistani officials have declined to say why they decided to begin demolition. Residents of the normally sleepy town of Abbottabad were divided on what the government should do with the compound in the aftermath of the raid. Some thought it should be destroyed, but others believed it should be turned into a tourist attraction to help the town earn money. There was always the danger, however, that it could also draw al-Qaida supporters. Pulled down: The destruction of the building brings an end to the a stain on Pakistan's history and remained a start remainder of the al Qaeda leader and in turn the atrocities committed on 9/11 . The three-storey compound, pictured, where Osama bin Laden spent his last years and was killed by U.S commandos is being demolished . American officials said they buried bin Laden's body at sea to avoid giving his followers a burial place that could become a makeshift shrine. Many U.S. officials expressed disbelief that bin Laden could have lived in Abbottabad for around six years without the Pakistani government knowing. But the U.S. has not found any evidence that senior Pakistani officials knew of the al-Qaida chief's whereabouts. The U.S. Navy SEALs who attacked bin Laden's compound on May 2 infiltrated by helicopter from neighboring Afghanistan. The raid, which lasted around 40 minutes, was a serious blow to the already troubled U.S.-Pakistan relationship. Inside the compound: An image showing Bin Laden in the shabby Abbottabad compound surrounded by TVs, a PC, digital decoder and a boster pillow . This well-known image captures the moment President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and members of the national security team saw bin Laden's compound raised and him killed live . Pakistan responded by kicking out more than 100 U.S. troops training Pakistanis in counterterrorism operations and reduced the level of intelligence cooperation. Some members of Congress called on the U.S. to cut of the billions of dollars of military and civilian aid to Pakistan unless Islamabad explained bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad and boosted cooperation on the Afghan war. The aid has continued, although at a somewhat lower level.","Pakistan completely demolished the former home of Osama bin Laden Sunday, ten months after he was killed .

"In what has to be one of the most emotional press conferences ever given by a sportsman, Australian captain Michael Clarke, paid tribute to Philip Hughes on behalf of his team and Cricket Australia on Saturday morning at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). From the moment Clarke sat down and said to the gathered press, 'I'll do my best, guys', it was clear just how much he was hurting and how hugely emotional it was going to be for him to read the statement at all. Struggling to keep his composure, Clarke took deep breaths and wept, as he paid a massive tribute to his close friend and team mate Hughes. Scroll down for video . Michael Clarke weeps as he talks about his friend Philip Hughes . Clarke struggled constantly to keep his emotions in check at the press conference . 'Words cannot express the loss we all feel as a team right now,' Clarke began. 'To Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan (Hughes' family), we share in the deep pain that you're feeling.' Clarke began to breakdown in tears at this point, but was able to compose himself. 'Apart from when he was at home on the farm with his beloved cattle, Hughesy was at his happiest playing cricket for his country with his mates,' he continued. 'Things were always put into perspective when Hughesy said: 'Where would you rather be boys than playing cricket for your country'.' Still struggling to keep his emotions in check, Clarke sighed audibly before continuing. 'We're going to miss that cheeky grin and twinkle in his eye,' he said. 'He epitomised what the baggy green is about and what it means to us all. 'The world lost one of its great blokes this week and we are all poorer for it.' The Australian captain sobbed throughout as he gave his statement . Inconsolable: A shattered Michael Clarke tries to gather himself . 'Our dressing room will never be the same. We love him and always will. Rest in peace bruzzy,' said Clarke . Clarke's emotional reaction may now call into further doubt Australia's first Test against Indian in Brisbane on Thursday as the final decision on whether it will go ahead is being left up to the players . Clarke regularly took deep breaths to help get him through the press conference . Clarke promised Hughes' family that they would do 'everything we can to honour his memory'. He then confirmed that Hughes' international one-day shirt number, 64, would be retired by Cricket Australia. 'That means so much,' he said. Clarke added that Hughes' 'legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives'. After thanking everyone 'here and overseas for the touching tributes to Hughesy', Clarke paused for what seemed an age to compose himself again, before ending the statement by saying in a breaking voice: . 'Our dressing room will never be the same. We love him and always will. Rest in peace bruzzy.' The 25-year-old Hughes died on Thursday after being struck by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield game on Tuesday. Clarke struggled to read the statement on on behalf of the national team and support staff at the SCG . Clarke looked mentally and physically exhausted after finishing his statement . A visibly upset Clarke is helped away after the press conference at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday . Cricket Australia announced on Saturday evening that Australia's match against India will not go ahead, with the final decision left up to the players. But the fact that Hughes’ family want the match to go ahead – as it is what he would have wanted – could make the crucial difference. Throughout the whole tragic saga of Hughes’ freak accident and death, it has been the wishes of the family that both Australian cricketers and team management have strictly abided by. Philip Hughes (left) and his father Greg celebrate Australia's victory against South Africa in 2009 in Johannesburg. Hughes' family will have a huge bearing on whether the first Test is played against India . Phillip Hughes' parents Greg (left) and Virginia (centre) and sister Megan (right) leave the NSW Cricket ground in Sydney on Friday. They would like the first Test against India to be played on Thursday. The Hughes family are set to play a part in whether next week's first test in Brisbane takes place . 9News reported that although the players’ feelings had to be respected after such a bereavement – the family’s wishes will have a huge bearing on the decision to play. ‘I've heard the Hughes family are keen for that (Test) to go ahead, obviously that's going to be a question for the players,’ South Australian Cricket Association chief Keith Bradshaw said. The Nine Network reported on Friday night the Hughes family suggested that the first session of the Test at the Gabba be abandoned and Hughes' bat and helmet be placed on the pitch as a tribute. According to the report, the match would then start after lunch. For now the Gabba is taking direction from Cricket Australia (CA) regarding the first Test, and CA is naturally proceeding cautiously with emotions still so raw. Speaking moments after captain Clarke and opening batsman David Warner arrived at the SCG for a team meeting on Friday, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said cricket would go on 'when it's ready'. 'The starting point is [the players] are grieving and they’ve lost someone that’s incredibly close to them, and I think there’s enough that we understand about grieving processes to know that it’s really important to give people time,' Mr Sutherland said. ‘To be honest they’ve got other things on their mind and I know for many people seven days doesn’t seem very far away, next Thursday, but in other ways it’s a million miles away,’ he said. ‘We’ll get there when we can.’ Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland looks at a floral tribute after speaking to the media at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday . However, although the merits of playing, delaying or abandoning the start of a four-Test series against India are still being considered, there are other realities. The series is a huge money spinner for organisers and sponsors, particularly in India, where millions of fanatical cricket fans have been waiting for the series all year. Indian cricket officials have already had to back down after initially saying that Friday’s tour match against the Cricket Australia XI had to go ahead. ‘Postponed because of one player? I don’t think so,’ a spokesman for the Board of Control for Cricket in India told The Daily Telegraph. However, when it became apparent that Hughes was on his death bed they agreed for the match to be postponed. Australian cricket chief Sutherland said they were in constant contact with the India team and management who had been ‘supportive and sincere’ throughout. Meanwhile all over Australia on Saturday cricket clubs and players of all ages were showing their respect for Hughes.

The guidance – given to parents at feeding clinics – recommends giving young children over eight months snacks to help overcome feeding problems. But the leaflet from Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has raised concerns children will be encouraged to eat unhealthy foods from an early age. Dave Munday, who works with the Community Practitioners’ and Health Visitors’ Association, said parents should give their children ‘healthy foods that are not going to get them into bad habits’. Scroll down for video . This baby is pictured eating a chocolate snack, after mothers were told to feed their babies junk food in an advice leaflet produced by Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. (file picture) He told The Telegraph: ‘There are lots of foods out there that you would try before the foods being suggested in this leaflet.’ Wotsits and Quavers are among the snacks recommended in the leaflet to help a child ‘bite and dissolve’ food, while Crunchies and Milky Bars are said to be good ‘if a child sucks food well’. Tracey Nutter, director of nursing at Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, defended the advice. She said that the leaflet was the ‘first of several documents given to a small number of parents with babies and toddlers who have significant feeding problems and are failing to progress onto solid food for a variety of medical or developmental reasons’.

She also said the foods are ‘not intended as meal replacements or as a means to put on weight’. Consultant dietitian Sian Porter, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, said giving youngsters sugary food was usually not a good idea. She said: ‘In a healthy child who is having a balanced diet, it would not be necessary for them to include things like chocolate.’ And she said there were certain circumstances when specialist advice given might ‘surprise or appear to be at odds with the majority of what people eat for a healthy diet’. The dietitian said this could apply to children who might attend a feeding clinic. Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) has defended the advice, that they say is only given to a small number of parents needing to overcome 'significant' feeding problems .","NHS leaflet tells parents to feed their babies junk food from eight months .

"Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst has a secret love child - Australian country music star Jay O'Shea. The pair have been forging a relationship with each other for the past four years and now O' Shea has decided to make their connection public. O'Shea, who is now 40-years-old, was adopted as a baby and has always longed to find out who were biological parents were. It has been revealed that Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst fathered a love child in 1974 . After 15-years searching for answers, she was finally united with Hirst in 2010 at Bronte Beach, thanks to her biological mother. Taking to her Facebook page, the singer, who moved to Nashville in 2007, said it amazes her every day that she has been able to develop a loving relationship with her biological father and her new found siblings. 'I searched for about 15 years and just when I least expected it, and in the strangest possible way, I finally was given the answers,' the star's Facebook post said. Australian country music singer Jay O'Shea has been revealed as Rob Hirst's love child . Jay O'Shea took to her Facebook page today to reveal that she had been adopted as a baby . 'It's a story that's filled with crazy coincidences, twists of fate and OMGs! One of these days I'll write a book and no one will believe it. If it hadn't happened to me, I wouldn't believe it myself!' 'I'm so lucky to have found my biological parents and even more blessed to have been able to develop wonderful relationships with them and my new found siblings. It amazes me every day,' she said. Hirst's childhood girlfriend was faced with a tough decision when she became pregnant with O'Shea as a teenager. Hirst found out his childhood sweetheart was pregnant when the two were teenagers . Jay O'Shea was adopted by a loving family in Adelaide . Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Hirst said his girlfriend was sent to Adelaide by her parents to have the baby. Their baby daughter was born on January 17 ,1974 in the Memorial Hospital in North Adelaide. As soon as O'Shea was born, she was removed from her mother and father, without them even knowing if she was a boy or girl. Hirst and his childhood sweetheart parted ways after their baby girl was adopted and he joined the band Midnight Oil. Midnight Oil went on to enjoy phenomenal success in the Australian charts, with . 'My girlfriend told me that because all the names had been changed and the secrecy was so great that neither of us should ever expect to ever find this child ever again. to forget about it and go on with our lives as if it never happened,' Hirst told The Sunday Telegraph. Rob Hirst said he had lost hope that he would be reunited with his daughter after her birth documents were forged . O'Shea was adopted by a loving family in Adelaide and she grew up with two big brothers and besotted parents. They named her Kylie Smith. However music was never far from O'Shea's mind and she moved to Sydney when she was 19-years-old to pursue a career in the music industry. She worked as a backing vocalist for INXS for a number of years before meeting her husband Mark O'Shea while she was in London. The couple moved to Nashville in 2007, the home of country music. They set up their life there and have two adorable daughters. The country singer is the proud mother of two beautiful daughters . The couple, who perform today as O'Shea, won a Golden Guitar for Best New Talent in 2012. Although O'Shea still had a constant burning desire to contact her biological parents. All of her birth documents had been fabricated and she held out little hope that she would find any trace of them. One day she received a call from her mother claiming that investigators had found her birth mother. While her birth mother did not want her identity to be revealed, she did  reveal that her father was the famous drummer. Jay O'Shea met her husband Mark O'Shea in London and the pair moved to Nashville in 2007 . This hit O'Shea hard as she had firmed a strong friendship with Hirst's bandmates Midnight Oil's bassist Bones Hillman and his wife Denise. Hillman eventually introduced the pair over a phone conversation and the beginning of their journey started. Hirst has two daughter, Lex and Gabriella, from his marriage to his wife Leslie Holland. O'Shea said she feels 'incredibly blessed and loved' to have found her true identity. 'My hope is that it may inspire others who are in the same boat to take that leap of faith, with a come-what-may approach and an open heart. You just never know what new beginnings may be out there for you,' she said. O'Shea has recently rerecorded a version of the song a song originally written by Hirst and featured on his recent debut solo record called The Sun Becomes The Sea. Hirst and O'Shea hope to perform it together when she is next back in Australia.","Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst fathered a love child when he was a teenager .

"Up to 13,000 people in Britain are being held in conditions of slavery, four times the number previously thought, the Home Office has said. In what is said to be the first scientific estimate of the scale of modern slavery in the UK, the Home Office has said the number of victims last year was between 10,000 and 13,000. They include women forced into prostitution, domestic staff and workers in fields, factories and fishing boats. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, described the scale of human trafficking as 'shocking' Data from the National Crime Agency's Human Trafficking Centre had previously put the number of slavery victims in 2013 at 2,744. Launching the Government's modern slavery strategy, Home Secretary Theresa May said the scale of abuse was 'shocking'. 'The first step to eradicating the scourge of modern slavery is acknowledging and confronting its existence,' she said. 'The estimated scale of the problem in modern Britain is shocking and these new figures starkly reinforce the case for urgent action.' The new estimate is based on a statistical analysis by the Home Office chief scientific adviser, Professor Bernard Silverman, which aims for the first time to calculate the 'dark figure' of victim numbers who are not reported to the law enforcement agencies. 'Modern slavery is very often deeply hidden and so it is a great challenge to assess its scale,' he said. 'The data collected is inevitably incomplete and, in addition, has to be very carefully handled because of its sensitivity. ' The new strategy document, which builds on the frameworks used to counter terrorism and fight organised crime, sets out plans for co-ordinated action across government and law enforcement agencies to run alongside the Modern Slavery Bill currently going through Parliament. Labour's shadow home office minister Diana Johnson, pictured, said an anti-slavery bill currently going through Parliament needed 'strengthening', while victims needed far more support from the State . While many victims are foreign nationals, the document emphasises that vulnerable British adults and children are also being systematically preyed upon by traffickers and slave drivers. The National Crime Agency estimates that the UK was the third most common country of origin for victims identified in 2013. Among overseas victims, many of them brought into the UK by people traffickers, the most common countries were Romania, Poland, Albania and Nigeria. As part of the strategy the national policing lead for modern slavery, Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, has been designated to draw up a new national action plan to ensure police forces across the country work together effectively in tackling the issue. In her foreword to the document, Mrs May said: 'Young girls are raped, beaten, passed from abuser to abuser and sexually exploited for profit. Vulnerable men are tricked into long hours of hard labour before being locked away in cold sheds or run-down caravans. 'Women are forced into prostitution, and children systematically exploited. Domestic workers are imprisoned and made to work all hours of the day and night for little or no pay. 'We must put a stop to these crimes, and stamp out modern slavery. Aidan McQuade, the director of the charity Anti Slavery International, warned that policing measures alone would not resolve the issue. He said that protection of victims needed to be placed on a statutory footing in order to reassure those who came forward that they would not themselves be treated as criminals or face deportation. 'It is something that the Government seems loath to consider because it is confusing this debate with the migration one and that is a poisonous conflict at the moment,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'For many of the victims of trafficking, the police aren't somebody that they would necessarily assume are going to be their friends because of their backgrounds and where they are coming from.' For Labour, shadow home office minister Diana Johnson said the figures underlined the need to strengthen the bill going through Parliament. 'There must be much more support for victims of human trafficking and slavery. This was the biggest gap in the Government's bill,' she said. 'The Government must reverse their decision to tie those people who come here on a domestic worker's visa to their employer - this makes it much harder for those facing abuse and not being paid to report this and leave.'","The shocking figures include women trafficked for prostitution or service .

"Chairman of the 1922 committee Graham Brady (pictured) is among those supporting the campaign for a new generation of grammar schools . Senior Conservative MPs will next week challenge David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools. The chairman of the influential 1922 committee, Graham Brady, and former leadership contender David Davis are among those supporting the campaign, the Daily Mail has learned. At present, the law forbids new grammar schools, whose intake is based on selection according to academic ability - only allowing existing institutions to open ‘satellites’ in new locations. Theresa May, the home secretary, and Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies. The option is being attempted by Conservative councillors in Kent, where Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge has applied to open a site nine miles away in Sevenoaks. But a poll this week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them, such as petitions in support. Don Porter, founder of Conservative Voice, the party pressure group which is behind the new campaign, said: ‘We want to ensure that in the Conservative Party manifesto there is a clear commitment to reverse the legislation preventing the creation of new grammar schools. ‘Our followers are strongly of the opinion that new grammar schools will both enhance social mobility and present parents with choice, both of which lie at the heart of the Conservative Party’s values.’ Mr Brady, a former frontbencher, said the closure of selective grammars ‘is one of the things which is building a less cohesive society’. Mr Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said: ‘They [grammar schools] are still a motor for social mobility but nothing like as good as it used to be. That is all down to, I am afraid, a massive failure in public policy, a massive failure in confidence in high quality education for bright kids.’ Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘There’s no silver bullet to reviving stagnant social mobility in Britain. But grammar schools are a key piece of the policy jigsaw, creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard-working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters.’ Research for Conservative Voice found 84 per cent of people said that grammar schools are a valuable asset to the British education system. Some 80 per cent believe that grammar schools make the education system fairer. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (right) have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies . Two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11+ exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed. David Cameron has long resisted calls to pledge to expand selective schooling in the Tory manifesto. The architects of the coalition’s school reforms hoped that controversy over grammar schools in the party could be put to rest by focusing on all-ability academies and free schools. In the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher - herself a grammar school girl - allowed local councils to decide themselves whether their schools should remain selective grammars when she was the education secretary. It proved to be a political misjudgment, since many councils took the opportunity to end selective state education. There are now around 160 grammar schools left in England – mostly in the home counties.","Senior Conservatives MPs challenge David Cameron on grammar schools .

"Controlled explosions have been carried out on ageing detonators, which were found near to the Army's biggest training centre. The detonators were discovered as police carried out extensive searches around the Marne Barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire following reports of an explosion in the early hours of this morning, which resulted in a six-mile stretch of the A1 being closed for most of the day. However, police have stressed that the detonators were not the cause of the sound of the earlier blast, which still remains unexplained and a mystery. Scroll down for video . A section of the A1, which been closed in North Yorkshire, after reports of an explosion . Police said that the road closures were a 'precautionary measure' while officers conducted their enquiries . 'Explosion': The A1 runs adjacent to Marne Barracks (pictured), formerly RAF Catterick - the British Army's largest training facility . Officers have also ruled out any link to terrorism and have confirmed that the closed stretch of carriageway has now reopened. Police were called to the barracks at 3am this morning after staff there reported that they had heard an explosion. There were no other reports of damage in the area and police found no obvious signs of an explosion. The searches included experts from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, explosive detection dogs, the National Police Air Service and military search personnel. Witnesses also described seeing police vans, a police dog vehicle, ambulances, and military cars at the scene, where armed officers were also stationed. But despite their investigation they were unable to find anything which may have cause the sound of the explosion. And now police have defended their decision to close a six-mile stretch of the A1 near to Catterick for most of the day. Superintendent Dave Hannan of North Yorkshire Police said: 'We are satisfied that the call to the police was made with good intent. Armed military officers (pictured) were positioned at the road closure, which is near Marne Barracks . A statement from the Highways Agency said the closure of the carriageway had led to a 40-minute delays . Witnesses said that those living in the area were woken up by a loud bang at about 3am this morning . 'We appreciate that members of the public will ask why the road had to be shut for so long. 'In view of the location of the suspected explosion, the source of the information, the current threat to UK security and a report a few hours earlier of a vehicle seen in suspicious circumstances outside the barracks, we were not prepared to take any chances with people's safety and had to carry out a very extensive and thorough investigation. 'Officers have worked throughout the night and day to identify and locate the driver of the vehicle and we are now satisfied that he was not connected to the reported explosion and we have now eliminated him from our enquiries. 'We thank the driver of the vehicle for his patience and cooperation. We have also ruled out any link to terrorism. A spokeswoman said the police were taking 'all precautions' because of the location of the reported explosion . 'I again extend our thanks to members of the public who were caught up in the congestion for their patience and understanding. Their safety was our prime concern. 'We may never find out what the source of the explosion was, however, following the search and investigation I am now satisfied that there is no threat to members of the public. 'A number of possibilities have been looked into, however, there is no information or evidence to say this reported explosion was a criminal or deliberate act.' On the Ministry of Defence website, Catterick Garrison is described as the army's 'largest training establishment'. It covers 2,400 acres and 20,000 acres of training land. The Garrison is situated just a few miles from the A1 and includes Marne Barracks near Catterick Village and the outstations of Ripon, Dishforth and Topcliffe. Catterick Garrison provides a base for Headquarters 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East which forms part of 1st (United Kingdom) Division.","The noise of an explosion was reported by staff from Marne Barracks .

"A couple have claimed a social worker had wanted to play God as he refused to back their bid to adopt their own grandson. Neil Swaby, Rachel Olley and Peter Nelson were named and shamed by a furious judge for bias against the grandparents who wanted to give the two-year-old a home. The evidence they gave to a court as they tried to prevent the couple from raising the child was described as ‘visibly biased’, ‘begrudging’ and ‘grossly overstated’. Scroll down for video . Slammed: Three social workers have been named and shamed by a furious judge for bias against grandparents who wanted to give their two-year-old grandson a home . The couple, known only as Mr and Mrs G, said one of the North East Lincolnshire Council social workers, Neil Swaby, had refused to explain why he was not backing their bid for adoption. Mr G told BBC Radio Four’s Today programme that he had asked Mr Swaby: ‘Who do you think you are, God?’ and Mr Swaby had allegedly replied: ‘In this situation, yes. Get used to it, your grandson will go for adoption.’ Mr G added: ‘The judge asked Miss Olley’s advocate to stand up and he said to her, “basically your case is a shambles”. ‘I could have hugged that judge. I have never known anything like it.’ The condemnation of the social workers came in a hearing in which the judge ruled that the grandparents should bring up the boy, with occasional help from the child’s other grandparents. Referring to the social workers, Judge Simon Jack said in the adoption case heard in Hull: ‘I found it very difficult to give any weight at all to their evidence.’ The judge said social workers had claimed one set of grandparents – named only as Mr and Mrs G – were already bringing up two older children and the little boy’s brother, and all of the children had difficulties or behavioural problems. The other set – named as Mr and Mrs C – were said by social workers to have problems with drink and domestic violence. The social workers, employed by North East Lincolnshire council (headquarters above), were named under new guidance for the family courts intended to make proceedings more transparent . But Judge Jack said there was no evidence Mr and Mrs G had problems with the children and ‘so far as Mr and Mrs C are concerned there is no evidence that I am aware of that any domestic violence or any drinking has had an adverse effect on any children in their care’. The social workers were named under new guidance for the family courts intended to open up the habitually secret workings of lawyers, experts and social workers who decide on the future of children in the state care system. The most senior family judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, has ordered that social workers and medical experts in family courts should be named in the same way as witnesses in other courts. The Hull case came about after the death of the two-year-old boy’s mother, who had a history of drug abuse and violence with the child’s father. Judge Jack said: ‘Neil Swaby seemed very reluctant to accept anything positive could be said about either set of grandparents. I had the clear impression... he was intent on saying only things which supported the local authority’s case.’ The judge said Miss Olley gave evidence the two-year-old had behavioural problems, but this ‘conflicted very strongly’ with an adoption social worker’s statement. He added of Mr Swaby and Miss Olley: ‘Their concerns appeared to be grossly overstated to try and achieve their ends. I have never, in over ten years of hearing care cases taken the view, as I did in this case, that the local authority’s witnesses were visibly biased. I hope I shall never see that again.’ The judge said evidence from Mr Nelson, a new social worker who had been brought on to the case, had ‘the same bias’. North East Lincolnshire council said it was ‘committed to ensuring the best outcomes for children and where possible allowing them to stay within their extended family’. It added: ‘In light of this judgement, we have also reminded social workers of the importance of giving a balanced point of view whilst recognising their right to giving a professional judgment.’","Social workers trying to prevent couple raising grandchild accused of bias .

"Falling fuel prices: Oil fell 3 per cent this morning as Colonel Gaddafi's regime began to crumble . Oil prices fell today as Colonel Gaddafi's regime appeared to be on the verge of collapse after 41 years in power. The price of Brent Crude oil in London plunged 1.63per cent to $106.85 a barrel this morning. But there is unlikely to be any respite at the pumps for beleaguered motorists because it takes weeks for the price of fuel to filter through. The oil markets will be watching carefully with the expectation that a smooth transition of power in Tripoli likely to send prices falling further. There are hopes that an end to the conflict will see the North African country's oil supplies restored and increase global supplies. Around 85 per cent of Libyan oil output was exported to Europe until the revolt disrupted the country's production. European refineries have struggled to make up for the production loss despite an increase from Saudi Arabia. The average price of unleaded is currently 134.9p per litre for unleaded and 139.1p for diesel, according to PetrolPrices.com. When protests against Colonel Gaddafi's regime began in February, petrol was six pence cheaper at 128.9p per litre while diesel was 134.3p. As the conflict escalated, oil prices shot up as the supplies in Libya, the world's 12th largest oil exporter, were heavily restricted. Last year the country's oilfields were producing 1.65million barrels per day but output has fallen dramatically. Andrew Lipow, analyst and president . of consultancy firm Lipow Oil Associates, said oil markets are likely to . respond with 'a sigh of relief that the conflict has come to the end'. But he warned that it will take time . for the market to erase the hefty price increase which resulted from the . suspension of Libyan oil exports. There are hopes that an end to the conflict will see the North African country's oil supplies restored and increase global supplies . The country has oil reserves of 44billion barrels - more than any other country in Africa. As news filtered through that Gaddafi's . regime was crumbling, the price of U.S. sweet crude also fell nearly 1 . per cent to $81.48. Petrol prices have begun to come down from a high of 136.58p a litre on August 8 as the wholesale price of fuel came down. Last week petrol was 19.22p a litre more expensive than in August 2010 (135.71p compared with 116.49p) while . diesel was costing 20.91p more (139.89p compared with 118.98p). That means filling up a typical 50-litre . petrol car now costs £9.61 more, adding £40.81 to the monthly petrol . spend of a two-car family. Filling a commercial van's 80-litre tank with . diesel now costs £16.73 more than 12 months ago. Despite fresh hope that prices could fall at the pumps in the coming months, the government has 4p per litre fuel duty increases scheduled for January and August 2012.

"Blue light observations of a super-Earth 40 light years from our planet suggest that it is a world with a thick, steamy water-rich atmosphere. Japanese astronomers used the Subaru telescope to observe planetary transits of the super-Earth, which is located at the centre of the Milky Way. Astronomers had previously confirmed that this alien world has a thick atmosphere, but were unable to determine whether the atmosphere was primarily hydrogen or a steamy soup of water vapour. Their findings confirm that the super-Earth has an atmosphere rich in water rather than hydrogen. Artist's rendition of a transit of GJ 1214 b in blue light. The blue sphere represents the host star GJ 1214, and the black ball in front of it on the right is GJ 1214 b . The water world, named GJ 1214b is . one of the more well-known super-Earths and was discovered by the . ground-based MEarth Project in 2009. This super-Earth is about 2.6 times Earth’s diameter and weighs almost seven times as much. It . orbits a red-dwarf star every 38 hours at a distance of 2 million . kilometres, giving it an estimated temperature of 230 degrees Celsius. Astronomers had previously confirmed that this alien world has a thick atmosphere, but were unable to determine whether the atmosphere was primarily hydrogen or a steamy soup of water vapour. Super-Earths are exoplanets orbiting a star outside of the solar system that are larger than Earth's but smaller than those of ice giants such as Uranus or Neptune. Their planetary transits enable scientists to find changes in the wavelength in the brightness of the star, which indicate the planet's atmospheric composition. If scientists can determine the major atmospheric component of a super-Earth, they can then find out the planet's birthplace and formation history. The water world, named GJ 1214b is . one of the more well-known super-Earths and was discovered by the . ground-based MEarth Project in 2009. This super-Earth is about 2.6 times Earth’s diameter and weighs almost seven times as much. If the sky has a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (as shown in the top image) Rayleigh scattering disperses blue light from the atmosphere of the host. The middle image shows how Rayleigh scattering is much weaker in water-rich atmospheres while the bottom image show what would happen if the sky had extensive clouds . It orbits a red-dwarf star every 38 hours at a distance of 2 million kilometres, giving it an estimated temperature of 230 degrees Celsius. Last year, the Hubble space telescope examined GJ 1214b when it crossed in front of its host star. During such a transit, the star’s light is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere, giving clues to the mix of gases. They found the spectrum of GJ 1214b to be featureless over a wide range of wavelengths, or colours, also suggesting the planet had a dense atmosphere of water vapour. The planet GJ 1214b, shown here in an artist's conception with two hypothetical moons, orbits a star 40 light-years from Earth. The super-Earth is about 2.6 times Earth's diameter and weighs seven times as much . Subaru found weak Rayleigh scattering in the optical wavelength which the team claim provided ‘powerful evidence’ for a water-dominated atmosphere. Another possibility for the weak Rayleigh scattering is that the planet has a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere with extensive clouds. Rayleigh scattering occurs when light particles scatter in a medium without a change in wavelength. In a water-rich atmosphere, such as the one on GJ 1214b, the effect of the Rayleigh scattering is much weaker than in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Up until now, more than 800 exoplanets have been discovered and around so far and 12 are thought to have the environments that could be habitable. More unusual discoveries include a planet that is as airy as Styrofoam, and another that rains glass. Researchers claim there could be as many as 100 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way. Astronomers, however, claim the temperature on GJ 1214b  is probably far too high for life to exist there.","GJ 1214b is 2.6 times Earth’s diameter and weighs seven times as much .

"Scroll down for a full table which shows what each club will earn in their current position. It is the final round of fixtures in another Barclays Premier League campaign, and there is little at stake for clubs not involved in issues at either end of the table. So the theory goes, anyway, but try telling that to Hull City’s bank manager, with a win at home to Everton potentially raking in a near-£5million bonus for the FA Cup finalists. TV revenue is the big money-spinner in the Premier League, but merit payments are not to be sniffed at. There’s £1.2million for the bottom-placed club, with the amount rising by the same amount as you go up the table. So, if you climb one place on the last day, it is worth £1.2million. Leap four places, as Hull conceivably could, and it’s a cool £4.8million. In the money: Hull City will be celebrating again if they can pick up £4.8 million on the final day . With that in mind, we’ve worked out how much is theoretically up for grabs for each team, heading in to Sunday’s games. Don’t forget, the calculations do not take into account what might happen to teams around them. Also, we are discounting any team winning by a cricket score to overturn a massive goal difference deficit. Cardiff v Chelsea . A win or draw could be worth £1.2million to Cardiff. Chelsea need to win to have a chance of an additional £1m. Plenty to play for: Chelsea may be out of the title race but a win for Jose Mourinho's side could earn £1m . Fulham v Crystal Palace . Fulham need to win for an extra £1.2m. Palace cannot go any higher or any lower. Hull v Everton . If Hull win and manage a four-goal swing on goal difference with West Ham, it could be worth £4.8m. Even a draw could be worth £2.4m. Everton stay same. Liverpool v Newcastle . A win could be worth £2m for Liverpool. Newcastle cannot go higher, but if they fail to win and Stoke pick up three points then the Magpies will slip to 10th, losing £1.2m. Plenty at stake: A Premier League title for Liverpool would also see them pocket an extra £2m . Manchester City v West Ham . Neither side can go higher. Defeat for West Ham though could cost them up to £4.8m, with Swansea, Sunderland, Aston Villa and Hull all poised to pounce if they slip up. Norwich v Arsenal . Neither side can go higher. A draw will all but guarantee Norwich 18th place and £3.6m windfall to soften the blow of relegation. Southampton v Manchester United . Southampton stay same. A win could be worth £1.2m to United. Not over yet: The last act of United's interim management team could be to earn an extra £1.2m for the club . Sunderland v Swansea . A win could be worth £2.4m to Sunderland. A draw or win could bring Swansea an additional £1.2m. Tottenham v Aston Villa . Tottenham cannot move up. A win for Villa could be worth an extra £3.6m, a draw £1.2m. Crucial cash: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert will be hoping he can boost his club's coffers by £3.6m . West Brom v Stoke . A win for West Brom could bring them an extra £3.6m.

"Neil Lewis, 72, from Colchester, drowned his lodger's cat after it broke his model aeroplane . An elderly man drowned his lodger's cat in an apparent revenge attack after it knocked over his model aeroplane. Neil Lewis, from Colchester, placed the animal in a pet box before submerging it in the River Colne until it stopped breathing. The 72-year-old - who owned another cat - later justified his actions by telling police the cat was a 'pain' and 'scratched things'. The cat was taken to a veterinary surgery after a witness called police, but it was already dead on arrival. Colchester Magistrates' Court heard how Lewis's lodger Alexander Hammond had brought the kitten home last November. He had found it at the town's railway station and was unable to trace its owner. But the court heard how Lewis -who has bipolar - began developing some 'hatred' for the cat, as it got older. At one point, Lewis suggested to Mr Hammond that they should take the cat into a nearby meadow and set it loose. But in April this year, he had had enough of the cat and decided to carry out the killing. Colette Harper, prosecuting, said: 'As it got older, he noticed the defendant had some hatred for the cat. 'He told him he was fed up it because it knocked his model airplane over.' She added: 'He was seen to place the pet carrier fully in the water.' The court was told how, when police arrived at the scene, Lewis told them: 'I didn't like that cat, it was always a pain and scratched things.' He added: 'There's another cat at home I like - that's my cat.' Laura Austin, mitigating, told magistrates that Lewis had a 'significant history of mental health problems'. She said: 'This was exacerbated by a serious traffic accident he was involved in a year ago. He knows in hindsight what he did was wrong. Lewis took the animal to the River Colne (pictured) in a pet carrier, before submerging the box under water . 'He saw a short-term solution to the perceived problems he was facing at that time, not thinking of the consequences. 'The defendant is a somewhat educated person who, without these mental health difficulties, would have behaved entirely differently.' Lewis admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. He was given an 18-week prison sentence, which was suspended for two years. He was also put under a lifetime ban which stops him from keeping animals.","Neil Lewis's lodger Alexander Hammond brought kitten home in November .

"Veteran Gordon Hoggan, 55, wants to meet the family of the Argentine soldier he claims he killed with a bayonet during the Falklands War . A Falklands War veteran who wants to meet the family of an Argentine soldier he claims to have killed during the 1982 conflict was accused last night of fabricating his story. Former guardsman Gordon Hoggan, 55, made international headlines last week after issuing an emotional appeal to come face-to-face with the relatives of Jose Luis Galarza – who he says he stabbed to death on Mount Tumbledown, near the islands’ capital, Port Stanley. In a story published by The Guardian, the guardsman, who has suffered mental health issues since the campaign, said he wanted to achieve ‘closure’ and to explain his actions to the deceased soldier’s family. But last night a senior British Army officer said Hoggan’s account was ‘completely untrue’. Hoggan, who served with G Company, Scots Guards, gave an interview during which he described graphically bayonetting an Argentine soldier. ‘I stabbed him through the neck with my bayonet,’ he said. ‘He was screaming in Spanish. I had to put my foot on his face to get my bayonet out. The blood came rushing out. I was covered from head to foot.’ Hoggan said he was now trying to trace the victim’s family using details on his helmet, which he has kept ever since. Hoggan, from Spondon, Derbyshire, added: ‘I’d like to return the helmet, for closure on my behalf. They may not want it. They’d probably hate me. But I would like to explain to them why it happened.’ Galarza was identified as the owner of the helmet by an Argentinian newspaper, which then tracked down members of his family, who apparently burst into tears. The story was subsequently published by The Guardian under the headline ‘British Falklands veteran to meet family of Argentinian soldier he killed.’ A retired commander said the company of the Scots Guards (file picture) Hoggan was in did not have bayonets fixed to their weapons . But Hoggan’s account has been challenged by several Falklands veterans, including a retired commander who led the Scots Guards on Mount Tumbledown. The senior officer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am afraid that this is completely untrue. The guardsmen of G Company did not see any enemy and therefore did not have bayonets fixed. For 200 yards around us there were no Argentinians.’ Told of the doubts about his account, Hoggan said: ‘They are wrong. Why would I lie about something like that? My company was the first to reach that position and there were no casualties. It was after the rest of the battalion moved up that we were left dealing with pockets of Argentinian soldiers. That is when it happened.’ Hoggan also claimed one of his colleagues from the battle, Kenneth Mains, witnessed his actions. But Mr Mains, who has now left the Army, said: ‘I was not with Hoggan and I never saw him that night or witnessed any such action. ‘Also, I don’t know of anyone in G Company who engaged the enemy. I would take what he’s saying with a pinch of salt. It’s a shame as everyone has their demons to deal with.’ The MoD and Foreign Office declined to comment.","Gordon Hoggan claims he killed Argentine soldier during Falklands War .

"A Phoenix man who became ill after returning this week from Sierra Leone, one of the three West African nations hardest hit by an Ebola outbreak, on Friday was taken to a hospital where he tested negative for the virus, officials said. The 32-year-old man, who was not identified, was transported to the Maricopa Integrated Health System in Phoenix for evaluation after complaining of sickness including dry-heaving and diarrhea, Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Mark Vanacore said. Lab results were negative for Ebola, but the traveler will continue to be monitored in line with federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Maricopa County health officials said in a statement. A Phoenix man who became ill after returning this week from Sierra Leone was taken to a hospital where he tested negative for the virus . The man told officials he had traveled to Sierra Leone, but Arizona officials said he had not treated Ebola patients, gone to funeral services or otherwise come into contact with anyone infected with the virus. His symptoms developed after he returned to the United States on Wednesday. The death toll in the world's worst Ebola epidemic has risen to 5,689 out of 15,935 cases reported in eight countries by the end of Nov. 23, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Almost all cases and all but 15 deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - the three hardest-hit countries, which reported 600 new cases in the past week, the WHO said in its latest update. 'The total number of cases reported in Sierra Leone since the outbreak began will soon eclipse the number reported from Liberia,' it said, adding that the capital Freetown remained the worst affected part of the former British colony.","Sierra Leone is one of the three West African nations hit hardest by the outbreak .

"A mother who was too fat for the Nintendo Wii - making her computerised character balloon when she stood on the Wii-Fit board - can now play with her children again after losing an incredible nine stone. Mrs Rose was horrified to be told by the Nintendo Wii that she was too heavy for the board when she went to play the game - including bowling and skiing - on the console with her young daughter one Christmas. Weighing in at 22st 6lb, the machine told her it could not cope with her weight - even making her computerised character blow right up  on screen. Debbie Rose pictured, left when she weighed in at 22st 6lb and right looking healthier after losing just under nine stone . Wake-up call: Mrs Rose was told by the Nintendo Wii that, at 22st 6lb, it could not cope with her weight - even making her computerised character, pictured, balloon on screen . After years of battling the bulge, it was the wake-up call the 33-year-old needed - and forced her into shedding weight. The size 28 mother-of-two has incredibly managed to lose just under nine stone in two years - and can now join in with family fun and play with her children on the console. Mrs Rose, who lives in Brownhills, Staffordshire with husband Tim and daughters, Alana, eight, and Summer, two, said: 'I was so miserable, but didn't realise how sad I was until I look back at that time. Result: Mrs Rose pictured with her daughters who she can now play with on the Wii-Fit console . 'We bought my eldest daughter Alana a Wii Fit for Christmas but when I got on it the game made my character explode before we could even start. 'I was stunned when it said that I was too heavy for it. I was just mortified. 'But it really spurred me on to go and do something about my weight. It was the kick-start I needed.' Deb's diet before she lost weight: . Breakfast: Four slices of toast with butter and jam . Morning snack: Biscuits and crisps . Lunch: A cheese sandwich with a packet of crisps and a chocolate bar . Afternoon snack: A piece of cake . Dinner: Full-fat curry with chips, rice, naan bread and onion bhajis . Deb's diet since losing weight: . Breakfast: Branflakes with banana and raisins . Morning snack: Piece of fruit . Lunch: Ryvita with low fat cheese spread and salad . Afternoon snack: Low fat yogurt and a Weight Watchers bar . Dinner: Healthy curry with rice, a finger of naan bread and salad . The machine, which helps users keep track of their fitness and weight with interactive exercises, states the maximum weight for gamers is 21.5st. Mrs Rose, who works at Asda, joined Weight Watchers at the Park View Centre in Brownhills in January 2010. She swapped her diet of biscuits, crisps, and curries for fruit, cereals and low-fat meals, and hasn't looked back. 'Things like going shopping for clothes used to be an emotional trauma,' she said. 'I'm still keen to lose more weight and it would be wonderful to get to my goal of 11st 10lb this year. And she's back on the Wii Fit with her daughters weighing in at 13st 12lb. 'As soon as I'd lost enough weight to use the Wii I was on it - and I can join in with the family Wii parties as well. 'I can actually play the skiing game now and we have a good time playing with it now. I can finally stand on the board without the character blowing up like a balloon and exploding.'","The Wii-Fit console told her, that at 22st 6lb, it could not cope with her weight .

"Premier League duo Chelsea and Liverpool earned more money from selling players during the summer transfer window than all but two clubs in Europe. The Blues opted to cash in on a number of stars in order to finance Jose Mourinho's summer spending and keep in line with Financial Fair Play rules. The west London club made £81million - the third highest amount of any side on the continent - after selling David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for £50m, Romelu Lukaku to Everton for £25m up-front and Demba Ba to Besiktas for £6m. Chelsea sold Brazilian defender David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain for £50million over the summer . The Blues also allowed Romelu Lukaku to join Everton on a permanent basis for a fee rising to £28million . That leaves them one spot above Liverpool, who sit fourth, on a list put together by research group The Football Observatory. The Reds made £80m after Barcelona met Luis Suarez's £75m release clause and they also sold Pepe Reina, Martin Kelly, Daniel Agger and Jack Robinson. Real Madrid are second after parting with Angel di Maria (£60m), Xabi Alonso (£7m), Alvaro Morata (£16m) and Nuri Sahin (£7m) for a total income of £90m, but they still sit behind another club from England. Barcelona paid Liverpool £75million for the services of striker Luiz Suarez (second from right) Manchester United bought Angel di Maria for a British transfer record fee of £60million from Real Madrid . Southampton really raked it in, selling Adam Lallana for £25m to Liverpool . The sales of Suarez (left) and Luiz were two of the biggest deals last summer . Southampton top the table after making £97million from selling five of their first team stars to other clubs in the top-flight. Teenage defenders Luke Shaw (£30million) and Calum Chambers (£16m) joined Manchester United and Arsenal respectively, while Adam Lallana (£25m), Rickie Lambert (£4m) and Dejan Lovren (£20m) all swapped the south coast for Liverpool. Those deals left newly appointed manager Ronald Koeman with plenty of cash to splash as he brought eight new players to St Mary's before the September 1 deadline.

"These dramatic photographs show the streets of modern-day San Francisco torn apart by the after-effects of a violent earthquake. Buildings are reduced to rubble, huge craters have opened in the debris-strewn roads and uncontrollable fires have ripped through homes. Fortunately, these pictures are a clever amalgamation of images of the city today and after the devastating quake of 1906. Trip back in time: A women opens the door to her Mercedes on Sacramento Street while horses killed by falling rubble lie in the street . Wonders of the modern world: A crowd from 1906 stare out over the burning city - and a 21st century bus .

Breathtaking: Mr Clover returned almost 20 times to get the exact position and light right for this picture of the fallen Valencia St. Hotel . They were created by photographer Shawn Clover, a San Francisco resident who wanted to reimagine the traditional 'then-and-now' concept. Mr Clover first selects a catalogue of historical photos and then takes new ones from the same spot, which he softly blends with the old. Once he has usable images, he has to recreate the exact conditions in which the original was taken - from where the photographer was positioned to where the sun is in the sky. I found that many of the original photos I planned to use were in fact unusable because the photographer was situated in a place where a building stands today,' he writes on his blog. 'Others now have trees blocking the view. 'My goal is to stand in the exact spot where the original photographer stood,' he adds. 'Doing this needs to take into account equivalent focal length, how the lens was shifted, light conditions, etc. Ghostly echoes: Mechanics Monument at Bush Street and Battery Street is surrounded by the shells of wrecked buildings from the past . Trash to tourism: Passing cable cars offer a view of the destruction of California Street. Cable cars at the time were crushed by rubble . Evocative: Fire fills the streets around Alamo Square - but does not quite reach the sunlit future - in one of Shawn Clover's mesmerising pictures . Broken windows: Cars park in front of the brand new US Courthouse, which survived the quake almost intact . 'I take plenty of shots, each nudged around a bit at each location. Just moving one foot to the left changes everything. He added: 'I kept running into delays. In the case of the Valencia St. Hotel, I had to return to the scene on Valencia between 18th and 19th four times before I managed to get it right. There’s quite a bit of conflicting information of exactly where this building once stood. 'And just when I was about to wrap things up, my dad announced that he had unearthed a local magazine published in late 1906 loaded with earthquake-aftermath photos that I had never seen in any library or online collection.' Photography was a common hobby by 1906 and thousands of photos have survived to this day. One photographer even flew his £46 camera on a kite to get aerial shots of the aftermath. Some colour photographs have even been found. Strange visions: Modern day business people and a child from 1906 face the camera while fire consumes a building on the corner of Franklin St and Hayes St . Fade out: Cheerful tourists pass by the Fairmont Hotel, which still stands, but is destroyed inside from the fires . Always prepared: Men pose in a tent city to house displaced residents while an armoured car turns left a corner . In ruins: Buildings fell, sinkholes in the streets opened up, railroad tracks bent, and collapsing bricks crushed cable cars during the disaster . The 42 seconds of intense shaking made building collapse, sinkholes in the streets open up, railroad tracks bend, and collapsing bricks crush cable cars. Four-day-long fires were responsible for 90 per cent of the destruction, with more than 30, caused by ruptured gas mains, destroying around 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks. Many were started when firefighters untrained in the use of dynamite attempted to demolish buildings to create firebreaks, and the dynamited buildings themselves caught fire. Mayor Eugene Schmitz put out an authorization for the federal troops and police to shoot and kill looters. Thousands of tents and temporary relief houses went up to house 20,000 displaced people.

"A man was injured during a bizarre incident when a pop-up toilet 'exploded' out of the pavement, raising up a moped several feet into the air before it toppled-off, pinning the shocked victim to the ground. According to Dutch media, the injured man was an employee of the company contracted to service the Urilift toilet. The toilets are designed to be used at night by clubbers to prevent them from urinating in the streets and then disappear into the ground in the morning, increasing the amount of space available on the pavement. The top of the toilet was blown clear of the structure, blasting the moped, pictured, into the air . The following morning, the top of the toilet looks warped with several of the blocks severely chipped . Workers put safety barriers around the defective toilet this morning to prevent anyone else being injured . Photographs taken immediately after the accident show the roof of the toilet, which also acts as the pavement, was blown clean off, landing several feet away. The front wheel of the scooter was badly damaged and the front forks of the bike appear to be severely twisted. Sean Davis, who was passing the Paradiso Club in the Weteringschans area of Amsterdam at the time of the incident tweeted: 'Literally just walked past this explosion about 2 minutes before. Feeling lucky.' Local TV station ATV5 said some witnesses heard a loud bang and thought there may have been an explosion. But police confirmed that the noise was caused by the moped toppling off the top of the toilet. The exploding toilet, circled, is outside Club Paradiso, left, in the Weteringschans area of Amsterdam . The Urilift toilets are very common in Amsterdam and have been introduced in several other European cities. Local councils have even introduced them in Islington, Watford and Guildford. The toilets appear out of the ground at night to facilitate men who require facilities on their way home from the pub or a night club, so they do not have to resort to urinating on the streets. Dutch authorities are currently investigating the cause of the malfunction. The injured man was taken to hospital in abdominal injuries and the moped suffered extensive damage. Normally, an operator presses a button on the remote control to raise the toilet from under ground . The operators ride around the city on scooters so they can service a number of toilets quickly . The high tech facilities allow men to urinate inside the metal structure and instead of the side of the street .","The Urilift toilet 'exploded' from the ground outside an Amsterdam club .

"The device is hooked over the ears and worn across the forehead like futuristic sunglasses . A band worn across the forehead for twenty minutes a day could zap migraines that blight the lives of millions. The device - which 'looks like something out of Star Trek' - delivers electric impulses to the supraorbital nerve that controls sensation in and around the eye. A study found those who used it were suffering about a third fewer debilitating headaches after a couple of months. The number of people whose migraines were reduced by half or more were also tripled, according to the findings published online in Neurology. Professor Jean Schoenen said: 'The device consists of a thin silver band that looks like something out of Star Trek. 'It is hooked over the ears and worn across the forehead like futuristic sunglasses. Patients don it once daily for 20 minutes.' A similar technique has worked on patients with pain in other parts of the body such as the back. It involves connecting the device to the nerve responsible and sending an electronic pulse to prevent it from causing pain. Prof Schoenen, of Liege University in Belgium, was also pleased there were no side effects from the treatment. He said: 'These results are exciting because they were similar to those of drugs that are used to prevent migraine. 'But often those drugs have many side effects and frequently they are bad enough that people decide to quit taking the drug.' Scroll down for video .

Some researchers have linked them to hormonal changes while others have argued a fall in air pressure reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. Lower oxygen levels may cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate - triggering a persistent pain.  It has also been speculated a drop in pressure affects the fluid protecting the brain inside the skull - leading to increased pressure on brain tissue. The device, known as Cefaly, is CE marked and costs around £260. It has been submitted to the FDA in the U.S but has not yet been approved. The study was published in the journal Neurology by the American Academy of Neurology.","Migraine sufferers who wore the band for 20 minutes a day saw headache days reduce from seven to five a month .

"A grandmother and two tiny children were car-jacked in a terrifying roadside robbery after three thieves climbed into their car and stole the vehicle. The woman and her grandchildren - described as a baby boy and a three-year-old girl - had just pulled up at road work traffic lights when the trio of men, all dressed in black, pulled open the doors of the Vauxhall Astra. The men then yanked out the car seats with the children still strapped in and dumped them and the youngsters on the roadside. A grandmother and two tiny children were car-jacked in a terrifying robbery on Farm Road (pictured), in Maidenhead, after three thieves climbed into their car and stole the vehicle . The 77-year-old woman was then ordered out of the car and all three men clambered in and sped off. Just minutes earlier the same men had crashed another stolen car into a tree and had unsuccessfully tried to hijack a workman's van. The drama happened in darkness in Maidenhead, Berkshire last night after the men arrived at a house in the town's Highway Avenue in a Skoda car they had earlier stolen in London. Police said that they broke into a house in the road but were disturbed by the occupants and returned to the Skoda which then sped off. However, the driver lost control as he tried to accelerate out of sight and crashed the car into a tree in nearby Birdwood Road. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that all three men abandoned the stolen Skoda and ran towards Farm Road in Maidenhead. 'The offenders then tried to steal a van but were chased off by workmen,' said the spokesman. The gang of thieves had already crashed a car into a tree in nearby Birdwood Road, pictured . 'A female driver was travelling along Farm Road, when she stopped briefly at a set of traffic lights next to roadworks. 'The three men entered the car and forced the occupants, the woman and the two young children she was with, to exit the vehicle with the children still in their car seats. 'The victim and the children were helped by people from nearby public house who took them in and called the police.' Neither the grandmother nor the children - who all live in Maidenhead - were injured in the incident although the woman was said to have been very badly shaken by the experience. The spokesman said that the three men were white and were dressed in black clothing. 'The car, a silver Astra, has not yet been located,' she added. Investigating officer Detective constable Reese Williams from Maidenhead local CID said: 'The victims of these incidents, particularly the robbery, were obviously left very shaken by what happened to them last night. 'There would have been a lot of people in the area at this time and, although we have already spoken to a number of witnesses, we would like to hear from you if you were in the area and saw anything which may be connected. 'If you saw a silver Astra leaving the scene, or have located this car, then please contact us immediately,' he added.","Three thieves climbed into the car at traffic lights in Maidenhead, Berkshire .

"It's an issue that's rarely spoken about, but groundbreaking new research has revealed alarming statistics concerning intentional self-harm  among young Australians. Children as young as three are deliberately harming themselves, with 8,227 admitted to hospital in the past five years for self-harm related injuries, the Children's Rights Report 2014 shows. The alarming report, which comes from The Children's Commissioner, also shows five Australian children aged between four to 11 have died from intentional self-harm in the past five years. The Children's Rights Report 2014 reveals Australian children as young as three are deliberately harming themselves . The Children's Commissioner Megan Mitchell said she was prompted to compile the report because there was a pronounced lack of data on self harm for these age groups. 'I really focused on children under 18 in this study to find out what's happening and find out how to support them better,' she told SBS. 'What that is telling me is that we need to be getting in much earlier in working with children to build their resilience; identifying risk factors and encouraging help seeking,' The study revealed some marked differences between genders, with boys are far more likely than girls to commit suicide than girls. Boys are also significantly less likely to seek help when experiencing hardships, however they are more likely to speak with someone over the phone, rather than the internet. The Children's Commissioner Megan Mitchell said she was prompted to compile the report because there was a pronounced lack of data on self harm for these age groups . The report showed were over 18,000 hospitalisations in Australia for self-harm among people aged between three and 17, with 82 per cent of these cases resulting from self-poisoning. 'We really need to mount that really strong research agenda in order to intervene at the right time and provide the right supports to kids that we know will work for them,' Ms Mitchell said. She has called for more detailed surveillance of self-harm and suicide among the age groups in the study.","The Children's Rights Report 2014 reveals Australian children are deliberately harming themselves .

"Mass killer Anders Breivik yesterday claimed he plotted his appalling murder spree in London. He said a secret meeting of far-Right fanatics in the capital nine years ago sparked his plans to devastate Norwegian society. Last night, Scotland Yard was trying to unravel a complex web of links between the crazed neo-Nazi and British extremists. Investigators are desperate to find out if Breivik - who lived in the Norwegian Embassy in London as a child - acted alone or was supported by others plotting similar outrages. At the centre of the inquiry is the maniac’s claim that there was a 2002 London ‘summit’ of far-Right fundamentalists from across Europe, including two Britons. Connections: Anders Breivik and at least two members of the English Defence League may have met in the past after discussions were posted on an internet forum . Damning links: An anti-fascist charity says it has uncovered connections between the EDL and Breivik . In a chilling manifesto begun shortly afterwards, Breivik, 32, boasted of his admiration for the English Defence League and other anti-Islamic organisations. The document was signed 'Andrew Berwick' - an English translation of his name - and he referred to someone called 'Richard' as his English mentor. The document was littered with references to English politicians for allowing the spread of Islam. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is branded 'a war criminal'  and accused of aligning himself with Islamist terror groups. Tony Blair, Jack Straw, Prince Charles and a number of national newspaper journalists are also mentioned. In his ramblings, he boasted there are 80 people across western Europe who are ready to stand up and fight in the same way. He emailed the document - A European Declaration of Independence - to 5,700 people in the hours before he went on the rampage, the Daily Telegraph revealed. Despite visiting Britain in the past, Breivik is not thought to have been in the country this year. Experts said the carnage in Oslo and on the island of Utoya is likely to mark a watershed moment in how police counter hard-to-track ‘lone wolf’ fanatics. As Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that security forces may not be able to stop a similar terror attack: . The full horror of events in Norway . was only becoming clear last night, more than 48 hours after the country . suffered its worst atrocity since the Second World War. At . least seven people were killed when a car loaded with a home-made . fertiliser and fuel bomb detonated in Oslo’s government quarter. British links: Breivik lived in the Norwegian Embassy in London as a child while in his manifesto, right, he wrote about his admiration for the English Defence League . A short time later, Breivik ran amok on a nearby holiday island where a political youth camp was being held. Trapped by freezing water on all sides, at least 86 people, mostly young men and women, were shot dead during 90 minutes of horror. The carnage ended only when armed police, tragically delayed by the isolated location, stormed the island and Breivik surrendered. His lawyer said he ran out of ammunition but police claimed he was carrying a lot more. The devastation has sent shockwaves around the world, and David Cameron will lead a meeting of security officials today to discuss the UK response. Ministers insisted they have not taken their eye off the threat of far-Right extremists as resources are pumped into the battle against violent Islamists. However, the shocking Norwegian bloodbath could trigger a re-think in the approach to right-wing groups. Investigators are studying a 1,518-page manifesto datelined London and posted online by Breivik just hours before his rampage. It reveals that the Christian fundamentalist had spent years plotting the attack and kept meticulous records of his preparations. He shows an obsession with the impact of multiculturalism and immigration, as well as what he sees as the ineffectiveness of mainstream politics. At least 86 people, mostly young men and women, were shot dead during 90 minutes of horror on Utoya . Terrified victims posted this picture on Facebook after barricading themselves in a building on the island . Writing under the anglicised name Andrew Berwick, the killer declares he is a ‘Justiciar Knight Commander’. He explains that this is a leading member of a ‘re-founded’ Knights Templar group formed at the secret London meeting in April 2002. Revered by some white supremacists, the Knights Templar were a Christian military order from the Middle Ages recently thrust into the spotlight after they featured in Dan Brown’s bestseller The Da Vinci Code. Breivik claims the founding group had nine members, whom he does not name, and a further three sympathisers who were not able to attend the meeting. Breivik says: ‘Our purpose is to seize political and military control of Western European countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda. ‘The time for dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance has come.’ He shows a detailed knowledge of . British far-Right extremists and claims to have held discussions with . members of the EDL, while calling for an equivalent in Norway. Smoke billows from a 17-storey government building after a powerful explosion rocked central Oslo . Horror: Young girls comfort one another after the shootings which could spark copycat attacks . Breivik’s lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said his client spent years crafting the manifesto about his views and had ‘confessed to the factual circumstances’ of the atrocities. He said: ‘He wanted a change in society and, from his perspective, he needed to force through a revolution. He wished to attack society and the structure of society.’ Sickened: Stephen Lennon, EDL founder member, said Breivik was a 'freak' Last night the EDL denied any formal link to Breivik. Stephen Lennon, who founded the group in 2009, said he was ‘sickened’ to learn of Breivik’s claims and denounced him as a ‘freak’. But he told the Daily Mail that he fears others could be inspired to commit similar atrocities ‘within five years’ if they feel their voice is not being heard. The shocking death toll piles pressure on police who are already well aware of the danger of a shooting atrocity in the run-up to the Olympics. Armed officers have been training for months to tackle gunmen who may target busy locations such as railway stations or entertainment events. Mr Hague said it was harder to prevent atrocities by determined individuals than sophisticated networks such as Al Qaeda. He said: ‘You have to have as many defences in place as you possibly can. But even then you cannot guarantee being able to prevent every attack or every kind of attack.’ Dr Matthew Goodwin, an expert in far-Right politics at Nottingham University, said the authorities have dismissed ‘lone wolf’ extremists for too long and they now pose a massive challenge to Europe. Dr Goodwin said: ‘We need to accept that this is not an exclusively Norwegian issue. There is clearly a wider pool of potential recruits should the main parties not respond to their grievances.’","1,500-page manifesto littered with references to Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, Prince Charles and a number of British journalists .

"There's always a chance that someone receiving your gift might not like it as much as you'd hoped - and it could end up being returned to a store. But research revealed as Britons embark on their Christmas shopping shows that we should take care buying gifts well in advance - as we might not be able to take them back after December 25. Complaints expert James Walker has spent three months going through the small print of leading UK high street stores and some of the biggest online retailers to uncover their rules on returning presents. WH Smith only gives customers 14 days to request a refund for a present bought online – although 30 days is given for products purchased in store. Therefore, consumers who want to buy a present from there - and retain a chance of returning it between Christmas and New Year - are advised to only purchase the gift online from December 16. Meanwhile at Toys R Us, you will not get a cash refund if you take back presents - and will instead receive a gift card to the value of the returned gift, the study said. At Maplin, if you buy electronics from December 1, you will be able to return them after Christmas - but could be hit by a £10 minimum ‘re-stocking fee’ or 20 per cent of the value, whichever is higher.

"Leaving his £2.5million home with a wry smile yesterday, Andrew Mitchell didn’t look like a man facing financial ruin after losing his Plebgate libel trial. But that may be because the 58-year-old millionaire politician has calculated he can pay off his hefty £2million legal bill in a matter of months. Mr Mitchell’s political career was thought to be in tatters after a High Court judge ruling that he did call police officers ‘f***ing plebs’ in a foul-mouthed confrontation in Downing Street two years ago. But the former Cabinet Minister last night confirmed he planned to stand again as MP for Sutton Coldfield at the election. Andrew Mitchell pictured leaving his home yesterday - the day after a judge ruled he did call police officers 'f***ing plebs' in a foul-mouthed confrontation . Mr Mitchell reportedly believes he can ‘wipe the slate clean’ by standing again and winning. He had a majority of 17,000 at the last election and is thought to believe he can restart his political career in a ‘new ball game’. And he can draw comfort from the fact that business is booming in his private-sector work as a consultant to firms offering services such as offshore banking to the super rich. Since last November, the former investment banker has made more than £150,000 for just 28 days’ work, dwarfing the ‘basic’ £67,060 MP’s salary. He commands as much as £18,000 a day, which would be enough to pay off the legal bill in four months if he managed to sustain the top rate. Details of the ex-Chief Whip’s lucrative sideline emerged yesterday as the row over Plebgate continued. A veteran officer who was on duty at the time said it was a ‘nonsense incident’ which needn’t have ended up in court if Scotland Yard had simply drawn a line under it. Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, criticised the force’s handling of the row, saying no one – including Mr Mitchell – should have lost their job over the 63-second exchange at the Downing Street gates. The constable, who heard part of the conversation in September 2012 when Mr Mitchell exploded with anger at officers who refused to open the gate for him to cycle through, said: ‘Mr Mitchell lost his sense of humour. Who hasn’t lost their sense of humour at work? A still image, issued by the Met Police, shows the moment of the heated exchange between police officers and Andrew Mitchell . ‘It was all totally unnecessary.’ He told the BBC that he wrote to his superiors, setting out what had happened, in the hope that the Met could put the matter ‘into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there’. But he said: ‘They were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was, but I was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest. It could have been said that it is a minor incident that has been leaked to the newspapers and let’s all move on. But of course we didn’t move on and we ended up all at the High Court.’ He accused the Police Federation of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ and criticised Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe’s handling of the affair, saying: ‘I think he could have done more at the time.’ Yesterday David Cameron said it was ‘never right to be abusive or rude’ to a police officer, and added: ‘The judge has made very clear his verdict and I think everyone should accept that verdict and move on.’ On Thursday a High Court judge castigated the ‘childish’ MP, ruling that he did shout at PC Toby Rowland: ‘You don’t run this f****** government. You’re f****** plebs.’ Left, Mr Mitchell is pictured leaving the High Court in central London after having lost the 'plebgate' libel case. Pictured right, PC Toby Rowland speaks to reporters after the judge delivered his verdict . The devastating ruling came at the end of a complex libel trial after Mr Mitchell sued News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation, and Mr Rowland countersued the MP. Mr Mitchell was ordered to pay costs of £300,000 by January 3 and may face a total bill of £2million as he will have to pay the other side’s legal fees and damages to Mr Rowland. His law firm Atkins Thomson also faces an estimated £1million bill after failing to get documents relating to their budget into the court in time, meaning it had to represent Mr Mitchell on a ‘no win, no fee basis’. But Parliamentary records published this week indicate Mr Mitchell may be able to afford the costs. On May 16 this year, he was paid £18,000 for one day’s work with Investec, a specialist private banking group. The politician has several homes in Britain and Europe. He lives in a £2.5million house in Islington, North London, with his wife Sharon, a doctor. Yesterday the couple left their home without commenting.","Mr Mitchell's work includes consulting for firms that offer offshore banking .

Decker Sound Beach School last week after her mother Jamie refused to let her receive the Tdap booster, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. McNicholas said her daughter's doctor wouldn't administer the shot, which is a new requirement of the Miller Place Union Free School District, because it's recommended only for children over 10 years old. Scroll down for video... A mother's fears: Long Island mom Jamie McNichols has refused to get her 8-year-old daughter Ceili a Tdap booster shot that FDA guidelines stipulate should be given to children no younger than 10 . Too young? Ceili has been expelled from third grade because her mother won't let her have the shot. Their doctor said Ceili is simply too young for the booster, per FDA guidelines--though CDC guidelines say children her age are old enought . Tdap boosters: Ceili is one of a small group of kids who were vaccinated iwth Tdap before age 4, meaning she should be due for the booster before an age when its indicated for use . And FDA guidelines back the doctor up. 'If we give that Tdap vaccination between 7 and 10, we are using it off label,' Long island pediatrician Dr. Mary Renna told CBS New York. 'So if we can’t use it, then we are the ones going to be held liable.' According to FDA.gov, the Tdap brand 'Boostrix is approved for use as a single dose in individuals 10 years of age and older.' And that's what scares McNicholas, whose daughter is part of a small group of children who got their whooping cough vaccinations before age 4. 'I believe in vaccinations, and that's not the issue,' she told NBC New York. 'The issue is an age-appropriate vaccination.' Meanwhile, the school district has taken cues from the state--which follows CDC guidelines that do allow for children Ceili's age to get the booster--in a bid to avoid whooping cough outbreaks. And the rule states that, until she gets the shot, Ceili simply may not attend her school. 'The only way that she will be back in school before age 10 is if the state makes an exception for my daughter and the other kids that are faced with the same situation, because I’m not getting her that shot,' McNicholas said. In the meantime, McNicholas is prepared to home school her daughter. She's also started an online petition to get her daughter back in school. 'It breaks your heart,' McNicholas said. 'But do I sacrifice her health, possibly, just to get her into that building?'","Third grader Ceili McNicholas was kicked out of her Long Island school when her mother refused to give her Tdap booster .

"A real life Indiana Jones has uncovered details about King Solomon's riches in a newly translated Hebrew text. But treasure hunters may have to wait a bit longer as, unlike the film ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ details about the exact location of these treasures are unclear. Rather than a guide to lost treasure, the newly translated ‘Treatise of the Vessels’ was a legendary story written in Biblical times that was meant to entertain. The Ark of the Covenant is a gilded case believed to have been constructed nearly 3,000 years ago . The Ark of the Covenant . The Tabernacle - According to the Hebrew Bible, this was a portable dwelling where God chose to meet his people . Musical instruments made of gold . Ornaments from the Garden of Eden . 77 golden tables of the Bread of the Presence -  bread placed on a special table as an offering to God . Silver trumpets . The clothing of the high priest . Thousands of garments of regular priests . Gems from the 'Celestial Pavement', or Heaven . The text, translated by Professor James Davila from St Andrews University, suggests the artefacts from King Solomon's temple were tucked away in various places throughout the Middle East. It lists a number of treasures including the Ark of the Covenant, the Tabernacle, musical instruments made of gold, ornaments from the Garden of Eden and various precious religious stones. It describes: '77 tables of gold, and their gold was from the walls of the Garden of Eden that was revealed to Solomon, and they radiate like the radiance of the sun and moon, which radiate the height of the world.' 'The number of stones was forty-six thousands and the number of pearls was the same...seven curtains of fold in which was collected twelve thousands talents of gold and the vestments of the Levites and their belts.' The Hebrew text claiming to reveal the location of King Solomans hidden treasure and the fate of the Ark of the Covenant. The oldest confirmed example of the treatise, which survives to present day, is from a book published in Amsterdam in 1648 called 'Emek Halachah' A modern-day Indiana Jones has uncovered details about the fate of the Ark of Covenant (pictured in this stone carving) in a newly translated Hebrew text . The Ark of the Covenant is a legendary gilded case believed to have been constructed nearly 3,000 years ago. According to biblical text, the Ark holds the Ten Commandments handed down to Moses by God. It was housed in King Solomon's Temple, which contained a variety of different treasures. In the Book of Exodus, the Ark is a box made from a of wood generally translated as acacia, covered in gold. The top surface of the Ark is decorated with two cherubim, or angels, who crouch facing each other with wings outstretched, forming a seat. Some say God himself occupies that seat, while the Ark served as a footstool. When King Solomon’s Temple was captured . and destroyed by the Babylonians in 597 and 586 B.C., the coveted . artefact disappeared forever.Some of the treasures were hidden in Israel and Babylonia, while others were delivered into the hands of the angels Shamshiel, Michael and Gabriel. ‘The text tells us no more about where the Ark and other treasures might be than if you watched the film,’ Professor Davila told MailOnline. ‘But it does provide some interesting insights into Jewish legends in the Middle Ages….Mostly it tells us ways in which people understood the Bible that are not part of official interpretation.’ The Ark of the Covenant is a legendary gilded case believed to have been constructed nearly 3,000 years ago. According . to biblical text, the Ark holds the Ten Commandments handed down to . Moses by God. It was housed in King Solomon's Temple, which contained a . variety of different treasures. But when King Solomon’s Temple was captured and destroyed by the Babylonians in 597 and 586 B.C., the coveted artefact disappeared forever. Archaeologists are still unsure whether Ark was captured, destroyed or hidden, and many have searched for it throughout the centuries. The text, which dates back at least as far back as the 15th century, says the ‘treasures were concealed by a number of Levites and prophets.’ ‘Some of these (treasures) were hidden in various locations in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia, while others were delivered into the hands of the angels Shamshiel, Michael, Gabriel and perhaps Sariel,’ he writes. The writer of the text draws on traditional methods of scriptural explanation to explain where the treasures might have been hidden. But there are a number of inconsistencies in the text. For example, in the prologue it states that Shimmur the Levite and his companions hid the treasures. Later on the text mentions the treasures being in the keeping of, or hidden by, Shamshiel and other angels. ‘I believe the author looked at various legends without much concern about making them consistent,’ said Professor Davila. He added that the treatise is similar in some ways to the metallic ‘Copper Scroll,’ one of the Dead Sea Scrolls found near the site of Qumran in the West Bank. King Solomon . King Solomon has fascinated historians, scholars and treasure hunters for centuries. Some have been drawn to his poetry, others to his tales of wisdom - and many to the tales of his phenomenal wealth. Although the only accounts of him come from the Bible, many historians believe he was a real and immensely powerful figure. The son of King David - of the David and Goliath story - and Queen Bathsheba, he was the third King of Israel and ruled for 40 years, between 965BC and 925BC. During his reign, Israel was at the heart of a prosperous and stable empire. He rebuilt Jerusalem, creating magnificent palaces and fortresses, and also built the first temple to store the Ark of the Covenant. His life was extravagant. The Book of Kings reveals he had 700 wives, including the daughter of a pharoah and 300 concubines. The Old Testament also reveals how he was visited by the Queen of Sheba, who was so impressed by his wealth that she arrived on camel with spices, gifts and tons of gold. According to Bible, he was a prolific writer, composing 1,005 songs and 3,000 proverbs. Many are still in use, with the expression 'pride comes before a fall' based on one of his sayings. According to biblical text, the Ark holds the Ten Commandments handed down to Moses by God. This image (ca. 1725-1727) shows the Ark of the Covenant and is by Giovanni Battista Pittoni . Indiana Jones, right, carries away the glistening Ark of the Covenant in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark by Steven Spielberg . The Copper Scroll, which dates back around 1,900 years, shows several ‘striking parallels’ with the newly translated treatise, Professor Davila said. The treatise says that the treasures from Solomon's Temple were recorded ‘on a tablet of bronze,’ a metal like the Copper Scroll. The Copper scroll also discusses the location of hidden treasure, although not from Solomon's Temple. Professor Davila said this might reveal a tradition of inscribing lists of treasures on metal. The oldest confirmed example of the treatise, which survives to present day, is from a book published in Amsterdam in 1648 called ‘Emek Halachah.’ However, Professor Davila is the first to translate the text into English.","'Treatise of the Vessels’ suggests artefacts were hidden in the Middle East .

"Derrick Quarm (pictured) complained the comment by a detective was ‘overtly racist’ because it referred to the black and ethnic minority population in Lambeth, South London . Senior officers failed to investigate a policeman who compared an inner-city borough to ‘Planet of the Apes’ in the aftermath of the 2011 London riots, it was claimed yesterday. Black officer Derrick Quarm complained the comment by a detective was ‘overtly racist’ because it referred to the black and ethnic minority population in Lambeth, South London. But he said senior managers attempted to ‘bury the incident’. DC Quarm said he found it ‘incredible’ that managers failed to investigate the comment – allegedly made in the days of heightened racial tension after the police shooting of Mark Duggan, which sparked the London riots and looting – for almost three years. The plain clothes officer claimed it was investigated only after he included it in a report about his experiences of alleged racism, corruption and cover-ups within policing in Lambeth. The force was described as ‘institutionally racist’ by the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence and Mr Quarm said his experiences showed it had not done enough to combat racism among its own officers. But his attempts to force Scotland Yard to address the problem resulted in him facing a campaign of ‘detriment and hostility’, he told an employment tribunal. The former paratrooper said his senior officers falsely accused him of incompetence and lying in an attempt to discredit him as a whistleblower, and called their behaviour ‘classic school ground bullying’. He was treated as a ‘troublemaker’, accused of losing evidence in a stabbing case and overloaded with paperwork to punish him for speaking out, he said. Disturbingly, he told South London Employment Tribunal in Croydon that his senior officers’ behaviour had hindered his police work and even stopped him from preventing a murder. DC Quarm, who has served in the Metropolitan Police for 18 years, said he had attempted to raise his concerns with the force’s commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, and other top-ranking officers. Mr Quarm's attempts to force Scotland Yard to address the problem resulted in him facing a campaign of ‘detriment and hostility’, he told an employment tribunal . But he claimed the ‘Planet of the Apes’ comment, allegedly made by DS Matthew Price, was investigated only after he raised it at a previous employment tribunal, in which he unsuccessfully accused the Met of race discrimination. DC Quarm said: ‘In early August 2011 after the shooting of Mark Duggan, there were several witnesses to DS Price in Lambeth commenting “It’s like being in Planet of the Apes” in reference to the numbers of BAME [black and minority ethnic] people around him. ‘I expressed concern that no formal investigation had taken place into this incident. There was a clear breach of policy and legislation, including the Public Order Act 1986 that was not investigated. DC Quarm claimed senior officers failed to investigate a policeman who compared an inner-city borough to ‘Planet of the Apes’ in the aftermath of the 2011 London riots (file picture) 'To my mind the SLT [senior leadership team] managers who had made the decision to bury the incident were at fault … I found it incredible that the Lambeth SLT decision makers would buck policy and legislation then protect DS Price’s behaviour.’ DC Quarm, 41, said Lambeth referred the 2011 incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2014 only after he had raised concerns in his previous employment tribunal. The police watchdog referred it back to the Met with a recommendation that the force’s own professional standards department should investigate. The employment tribunal was told the internal probe found DS Price had no case to answer. DC Quarm told the hearing he had unearthed a ‘white collar criminal network’ in Lambeth but was ‘portrayed as a pathological liar’ after reporting his findings, and claimed his previous managers briefed his new bosses in a different borough that he ‘played the race card’. He has previously lost two employment tribunals in which he accused the Met of overlooking him for promotion because of race discrimination. The Met disputes his version of events, given during a current employment tribunal in which DC Quarm claims he was treated unfairly after coming forward as a whistleblower. The hearing continues.","Managers failed to investigate policeman who made comment, tribunal told .

"The teenage boy at the center of the Louisiana school threesome scandal is devastated that his bragging has ruined the promising careers of two teachers. 'He is really down about it right now,' the high school junior's grandfather told MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'All boys that age want to brag about what they are doing. He didn't expect it would come to this.' The teachers, Rachel Respess, 24, and married mom-of-three Shelley Dufresne, 32, are currently out on bond awaiting trial for having sex with their student. They are on unpaid leave from their jobs at Destrehan High School and are unlikely ever to return. Scroll down for video . Shelley Dufresne (left), 32, a Louisiana teacher and married mother of three, allegedly had sexual encounters with a 16-year-old boy, which also involved another female English teacher identified as Rachel Respess (right) Busted: Shelley Dufresne, pictured left in her yearbook, 32, is a Louisiana teacher and married mother of three, while Rachel Respess, right, 24, is accused of taking part in sexual trysts at her home . 'He feels really bad,' said the boy's grandfather. 'These women have families and he knows how terrible it is for them. He knows they will never be able to teach again and could very well go to prison. 'He just wishes the whole thing had never happened. It's a shocking thing — a real shock for all of us — when you have teachers who should be educating doing this instead.' MailOnline is not identifying the boy who turned 17 just days after the alleged ménage à trois as he is still a minor. The boy is said to have had an ongoing affair with Dufresne, his 11th grade English teacher at Destrehan, a sleepy commuter town west of New Orleans. According to police she picked him up after a Friday Night Lights high school football game on September 12 and drove him to Respess's apartment in Kenner, Louisiana — where she had only moved two weeks previously after living with her parents. Respess, a pretty blonde who used the name 'CajunBabe' for her email addresses, decided she needed freedom away from her parents' upscale 3,900-sq. ft. home in Destrehan and moved 12 miles into a cramped apartment with peeling paint. 'She only moved in at the end of August,' a neighbor who would identify himself only as 'Will,' told MailOnline. 'CajunBabe': Respess decided she needed freedom away from her parents' upscale 3,900-sq. ft. home in Destrehan, above . Love nest: Police say Respess invited her friend Dufresne and their underage lover to her apartment in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue in Kenner for group sex . 'There was a lot of activity going on in that short time.' 'All sorts of people you wouldn't expect were coming and going,' he added. Dufresne, the daughter of a local judge, is separately charged with having sex with the teen in the small oil town of Montz, 25 miles west of New Orleans, where she lives with her oil company manager husband Wes and their three young children. She was featured in a diet ad for xlr8fitness claiming she had lost 10 pounds in 75 days, MailOnline has learned. She posed in a bare midriff for the before and after photos. Neighbors say the couple is still living together. Police are currently looking at cellphones to see if rumored videos of the threesome exist. Sgt. Brian McGregor of Kenner Police told MailOnline forensic experts are examining the phones. 'These days things like iPhones are just like computers so forensics are looking to see what may have been deleted,' he said. He would not say who owns the devices being examined. Respess and Dufresne were caught after the boy told friends he was having sex with two of his teachers, police say. Word soon traveled around the high school campus and school authorities brought in the cops. Though the student was only a few days short of the age of consent in Louisiana, state law forbids teachers having sex with any of their students under 20. Alumnus: Respess  is a Destrehan graduate who has been teaching English at the school for more than a year. She taught the boy involved last year . Pals: Respass' neighbor Will told MailOnline he had seen Dufresne at Respess's home in the Windsong apartment complex before the night of their alleged ménage à trois . Respess taught the boy English last year when he was a sophomore. Her neighbor Will told MailOnline he had seen Dufresne at Respess's home in the Windsong apartment complex before the night of their alleged ménage à trois. 'As soon as I saw her picture in the paper I recognized her,' he said. 'She'd been round here several times.' But he admits he did not see or hear anything on the night that the two teachers are said to have brought their student for some extracurricular activity. 'The walls on this place are pretty soundproof,' he said. 'But our dog barks at anything and I would have thought he would have heard something. Will said he wants nothing to do with his new neighbor. 'My father used to say: ""Bad people are contagious."" That's how I feel about her.' Despite lights blazing in Respess's ground floor apartment, no-one came to the door when MailOnline knocked. One-bedroom apartments at Windsong start at $595 a month according to the complex's website. Dufresne, who has two sons and a daughter all aged under 8, was originally arrested by the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Department on September 29 and charged with having sex with the boy in Montz. Stand by me:  Dufresne, the daughter of a local judge, lives in the oil town of Montz, 25 miles west of New Orleans,  with her oil company manager husband Wes and their three children. Neighbors say the couple are still living together. Then she and Respess were slapped with additional charges of 'having carnal knowledge of a juvenile' — official language for underage sex — indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. All those charges are in relation to the partying at Respess's apartment in Kenner which is in neighboring Jefferson Parish. According to police. Dufresne enticed the boy to drive with her to Respess's home after the game — when Destrehan High nearly blew out a team nicknamed 'The Cougars.' The Destrehan Wildcats beat the Helen Cox High Cougars by 48-7 with the visitors only scoring a late touchdown after most of Destrehan's starters had been withdrawn. Police say the 'unlawful sexual acts' started on the night of September 12 'carrying over into the early morning of Saturday September 13.' Cops also believe the threesome was Dufresne's idea and she 'propositioned' her younger colleague with her plan. Respess told police she was aware that Dufresne was bringing the boy to her apartment for three-way sex. A police report says that while Respess was having intercourse with the boy, Dufresne 'began intimately kissing (Respess) in an attempt to arouse all parties involved, all who were complete(ly) disrobed.' Kenner Police Chief Mike Glaser said the boy told investigators he consented to the sex with the teachers and Respess gave a statement in which she 'almost' admitted having sex with the student but, he said, she did not go into 'intricate details.' 'She gave a similar account of his story,' the top cop said. 'But she stopped short of a total confession.' Glaser said his investigators 'have no doubt' that both women had sex with their student. Dufresne has taught English for 10 years at Destrehan High School, where met another teacher who now has been implicated in the sex abuse case . He called the allegations unfortunate but not surprising. 'Nothing surprises me any more really, but I do believe it's lack of a better judgment. They should have known better. 'You have an educator whose responsibility is the safety and education of the children and when it goes outside those lines I believe the community should be outraged,' Glaser added. Both teachers had been students at Destrehan High and both went on to Louisiana State University. On her page on the high school's website, Dufresne, who had taught there for 10 years, wrote: 'I take my job and my students' education seriously and try my best to help all of my students be successful; however, this requires work and effort on the part of each of my students. 'I hope that all of my students have a great experience in my classroom and leave with the tools they need to be successful throughout the rest of their high school careers and in life.' School principal Stephen Weber sent parents and students a note after the women's arrests saying: 'I want to assure you that while the school system and proper authorities are conducting a thorough investigation of the allegations, you can be confident that teaching and learning, our core business, will continue effectively.' Dufresne is due in court in St. Charles Parish, where her father Emile St. Pierre is senior judge, on October 23. Judge Lauren Lemmon set Dufresne's bail at $200,000. She also ordered that she could only leave her single story brick home in Montz for 'continued mental health treatment, doctor appointments and church services.' Lemmon has since recused herself from the case because of her vlose professional relationship with Dufresne's father. The two teachers are due in court in Jefferson Parish for the case involving the alleged threesome on November 17 for a status hearing. If convicted they face a jail sentence of up to 17½ years in prison. Both are free on $7,000 bond in that case. Court records show Dufresne paid her bond in cash while Respess had to use a bail bond service.","The boy who shared the secret of his threesome regrets that his two blonde English teachers may never teach again .

"Steven Gerrard again covered every blade of grass in the midfield battle . Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game . Their shoulders were sunk, their faces long. This was supposed to be the day when Anfield hosted its biggest party for 24 years but ultimately it became the setting for a wake. No matter that Liverpool signed off an impressive campaign with the runners-up spot after beating Newcastle United; the emptiness of falling short of the ultimate dream as Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez and Co strolled around Anfield was palpable. For Brendan Rodgers, however, this was no time for despondency. Gloom had descended following the results against Chelsea and Crystal Palace that fatally damaged their title aspirations but, to lift the mood in the dressing room, Liverpool's manager took his squad back to the first day of the campaign. Before that opening contest against Stoke, he read out a letter that had been sent to him by a supporter. Not this year: Skipper Steven Gerrard is left to reflect as Liverpool missed out on the Premier League title . So near, yet so far: Daniel Sturridge was the match-winner but Manchester City were crowned champions . Support: Manager Brendan Rodgers salutes Liverpool's fans after full-time . Appreciation: Gerrard applauds the Anfield crowd during the post-game lap of honour . Volley good: Daniel Agger levels for Liverpool midway through the second half .

Referee: Phil Dowd . Attendance:44,724 . Man-of-the-Match: Raheem Sterling . Ratings by Dominic King at Anfield . The fan, named Ben, explained about . his pride in Liverpool and his faith that this could be a memorable . season. Sensing the need to put into perspective what they have . achieved, Rodgers felt the need to provide his group with a reminder. 'He . told us not to just think about fourth (place) but think about winning . (the title),' said Rodgers, taking up the story. 'At the time, probably . the staff and the players thought it was a bit far-fetched. But I truly . believed we could progress and (before the Newcastle match) I read the same letter back . again. 'All the words . that went back into the players' minds were the same as the beginning of . the season. Now the word that comes from this is belief. We will . improve. We will get better next season and we will be able to fight . again as we have got belief.' It will be difficult to see images of . Manchester City with the trophy they covet so much but once the . frustration subsides over the coming weeks and months, Liverpool will be . able to reflect on a campaign that has given them a base to attack the . top on a regular basis. Though . they had to work hard for victory here, coming from behind to snatch . the points with goals from two Daniels, Agger and Sturridge, they . dazzled for long periods and taking 37 points from the last 42 available . is clear evidence they are capable of championship-winning consistency. Mending . the wobbly defence is a prerequisite when the transfer window opens - . Newcastle, with more poise, could have had this contest wrapped up . before half-time - but should Rodgers do that, Liverpool will continue . to be a threat. 'We . will get better,' Rodgers insisted. 'The style will be enhanced and . improved. The philosophy here is very much based on attacking creative . play. We just need to be better and more concentrated when we are . winning other games. But there will be no fear.' Ow no! Martin Skrtel puts through his own goal to give Newcastle an early lead . Now what we had planned: Skrtel (right) cannot hide his despair following the first-half concession . Silver service: Newcastle celebrate their unlikely opener in the 20th minute . Frustration: Daniel Agger rues a missed chance as Liverpool tried to find an equaliser . Realisation: Liverpool fans react to news that Manchester City had taken the lead against West Ham . No goal: Suarez had a first-half effort disallowed by Phil Dowd, who had not seen the striker's quick free-kick . So close: Luis Suarez shows his frustration as Liverpool's title hopes faded . His words were as . impressive as the show of support that came before the game. As has . become the habit, Liverpool's fans lined Anfield Road with flags and let . off flares to greet the team bus. Inside the stadium, the club DJ . provided a soundtrack with hits from their glorious past. There . was even a rendition of 'Bubbles' to show that Red allegiances on this . day were also with West Ham United, who needed to provide the ultimate . favour and beat City if Liverpool were to win their 19th . title. In reality, the . fairytale scenario never threatened to come true. Liverpool were scruffy . in the opening 45 minutes. Newcastle, by contrast, showed plenty of . fight and spirit and deservedly took the lead when Martin Skrtel . horribly sliced Yoan Gouffran's cross past Simon Mignolet in the 20th . minute. That . was the 12th goal Liverpool had conceded in the last six matches and it . nearly became 13 when Gouffran skipped clear but succeeded only in . shooting straight at Mignolet after Shola Ameobi had split Liverpool's . defence open. Expectations at that point deflated like a punctured . balloon. 'We couldn't . have ended the season in that way,' Rodgers said. 'We needed to put that . behind us.' To their credit, Liverpool's response was impressive. Full . of energy and movement, they began pressing and Newcastle were . powerless to prevent themselves being pushed back deeper and deeper. Eventually they cracked. Clash: Paul Dummett was sent off following a challenge which felled Suarez . On the run: Joe Allen tries to get away from Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko . Raheem Sterling again provided evidence ofwhy he should be included in Roy Hodgson’s23-man squad with an energetic display thatcaused Newcastle problems and showed howmuch he has progressed in the second half ofseason. Daniel Sturridge also made his markwith the winning goal. He was quiet in the firsthalf but improved and was given a standingovation when substituted. Glen Johnson didnothing to harm his position as first-choiceright back, and Steven Gerrard and JordanHenderson were solid. Uruguay, meanwhile, will be relieved to seeLuis Suarez end the campaign unscathed. Parity . was secured in the 64th minute when, after foul by Vurnon Anita on . Sterling, Gerrard swung a deep free-kick beyond the far post to Agger, . who divert the ball back past Tim Krul; 60 seconds later, an identical . set piece from another cheap foul presented Sturridge with the chance to . win the game. From . that point, Newcastle lost their discipline. Ameobi was sent off for . persistent dissent - a decision by referee Phil Dowd that left Alan . Pardew perplexed - and he was followed by substitute Paul Dummett, who . went in late on Suarez. 'The . referee could have managed the game better,' Pardew observed.

As he sat down to take his last press conference in this current stint as Manchester United manager, the players of Manchester City appeared on a large television screen with the trophy he knows so well. ‘Can someone switch that off, please,’ he said, only half joking. What strange times these are for Giggs and the club he has served for most of his life. Moments earlier he was part of the contingent that walked to the corner of the ground where the away fans were singing and dancing. Perhaps predictably, missing out on the Europa League was not met with grief. Maybe there were other reasons for the joy. The end of suffering in a humiliating season, most likely.

Not so much the era of United’s . dominance – that ship hoisted anchor before Christmas. But what of the . cogs, men like Giggs and his class-mates from 1992? Giggs . had nothing new to say on that score after the game. ‘I think the . managerial situation will be sorted next week and I will need to think . about my own position,’ he said. With . Louis van Gaal’s intentions towards the existing staff not totally . clear, that is a position in limbo. ‘I need to decide whether to play . on, stay on in the staff - and what position that is going to be - or . take a year off football,’ Giggs said. And . what of Rio Ferdinand, whose contract is up? His waving at the end . appeared more of a goodbye than a ‘see you later’. Then there was . Nemanja Vidic. They have good memories at United. A cruel person might . say they’ll need them. But . in any case, they were remembering Vidic the colossus. He was dreadful on Sunday and has often looked poor since announcing he is off to Inter . Milan. But they love him and, at the moment, history is all they have. There . is no telling how long these supporters will have to wait. Giggs says . ‘there is a lot to look forward to’, and channelled ‘the positives’, . namely that United’s first season without European football since the . Heysel bans of the Eighties will be a good thing. Bloodied in battle: Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic was hurt in a challenge with Lambert . Goodbye, Nemanja: It was Vidic's last game for United before his move to Inter Milan this summer . Class of '92: Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt watch on from the sidelines . ‘It . might help with our league form and cup runs,’ he said. ‘If we do well . in the cups it gets the amount of games up and everyone gets a chance . because we need to keep a squad for when we get back in Europe next . year.’ But Giggs is an optimist. This performance, as if further proof were needed, showed the stark limitations of the side. Within . five minutes, one of Vidic’s touches went straight into touch. Two . minutes later he clearly handled in his area and, shortly before the . half-hour, he was left covered in blood from an incident that led to . Rickie Lambert’s opener. The . England striker elbowed Vidic as they contested an aerial ball – it did . not appear to be malicious – but Mike Dean incorrectly opted against . giving United a free-kick. Steven Davis then played in Lambert to score . his 13th league goal of a fine season, before Juan Mata levelled with a . delightful free-kick. Pace: Adnan Januzaj attempts to jink past Southampton midfielder Jack Cork . Skill: Adam Lallana races away from fellow Englishman Michael Carrick . Great job: Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a move to take over at Spurs for next season . Luke Shaw was brilliant at left back in front of Roy Hodgson and is going to Brazil. Southampton team-mate Adam Lallana impressed in midfield as well. Rickie Lambert scored for Saints but was generally quiet. United’s Danny Welbeck and Chris Smalling struggled to make an impact but Michael Carrick’s arrival as a substitute helped turn the game in his team’s favour. Of . course, Southampton now face their own period of uncertainty. Mauricio . Pochettino continues to sidestep direct questions about his future, with . Tottenham looming. ‘I still . have one year on my contract and it is normal that these rumours crop . up,’ he said, as he always does. He was marginally more effusive in his . appraisal of a stunning season. ‘The way we played throughout, they way . we took eighth place, this makes me proud,’ he said. But Southampton are looking at a near future that quite feasibly will not include Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw or their manager. Those will be huge losses. But they are still on an up-slope. It’s been a long year since United could say the same. Emotional: Vidic bids farewell to the fans after the game . Strong tackle: Vidic goes up for an aerial duel with Cork... putting his leg high .

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including Fernando Torres' winning goal . And so a season in which Jose Mourinho has regularly bemoaned his lack of a quality striker ended with a match-winner from Fernando Torres. The £50million British record transfer did not appear especially overjoyed to find the net. He rarely does, these days. Likewise Mourinho did not appear too thrilled to finish with a win which could not prevent him recording the lowest league position in any full season of his managerial career. Cardiff were already doomed but Craig Bellamy's heavily deflected shot gave them the lead before Andre Schurrle turned the game, scoring an equaliser six minutes after coming on as a sub, and setting up Torres, two minutes later.

"Spoon-bending 'psychic' Uri Geller believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond' There are some on the outer fringes of the internet who say it heralds the end of the world; but for others, it looks like the perfect day for a wedding . At 11.11.11 on 11.11.11, the time and date will be a perfect same-numbered palindrome, reading the same backwards as forwards, an event which can only happen on one day every 100 years. And even the most hardened sceptic will surely pause for a moment to reflect on the unique occurrence, which will not come around again in the lifetime of most of us. Among other things, 11.11.11 will be: . The reason the date is so unusual is that 11.11.11 is the only double-figure palindromic date, since there is no 22nd month. And . the last time it happened, on November 11 1911, an almost supernatural . event saw temperatures drop by more than 60F in a single day. This was the Great Blue Norther, a cold . snap which hit the U.S. causing blizzards and tornadoes as well as . record falls in temperature. In Kansas City, it was as warm as 76F (24C) in the morning - but this had dropped to 11F (-12C) by the end of the day. Remembrance: November 11 is best known in the UK as Armistice Day, or Veterans Day in the U.S. A new film being released on Friday, . entitled simply 11-11-11, predicts that the day will see the opening of a . portal in to Hell, and says: 'On this day, innocent blood will spill.' The film by Darren Bousman, director . of several entries in the Saw franchise, features a man whose family . dies in a car crash at 11.11am, and who then begins to be haunted by the . number 11. It plays on . beliefs long held by some spiritualists, who say that the number has a . special significance and claim that many people have a mystical . attraction to the time 11.11. Horror: Today sees the release of apocalyptic film 11-11-11, which predicts the opening of a Hellmouth . One group believes that 11.11 is the special symbol of the 'Spirit Guardians', a group of 1,111 celestial beings who supposedly look after mortals and manifest themselves in mid-morning. Spoon-bending 'psychic' Uri Geller has written that the number represents 'the need to find balance in life', and added: 'When I see the number 1111, I pray for sick children and world peace.' Gretna Green: The romantic town in the Scottish Borders will have an upswing in marriages on 11.11.11 . He also believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and . the key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond'. However, most of those who have chosen . this Friday as a day to get married are more attracted by the pleasing . coincidence than by any deeper significance. The small town of Gretna Green, a . traditional wedding venue near the border between Scotland and England, . will host at least 50 weddings on 11.11.11, compared to fewer than a . dozen on a typical November Friday. Wedding . mania will be even more pronounced overseas, such as in India where . thousands of couples have judged the date to be auspicious for a . successful marriage. Sarah . Bull, a Mail Online journalist who is getting married in Suffolk on . Friday, said that it 'means a lot to be able to get married on such a . historical date.' She . added: 'We chose 11.11.11 for our wedding day because it's a date which . nobody, including my rather absent-minded fiancé, will ever forget.' Trousers: One group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines . The day will also be one of celebration for a number of children who will be turning 11 on 11.11.11. For . Hannah Rose Hawkins, of Walton in Somerset, it will be even more special, . as she sees in her 11th birthday at her house - number 11. Most famously, the 11th of November is . Armistice Day in the UK - Veterans Day in the U.S. - when we celebrate . the end of World War I and commemorate the victims of that war and . subsequent ones. The reason we ascribe significance to 11.11.11 is apophenia - the urge to find patterns in seemingly random data. It is this that explains why we see clouds forming certain shapes, and why we often hear of people finding 'faces' in things like potato crisps. Apophenia is also important in the psychology of gamblers. It can either encourage those on a winning streak to believe that it will continue, or convince losing gamblers that their luck must inevitably change. While it can be a symptom of mental illness if taken to an extreme - as depicted in the film A Beautiful Mind - apophenia is instinctive to all humans as a way of drawing conclusions about the world. This phenomenon helps us, for example, to recognise abstract drawings as representing human figures, and to remember phone numbers which seem to follow a pattern. The end of the Great War came on November 11, 1918. Given the carnage seen in the war, we can assume that the date was not deliberately chosen, but was simply the earliest possible opportunity for a ceasefire. However, the decision to end the war at exactly 11 o'clock certainly was deliberate, at the Armistice was signed around five in the morning (Paris time), to take effect at the symbolic point a few hours later. Tragically, fierce fighting continued right up until the official ceasefire, and one American soldier was killed at 10.58. Of course, there is no real significance to the date 11.11.11 - not even at the time of 11.11.11 - but it is a classic example of apophenia, the human urge to see patterns in essentially random events. With that in mind, perhaps the group . which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy . Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most . Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines. However, . to say that the date is no more than a coincidence would have provided . little comfort to those who endured the bizarre weather on the last . 11.11.11. It remains to be . seen whether 11.11.11 will produce such surprises this time around, but . people should be sure to keep a careful eye on the weather - and on any . local Hellmouths - at 11 seconds past 11 minutes past 11 o'clock.","Only occurs on one day every 100 years .
Armistice Day, celebrated around the world.
A day of spiritual significance for those who believe the number 11 has a mystical power.

"A discriminating side to babies has been revealed in a study that showed they condone bullying of those 'dissimilar' to them. The University of British Columbia carried out research that found infants divide their friends from their foes as young as nine-months-old. Previous research has shown that babies generally prefer people who act kindly, but this new study is the first to find that they condone antisocial behaviour directed at individuals who are different to them. Sinister: Babies are happy to condone bullying of people they feel are different or 'dissimilar' to themselves, a new study has found . Professor Kiley Hamlin of the University's Department of Psychology, who carried out the study, said: 'Our research shows that by nine months, babies are busy assessing their surroundings, trying to determine who is friend or foe. 'One important way they make these distinctions, our study finds, is based on perceived differences and similarities.' Researchers made babies choose which food they preferred between crackers and green beans then treated the babies to a puppet show. During the show one puppet demonstrated the same food preference as the infant, while another exhibited the opposite preference. In the experiments, other puppets . harmed, helped or acted neutrally towards the puppets with different or . similar food preferences. Prompted to pick their favourite puppet, infants demonstrated a strong preference for the puppets who harmed the 'dissimilar' puppet and helped the 'similar' one. One baby even went as far as planting a kiss on the head of the familiar puppet. Development: The behaviour is thought to be an early form of the social biases that most adults have . Professor Hamlin added: 'These findings suggest that babies feel something like schaudenfreude - pleasure when an individual they dislike or consider threatening experiences harm. 'Or babies have some early understanding of social alliances, recognising that the 'enemy of their enemy' is their friend.' Hamlin described the behaviour as an early form of the social biases that exist in most adults. She said that as humans get older, they favour individuals who are more familiar to themselves - over people with whom they have fewer things in common. These familiarities include origins, languages, appearances - even birthdays and sports affiliations. While studies show that humans tend to gravitate toward people who have things in common, these preferences can have a dark side. Professor Hamlin said: 'Disliking people who are different may lead us to mistreat them, and excuse - or even applaud - others who mistreat people who are different than us. 'But this does not mean that more extreme outcomes, like xenophobia and intergroup conflict, are inevitable. 'Rather, this research points to the importance of socialization practices that recognize just how basic these social biases might be and confront them head-on.' The study, called Not Like Me = Bad: Infants Prefer Those Who Harm Dissimilar Others was published by the Association for Psychological Science.

His poignant visit comes as it was announced the sea of red ceramic flowers, titled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red by artist Paul Cummins, will remain at the Tower of London until the end of November to allow more people to pay their respects to Britain's war dead. To date 888,246 poppies have been planted in the Tower's moat to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha planted ceramic poppies at the Tower of London today on the eve of Remembrance Sunday . Mr Cameron plants his poppy among the hundreds of thousands others to commemorate those who died in the First World War . Despite a public campaign to make the entire display permanent, a team of 8,000 volunteers will begin dismantling and cleaning the flowers on November 12. They will leave two sections, The Wave and The Weeping Window, in place until the end of the month. It will then be displayed across the country in different museums, before being permanently installed at the Imperial War Museum in 2018. 'I think the exhibition of the poppies has really caught the public imagination, people have found that incredibly moving,' Mr Cameron said today. 'What we've managed to do is find a way of saving part of the exhibition for the nation and making sure it will be seen by many more people. 'Then it will be permanently saved by the Imperial War Museum - I think the right place for it to be - and something that marks the fact that everybody has found it so moving, so poignant, and such a brilliant idea. 'By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.' Floodlights have already been installed to allow people to visit after dusk. It comes after overwhelming crowds forced the closure of the nearby Tower Hill Station, with Transport for London pleading with tourists to postpone their visits. Crowds gathered around the Tower of London's famous moat to watch the Prime Minister and his wife plant their ceramic flowers . The Camerons are among millions of people to have visited the site since it was unveiled by Paul Cummins earlier this year . The Prime Minister and his wife walking among the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London earlier today . The Prime Minister said he was glad sections of the piece will remain to allow more visitors to pay their respects to the war dead . An estimated 4million people will have visited the artwork by November 12 since it became open to the public at the start of August . Politicians pleaded with organisers to keep Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London permanently following the site's popularity. An estimated 4million people will have viewed the attraction by November 12, prompting an online campaign with more than 20,000 signatures to stop it being dismantled. Adding his weight to the calls, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘I hope that a way can be found to extend this remarkable exhibition, and ensure that many more members of the public get the chance to pay their own personal tributes and see this extraordinary sight.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson is also reportedly in favour of keeping the artwork at the Tower. The politician told the Evening Standard this week: 'I’m keen to explore whether we can keep the exhibition open for longer, to give as many people as possible the chance to glimpse something so incredible, whilst easing the pressure on numbers.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has not yet visited the attraction, told radio listeners: 'It's really struck a chord, it's extraordinary and very moving to see. 'Let’s maybe keep the display going a bit longer, but not deprive those charities of that much needed money from the sale of the poppies.' The individual poppies have been sold for £25 each to raise money for Armed Forces charities. The tour of sections of the artwork will be funded with charitable donations as well as £500,000 from the Government. Chancellor George Osborne also revealed fines paid by banks over the Libor-fixing scandal would be used to contribute to the tour. 'The Tower of London poppies are a striking reminder of the sacrifice that over 800,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers made to protect our freedom during the First World War, so I'm delighted that £500,000 of Libor fines will be used to ensure that people across the country will be able to see this moving tribute over the next four years,' he said. 'To support the current generation of brave servicemen and women who continue to protect our freedoms every day, we're also using Libor fines to waive VAT on the sale of these poppies, with proceeds going to military charities. 'It's only right that fines from those who have demonstrated the very worse of values should go to support those who have shown the best of British values.' Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who leads the Government's programme to mark the centenary of the war, added: 'The poppies at the Tower are a stunning memorial to those who died in the First World War. 'I had the honour of being allowed to plant one of the poppies myself and, like the four million or so people who have gone to see them, I was left in awe at the sheer scale and strength of the piece. For me this is public art at its most powerful and moving.' General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London, added: 'We are delighted that key elements of Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red - the poppies installation at the Tower of London - which has so captured the heart of the nation, are to be preserved for many more thousands of people to see and appreciate over the coming four years. 'All at the Tower of London and Historic Royal Palaces are most grateful that this wonderful community art project will continue for the next four years.' Mr Cameron is the latest public figure to make an official visit to the artwork since it was unveiled in August. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured the impressive attraction in August with Prince Harry. In her last public appearance before announcing she was pregnant with her second child, the Duchess wiped tears from her eyes as she planted her own flower on August 5. The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the Tower on October 16. Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard . Sections of the artwork such as The Wave (pictured) will remain at the Tower of London until the end of the month to allow more visitors . The Weeping Window, a section of the piece with flowers pouring out of one of the tower's historic windows, will remain until December . The poignant tribute is among many pieces of artwork produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI .

"Siobhan Condon bragged about the court proceedings on a Facebook page open to the public . A social worker gloated about having three children taken into care on her publicly accessible Facebook page. Siobhan Condon, 41, bragged about the power she felt at breaking up the family and revelled in the judge giving the parents a ‘massive rollicking’. She even referred to the solicitor in the case complimenting her ‘fine nails and shoes’ before saying she was about to ‘do the mammoth grim task’ of removing the youngsters from their home and signing off with three kisses. The children, all aged under ten at the time, were put into foster care following the court hearing last year. Their mother reported Miss Condon’s comments to Essex County Council after spotting them on the social worker’s Facebook page, which was open to the public and gave enough information to identify the family. Family proceedings are normally held behind closed doors and shrouded in secrecy. The Health and Care Professional Council found Miss Condon guilty of misconduct and the local authority decided not to renew her contract. However, she has not been struck off. Instead, she must be closely monitored by a line manager for a year. Tory MP Simon Burns yesterday questioned the leniency of the punishment, saying: ‘There are some very difficult cases … where there are no winners and it seems incredible that someone in a position of trust and responsibility should post information on Facebook … to gloat is totally inappropriate. ‘I find it quite staggering and do question whether simply monitoring someone who does this is right.’ The case of ‘Family A’ was heard at Chelmsford Crown Court on May 9 last year. Miss Condon, who has a young daughter, posted comments the night before, speculating about whether the judge ‘might question my zero tolerance to domestic violence’. The next day, after the case ended, the senior social worker who qualified in 1999, wrote: ‘Just experienced His Honour Judge [sic] give parents a massive rollicking. It was an amazing and extraordinary moment in my career and he complimented my court evidence.’ She added: ‘Me and [unnamed person] are reflecting on how the solicitor commented on [how] fine nails and shoes appear to be a requirement of our team lol. Anyway of [sic] now to do the mammoth grim task fingers crossed xxx.’ Miss Condon later wrote: ‘Its [sic] powerful to know that … children’s lives have been massively changed for the better.’ The council’s conduct committee heard the children’s mother, ‘Mrs A’, made a complaint on May 17. A senior manager used Google to look for evidence and found the comments, despite not being a Facebook friend of Miss Condon’s. He reported that Mr and Mrs A were ‘upset and angry’. Miss Condon claimed she thought a privacy setting on her account meant her entries could only be read by her friends. But the committee noted that even if this were true, around 70 of them were not involved in social care and the family were identifiable. Last week the committee concluded her conduct fell ‘seriously below’ expected standards as the postings were ‘disrespectful and demonstrated poor judgment’. Miss Condon, who now works for the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham according to a friend, declined to comment. Essex council has apologised to Mr and Mrs A for her conduct.","Siobhan Condon bragged on social media about court proceedings .

"Diane De Courcy speaks during a news conference in Quebec City . Fierce laws brought in to protect the French language in Quebec are under the spotlight after a recent spate of rulings - including a restaurant that was condemned for using the word 'pasta'. The Office Quebecois de la Langue Francaise is the body responsible for 'safeguarding' the region's French language, which is spoken by 94 per cent of people in the region. But recent rulings have prompted ridicule from the English-speaking minority. It follows a spate of draconian decisions, including: . Many of the area's French speakers are equally dismissive of the crackdown on foreign languages. The backlash prompted OQLF president Louise Marchand to resign from her role, as Diane de Courcy, the Quebec minister for language, ordered a review of the latest incident where 'pasta' was deemed one of 'too many' foreign words used by an Italian restaurant. 'It was a big crisis,' admitted De Courcy. 'We had 60 countries report on this issue, and we weren't all very proud about it. But at the same time, this was also an opportunity.' Quit: Louise Marchand, pictured presenting an African peacekeeping certificate, has stepped down from her role . She promised that the language office will be 're-structured' following the latest embarrassment, and the body will be conducting an internal review in the face of negative media coverage. But the aim of the OQLF will still be to protect the French language, which is seen as being under constant assault by English speakers across the rest of Canada. The recent evidence suggests that the pro-French campaign has stepped up a gear in recent years but there has been no shortage of ridicule over the years - and not always because of OQLF. Many people do support the bid to protect French, and it is not unheard of for members of the public to threaten taking organisations to court for not respecting the language. In the Nineties, a pet shop owner was threatened with legal action because it had a parrot named Peekaboo that only repeated English phrases.","Latest embarrassment for the  Office Quebecois de la Langue Francaise .

"After winning the support of New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Mitt Romney now has the support of legendary quarterback John Elway, ahead of the first presidential debate tomorrow. The former Denver Broncos quarterback hailed the Republican candidate as a 'proven leader' and called Romney and his vice-president hopeful Paul Ryan as a 'comeback team'.

A delighted Romney said he was thrilled to have the Hall of Fame footballer, who retired in 1999 and was statistically the second most prolific passer in the history of the NFL, backing him. He said: 'Leaders come in many forms, . and John Elway has always exemplified leadership, first as a . quarterback for the Super Bowl champion Broncos, and now as an executive . vice president for the team.

"They tend to make their beds in the hollow of a tree. But these baby raccoons seem quite happy to keep an eye out for Davy Crockett types from the safety of this road grate in the Big City. The trio were spotted poking their heads over the drain by motorist Anthony Richards in California when he stopped at traffic lights. Raccoons have increasingly made their way into towns and cities in the U.S. since the 1950s, but urban raccoon populations are frequently underestimated because people seldom see them during the day as they are nocturnal. Peek-a-boo: These three little racoons popped up in California over the Christmas period and were snapped by a motorist . According to the department of Animal Care and Control for the County of Los Angeles, raccoons are attracted to urban areas by the easy accessibility of food, water and shelter. They may be cute but they can damage buildings, gardens, fruit trees, lawns and bins and carry carry diseases and parasites. As well as in hollow trees, raccoons make their dens in drainpipes, homes, apartment buildings, under decks and in storage buildings. Moving to the city: More and more raccoons have made their way into urban areas since the fifties .","Row of cute creatures in grate pictured in California .

"A Korean girl group has sparked outrage for wearing armbands strikingly similar to those worn by the Nazis during the Second World War. During a recent performance, the pop group pulled off their coats to reveal completely black outfits with short frilly dresses - and bright red armbands featuring a black cross on a white circle. The managers of rookie girl group Pritz - which stands for 'Pretty Rangers in Terrible Zone' - have denied the similarities were deliberate, but the group has come under fire for the obvious resemblance. Korean girl group Pritz (pictured) wearing armbands which look strikingly similar to those worn by the Nazis . Pictures of the armbands were quickly shared on social media, where users agreed that they looked almost identical to the armbands used by the Nazis. Pritz's entertainment agency Pandagram, which rejected the comparison, said that when they were designing the costumes the 'thought never occurred' to them that the armbands and black outfits could be reminiscent of Nazi uniforms. According to Pandagram, the logo was inspired by traffic signs, with black numbers written on white circles surrounded by red. The X-shape has arrowheads at the end to symbolise Pritz's ambitions of expanding 'without a limit in four directions,' according to the company's representative. The girl group from the South Korean capital Seoul wore the armband outfits on November 2, but had sung the same song at an event on October 25 without them. The group pictured during their performance wearing the offending armbands. The group's managers said any similarities to Nazi insignia were not deliberate . One social media user pointed out that Pritz's insignia more closely resembled that of Hungary's defunct Arrow Cross Party, a political group active in the 1930s and 1940s, with a fascist, ultra-nationalist, and militantly anti-Semitic philosophy. But whether Hungarian or German Nazis, most agreed it was a PR stunt that had gone badly wrong. Pritz debuted in April 2014 with an anime-themed song, 'Go Girls!' The group is modelled after Japanese idol groups and has four members, Hana, Yuna, Ari, and Shua, all aged between 18 and 23-years-old.","Korean group Pritz wore the armbands during a November 2 performance .

"A cancer patient's dying wish was granted recently when his discharge from the Marines was changed from 'undesirable' to 'honorable' after being kicked out in 1956 for being gay. Since 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was repealed in 2011, an estimated 114,000 former-soldiers who were discharged from the military for homosexuality are eligible to have their records corrected. When 79-year-old Hal Faulkner was diagnosed with terminal cancer a year ago, he applied for an honorable discharge but still didn't know if he would live to see the day it was changed. Celebrated service: Hal Faulkner (sitting) was recently awarded an honorable discharge from the Marines at a ceremony in his apartment building. The dying Marine was kicked out of the service in 1956 for being gay . Proud to be a Marine: Mr Faulkner served three years in the Marines before being kicked out at the age of 22. Above, photos from his military days. Receiving an award (left) and taking books to a comrade in the hospital (right) That's when activist group OutServe-SLDN stepped in. They got Mr Faulkner New York lawyer Anne Brooksher-Yen to represent his case pro bono and the military expedited his request in just two weeks, instead of the normal six weeks to six months. At a recent ceremony held in his apartment building, two Marines in uniform came to congratulate Mr Faulker and hand him his new discharge papers. 'I don't have much longer to live,' he said as he fought back tears, 'but I shall always remember it.' Mr Faulkner was kicked out of the military when he was 22, after three years of service. A fellow soldier whom Mr Faulkner had spent off-duty time with had informed his commanding officer that Hal was gay and the officer believed it and processed the discharge. But the discharge didn't stop Mr Faulkner from going on to have a successful career, at one point helping to construct Walt Disney World. Welcomed back: Mr Faulkner was given a cap and the letter was read to him during the recent ceremony . It did, however, keep him in the closet for many years and he still attributes his later success to hiding his sexuality. 'I wouldn't be here today. I'd probably be on the street,' he told the New York Times. Mr Faulkner finally came out to his family in 2005 when he attended a wedding with Charles, his partner of more than 20 years who has since passed away. 'He's been carrying this societal shame with him all these years,' his niece Michelle Clark said. 'We as a family had no idea the pain he had inside him.' Fred Sainz of the Human Rights Campaign was on hand for the ceremony and hopes Mr Faulkner's case will lead others to get their records changed. Movement: Fred Sainz of the Human Rights Campaign hopes Mr Faulkner's story will inspire others to go back and change their discharges . 'What happened today is that a dying man, his dignity was restored,' Mr Sainz told NPR. 'He will die here knowing that he served his country honorably. You certainly can't right the wrong of six decades, [but] you can make it right going forward. And that's what happened today, and that's what we hope will come to thousands of Americans similarly situated.' The hundreds of thousands undesirably discharged from the military will also be eligible for benefits like VA health care or home loans with an honorable discharge, but that was never the point of the change for Mr Faulkner his lawyer said. 'It was really overwhleming seeing Hall finally have his wrong righted,' she said. 'He is such a wonderful loving man, and he served with honor in the military and it was so important to him.'","A fellow soldier told Hal Faulkner's commanding officer that he was gay and had him discharged .

In 2012, roughly 200,000 Britons saw the capital gains tax on the sale of their second homes rise from 19 per cent to 34.5 per cent. The tax on rental income increased from 20 per cent to 34.5 per cent. This was as a result of a 15.5 per cent 'social charge' that Francois Hollande's government imposed in a bid to raise some £200million a year. But there is a case that has been brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union whose decision might put an end to these 'social charges' on Britons' holiday homes. It is based on European regulation that states an individual should only be subject to the social security legislation of one member state. The court has previously said that an individual should only pay social contributions levied on their income in one country. Now it must decide whether the same rules apply to social contributions imposed on assets, such as second homes. The European Commission has already ruled that it considers extending these French 'social charges'  to non-residents to be against EU law. And, in an opinion released last month, Eleanor Sharpston, the Court of Justice's Advocat General, stated that she agreed with the ruling. Now a number of legal experts have stated that they think it likely the Court will follow Ms Sharpston's opinion. David Anderson, a British-based cross-border tax adviser, stated in an online post: 'It seems very likely the European Court when it makes its final decision shortly (before end 2014) will take this view as the Advocate General is very clear in her opinion.' Holiday home: The decision could force the country to pay back more than £396million to EU residents who sold or rented their second homes in France in the last three years. (File image) If this conclusion is reached, then Britons who have paid the additional 'social charge' on a sale of a French property should be able to reclaim past payments. The same principle should apply to charges paid on rental income. But a French law passed in 2013 means that taxpayers only one year - starting from the end of the year that the social charge was paid - to claim the money. As a result, the period to reclaim on any social contribution paid on a property sold in 2013 expires on 31 December this year. Britons who rented out properties in 2012 will have until the end of the year to make a claim. However, British based law firm Wragge, Lawrence Graham & Co stressed that the rules are not entirely clear and said their might be room for the law to be interpreted more favourably.","Britons pay 15.5% 'social charge' when renting and selling holiday homes .

"George Osborne will announce an extra £1billion in NHS funding next week to avert a potential winter crisis, government sources say. The Chancellor is expected to use his Autumn Statement to pledge the extra money, as hospital admissions soar. Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb has suggested extra health funding for England must be found before the general election to prevent a ‘crash’ in services. George Osborne will announce the funding in order to avert a potential winter crisis, government sources say, as A&E departments warn they are at breaking point  with attendance up 5 per cent on last year (file) Several A&E departments have already warned they are at crisis point as the number of patients attending has risen, with many visiting because they cannot get an appointment with their GP. Attendances are on average 5 per cent higher compared with this time last year. Last week also saw 108,301 patients admitted for emergency treatment in England – the highest figure ever recorded. Units in Scunthorpe, Middlesbrough, Wigan, the Wirral and King’s Lynn in Norfolk have had to advise patients in recent weeks not to attend hospital with minor complaints. And senior doctors have warned that if there is a particularly cold winter the NHS could fail to cope. Dr Chris Moulton, vice president of the College of Emergency Medicine, has expressed particular concern about the length of time patients are having to wait to be seen by a doctor. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted he had taken his own children to A&E because he feared it would take too long to get an appointment with a GP. A total of 108,301 patients were last week admitted for emergency treatment in England - the highest figure ever recorded - with medical chiefs saying it is because the public cannot get a GP appointment (file photo) There are also fears some patients are being discharged from hospital too soon in an effort to free up beds, leading to return visits. At the same time, ‘bed-blocking’ is becoming an increasing problem. Figures released by NHS England yesterday said that in October, 96,564 ‘bed days’ were wasted on patients who should have been discharged – a rise of around 20 per cent on a year ago. Overdue assessments, long waits for social care plans and funding disputes were behind some of the delays. Richard Murray, director of policy at health think-tank the King’s Fund, said: ‘If you look at where A&E performance in November was back in 2009 and 2010, we are probably already in a winter crisis. ‘Performance against the four-hour [A&E waiting time] target has already dipped well below where you’d expect it to be, with some hospitals failing to meet it and some missing the target by a long way.’ Labour announced an extra £2.5billion a year in NHS funding at its party conference, to be paid for through a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and a crackdown on tax avoidance. But it later emerged that the money would not start trickling into NHS coffers until the middle of the next Parliament. Conservative and Lib Dem MPs have accused Labour of ‘hypocritical posturing’ over the health service. One Tory source said Labour appeared to be cynically ‘hoping for’ a winter crisis, thinking it could help the party’s chances at next year’s general election. A spokesman for the Department of Health said it had already committed an extra £700million for thousands more doctors, nurses and beds this winter.","Funds needed to avert a potential winter crisis, government sources say .

"Clubbers are being warned of the risk of overdosing on 'super strength' ecstasy, as tests reveal the drug's purity is at its highest level for ten years. Tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of MDMA contained in the party drug. In one case, the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two-and-a-half times the standard MDMA dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill. Scroll down for video . Tests carried out on drugs which were seized this summer show the purity of ecstasy is at its highest level for ten years (stock image) It comes after the number of deaths caused by ecstasy soared from eight in 2010 up to 43 in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. The perceived rise in purity has prompted the Warehouse Project in Manchester (WHP), one of the biggest clubs in the country, to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue. Sacha Lord, director of WHP, said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so, potentially sparking fatal consequences. While the club says it does not condone drug-taking, it has started warning about 'very high purity' drugs in circulation on its Twitter feed. Nick Bonnie, 30, died after unknowingly taking almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before visiting the Warehouse Project, Manchester . Mr Lord told the Guardian: 'I would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much.' Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, who regularly tests drugs, says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of MDMA. In 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20-30mg. An 'acceptable' dose for an average-sized adult during one drug-taking session is 70-75mg, she says. Ms Measham said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug. Last year, WHP started warning customers of the dangers of PMA, a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of MDMA. Though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in September, about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on-site paramedics, mostly for drug-related issues. In an inquest earlier this month, the court heard how Prince's Trust worker Nick Bonnie, 30, died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning. He unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before entering the club, the coroner ruled. Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. Anne-Marie Cockburn has called for a change to UK drug policy, after her daughter Martha Fernback died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure. The average is around 58 per cent . Earlier this year, Anne-Marie Cockburn, the mother of 15-year-old Martha Fernback, who died in 2013, called for drugs to be legalised. Martha, from Oxford, had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure. The average street purity is 58 per cent. Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation. The Warehouse Project in Manchester (pictured) has started warning clubbers about the increased purity of ecstasy tablets . 'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford. He said: 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, ecstasy or MDMA. 'What is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is. So, as I say, this is a very stark warning of what can happen.'","Tests over the summer show purity of ecstasy is at its highest for ten years .

"Online music streaming through sites like Spotify now account for at least 10 per cent of record industry revenue . The rise of downloads and streaming means that digital music now accounts for half of record industry income in the UK for the first time, according to new figures. Digital revenue increased by 11.9 per cent last year on the back of strong album downloads, with streaming income also rising by 41 per cent, a report by music industry body the BPI has found. Despite the positive digital figures, revenue from sales of CDs and music videos continued to decline - dropping by 6.4 per cent in 2013 to stand at £365.4million. The digital sales mean the UK music industry saw an overall 1.9 per cent increase in its income - the first growth in four years - taking it to £730.4 million last year, up from £716.8 million in 2012. Hit albums such as Bastille's debut Bad Blood - the biggest selling digital artist album of 2013 - helped the income from download albums to grow by 19.5 per cent. The trend for luxury digital packages also contributed to the boost, although sales of download singles slipped by 4.4 per cent. But the rise of streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer offset any drop and represented the fastest growing area, with revenues growing by 41 per cent and generating £77million. Digital income accounted for a milestone 50 per cent of UK record industry sales revenue.

PC Boulton was suspended after he was filmed telling a young woman: 'I will knock you clean f***ing out' but has returned to his duties after escaping with just a written warning . Nikki Wright, 22, was threatened by the police officer after a night out in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in July . Mr Smith then asks a second time: 'You said you'd knock her out?' PC Boulton is then clearly heard to say: 'Yeah, yeah. If she tries to throw a punch at me, of course I would.' Mr Smith recorded his collar number - 4595 - and posted the video on Facebook where it was viewed by more than 800 people. Staffordshire Police suspended the officer from his duties after the row erupted outside a bar on Trinity Street on July 20 this year. But now, PC Boulton has been allowed to return to work after he was handed a written warning. His duties will also be supervised after Staffordshire Police carried out an investigation into the incident. The force found he used threatening language towards Miss Wright but threw out two complaints which included two allegations of assault and one that the officer lied. Chief Superintendent Martin Evans, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'The comments made by PC Boulton were not acceptable and below the standards expected of an officer. 'We concluded that the circumstances of the upheld complaint did not constitute grounds for dismissal and were suitable to be dealt with via a misconduct meeting.

He has returned to work and his conduct will be closely monitored by supervision. 'We expect our officers to provide the highest standards of professionalism at all times. If an officer's behaviour falls below the standards expected we would encourage it be reported so we can scrupulously investigate.' Staffordshire Police and Crime Panel member, Joy Garner, also backed the decision, calling the ruling the 'right result'. She added: 'We don't know what the officer had been doing leading up to the event. 'It's right and proper that he's been dealt with because speaking to the public in that way is wrong. 'It's so unusual for one of our officers to behave in this way - I hope a line can be drawn under it all.' Today, Miss Wright blasted the decision to let PC Boulton off with 'a slap on the wrist' She said: 'All I asked for was a hand written letter of apology but instead I got a photocopied printed letter through the post making excuses. 'He basically got off with a slap on the wrist. 'The letter, which I got in October, said: ""I regret the words I said to you and these are very much out of character and in the heat of the moment. ''I can only apologise for the words I used, they are clearly not what is expected of a police officer, but we are all still human and after a particularly stressful 11-hour shift this reaction was very much human. ''Once again I apologise for the words I used, I hope that you accept this.'' Speaking after the incident, she had said she was 'terrified' when the officer verbally abused her. She added: 'I am just a little lass and was genuinely terrified I was going to be hurt when this big officer came and threatened me. 'You can hear in the video how panicked I am and that I'm close to tears.

'If it had been the other way around and I had said that to him then I think I would have been arrested. 'I was so shocked. I have never been in trouble with the police before and I'm a law abiding person. How can a police officer be allowed to get away with this?'

"More than 100 patients of a millionaire dentist accused of putting lives at risk from HIV or hepatitis by failing to sterilise equipment are planning to sue him – and could receive payouts of up to £20,000. Their lawyers say Desmond D’Mello, 60, ran an ‘NHS dental factory’, seeing so many patients to boost his earnings that some had shoddy treatment including undiagnosed gum disease and botched surgery. D’Mello was suspended in June after he was filmed breaking hygiene rules at his Nottinghamshire practice. In three days, he saw 166 patients – 40 in one morning. Dentist Desmond D'Mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his Nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period . Health chiefs have urged 22,000 patients to be tested for blood diseases. Police are already investigating the death of Amy Duffield, 23, days after he gave her a check-up. Chris Dean, of the Dental Law Partnership, which is handling the claims, said: ‘It’s inconceivable that you could see 166 patients over a three-day period and give them all a reasonably satisfactory service.’ The Dental Defence Union, which operates D’Mello’s indemnity scheme, said last night the dentist could not comment because of patient confidentiality. A spokesman for NHS England said all 166 patients filmed being treated by Mr D'Mello have been contacted. It has emerged Mr D'Mello raked in around £1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He sold his Georgian mansion on the outskirts of Nottingham for £1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury Nottingham flat, pictured . He said an alert was sent to GPs and dentists in the area with guidance on how to advise patients who might contact them. A dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support. Anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. NHS England has also set up a temporary Community Clinic for patients, to provide further advice, counselling, and where necessary blood testing. Patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, at the Arnold Health Centre, located at Highcroft Medical Centre on High Street in Arnold, Nottingham. Anyone who lives outside the area, or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening. That alert was sent to all GP surgeries and dentists across the UK, to ensure patients who have moved away from the Nottingham area can still seek help. He added: 'NHS 111 and the NHS Customer Contact Centre have been briefed, as have NHS Choices who have placed information on their website. 'Other NHS organisations, including CCGs and acute trusts, have been notified in order to direct patients to the correct place should they present with concerns.' Detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient Amy Duffield is linked to dental treatments she received. Last week it emerged Mr D'Mello could have earned up to £1,000 a day, fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle. The 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished Georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars, including a Mercedes, a Porsche and a Ferrari, with personalised number plates. The impressive Georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds. It features seven bedrooms, three reception rooms and a study, garages for three cars, a tennis court, pond, wood, meadow and secret garden. It is built on land formerly owned by the Seely family, renowned landowners in Nottinghamshire. He sold the £1.5million grade two listed property, Ramsdale Farm, on the outskirts of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of Nottingham. Nottinghamshire Police are making enquiries into the death of Amy Duffield, 23, a patient of Mr D'Mello who died unexpectedly last year .

"The BBC has been accused of cruelty for using wild animals in a new  drama. Our Zoo tells the true story of Chester Zoo, which pioneered a freer approach to animal captivity. But just days before it screens nationwide, a coalition of animal rights groups have launched a bitter campaign against the show's 'cruel' use of wild animals as actors, calling it 'a shocking use of public money'. Under fire: Animal rights activists have blasted the BBC for using wild animals in its new drama Our Zoo . 'Outdated': Campaigners have blasted the Corporation for 'using public money to fund an outdated practice' It comes a week before Parliament debates banning circuses in England - a motion supported by 95 per cent of people surveyed in the Government consultation. Liz Tyson, of the Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS), told MailOnline: 'The use of wild animals in entertainment is both cruel and unnecessary. 'It is shocking that the BBC has used the public's licence fees to fund this outdated practice.' The BBC series, which screens on September 3, follows the journey of George Mottershead who, in 1930, transformed a derelict plot of land into a sanctuary for exotic animals - which is now one of the world's most popular zoos. He had been inspired to create a zoo 'without bars' after witnessing caged animals at a zoo in Manchester. The estate today covers a total of 500 acres, of which the zoo takes up 110. Recreating George's journey, Our Zoo features penguins, monkeys, a camel, and bears. However, it has emerged the animal actors were scouted from scandal-hit firm Amazing Animals, which was exposed for sending lion cubs born in the West Midlands to a Japanese performing circus. Animals: The show feature monkeys, snakes, penguins, a camels and bears from scandal-hit Amazing Animals . It comes after Amazing Animals was blasted for providing lion cubs to a Japanese performing circus . The firm became embroiled in a fresh scandal last week for providing wild bear cubs as entertainment for a quaint country fair in Oxfordshire. Now, CAPS has launched a petition with Wild Futures and Born Free Foundation calling on the BBC Trust for an urgent review of its use of performing animals in productions with a view to ending the hiring of such companies going forward. Ms Tyson, who has built a petition with two other animal rights' groups rallying against Amazing Animals, told MailOnline: 'Domesticated animals like cats and dogs have gone through genetic changes via the process of domestication over thousands of years. Wild animals have not. 'These animal entertainment companies often argue that the animals are fourth or fifth generation captive bred and therefore domesticated or no longer wild. 'This is simply not the case. 'A few generations of captive breeding does nothing to change the genetic make-up of these animals.' Rachel Hevesi, director of Wild Futures, added: 'Every monkey that arrives at the Sanctuary has serious psychological, and often physical, problems. Our Zoo tells the story of Chester Zoo, which was the first zoo to give animals free roam . 'This is not caused by deliberate cruelty, but by a lack of understanding of the needs of a wild animal.' Adam Roberts, acting CEO of the Born Free Foundation, said: 'The BBC has a global reputation for quality programming. If it wishes to retain that reputation it must move with the times and adapt to changing attitudes. 'The use of captive wild animals for entertainment is now widely regarded as unethical among the British public, and we are convinced that a lifetime of training, transport, and performance puts the welfare of the animals at significant risk.' The charities have established an online petition and are encouraging members of the public to join the call for action. A spokesperson from the show said: 'Our Zoo consulted with the RSCPA Performing Animals Advisory Service and followed their guidelines at all times. An independent vet was on set whenever animals were filmed and they filed a report at the end of the working day. There were no incidents during filming.'","Our Zoo tells story of Chester Zoo and its creator who vowed to ban cages .

"An incredible video has emerged  of an ox being rescued from a manhole in China's Jiangxi Province. A local farmer identified as Mr Deng found the ox stuck down the manhole a day after it went missing from his farm. As soon as he recognised it, he crawled into the opening in the ground to attempt to corral the animal with a rope. The ox's owner, a farmer called Mr Deng, recognised the animal, who had run away from his farm a day earlier . Incredible footage has emerged of an ox being rescued after falling into a manhole in China . Unfortunately, when a fire crew arrived to perform the rescue, they were unable to lift the 450lb animal out of the hole on their own. Thankfully, eight workers from a nearby construction site volunteered their assistance. A group of eight construction workers assisted the ox's owner in hoisting him out to safety . The group of men worked together to free the struggling animal . Within seconds, the ox regained his strength and quickly dashed away from the group of men . Once Mr Deng managed to hook the rope around the ox’s body, the construction workers began to hoist the large animal out of the hole. Though the ox initially put up a fight, he soon gave up his struggle and allowed the determined men to lift him to safety. Moments after the ox was freed, he jumped to his feet and ran away from his rescuers.","Ox was rescued after falling into a manhole in Jiangxi Province .

"U2 star Adam Clayton’s former personal assistant has been found guilty of embezzling £2.2 million from him to fund a lavish lifestyle. Carol Hawkins was convicted on 181 counts of theft from the bassist’s bank accounts over a four-year period. Clayton walked in to the courtroom as the jury at the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin returned an unanimous verdict on each individual count. Relieved: U2 bass guitarist Adam Clayton talks to the media after his former personal assistant was found guilty of embezzling £2.2 million from him . Swindle: Adam Clayton, right, saw his money spent on 22 horses for his former PA . Jurors had been deliberating for more than five hours. Judge Partick McCartan released 48-year-old Hawkins on bail until sentencing on Friday July 6. He told the jury: 'The evidence in this case was overwhelming. Nobody could seriously disagree with the verdict you have given.' Hawkins showed no emotion as each verdict was delivered, which took almost 25 minutes. She sat in the dock, staring straight ahead and resting her head on her clasped hands. Found out: Carol Hawkins was found guilty on 181 counts of theft . The mother-of-two had gained the musician’s 'absolute trust' for the 17 years she worked for him. She was signatory on two of his bank accounts from which she wrote 181 cheques to deposit it her own account, a joint account with her then husband John Hawkins and a credit card account. Her deception emerged in 2008 when . she confessed to booking herself between £10,500 and £12,100 worth of . flights on his account to visit her children in the US and London. Investigations . later revealed that thousands of pounds had been spent on exotic . holidays and in designer boutiques in New York, such as Roberto Cavalli.

"These new pictures show the RAF's next-generation F-35B fighter, bristling with fearsome state-of-the-art weaponry. However, the deadly-looking weapons are actually trial or 'dummy' ordnance, which are identical in fit and form to their lethal counterparts but incapable of causing damage. A UK test team including personnel from BAE Systems, has successfully completed initial aircraft handling trials for ASRAAM and Paveway IV weapons on the F-35B Lightning II aircraft at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, United States. The 'weapons' were tested on the Short Take-off Vertical Landing (STOVL) F-35B for the first time during a series of flights from the US Navy's test facility. Scroll down for video . Two F-35B STOVL aircraft, flown by Billie Flynn, Lockheed Martin's F-35 test pilot and Squadron Leader Andy Edgell from the RAF, completed 9 flights with ASRAAM missiles and  Paveway IV laser guided bombs. The flights involved different configurations of both weapons types on the aircraft . The 'weapons' were tested on the Short Take-off Vertical Landing (STOVL) F-35B for the first time during a series of flights from the US Navy's test facility . The initial tests are an important step in integrating weapons onto the F-35B, allowing test pilots to understand how they affect the way the aircraft performs and handles. The planes feature short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) technology and the latest stealth and intelligence surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) technology. The RAF already uses ASRAAM air-to-air missiles and Paveway IV - a 500lb weapon capable of taking out a small compound - on its existing combat air fleet. The successful tests are a step towards full integration between the current and future fast jets that will be used by the RAF and the UK's Royal Navy from 2018.

The successful tests are a step towards full integration between the current and future fast jets that will be used by the RAF and the UK's Royal Navy from 2018 . The successful tests will be followed by the next stage of weapons testing due to take place in early 2015. These tests will involve weapon separation and then guided releases of both ASRAAM and Paveway IV from the aircraft. BAE Systems' lead test pilot for F-35, Pete 'Wizzer' Wilson, said: 'The team at Patuxent River has got over two thousand hours of flying under their belts for the F-35B variant and the handling and performance of the aircraft has shone through throughout. These latest trials were no exception and help us to move confidently into the next phase of weapons testing.' J.D. McFarlan, Lockheed Martin's vice president for F-35 test & verification from the Joint Strike Fighter programme added: 'These trials show the truly international nature of the F-35 enterprise - being led out of a U.S. Navy facility, involving a joint UK Ministry of Defence and industry team, working alongside the U.S. Department of Defence and Lockheed Martin. 'And the test results for one partner will benefit all, further demonstrating the versatility and capability of the F-35 as a multi-role platform.' The aircraft were equipped with 'dummy' Paveway IV 500lb laser guided bombs. File picture . Deadly effect: An explosion after a Paveway bomb strike on a Libyan warship launched from an RAF Tornado in 2011 . Britain on Monday announced it had signed a contract with US manufacturer Lockheed Martin to buy the first of 14 F-35B combat jets. The four Lightning II stealth combat aircraft will operate from both of the Royal Navy's forthcoming new aircraft carriers and from Royal Air Force land bases, with another 10 due to be ordered over the next five years. Aircrew: One . Max speed: 1.6Mach (1,217.3mph) Length: 51ft . Wingspan: 35ft . Max. altitude: 50,000ft . The first batch is expected to be delivered in 2016 and will take up station in 2018. 'The investment we are making in the F-35 aircraft will ensure we are securing the skies for decades to come, providing the UK with the latest stealth technology and multi-role aircraft capability,' said Philip Dunne, minister for defence equipment support and technology. The British government has long planned to provide its air and naval forces with F-35Bs and signed an agreement in principle to buy the four jets last month. The F-35 should have appeared at this year's Farnborough International Airshow near London, but was grounded by technical problems and could not cross the Atlantic Ocean. Britain's navy is currently without an aircraft carrier but a new carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is due to go into service in 2020 with another, HMS Prince of Wales, to follow.","Despite their lethal apearance, the weapons on the F-35B are 'dummies' used for testing .

She told The Sun: 'I feel I should've done more that night she went missing. I was the big sister and I normally stayed with her on a Monday night.' Jazmin recalled how she went to meet April and their mother at a local leisure centre and helped her sister get changed. They then all met up in a cafe. The teenager then left to meet friends at a youth centre. The last words she said to her little sister were 'I love you'. Just hours later she received a call from her panic-stricken mother Carol who was crying: 'She's gone, she's gone'. Remorseless: Bridger has never admitted April's murder and will remain behind bars for the rest of his life . Bridger, 49, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth that night. He is believed to have lured the child into his Land Rover before driving her away. The former abattoir worker is thought to have killed the girl inside his rented cottage after he snatched her from outside her family’s home. Traces of her blood and fragments of a child’s skull were discovered inside the cottage, despite Bridger’s desperate attempts to clean up. He is then thought to have dumped her body, which has never been found despite a huge search operation – and he remains the only person who knows what happened inside the house or where her remains are hidden. During his trial, Bridger claimed he knocked her over in his Land Rover and then ‘forgot’ what he did with her body.

"Steven Higginson, 33, was stabbed outside a primary school in Salford as he waited to collect three of his children . A 30-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a father-of-six was repeatedly stabbed outside a primary school while waiting to collect his children. The man, named locally as 33-year-old Steven Higginson, was knifed in the chest after a scuffle broke out outside North Walkden Primary School in Salford, Greater Manchester, at 3.30pm yesterday. The incident took place in front of shocked family and friends as Mr Higginson was waiting outside the school gates to collect three of his young children. Despite being covered in blood, Mr Higginson managed to stagger into the school to get help and was rushed to Manchester Royal Infirmary. He has since been discharged. Earlier, Greater Manchester Police appealed for a man and woman, who they believed were involved in the attack, to come forward. They believe the couple, who made off from the scene in a silver Vauxhall Corsa, are known to the victim and that yesterday's attack was part of an 'ongoing dispute'. This afternoon, Detective Inspector Ben Hart urged the man to hand himself in to police. He said: 'We have an arrest but we are still looking for a man in connection with the incident. 'I would appeal directly to this person to hand himself in. You know who you are and you know we are onto you. 'We will not stop looking until you are in custody so I would advise you make it easier on yourself and hand yourself in to the nearest police station.' Yesterday, brother-in-law David Quinn, 27, told the Manchester Evening News how the incident broke out when he had gone with Mr Cunningham to pick up the children. Mr Quinn said the stabbing took place over 'something which had been going on a couple of months'. He said: 'I'd gone inside the school and he was waiting in the car round the corner. 'When I came back he was stood there by the car holding his chest and saying ""I've been stabbed, I've been stabbed"". We went into the school straight away and phoned an ambulance. 'He looked pale and in a bad way and they took him to MRI. We know who did it. It was over something which had been going on a couple of months, there'd been a lot of talk back and forth. Forensic officers were last night investigating after the father-of-six was repeatedly stabbed during the fight . A 30-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the incident yesterday . 'There was a lot of people around and I'd ask anyone who say anything or has any information to speak to the police if they haven't already.' One parent who witnessed the incident added that had had seen two men 'wrestling' over a car. He described how he rushed over to help the victim and dragged the male attacker away. Another witness said the attacked had Mr Higginson on the car bonnet and stabbed him 'near his heart'. Reports say the injuries were caused using a small lock knife with holes in the blade. Bernard Pennington, the school's chair of governors, said: 'It makes me very sad and also very sad to think that somebody could do something like this is front of a group of children. 'I hope the school won't be associated with what happened because the school is a good school and the parents are good parents. 'This is a one-off which we hope will never be repeated.' The incident took place outside North Walkden Primary School (pictured) in front of shocked parents and their children (file picture) Detective Inspector Ben Hart, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: 'Obviously at that time of the day, there would have been a number of parents picking up their children. 'A lot of people would have witnessed what happened which would have been very distressing. 'We now understand the victim, the man and woman are all known to each other. We believe there has been an ongoing dispute which has erupted into violence outside the primary school. 'The nature of this attack is appalling and I would like to reassure the children, parents and local residents that this appears to be an incident between people who were known to each other already and not a random attack. 'There is no suggestion from the inquiries undertaken so far that any children were directly at risk during the attack. 'We are now working closely with the school to make sure that all necessary measures are taken to support a return to normality for the children on Monday. 'I would like to appeal for anyone with information to come forward and make contact with us if they have seen any part of these events taking place. 'We are now making extensive inquiries to trace the two parties who attacked the victim and I would like to appeal directly to them to make contact with me as soon as possible.' North Walkden Primary School has 200 pupils,  with nursery and reception children and classes up to Year 6. It was rated 'good' by Ofsted in a report in October 2013, improving from a 'satisfactory' rating from previous inspection.

The officers, who have not been named, are under investigation after footage of the incident emerged. Photographs of the men alleged to have been involved with bloodied lips and scruffy clothes were published as it was claimed they were forced to spend £1,000 to be let out of jail. Seven Metropolitan Police officers were arrested in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius (pictured) for fighting in the street while on a stag party . A spokesman for Metropolitan Police said investigations were underway but that it was too early to say whether the men will face disciplinary action. Footage obtained by the Sun shows the men being dragged away by Lithuanian authorities outside a nightclub. A local prosecutor later told the newspaper he granted them bail so they could return to the UK. It is not known whether the men will face charges yet. 'I personally gave them bail after they paid 5,000 Lithuanian Lita which is about £1,000,' said Marius Zupkauskas. 'If we decide to charge them they will have to return to Lithuania for a trial.'

"Fled: Paul Meekin (above) was the subject of a police investigation in India, where he was a teacher . A British teacher who once claimed he taught Daniel Radcliffe has reportedly left India, where police were investigating him over child  abuse allegations. Paul Meekin, 40, was the principal of Trio World School in Bangalore when he was accused of sending lewd messages online to a 13-year-old boy in January 2012. Now it is claimed he has moved to Kuwait and taken a job teaching social studies at an international school. The report in the Daily Mirror claims he took the job at an English-Arabic bilingual school a few weeks ago and may have shaved off his beard. Meekin made widespread headlines in India in 2012 when he was arrested while leading the £1,400-a-year Trio international school, which teaches international GCSEs and A-Levels to English-speaking pupils. Just three months earlier Meekin had laid on an English high tea and a tour of the school for Ian Felton, the British Deputy High Commissioner in Bangalore. Meekin was accused of sending lewd messages to a boy online, and police  filed charges against him under India's Juvenile Justice Act and Information Technology Act, according to a report at the time by the Mail's India edition Mail Today. He was later reported to police by his school amid claims he had 'fabricated certificates' related to his academic qualifications when he took the job in 2010. A police spokesman told Mail Today at the time: 'We have seized his passport and are trying to obtain his real name and address.' According to other reports in Indian media, he was released on bail last year while he awaited trial on the charges which related to his alleged lewd messages. Earlier this year Indian media claimed he had missed a magistrates' court hearing and his whereabouts were unknown. Fame: Meekin reportedly told the Times of India he had taught Daniel Radcliffe (right) before he was famous. The claim, which refers to the child star's time at primary school before the Harry Potter films, is unverified . School: Meekin was the principal of the Trio World School in Bangalore when the scandal emerged in 2012 . Three years ago Meekin is said to have claimed he had  taught Daniel Radcliffe at a London primary school before he gained his starring role in the Harry Potter films. In an interview with the Times of India, he was quoted as saying: 'I taught him science, but was a temporary teacher and taught only for a short while. 'I remember him as a very happy kid, sitting in one of those middle rows, third from the back. But he was not regular to classes because he was already into acting. 'I did not even recognise him when I watched the first movie of the series. Children change a lot, you need to look into their eyes to recognise them. It was much later that I recognised him by his name and said, ""Oh it's that boy"".' It is not clear whether Meekin did ever teach the child star. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman declined to comment.","Paul Meekin, 40, was principal of Trio World School in Bangalore, India .

"Paramedics have been told to ring ahead before taking patients to an A&E struggling to cope after the closure of departments at two nearby hospitals. In the latest blow for health bosses who claimed their massive hospital reorganisation programme would improve care, the London Ambulance Service has put out the warning over patients being taken to Northwick Park in Harrow. Two weeks ago, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the same hospital was experiencing the longest waits in the country following the closure of casualty units at West London’s Central Middlesex and Hammersmith hospitals. Scroll down for video . The London Ambulance Service put the 'call ahead' arrangement in place at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, London, following the closure of two casualty departments in nearby hospitals (file photo) Paramedics would usually take patients to the nearest department, but this is no longer necessarily the case at Northwick Park. A spokesman for London Ambulance Service confirmed the ‘call ahead’ arrangement was now in place, saying: ‘We are working with the hospital, so before crews go directly to Northwick Park, they need to call our control room. They are then advised if that is appropriate.’ It is the only London hospital with such an arrangement. According to official guidelines, ambulances should have to wait no more than 15 minutes outside A&Es to drop off patients, but at a meeting last week, Northwick Park executives admitted this was exceeded hundreds of times at the site in September alone. Crews had to wait because there was either no room in A&E to take the patients, or there were no staff free to care for them. The waiting not only affects patients already in the ambulances, but also ties up crews urgently needed elsewhere. The Mail on Sunday has revealed that Northwick Park has been experiencing the longest waits in the country . In September, ambulances had to wait outside Northwick Park for more than half an hour on 179 occasions. Of those, 30 patients had to wait more than an hour. Brent Council leader Muhammed Butt said his worst fears about the effects of closing local A&Es were coming true. ‘Immediate action needs to be taken to resolve this as we are talking about life-and-death emergency treatment. Our residents deserve the best healthcare and we need to understand why the reconfiguration of local health services has been botched so badly.’ The Mail on Sunday has campaigned for two years to keep A&Es open nationwide, pointing out the problems that health bosses frequently gloss over. Meanwhile, more than 20 health chiefs from West London have just flown to the United States on a week-long ‘fact-finding’ mission – at a cost of more than £5,000 a head. The taxpayer-funded trip to New York, Boston, Richmond and Baltimore began yesterday, with 22 officials due to visit ‘innovative organisations renowned for excellent community care and partnership models’, according to an official briefing. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, said: ‘People will see it as extraordinary that during an A&E crisis, senior management are jetting off on a jolly.’","London Ambulance Service made warning over struggling emergency unit .

"She is the woman accused of dumping her day-old baby down a drain and leaving him to die. But the 30-year-old is also a loving auntie who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in Australia and Samoa, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. One of her social media accounts - filled with pictures of babies and young relatives - suggests that she became increasingly clucky as her pregnancy progressed. It is a stark contrast with the savage act with which she is charged, the attempted murder of her baby boy, who miraculously survived five days in a concrete stormwater drain off a Sydney motorway. Scroll down for video . Tragic mother: This is the 30-year-old Samoan woman who has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly dumping her day old baby son in a drain in western Sydney, where he lay for five days . Increasingly clucky; As her secret pregnancy drew close to term the Sydney woman (pictured) became obsessed with babies and in one photo of herself with a relative's newborn she posted 'Awww, mine' Baby in a drain: The five day old baby boy (left) who miraculously survived after being dumped down this drain (right) by his mother on the day of his birth during hot Spring conditions in western Sydney . And the woman, the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, appears to have another son - a five-year-old who lives in New Zealand. Postings on social media in the days after she dumped her son, but before the baby was found and alleged crime was detected, show her posing and looking pretty in a dress but also experiencing post-natal tiredness. A family friend has told Daily Mail Australia that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western Sydney - 'loves children and is very good with children'. Secrets and lies: The Samoan woman (pictured) who allegedly attempted to kill her newborn son kept her pregnancy a secret, but could not contain her mounting obsession with babies as her came closer to giving birth herself. She will appear in court on December 10 by video link from a Sydney women's prison . Distraught: The Auntie of the woman accused of attempting to kil her own child is comforted on Facebook (above) by relatives and friends who appear distraught and still bewildered at the events . Saved: The moment the baby boy is retrieved by Senior-Constable Mark McAlister from the stormwater drain and handed to paramedics in western Sydney last Sunday, five days after his 30-year-old mother allegedly left him for dead . The one day old baby boy was pushed through the tiny opening of this stormwater drain (pictured) in western Sydney. If recent rains had been about, the newborn might have drowned . According to police, the woman had been living with her aunt and uncle in Quakers Hill in Sydney's west when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months. After giving birth to a healthy baby boy in a western Sydney hospital at 1am on Tuesday of last week, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home. The baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom. The accused woman lived in this Quakers Hill house with her relatives (pictured) during the nine months of her secret pregnancy . Five days later, last Sunday morning, David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard a crying sound coming from a drain as they cycled on the M5 motorway and, thinking it was a kitten, discovered the baby boy miraculously alive. Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain. The drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift, including two police officers who had arrived at the scene. The baby had blood on his head and was taken to hospital where it was found he was severely dehydrated and had bleeding on the brain. Police tracked down the woman and charged her on Sunday evening. The son of the Seventh Day Adventist pastor who leads the church where the woman and her family are members told Daily Mail Australia his father had spoken to her in prison on Wednesday. He said she 'was trying to keep on top of things' while incarcerated in a Sydney jail, believed to be Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. He described her as a 'very happy person' who was 'very good around children and young people at the church'. He said that she is 'a quiet girl' but that 'she's an island girl, so she's got a bit of bite in her' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. He said the reason she hid the pregnancy was less about the church and for 'cultural reasons' to do with the traditional Samoan community, but he believed the father of the child was Samoan and had 'perhaps moved away'. The woman, whose case was heard briefly in Penrith Local Court on Friday,  is expected to appear via audio visual link from jail in December. Relatives of the accused woman (pictured leaving Blacktown Court last week) are distraught and confused about the events leading up to the 30-year-old allegedly dumping her newborn son in a drain . The accused woman's aunt (pictured, left) said she did not know who the father of her niece's baby could be . Court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4-metre deep drain on Tuesday - less than 24 hours after he was born at Blacktown Hospital. 'The accused makes full admissions to putting the baby down the drain knowing it may kill the baby,' court documents claim. The young woman's social media postings reveal friends and family are distraught over the events, and are still unable to come to terms with the attempted murder charge. Her social media account also reveals that in the months leading up to the day the woman secretly gave birth, dumped her newborn son and then was tracked down by police who charged her with attempted murder, the woman posts photo after photo of newborn relatives with loving messages. 'Happy  Eleven Weeks Princess', she has posted with double pictures of an infant dressed in pink. In another post from earlier this year, below a photograph of her with a relative's baby, she says, 'Awww, it's mine'. Another post with photos of the same baby dressed in a singlet and nappy has 'I love you' written with the accused's name next to it. In earlier posts, the young woman's life appears to revolve around her work friends, family and the church. Last year, she posted a happy birthday to her auntie, with whom she was living in Quakers Hill until her arrest, saying 'Happy Birthday to the lady of our house an amazing, aunty, mom, chef ... hero!! Thank God for you [and] may our Good Lord continue to Bless you with many more years to come. Love you loads xox' She is pictured at a relative's wedding in a black dress and carrying a bouquet. The landlord of the house (pictured) where the young Samoan woman lived while hiding her secret pregnancy said he had seen her about three months ago and noticed she had 'put on weight' Chance find: If David Otte and his daughter Hayley (pictured) had not been cycling past the stormwater drain last Sunday morning and heard the baby's cries, the newborn boy may have died and never been found . She posts pictures of herself attending a church concert and also celebrating birthdays with work friends. In a posting in March last year of herself with a young boy she says 'happy 4th birthday to my son' and says 'cant wait to c u again' and 'miss u mate'. On Thursday, Samoan friends put up a poster which said 'Stay Strong and God will be with you' accompanied by the note, 'God be with you Sis'. On Tuesday, the day after the woman made her first court appearance  accused of attempted murderer, a close relative posted on Facebook, 'HEARTBREAKING - feeling sad'. A flurry of responses from friends and relatives in Australia, New Zealand and Samoa included 'Pray Mama, just pray!!' and 'Shocking..... Shocking.... Omg, still can't believe it!!'. The woman, believed to be an aunt of the accued, responded, 'Thanks guys right now i feel so empty i can't eat or sleep ... I'm still crying, sorry I can't help it'. The friends responded: I know but be strong ok, we're here to give you our strength and love so you can do the same for her. Rest your mind, body and heart you're gonna need the strength tomorrow. Love you xx' 'Love u so much [name deleted] we will get through this we have a special family and now is the time when we need each other the most.' The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight two or three months ago. 'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything. 'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.' Now 10 days old, the baby was discharged from Westmead Hospital on Friday. Doctors said the baby was able to survive in the drain because of a lack of rain causing storm water which might have drowned him, along with newborns' natural ability to survive without food or water. A Westmead Children's Hospital spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the baby is in the care of Family And Community Services.

"Warring mobile phone firms could delay the launch of superfast 4G mobile phone networks in the UK. Talks between firms hoping to launch networks are 'in the balance', according to insiders. EE, the newly rebranded firm from Orange and T-Mobile, plans to launch its service within weeks using a number of handsets including Apple's iPhone 5. CEO of EE, Olaf Swantee, said today the firms 4G network will launch on October 30th . Operators are asking Ofcom to bring forward the auction spectrum they need to launch 4G services in the UK, which was due to take place next year. They are also asking for the spectrum needed to be freed up quickly, which is currently scheduled for September 2013. These frequencies are currently in use by Air Traffic Control, analogue . television broadcast and radio waves used for the Olympics and . Paralympics. However, other operators must wait for a Government auction to buy the spectrum needed to launch such service, which offer speeds three time faster than current 3G networks. The move to give EE an advantage has left other operators furious, and threatening legal action. This could see the entire process stalled, meaning no 4G network can be launched until the spectrum auction has been taken place - likely to be at least 12 months away. A source close to the talks said operators were keen to bring the auction forward, and clear the spectrum needed quickly. These frequencies are currently in use for Air Traffic Control, analogue . television broadcast and radio waves used for the Olympics and . Paralympics. 'It’s fair to say that we’re in discussions with the wider industry over 4G spectrum, but this is in an attempt to bring 4G to all UK customers, not to delay the launch of 4G,' said an O2 Spokesperson. 'As a result, we’re talking as a group about the possibility of bringing the auction forward and asking if the frequencies used in the spectrum can be cleared quickly.' Experts say further delays could be devastating for consumers. 'I can understand why the other . networks would complain - it's a pretty compelling reason to jump ship . if you're on another network,' said Will Findlater, the editor of gadget . magazine Stuff. 'Delaying the rollout is not going to be good for consumers in general, and it would be pretty devastating.' The move would also put the UK behind other countries where 4G services have been available for several months. Key issues are believed to include accelerating the long-awaited auction of the 4G spectrum, as well as streamlining the planning system for faster rollout of mobile masts. London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the launch of EE, the UK's first super fast 4G network. however, it could now face legal challenges from rival operators. People close to the talks said they were 'hopeful' the issues could be resolved before the end of a government-brokered month-long standstill agreement that prevents legal action as well as any 4G launch. Any delay could also have a huge impact on government finances next year given the £4bn that could be raised by the auction of 4G spectrum, according to analysts. EE, the UK’s largest mobile network with the Orange and T-Mobile brands, said this month that it wanted to launch 4G in the UK this year, but has been unable to give an exact date due to the talks. It says that it plans to reach 16 UK cities by Christmas and 98 per cent of population by 2014. The talks are also discussing the formation of a company called MitCo that will make sure TV and other services do not interfere with 4G networks, as well as streamlining the process of planning permission  for new masts needed. One person familiar with the talks told the FT there was a threat of 'years of litigation' remaining. In addition to fears legal action could be launched to stop EE's 4G service, there are also concerns that litigation could affect the 4G auction, which is set to take place early next year. Ofcom said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year, with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part. Those applications will then be assessed by Ofcom before the bidding phase starts, likely to be in early 2013. Mobile operators are expected to start rolling out 4G networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013, and to start offering 4G services to consumers later that year, Ofcom added.","Threat of legal action could delay launch of first 4G network, which was expected to launch within weeks .

"A four-year-old girl who was the sole survivor of a plane crash which killed everyone else on board has spoken for the first time, 25 years after the disaster. Cecelia Cichan, 29, became known as the 'miracle child' after she was dug out of the burning wreckage by a rescuer who heard her whimper. Northwest Airlines flight 255 crashed shortly after take-off at an airport in Romulus, Michigan en route to Phoenix, Arizona on August 16, 1987. Some 156 people died, including two on the ground, in what remains one of the deadliest air disasters in U.S. history. Scroll down for video . Miracle: Cecelia Cichan, 29, was four years old when she survived a plane crash in Michigan which killed the other 154 people on board including her parents and six-year-old brother . Sole survivor: Four-year-old Cecelia was dug from the burning wreckage of Flight 255 by a firefighter having suffered a fractured skull, broken leg and collarbone and third-degree burns . Wreckage: Bodies covered with plastic bags lie strewn across the highway where the plane came down in Romulus, Michigan . The young woman has decided to tell her . story as part of a new documentary called Sole Survivor featuring . passengers who lived through plane crashes against all odds. She told film-makers: 'It’s kind of hard not to think about it. When I look in the mirror, I have visual scars.' It was believed that Cecelia survived the crash because her mother shielded her with her own body. Her mother, Paula, father Michael and brother, David, six were among those killed as the family returned from their vacation . The four-year-old suffered serious injuries including a fractured skull, broken leg and collarbone and third-degree burns. She underwent four skin grafts for the burns on her arms and legs. Destruction: A member of the investigations team working on the crash of Northwest Airlines flight 255 looks inside the cockpit two days after the tragedy . Devastating loss: Cecelia was just four when her father Michael, mother Paula and six-year-old brother David were killed in the air disaster . Disaster: The plane, bound for Phoenix, Arizona, crashed shortly after take-off at 8.46pm near Detroit killing everyone but one child on board . Northwest Airlines Flight 255 exploded shortly after taking off at 8.46pm on August 16, 1987. The flight, carrying 154 people, left Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Romulus, Michigan bound for Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. As soon as the plane lifted from the runway, it began to roll from side-to-side and struck a lighting pole. This severed part of the left wing and set jet fuel stored in the wing on fire. The aircraft then tipped violently to the right, causing the wing to tear through the roof of a car rental building. Completely out of control, it crashed into cars on to a nearby highway and broke apart before bursting into flames when it hit an overpass. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the crash was likely caused by  crew’s failure to check the slats and flats on the wings. These work to control speed and angle of take-off. A lack of electrical power was also cited that failed to trigger the warning system that the plane was not properly configured for take-off. Causes for an electrical failure were never found. There was intense global interest in . the little girl, which saw her feature on magazine covers and receive . piles of gifts from strangers. More . than 2,000 presents and 30,000 cards were sent to the University of . Michigan Medical Center but her guardians asked that they be distributed . to local children's hospitals. The family also set up a trust fund . after she received more than $150,000 in donations. Her . uncle Franklin Lumpkin and her aunt Rita, her mother's sister, kept her . sheltered from the attention once she left hospital after seven weeks . of treatment, allowing her to grow up in obscurity in Birmingham, . Alabama. Cecelia, who is now 29 and married, has . never spoken publicly but has a small tattoo of an airplane  on her left . wrist to remind her of a tragedy that she thinks about 'every day'. Cecelia said that she had finally decided to open up about the crash because the film was a group project 'and that’s why I’m willing to get involved and be part of something bigger'. The man who pulled her from wreckage more than 20 years ago, firefighter John Thiede, told the Today show: 'I heard that faint cry a baby doll makes. 'I looked to my right and I could see an arm, kind of bent, coming out of a chair.' It was initially believed that the four-year-old was one of those injured on the ground until her grandfather came forward to identify the little girl by her chipped front tooth. Dr Jai Prasad, the doctor who led the team which cared for the four-year-old, said at the time: 'She understands she has lost her father and her mother, and her brother. 'She understands that she was involved in an accident. 'But she doesn't have any memory of how it happened.' Cecelia has kept in touch with the families of those who died in the 1987 crash - including her rescuer Lieutenant Thiede. He met her for the first time on her wedding day when he watched her walk down the aisle to  become Cecelia Crocker. Never forgotten: Cecelia, 29, says she is reminded of the crash every time she looks in the mirror. She has a tattoo on her wrist in memory . Rescuer: Firefighter John Thiede, pictured at the memorial for Flight 255, pulled four-year-old Cecelia from the burning wreckage. He recently attended her wedding . The firefighter spoke out as part of the documentary, made by Yellow Wing Productions. Lieutenant Thiede said: 'To see her come down the aisle, my heart, I lost it really. Just to see her in person was something.' Sole Survivors tells the story of 13 . others who were the only people left alive in deadly plane crashes - . none of whom have ever spoken publicly. The . 25th anniversary of the Michigan crash will be commemorated by victims' families on Thursday at the memorial site close to where the plane went . down. The black granite memorial was erected in 1994 and stands on a hill above the interstate where the passengers perished. The names of all those who died are inscribed under a dove with a ribbon in its beak, reading: 'Their spirit still lives on.'

"Opposition: Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC (pictured) opposed a Bill of Rights being considered by the £700,000 Commission on a Bill of Rights . A panel set up to examine human rights law in Britain was branded ‘fatally flawed’ last night – after it failed to discuss controversial rulings by Strasbourg judges. The Commission on a Bill of Rights cost £700,000 and took 19 months, but did not look at whether Britain should pull out of the discredited European Court of Human Rights. The commission, filled with lawyers proposed by David Cameron and Nick Clegg, could not even reach a unanimous conclusion on the central question of whether there should be a new British Bill of Rights. Two Lib Dem appointed members – Labour peer Helena Kennedy QC and Lib Dem adviser Philippe Sands QC – opposed such a bill, saying there was nothing wrong with the Human Rights Act. In a damning paper appended to the main report, two Tory panel members, Lord Faulks QC and Jonathan Fisher QC, criticised the Commission’s narrow scope, saying it had been prevented from discussing ‘critically important matters’. They said it had been wrong to prevent the Commission considering either withdrawing from the European Court of Human Rights or ditching the convention on which it bases its decisions. Critics of the court say judicial activism – judges making up the law instead of interpreting it – has resulted in the court ruling on areas such as prisoner votes and equality law that should be matters for Parliament or national courts. The two QCs wrote: ‘Since our appointment as members of the Commission on a Bill of Rights, it has become increasingly clear that a key issue, if not the key issue, has not been adequately considered by the Commission and reflected in the terms of the report.’ ‘As the overview of the Commission’s report makes clear, by virtue of its terms of reference, the Commission has been required to proceed on the assumption that the UK is to remain a member of the Convention,’ they wrote. As a result, the Commission left behind ‘vitally important unfinished business’, they said. The Commission emerged from a Tory manifesto commitment to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights to stop rampant abuse by criminals and terrorists. The Commission on a Bill of Rights cost £700,000 and took 19 months, but did not look at whether Britain should pull out of the discredited European Court of Human Rights (above) But following the coalition with the Lib Dems, this was watered down to a Commission to examine the best way forward. Insiders said the Commission was undermined from the very beginning by the deputy prime minister’s insistence that it only consider how to ‘build on’ the Human  Rights Act. In May, only months after it started deliberating, a senior Tory member, Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, quit claiming it had been rigged by Mr Clegg and then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke. There were also reports that the chairman, Sir Leigh Lewis, threatened to resign. Last night Mr Pinto-Duschinsky said the Commission was like ‘Hamlet without the Prince if you don’t discuss Strasbourg’. ‘I completely agree that it’s artificial to explore a British Bill of Rights in a vacuum because the Strasbourg court currently has the last word on any British decisions,’ he said. ‘Only by withdrawing from the Strasbourg Court will we redeem rights in our own country.’ Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has led opposition in the Commons to votes for prisoners, said: ‘It’s crazy that the one thing they all agreed on was fundamental Strasbourg reform, and yet that was the one thing the Lib Dems vetoed the Commission from even considering.’ The Fisher paper was one of nine separate documents written by panel members and appended to the report to demonstrate differing views. In their minority report, Baroness Kennedy and Professor Sands said the rest of the panel had failed to identify any shortcomings in the current human rights system. And they backed the extension of human rights rules to include ‘socio-economic rights’ such as a right to education and healthcare – but the majority of seven rejected this suggestion. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will now consider the report.","Could not even reach unanimous conclusion on whether there should be new British Bill of Rights .

"They were described as the ‘homes of the future’, with an eco-friendly design that would keep bills low. The 45 super-insulated houses, built with £5.6million of public money, were even held up as a ‘model’ of environmentally-friendly construction. But 18 months after the social housing complex in Bradford was completed, residents have complained of bills that are double what is normal and faulty equipment that was supposed to save them money. Home sweet home: Residents moved into the Pavilion Gardens complex in Bradford with the promise they would get cheaper bills in their eco-friendly houses . 'Super-insulated': The houses are either heated by biomass boilers or air heat pumps and are equipped with solar panels to provide electricity . Council bosses admit there is a . ‘serious problem’ with energy use at the Pavilion Gardens site and . promised to reimburse residents for excessive bills, blaming the . original builder. Resident Danny Hall, 27, a redundant . sales adviser, his wife Jacqueline, 28, and their three children have . had problems ‘from day one’. Rising costs: Danny Hall, pictured, who shares a three bedroom house on the complex with his wife and three children, says he received a £1,600 electricity bill for six months . ‘The houses were supposedly the most . energy efficient in Bradford,’ he said. ‘We weren’t really told what . expected bills would be but with solar panels, heat exhaust and all this . fancy stuff you would expect it to be considerably lower than what we . used to pay.’ Instead the family received a £1,600 bill after six months. Energy bills were almost double what they paid at their previous home, he said. When the family moved in, there was no water in the toilets because the water recycling system had not been activated. When it was turned on, water ‘poured through the light fittings’. The homes are equipped with an . eco-heat exhaust pump that recycles warm air, solar panels, and . rainwater-harvesting systems to cut water bills. Twelve of the homes, . supposedly built to the highest standards for sustainability, are heated . by a communal biomass boiler. Sunny Tanday, 23, a tenant who lives . with wife Raquel, 23, and their two young children, said it was proving . an expensive disaster. He said: ‘We thought it was going to . be our dream house. 'They are lovely houses on a nice street, but they . are not what we expected them to be in terms of power-saving and being . cheap to run. ‘We moved in here to be a family, but . it’s just tearing us apart because the big bills are making us argue all . the time. There are people in the street who already want to move out . because it’s just too expensive.’ The eco-housing complex is located in West Bowling, Bradford, West Yorkshire .

"England should accept it is too bad at football to compete and join a United Kingdom team instead, a Tory MP has said. Laurence Robertson has called for a debate in the Commons on scrapping the England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland football teams in a bid to do better at the World Cup. In the wake of England's first-round failure at the World Cup in Brazil the Tewkesbury MP said the football authorities from each nation should 'come together' to form one national team for the UK. England's sole victory in 1966 shows the need to join up with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, claims Tory MP Laurence Robertson . Speaking outside the House of Commons, Mr Robertson said: 'It's my opinion we should have gone down that road a long time ago. 'None of us have really been successful - England have not done any good since 1966 and some great players from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not played in the World Cup, such as George Best and Ryan Giggs. 'That talent was lost on the international stage.' Mr Robertson said he did not believe much could be done about the number of foreign players in the Premier League in England, as he said the nation should not 'deny ourselves the option to pick players from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales' to produce stronger sides. He went on: 'Even in 1966 we could have had an even stronger side. 'In the past we would have been world-beaters - throughout the 1970s England failed to qualify twice and Scotland did qualify but failed to do any good. England's best performance since 1966 was reaching the semi final in 1990. 'What's the point of four teams? I don't think any other country puts more than one team out - the United States doesn't put forward 50 teams.' Mr Robertson added: 'When England get to the group stage and we cannot get out of it, I don't think we should accept that. I think we should try and improve.' Alf Ramsey's England side beat West Germany 4-2 at Wembley to conquer the world but have since endured 48 years of hurt, culminating with the Three Lions securing a solitary point in Brazil and finishing bottom of their group behind Costa Rica, Uruguay and Italy. Wales last appeared at the World Cup finals in 1958 - the last occasion when all four home nations played at the same tournament - while Northern Ireland last took part in 1986 and Scotland in 1998. A Great Britain football team appeared at the London 2012 Olympics although only consisted of English and Welsh players. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Football Associations were opposed to a combined team entering in 2012 despite assurances from Fifa that it would not affect their independence as footballing nations. Mr Robertson put forward the idea for the UK team in an early day motion before Parliament. He says that 'no other nation fields more than one national team' and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to 'come together and form one national football team covering the UK'. An EDM is a formal motion submitted for debate in the House of Commons although very few are actually debated. Mr Robertson's EDM states in full: 'That this House notes with regret England's early exit from the 2014 World Cup; recalls that England has not won the World Cup since 1966; further notes that on three occasions since 1966 England has failed to qualify for the World Cup Finals at all, that Scotland has only qualified for eight World Cup Finals out of a total of 20, that Northern Ireland has only qualified for three and Wales has only qualified for one in 1958; believes that fielding four teams from the UK reduces the chances of success and has denied World Cup opportunities to outstanding British players; observes that no other nation fields more than one national team; and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to come together and form one national football team covering the UK.'","Laurence Robertson calls for a Commons debate on setting up a UK team .

"Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has revealed that he and his staff have received death threats from ISIS . Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has revealed that he and his staff have received death threats from ISIS after the site shut down accounts being used by the terrorist organization. He said that when Twitter found out the extremist group was using the site to spread news it  would regularly shut down the jihadist accounts - prompting the assassination threats. Mr Costolo said: 'After we started suspending their accounts, some folks affiliated with the organization used Twitter to declare that employees of Twitter and their management should be assassinated. 'Obviously that's a jarring thing for anyone to deal with,' the CEO added, speaking to Aspen Institute president Walter Isaacson, the New York Post reported. Mr Costolo was discussing the challenge of balancing the ability to be a free and open platform against wider concerns and government intervention at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco. Earlier on in the session, Mr Isaacson had pointed out that ISIS had been using the social media network to spread its message, highlighting the group's use of Twitter to point out the video of the beheading of American journalist James Foley on YouTube. Mr Costolo said: 'Whenever you have a global public information-sharing channel, you are going to have people that use it for good. It's obviously been a tool for social change, beneficial social change in a number of countries around the world. But he pointed out that not everyone was using the site for good and jihadist organizations were using Twitter accounts to communicate an extremist message. 'It's against our terms of service,' the CEO said. 'It's against the law in many of the countries in which we operate for them to use it to promote their organization. And when we do find those accounts we shut them down. We shut them down quite actively.' In the past nine months, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the US continues to intervene in Iraq. The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani. Scroll down for video . Aspen Institute president Walter Isaacson pointed out that ISIS had been using the site, highlighting the group's use of Twitter to point out the video of the beheading of American journalist James Foley on YouTube (pictured) In the past nine months, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the US continues to intervene in Iraq . A month ago it was revealed that an ISIS-affiliated group was threatening to assassinate Twitter employees that close down their accounts. Users linked to the extremists tweeted a series of messages  urging 'lone wolves' in the US and Europe to make the firm their target. A specific warning was directed at staff at the Silicon Valley headquarters, warning they would 'bring the war' to San Francisco. One of the calls is believed to have come from Al Musra Al Maqdisia, or The Supporters Of Jerusalem - a Jerusalem-based group that pledged its allegiance to ISIS in February. Salma Halane (left) and her twin Zahra (right), from Manchester, 16, have been Tweeting from Syria . The tweets from the now-suspended account, translated by Vocativ, read: '#TheConceptOfLoneWolfAttacks The time has arrived to respond to Twitter's management by directly attacking their employees and physically assassinating them!! Those who will carry this out are the sleepers cells of death.' It continued: 'Twitter management should know that if they do not stop their campaign in the virtual world, we will bring the war to them in the real world on the ground.' The user then directly threatened workers at the Silicon Valley headquarters: 'Every Twitter employee in San Francisco in the United States should bear in mind and watch over himself because on his doorstep there might be a lone wolf assassin waiting'. And finally, they urged Europe to join the pledge: '#AttackingTwitterEmployees is on the agenda of mujahedeen and lone wolves who are across Europe'. Last month's threats came from the now-suspended account of Al Musra Al Maqdisia, an ISIS-linked group . The social network has been a crucial platform for the jihadis to promote their warped interpretation of Sharia law. The freedom of speech premise that underlies Twitter makes regulation of extremist propaganda almost impossible. Tactics have included Twitter storms, spamming the site with their beliefs and calling on Western recruits to join them. Many of the British and American jihadis that have fled their native countries to join the faction in Iraq and Syria have been tweeting their experiences. One of the 16-year-old twins from Chorlton that fled to join ISIS in Syria has been tweeting messages to the UK, mocking concerns for their welfare. A specific warning was directed at staff at the Silicon Valley Twitter headquarters, saying that they would 'bring the war' to San Francisco, after the site deleted jihadist accounts . Either Salma or Zahra Halane has taken the name Umm Ja'far and tweeted a slew of fanatical messages, including several revealing she still plans to be a doctor - but only so she can treat ISIS fighters. She wrote: 'I love the name Terror Twin because it makes me sound scary. Isis love it when they make us sound scary because it makes us a big threat so I love it.' She added: 'I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It's self defence.' However, in the wake of the murders of James Foley and Steven Sotloff at the hands of ISIS, the firm has worked to shut down accounts that permeate the organisation's message. Twitter has bureaus across the world. There are 12 in the US, including the headquarters, and five in Europe. A further two are in Latin America, three in Asia, one in Australia and two in Canada.","Dick Costolo said site shuts down  accounts linked to terrorist organizations .

"Vladimir Putin has offered to have a replica Super Bowl ring made for Robert Kraft after the Russian President was accused of stealing it. In his first official statement about the ring allegations, the Russian leader told Petersburg Economic Forum he did not remember Mr Kraft or the ring, but seeing as it was so valuable he would have more made for the New England Patriots' owner. 'I remember that I was handed some souvenirs. If this is such a great value for Kraft and the respective team, I have a proposal,' President Putin said. Scroll down for video . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has claimed that Vladimir Putin took his Super Bowl ring and that the White House told him to say it was a gift . He suggested that a Russian factory . could create a replica, using 'good metal and stone' so a copy of the . ring can be given to Mr Kraft and the team. '[It] will be the smartest … solution to this complex, international problem,' he added. The ring is believed to be in the . library of the Kremlin, which has denied Mr Kraft's account the . President Putin walked off with the ring during a meeting in St . Petersburg in 2005,according to the New York Post. Since details of the ring's disappearance first emerged, Mr Kraft backtracked on his original claim that President Putin . stole the Super Bowl Ring. A spokesman for the billionaire businessman said Mr Kraft's claim that Putin pocketed his $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring was a 'humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs.' A . careful reading of the statement, though, reveals that Mr  Kraft isn't . saying the story is untrue - only that it isn't meant to be taken . seriously. Mr Kraft had said that after Putin . made off with his ring, he was pressured by the Bush White House into . calling it a gift was a gift and letting Putin keep it. On Sunday, Kraft's spokesman said: . '(Kraft) loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back . in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the . leadership of President Putin.' It's a good thing, too. Because Putin isn't giving it back. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN  the ring resides at the Kremlin museum - where all 'state gifts' are kept. He denied that Putin stole the ring - . insisting that Mr Kraft freely gave it to the Russian leader in 2005 at a . meeting in Saint Petersburg. 'What Mr. Kraft is saying now is . weird. I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw . and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift,' he told the network.

'It's a humorous, anecdotal story that Robert retells for laughs. 'He loves that his ring is at the Kremlin, and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin. 'In particular, he credits President Putin for modernizing the Russian economy.' The statement adds that the ring being at the Kremlin has 'an added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some Patriots fan clubs in Russia.' ‘I took out the ring and showed it to . [Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this . ring,”’  Mr Kraft told the crowd. Mr Kraft continued: ‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’ The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his  ownership. He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. At the time, Mr  Kraft released a public statement saying the . diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift.

"Apple's iPhone could soon replace your ID card and subway card as well as your credit card, it has been revealed. The firm last week launched Apple Pay, which allows people to pay by tapping their phone and using a fingerprint on its home button to identify themselves. Now it is believed to be in talks to open up the technology to other uses. Scroll down for video . Obstacles: Apple Pay lets users pay with their phones at some 200,000 retail stores. Consumers may use whatever credit cards they'd like. While the system appears seamless, retailer opposition is a serious hurdle for the Silicon Valley giant . Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. According to the report in The Information, Apple's is planning to replace transit cards, like the ones that the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago subway and train systems use. 'The Apple representatives have talked to technology providers like HID Global and Cubic, which enable secure access to buildings and transit fare systems, respectively,' people briefed on the discussions told The Information. 'Spokespeople for the companies declined to comment about any discussions with Apple, but executives there discussed how they could integrate their systems with the iPhone.' Apple has already announced one partnership along these lines with Starwood Hotels, which allows visitors to use an Apple Watch instead of a keycard, but this will employ Bluetooth technology rather than NFC. However, Apple Pay has not been without its issues. CVS and Rite Aid have joined a long list of the world's largest retailers who will not be accepting Apple Pay. At its launch, Apple boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your iPhone and a tap of your finger to prove your identity. But retail giants Walmart, Target, Kohl's. Dunkin' Donuts are not among them. These retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme. When the App;e watch hits stores in 2015, the Starwood Hotels app will allow guests to unlock their hotel room doors without having to fumble with a key or dig through a bag to find a key card. The app was featured during Apple’s unveiling earlier this year and it will be used at some of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide’s properties, which include the Westin, Sheraton, W and Aloft brands, starting next spring. Apps that unlock hotel room doors are the wave of the future as hotel and travel companies attempt to make holidays more convenient. Hilton Hotels has also announced plans to replace keys with smartphones. American Airlines is partnering with the tech giant to create an Apple Watch app that will allow travellers to manage their bookings. Starwood recently made headlines when it announced that it would be using a robot butler at its Aloft boutique hotel in California’s Silicon Valley. Known as the Botlr, the robotic bellhop is designed to ferry amenities from the front desk to any of the hotel’s 150 rooms in just three minutes or less. It comes after the system hit several glitches following its launch last week. Some Apple Pay users in the US have been double-charged for purchases. The Californian tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system, but says it only affected 'a very small number' of Apple Pay users with Bank of America accounte, and is working to refund all faulty transactions. CVS and Rite Aid initially accepted Apple Pay, but quickly turned heel and no longer take the payment system. The chains disabled the system in their stores over the weekend, reports the New York Times. The retailer group to which both companies belong, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), is creating CurrentC--a system similar to Apple Pay that will be owned by a consortium of retailers rather than a third party, i.e. Apple. Apple Pay (screenshots pictured above) stores Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information and works with the iPhone 6's touch ID fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods. Stores such as McDonalds, Macy's and Walgreensare involved . The Merchant Customer Exchange, a consortium of retailers creating their own mobile payment app, includes dozens of companies, many of which are among America's largest retailers: . Best Buy, Lowe's, Kmart, Kohl's, Dunkin' Donuts, Gap, Sam's, Walmart, Target, Wendy's, 7-Eleven, Exxon, Publix, Shell, Sheetz, Shop-Rite, Conoco, Wawa, Dick's, Olive Garden and more. Like Apple Pay, CurrentC allows consumers to quickly and securely pay for goods and services with the aid of an app on their cell phones. CurrentC, however, appears to work in an opposite way from Apple Pay. While the former uses what's called an NFC chip, which is scanned by the retail kiosk, the MCX system has the phone scan a code generated by the kiosk. Not only is CurrentC hoping to leave Apple out in the cold, it's trying to circumvent credit cards completely. While Apple Pay allows users to store whatever credit cards they'd like in their phones, CurrentC taps directly into the user's bank account. Results, though, are the same: a seamless and safe purchasing process. CurrentC is set to hit smartphones in 2015. Apple said it had found most retailers were enthusiastic. 'The feedback we are getting from customers and retailers about Apple Pay is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, it told Business Insider. 'We are working to get as many merchants as possible to support this convenient, secure and private payment option for consumers. 'Many retailers have already seen the benefits and are delighting their customers at over 220,000 locations. And that may be Apple's one advantage, it's pay system is already here. Apple Pay made its debut last week. Now you can flash your new iPhone in the checkout line to pay for food, clothing and other goods. There's no need to pull out your credit card. But don't leave your wallet or purse behind quite yet: Despite a few dozen retail chains pledging support for Apple Pay, so-called contactless payments are still new. Smaller merchants, in particular, aren't likely to have the necessary equipment right away. All told, there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept Apple Pay in the U.S. Apple has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting Apple Pay at launch, and others are planning to do so by the end of the year. Apple said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores, if not all of them, were ready at Monday's launch: Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies R Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, Subway, Toys R Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. Bright side: Dozens of retailers will be accepting Apple Pay, the biggest of which include Subway, Whole Fooods, Walgreens, McDonald's and Macy's . Apple also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year: Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. For online payments, Apple said the following merchants have apps ready for Apple Pay: Chairish, Fancy, Groupon, HotelTonight, Houzz, Instacart, Lyft, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Spring, Staples, Target and Uber. Others expected by year's end include: Airbnb, Disney Store, Eventbrite, JackThreads, Levi's Stadium by VenueNext, Sephora, Starbucks, StubHub, Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. Of course, Apple's retail stores and the Apple Store app will also take Apple Pay. Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information. It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. Apple doesn't collect its users' purchase history, so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it doesn't know what they bought, where they bought it or how much they paid for it. Card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud. Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many US banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device.

"A senior NSW policeman has used his station's official Facebook page to question whether flags should have been lowered to half-mast for Phillip Hughes when slain servicemen were not given the same honour. The officer - believed to be Chief Inspector Bob Fitzgerald, who signs his posts 'Chief' - used the Blacktown local area command (LAC) Facebook page to express his private views about the reaction to  Hughes's death on Friday night. 'Should state flags only be lowered for sporting heroes who died through a sporting accident or for those that have died in the service of this great country?' he asked. 'Or perhaps someone could explain to the relatives of the men and women why they were no (sic) lowered to half mast for national heroes as opposed to sporting heroes. Chief.' His comments, which were later removed, quickly sparked criticism from other users distressed by the death of Hughes on Thursday from catastrophic brain injuries caused by a cricket ball. 'Very inappropriate post,' wrote one. 'Pull ya head in Bob,' wrote another. Dave Smith wrote: 'Totally out of line. Using your local area Facebook page to express your personal views. If these are your views then put them on your own page. Stick to reporting on the local police maters (sic) and story's (sic) not your own. Shame on you shame on you. This should be removed.' Scroll down for video . Totally out of line: Facebook users criticise Blacktown's 'Chief' for questioning whether flags should have been lowered for Phillip Hughes when slain servicemen were not given the same honour. Friday's post comes barely three months after Chief Inspector Fitzgerald was asked to take 'a more formal approach' to the Blacktown LAC Facebook page. 'Unfortunately my method of engaging with the community does not comply with the NSW Police Force Eyewatch guidelines,' Chief Inspector Fitzgerald said at the time. Eyewatch is a Facebook-based version of Neighbourhood Watch intended to 'give community members the opportunity to participate in active crime prevention activities online,' according to the NSW Police Force. Sense of humour: Chief Inspector Bob Fitzgerald has previously been warned about his posts on Blacktown LAC's Facebook page. Blacktown local area commander Detective Superintendent Gary Merryweather did not name Chief Inspector Fitzgerald but said Friday's post was 'the personal opinion of a staff member' and had not been intended to offend. 'The post on the Blacktown Local Area Command's Eyewatch page was never intended to diminish the tragic death of Phillip Hughes,' Detective Superintendent Merryweather said. 'The thoughts of the NSW Police Force are with his family and friends at this sad time. 'The post on the Eyewatch page was the personal opinion of a staff member and not an endorsed comment by NSW Police. 'Blacktown Local Area Command recognises that this post may have caused distress to some followers and that post has now been deleted.' Condolences: 'Chief' offers his condolences to the family of Phillip Hughes before using the Blacktown Local Area Command Facebook page to question whether flags should have been lowered in the cricketer's honour. A NSW police spokeswoman said an investigation into the matter was ongoing and no action had been taken against any officer at this stage. On Saturday, the Blacktown LAC Facebook page featured a picture of a cricket bat and cap outside the station. Jan Horne responded: 'Id put my Sons old one out but someone would steal it around my area!' Vickie Micallef wrote: 'yes the same as me - we would have put my son's bat out too but afraid it will get stolen'. The first post from 'Chief' began: 'A question? It's a very sad thing that an Australian sportsperson has died. The following commentary means no disrespect at all. As a cricketing family I understand his love for the sport. 'But can anyone tell me the name of the Australian service personnel that have died or the hundreds of servicemen and women that have been seriously injured for this country of ours not through sporting accident but through war?' Stephen McRae responded: 'With all due respect. I find this post disrespectful. Our service men and woman are on a totally different level'... 'Yesterday we lost an Aussie of whom we have all got to know and respect and sort of understand. 'We all grieve for this young man as he lost his life doing what he loves with the goal of representing our great country. 'A respectful young bloke who was taken playing a game of cricket.'

Chief Inspector Fitzgerald has previously received publicity for his light-hearted posts on the Blacktown LAC Facebook page. In August he announced online he was quitting the site. 'To the good people of Blacktown and the West,' that post began. 'It’s been a real blast engaging with you through this medium with a little humour. 'Unfortunately my method of engaging with the community does not comply with the NSW Police Force Eyewatch guidelines.

Five days after quitting administration of the page, Chief Inspector Fitzgerald was back. “I am astonished - I’ve been getting emails and hundreds of comments,” Chief Inspector Fitzgerald told the Blacktown Advocate. He wanted the Blacktown LAC Facebook page to encourage community co-operation with their local police. “I want to make it friendly and open to the point where people can feel comfortable with police - we’re not robots,” he said.","Senior policeman uses official Facebook page to question whether flags should have been lowered for cricketer Phillip Hughes .

"Homeowners are set to be given a boost in the run-up to Christmas as banks drop their mortgage rates to new lows. HSBC will launch its lowest ever five-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.48 per cent. The deal comes with a £999 fee and is available to borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit from Monday. It is the first five-year fix priced at under 2.5 per cent since the summer 2013, when Yorkshire Building Society offered a 2.44 per cent deal. Lowest on the market: HSBC will launch its lowest ever five-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.48 per cent. The deal comes with a £999 fee and is available for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit from Monday . The deal - the lowest rate on the market - is announced as lenders continue to undercut each other in the latest rate war. A string of lenders have been slashing their rates since the start of autumn and mortgage experts predict there will be more to come. Yesterday, Santander launched its lowest ever two-year fixed-rate mortgage, available for a 'limited time only'. Open only to people looking to remortgage, it offers a 1.84 per cent rate for people with per cent equity and comes with a £995 fee. Barclays has also made cuts this week, with its new deals including a five-year fixed-rate remortgage loan at 2.79 per cent for people with a 30 per cent deposit, with a £999 application fee. Skipton Building Society also has a 2.56 per cent five-year fix for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit. It comes with a £995 fee. There have been suggestions that lenders are offering deals to retain customers who are currently sitting on a standard variable rate (SVR mortgage). There are concerns that some may decide to jump to another deal when the Bank of England base rate starts to climb. The rise is expected at some point towards the latter half of 2015. Meanwhile, there is also evidence that lenders are now playing catch-up in order to meet end-of-year lending targets. Stricter mortgage lending rules came into force in April and this caused some disruption to the market as lenders adjusted to how they should interpret the changes. A recent Bank of England report showed that mortgage availability shrank back over the summer, just after the new rules were introduced. Despite signs that lenders are gaining a stronger appetite to offer home loans, concerns have also been raised in recent days that some groups of people, such as those aged over 40, are now having a tougher struggle trying to get a mortgage deal. Rachel Springall, spokeswoman for financial information website Moneyfacts, said that while HSBC's new 2.4 per cent deal is likely to cause a stir in the long-term fixed deal market. Difficult climate: Concerns have also been raised in recent days that some groups of people, such as those aged over 40, are now having a tougher struggle trying to get a mortgage deal . Ms Springall said: 'Customers sitting on an SVR or are even coming to the end of their current deal will be looking at the best rates out there, so by offering a headline rate this deal is bound to attract custom. 'The fact that this deal is a five-year fixed will furthermore boost its appeal to borrowers who want to lock into a low rate for the longer-term. 'As the end of the year approaches, banks and building societies will be aiming to meet their lending targets, therefore it won't be surprising if we see more of these low rates hit the market.' But she warned that borrowers needed to work out the true cost of a mortgage before signing on. Ms Springall added: 'A good all-round mortgage would ideally have a decent rate, low fee and an incentive package, but as these deals may not bathe in the same limelight as a market-low rate, it's wise for borrowers to seek out independent financial advice to find the right deal for them.'","HSBC will launch its lowest ever five-year fixed rate mortgage on Monday .

"To onlookers, Monsignor Kevin Wallin's fall from grace at his Connecticut parish was like something out of 'Breaking Bad,' the television series about a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine lord. The suspended Roman Catholic priest was arrested on federal drug charges this month for allegedly having methamphetamine mailed to him from co-conspirators in California and making more than $300,000 in drugs sales out of his apartment in Waterbury in the second half of last year. Along the way, authorities said, he bought a small adult video and sex toy shop in the nearby town of North Haven named 'Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place,' apparently to launder all the money he was making. Concerns: Former colleagues of Monsignor Kevin Wallin have said he was struggling with his faith before his fall from grace . Breaking bad: Since the arrest, Wallin, left, has been compared to Walter White from the show Breaking Bad . He has pleaded not guilty, and jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin March 21. On social media sites, people couldn't help but compare Wallin with Walter White, the main character on 'Breaking Bad' who was making so much cash that he and his wife bought a car wash to launder their profits. He has also been dubbed in some media as 'Monsignor Meth.' Wallin, 61, was the pastor of St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport for nine years until he resigned in June 2011, citing health and personal problems. He previously served six years as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury until 2002. He was granted a sabbatical in July 2011. The Diocese of Bridgeport suspended him from public ministry last May. Diocesan officials become concerned about Wallin in the spring of 2011 after complaints about his appearance and erratic behavior, diocese spokesman Brian Wallace told the Connecticut Post. Some reports of his behavior were startling. 'We became aware that he was acting . out sexually - with men - in the church rectory,' Wallace told the . newspaper, adding that church officials deemed the sexual behavior . unbecoming of a priest and asked Wallin to resign. Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . 'News of Monsignor Kevin Wallin's . arrest comes with a sense of shock and concern on the part of the . diocese and the many people of Fairfield County who have known him as a . gifted, accomplished and compassionate priest,' the diocese said in a . statement. 'We ask for . prayers for Monsignor Wallin during the difficult days ahead for him.' Walln is accused of selling upward of $9,000 of crystal meth a week, drawing comparisons to Walter White from Breaking Bad . Wallin's arrest called attention to . larger problems within the church, said Voice of the Faithful in the . Diocese of Bridgeport, one of many local chapters of the lay . organization formed in response to the sexual abuse crisis in the . church. 'Catholics have to ask whether the . mandatory obligation of celibacy imposes a harmful burden on priests and . whether women ought to be admitted to the priesthood,' the group said . in a statement. 'The steady decline in the number of priests, the aging . of priests, the terrible sin of pedophilia among priests, and the . downfall of Monsignor Wallin are all signs of a sickness in the . priesthood. It is time to seek a remedy for this awful malady that . threatens the Eucharist, the center of Catholic life.' Elizabeth Badjan, a member of the St. Augustine congregation, told The New York Times that Wallin needed the . prayers of parishioners. 'This is all the work of evil,' she . said as she left Mass last weekend. 'He was not close enough to God. He . was tempted by the devil.' Wallin's case has drawn comparisons . to that of the Rev. Ted Haggard, a well-known evangelical megachurch . pastor in Colorado who was forced out of his job in 2006 after a male . escort alleged Haggard had paid him for sex and bought crystal meth. The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth . Federal agents arrested Wallin on Jan. 3, and a grand jury indicted him and four other people on drug charges on Jan. 15. All are charged with one count of . conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of a substance containing . methamphetamine and 50 grams of actual methamphetamine, a crime that . carries 10 years to life in prison upon conviction. Wallin is also charged with six counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Last July, Drug Enforcement . Administration agents in New York told agents in the New Haven office . that there was an unidentified Connecticut-based drug trafficker . distributing methamphetamine in the region. Wallin allegedly bought the Land of OZ sex shop to launder his drug money . Two months later, an informant told . the DEA that the trafficker was Wallin, according to an affidavit by . agent Jay Salvatore in New Haven. The Connecticut Statewide Narcotics Task Force was also investigating Wallin. Authorities said an undercover . officer with the state task force bought methamphetamine from Wallin six . times from Sept. 20 to Jan. 2, paying more than $3,400 in total for 23 . grams of the drug. Federal agents also say they learned through wiretaps and informants about other sales Wallin was making. Connecticut U.S. Attorney David Fein . said federal and state authorities worked together in 'the dismantling . of what we allege was a significant methamphetamine distribution . organization that spanned from California to Connecticut.' Also charged in the case were Kenneth . Devries, 52, of Waterbury; Michael Nelson, 40, of Manchester; Chad . McCluskey, 43, of San Clemente, Calif.; and Kristen Laschober, 47, of . Laguna Niguel, Calif. Authorities say McCluskey and Laschober were . involved in the shipping of methamphetamine to Wallin.

"Schools must crack down on the teaching of Islamic Sharia law and promote English criminal law as part of a ‘British values’ drive. New ‘strengthened’ government guidance, published yesterday, demands that pupils are ‘made aware of the difference between the law of the land and religious law’. The Department for Education document on ‘actively promoting’ British values in state schools stresses the need for action within lessons as well as extracurricular activities. The government is demanding schools crack down on teaching Sharia law and promote English criminal law . It came as it emerged that a second rural school has been marked down after effectively being judged too English. St Lawrence School in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, was criticised by Ofsted for failing to promote British values in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal – an alleged Islamist plot to take over schools in Birmingham. This is in addition to the six private Muslim schools that were warned by the education watchdog last week that they were at risk of closure because their pupils could be vulnerable to radicalisation. Pupils at one school in the East London borough of Tower Hamlets were unable to tell the difference between Sharia and English law and told inspectors that a woman’s job was to ‘stay at home and clean and look after the children’ and ‘cook and pray’. The latest DfE guidance says that pupils ‘must be encouraged to regard people of all faiths, races and cultures with respect and tolerance’. It adds: ‘It is expected that pupils should understand that while different people may hold different views about what is “right” and “wrong”, all people living in England are subject to its law. The school’s ethos and teaching, which schools should make parents aware of, should support the rule of English civil and criminal law and schools should not teach anything that undermines it. The St Lawrence School in Horncastle, was criticised by Ofsted for failing to promote British values in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal . Middle Rasen Primary School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has missed out on an 'outstanding' rating from Ofsted because it is 'too English'. Pictured: Headteacher Melonie Brunton (back middle) with pupils . Inspectors penalised the 104-pupil school for not being multicultural enough, despite 97 per cent of the town being white and the majority of pupils not being from ethnic backgrounds . ‘If schools teach about religious law, particular care should be taken to explore the relationship between state and religious law. Pupils should be made aware of the difference between the law of the land and religious law.’ Since September, private and maintained schools have been expected to ‘actively promote’ British values as part of a drive by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. The new guidance for state schools says pupils must be able to ‘distinguish right from wrong and to respect the civil and criminal law of England’. Examples of actions schools could take to promote British values include considering ‘the role of extracurricular activity, including any run by pupils’. Revised guidance for independent schools was also published simultaneously by the DfE. Members of the Sharia Council of Britain, in their east London headquarters, as they deliberate over a case . Meanwhile, St Lawrence School in Horncastle was criticised by inspectors because youngsters’ awareness of ‘wider Britain and other cultures’ outside of rural England was too weak. Ofsted said the school, which caters for 140 special needs pupils aged five to 16, was ‘good’, but it could not be rated outstanding. Executive head Lea Mason told the BBC it was a ‘big challenge’ finding cultural diversity in the countryside because some of the school’s pupils were unable to ‘sit on a minibus for a long time to get to somewhere that has more cultural opportunities’. A week earlier, a nearby school – Middle Rasen primary – also came under fire from Ofsted because its mainly white pupils had a ‘lack of first-hand experience of the diverse make up of modern Britain’.","Pupils at East London school unable to tell difference between two laws .

"Writer Samantha Brick might have slammed the best-selling novel as 'badly written porn' but a bold new survey shows that Britain's women have been inspired by bestselling erotic book Fifty Shades Of Grey. Reports reveal that an increasing number of women have been inspired to try a slew of new tricks in the bedroom - including introducing blindfolds and handcuffs and creating their own mini ‘playrooms’. Almost 80 per cent admitted they found the idea of succumbing to a dominant male like Christian Grey a turn on. And 90 per cent of men confessed they were turned on by the idea of a woman being submissive, like Ana, the virgin character in Fifty Shades Of Grey. Upgrading: Inspired by the relationship between young virgin Ana and her billionaire lover Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey series, student Liya Step sought out her own rich boyfriend . Forty three per cent of those questioned said they were now more likely to use handcuffs in sexual role play, while 47 per cent confessed they wanted to experiment with blindfolds and other bondage gear after reading the X-rated book.

Caribbean with her lover, a London businessman aged 43 who made his . millions working in IT. She enjoys the ‘arrangement’ she has . with her sugar daddy - an agreement that many have likened to the ‘contract’ Anastasia enjoys with Christian in Fifty Shades of Grey. She says: 'We just have a great time and really enjoy each others' company. 'And like Christian and Anastasia, we are madly in love.' Liya adds: 'Yes, we have an agreement but there is nothing sinister and I don’t have to do anything I don’t want.'

"An American priest named by Pope Francis as the Vatican's sex crimes prosecutor was among church officials who failed to report an abusive priest to law enforcement, according to a report. The Reverend Robert Geisinger was the second-highest-ranking leader of the Chicago Jesuits in the 1990s when complaints were made against the Reverend Donald McGuire. Geisinger knew of the complaints as early as 1995 and advised church officials as late as August 2002 on how to discipline McGuire, the Boston Globe reported, citing legal documents. Court documents also show that abuse complaints against McGuire date back to the 1960s, but the Jesuits failed for years to tell police - and he went on to commit other acts of sexual abuse. Reverend Robert Geisinger, pictured, has just been appointed as the Vatican's sex crimes prosecutor - but an investigation has found he was part of a group that failed to remove a high-profile sex offender . McGuire, the former spiritual adviser to Mother Theresa, was defrocked and is now in prison serving a 25-year sentence. He is considered one of the most influential figures convicted in the scandal. Geisinger referred to the Vatican spokesman, the Reverend Federico Lombardi, who said Geisinger has a 'solid and proven record in child protection dating back nearly two decades'. Lombardi said that Geisinger had 'voiced concerns' about McGuire's conduct and was the canon lawyer who prepared the case that led to McGuire's dismissal from the clerical state. 'The Holy See fully expects Father Geisinger to continue to do an excellent job as Promoter of Justice, based on his prosecution record, his commitment to justice, and his concern for victims,' Lombardi told the Associated Press. Jailed: He allegedly knew about reports concerning Rev. Donald McGuire (pictured) in the 1990s . David Clohessy, director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, released a statement on Sunday urging Pope Francis to rescind the appointment of Geisinger as sex crimes prosecutor. 'Why on earth would Francis pick a priest with a problematic track record on abuse in the U.S. to deal with abuse worldwide?' Clohessy said. 'Why choose one who so clearly and repeatedly refused to call the law or tell the truth about a notorious, now-imprisoned serial predator?' Bishop Charles Scicluna, Geisinger's predecessor as chief sex crimes prosecutor, or 'promoter of justice,' told the AP that Geisinger's previous work in the church as procurator general in Rome for the Jesuits was excellent. Geisinger took over in September. 'He is a fine canonist dedicated to serving as a very strong promoter of justice,' Scicluna said. Reverend Timothy Kesicki, the president of the U.S. Jesuit Conference, also defended Geisinger. Kesicki insisted that Geisinger only worked for the Chicago province for about 14 weeks, from late December 1994 through March 1995, as a temporary executive assistant and never again. Geisinger had no governing authority and was tasked mainly with maintaining correspondence for his boss, said Kesicki. After his brief stint in the province, Geisinger worked for the Chicago archdiocese and in 2001 moved to Rome to become the top canon lawyer for the Jesuits worldwide. Locked up: McGuire, pictured being congratulated by nuns after initially being allowed to walk free after a 2007 hearing, is now serving 25 years behind bars. He was previously the spiritual adviser to Mother Theresa . Court documents show that while in Rome, in 2002, Geisinger advised the Chicago Jesuits about disciplining the priest, the Reverend Donald McGuire. But the province only moved to dismiss McGuire after he was convicted in criminal court in 2006. Geisinger processed the paperwork and McGuire was defrocked within two months, the Vatican said. 'I hold him in the highest professional esteem,' Kesicki said of Geisinger. 'I believe he is one of the leading canonists in the church today, and most importantly, I believe he dedicated himself and uses the law for the protection of children and all vulnerable persons.' Kesicki, who was provincial in Chicago from 2009 until July, and oversaw its $19 million settlement to McGuire's victims, acknowledged the Jesuits 'failed to do enough to respond' to McGuire's crimes. A Wisconsin jury convicted McGuire of five counts of indecent behavior with a child in 2006, three years after two men came forward to report they were abused by McGuire in 1967 and 1968. Defense: Pope Francis appointed Geisinger in September. The Vatican has come out in support of the priest . At the time, McGuire taught the boys at the Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. The case helped pave the way for federal prosecution and the 25-year sentence against McGuire in 2008 on charges of traveling outside the U.S. and across state lines to have sex with a teenager. Federal authorities alleged in court documents that McGuire sexually molested boys in their teens and men in their early 20s throughout the 1990s and up until 2003. Last year, Jesuit officials agreed to pay $19.6 million to settle a lawsuit by six men who alleged they were abused by McGuire, according to the men's lawyer. The men, ranging in age from their 20s to 40s, said they were molested between 1975 and the early 2000s.","Reverend Robert Geisinger was named by Pope Francis as the Vatican's sex crimes prosecutor in September .

"Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been elected as head of the conservative party leaving him clear to launch a campaign to return as the country's leader in 2017. He was under pressure to win the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) leadership by a wide margin and received 64.5 per cent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest rival Bruno le Marie. This victory advances Mr Sarkozy's hopes of running in the presidential race, and cements his return to the political scene after losing to Francois Hollande more than two years ago. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy arrives at his campaign headquarters with his singer wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy after his victory in the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) leadership vote . It comes a decade, almost to the day, after he first became leader of his political party. The UMP, which has struggled to be effective in opposition to Mr Hollande, will choose its presidential nominee in 2016. Mr Sarkozy, 59, used the UMP leadership to propel him to victory in 2004 when he won 85 per cent of the vote. Some analysts have said the recent result was below expectations as he had hoped to receive 70 per cent to keep his re-election hopes alive. The former French president posted a message on his Facebook page, saying: 'I would like to thank all the UMP members who did me the honour of electing me leader of our political family. 'Their mobilisation, at a level unequalled in the history of our movement, is the best response to two years of internal quarrels and divisions.' His wife  listens with rapt attention during Mr Sarkozy's speech for UMP presidency in Boulogne .

More than 150,000 party members - over 50 per cent - voted in the election, despite the process being slowed down by a cyber attack. UMP secretary-general Luc Chatel said the party was filing legal action against the unidentified hackers behind the attack, and that police were investigating. Mr Le Maire, a former agriculture minister, received less than 29.2 per cent and a third candidate, MP Herve Mariton had just 6.3 per cent. A spokeswoman for Mr Hollande's Socialist Party said that the UMP's campaign had provided 'nothing new for France'. 'Mr Sarkozy's victory in the campaign for the UMP presidency is not the triumphal return that he was hoping for,' Corinne Narassiguin said.

"British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, lingering on death row in a Bali jail, has received the grim news that Indonesia's new President will show no mercy and grant no pardons to drug traffickers. The 57-year-old former legal secretary from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to death in January last year for trafficking cocaine worth £1.6 million into Bali and all her appeals have been denied. Her final hopes of avoiding death by firing squad rest with the Indonesian President - but the newly-elected leader of the world's largest Muslim nation, Joko Widodo, has made it clear he will be taking a tough stance against drug smugglers. Scroll down for video . Lindsay Sandiford, pictured in her cell.  is on death row for smuggling cocaine worth £1.6million into Bali . Her hopes of avoiding death by firing squad rest with President Widodo - but he says he will show no mercy to drug traffickers . A spokesman for the Attorney General's Department told the Jakarta Globe that Mr Joko was not planning abolish capital punishment any time soon and the President would provide no clemency for people trafficking drugs into the country. 'The President says he will be firm,' said the spokesman. 'We want to send a warning to international drug syndicates that Indonesia doesn't want to be a stopping place, market place or even a place for producers of narcotics.' It is not known whether the President's 'no mercy' stance will include prisoners who have been on death row for several years - but already the House of Representatives in Jakarta has said it wants the jails emptied of condemned prisoners. 'Show them mercy, or execute them quickly,' said a spokesman for a special committee of the House of Representatives. 'Our jails are bursting and condemned prisoners are not making it any easier.' Mrs Sandiford was sentenced to death in January last year after she was found with the cocaine as she arrived in Bali on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, in May 2012 . Mrs Sandiford will have heard the bad news of the new President's 'no mercy' decision through the prison grapevine. Inmates would have been told of the bad news by visitors and it would have spread immediately to the cells. As a sign of the President's determination to execute condemned prisoners quickly, the Attorney General's office said today that five inmates currently on death row will be shot within the next four weeks. Mr Basuni Masyarif, deputy attorney general for general crimes, said the condemned prisoners had all exhausted their chances for appeal as well as failing to secure a pardon from President Joko. Mrs Sandiford's plea for a pardon is still with the President's office, having been lodged with the former leader, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Of the five prisoners who will now be shot before the end of the year, Mr Busuni declined to give details except to say that two are Nigerians and all are in prisons away from Bali - so Mrs Sandiford is not among those scheduled for immediate execution. Indonesia resumed the execution for death row prisoners in 2013, ending a four-year moratorium. Capital punishment is an option for Indonesian judges as a sentencing option for a number of convictions including drug trafficking, murder, sedition and terrorism. Indonesia's seventh President Joko Widodo, left, pictured waving with his wife Iriana following his inauguration at Parliament in Jakarta last month, is determined to execute condemned prisoners quickly . By law, condemned prisoners must be informed of their execution 72 hours before they are led away to a deserted place and ordered to stand, or sit, in front of the firing squad. Campaigners against the death penalty said that up to 2013 there were were 113 prisoners awaiting execution, but since then a further 16 have been sentenced to death. Mrs Sandiford pleaded guilty to attempting to smuggle the cocaine through Bali's international airport in 2012 following a flight from Bangkok, claiming that she had been under pressure to carry the narcotics because her adult sons had received death threats.","Lindsay Sandiford is on death row for smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali and all appeals have been denied .

"George Osborne will deliver a larger than expected boost to the NHS in this week’s Autumn Statement – injecting £2 billion to try to blunt Labour’s electoral advantage on the issue. Government sources say that the Chancellor has found the money for the windfall from budget surpluses across Whitehall departments. No 10 is acutely conscious that despite Ed Miliband’s rock-bottom personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour consistently polls ahead of the Conservatives. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to announce the massive cash injection in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday to blunt Miliband's party which consistently polls ahead of the Tories on NHS policies (file photo) The expected announcement in Wednesday’s speech comes after days of behind-the-scenes jostling between the Tories and Liberal Democrats to claim credit for the NHS funding boost, with Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb publicly calling for more resources to prevent a ‘crash’ in services over the winter. It had previously been rumoured that the NHS boost would amount to only £1 billion. The Autumn Statement is also expected to contain a number of big budget infrastructure announcements, with priority given to major new roads. Ministers are under orders from No 10 to be photographed next to the projects for use in ‘puff’ pieces for local papers. Mr Osborne will claim in the statement – his last major pre-Election Commons setpiece other than March’s Budget – that his handling of the economy has enabled him to free up extra resources for the health service. No 10 is aware despite Ed Miliband’s (pictured) low personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour polls ahead of the Tories . ‘You can’t have a strong NHS without a strong economy to pay for it. If you don’t have a long-term plan for the economy, you don’t have a plan for the future of the NHS,’ he is expected to say, adding: ‘We have both. It’s because our economy is growing, and we’ve kept a tight control on the finances, that we can do more for the NHS.’ The Chancellor is also planning to make the political point that extra NHS funding should be allied to the more efficient management which he claims would be ensured by a Conservative administration. ‘This will support the day- to-day work of our incredible nurses, doctors and other NHS staff; but it is also a down- payment on the future of our health service. ‘This new money will be used to buy the new facilities and services that will help transform the NHS so it becomes more efficient for taxpayers and effective for patients.’ Mr Osborne will also claim credit for the fact that ‘the British economy is growing faster than any other major economy in the world’ – but will also repeat David Cameron’s warning earlier this month about the risks of a new global downturn hitting the UK economy. Labour fought back last night, with Chris Leslie, the party’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, saying: ‘This week George Osborne will have to admit that he has broken his promises. ‘He has failed to deliver rising living standards and that failure is why he’s also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year. ‘We need a plan to save and transform our health service too. Labour will raise an additional £2.5 billion a year, on top of Tory spending plans, for an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs.’","Chancellor found cash from budget surpluses across Whitehall - sources .

The girl's body was removed from the canal on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . The pregnant 19-year-old's body was found strangled in the Ganges canal in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, pictured . Hastinapur police chief P K Singh said the victim was thought to be having an affair with a man from the same village. Her parents discovered she was eight months pregnant when they took her to a doctor after she felt unwell one day, The Times of India reported. Mr Singh added her brother Sonu and cousin Bhoore and another accomplice took her to the canal where they strangled her and dumped her body. The girl's body was dumped in the Ganges river in Meerut, in the Uttar Pradesh district of India . A post-mortem examination confirmed the girl had been strangled and police are searching for the three men, who have been charged with murder. The suspects have absconded since the incident came to light and a manhunt is underway to find them, police added. Recently, activists have said the law into honour killings in India need review after the death of Bhavna Yadav, a 21-year-old student.

"The sister of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani has made an emotional plea for the judge not to halt the trial of Shrien Dewani without hearing the accused’s version of events. Ami Denborg, the victim’s elder sister, said she and her family would never be able to ‘move on’ without hearing what businessman Mr Dewani had to say in his defence. Judge Jeanette Traverso last week adjourned the trial in Cape Town for a fortnight to assess Mr Dewani’s claim that the case should be thrown out for lack of evidence because prosecution witnesses were unreliable. Scroll down for video . Ami Denborg, right, wants the South African trial judge in her brother-in-law's murder trial to ensure that Shrien Dewani explains his side of the story on how his wife Anni, left, was killed in November 2010 . The judge is due to make a ruling on December 8 and supporters of Anni Dewani fear that she may clear the wealthy care home owner of all five charges relating to the murder of his wife on their honeymoon four years ago. But Mrs Denborg, 37, an engineer, said: ‘What about us, as Anni’s family? We need to hear what he has to say. ‘We have been waiting for years, sitting through each and every hearing just to know what he can tell us about how Anni died. ‘At times, our patience has worn thin. But, as Anni’s family, we always believed it was important to maintain dignity and allow the courts of law to follow the full due process. ‘But I wonder how we are going to live our lives knowing that half of the story is missing?’ Mr Dewani, 34, denies any involvement in his wife’s murder in November 2010, two weeks after he married her in a £200,000 wedding in Mumbai. Anni was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of Cape Town. Shrien Dewani, pictured, denies all involvement in his wife's murder in Cape Town in November 2010 . Mr Dewani and the driver, Zola Tongo, were freed unharmed, while the 28-year-old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck. The Bristol businessman is alleged to have masterminded the hit on his wife after asking Tongo to stage a robbery and engage two gangsters to kill her. Mrs Denborg, speaking at her home in Stockholm, said: ‘We absolutely respect the judge and the court. However, it would just not be fair of her to make a judgment to end the case before she has heard everything. ‘There are inconsistencies in what Shrien has said to the police and to my family and these need to be cleared up, once and for all. ‘We heard from the three men who were in the taxi and who have been convicted and now we need to hear Shrien tell his story. As Anni’s family, we are never going to be able to move on unless we hear what he has to say about what happened.’ Mr Dewani fought a three-and-a-half-year legal battle to avoid extradition from Britain to South Africa after an arrest warrant was issued to take him back and put him on trial. Mrs Denborg said: ‘We have always thought so highly about the South African justice system and it could be about to hit us in the face if it makes a judgment before hearing the case in full. I am totally devastated. I was at work and I couldn’t stop crying. It doesn’t feel fair. ‘If the judgment comes with her hearing the full story and he is declared innocent, then I would say, “Okay, he didn’t do it.” And it would be easier to accept.’ On the first day of the trial Mr Dewani confessed through lawyers to paying gay prostitutes for sex and declared himself bisexual. But a London-based rent boy and a senior Scotland Yard officer were banned from revealing details of Mr Dewani’s sex life by the judge and he has not yet been cross-examined.","Shrien Dewani is accused of arranging his wife's November 2010 murder .

"A couple have been awarded £1,500 in compensation over a delayed Thomas Cook flight, three years after their plane was held back on the tarmac. Michael and Gillian Vick were travelling to Barbados to embark on a Caribbean cruise in March 2011 when their flight was delayed at Gatwick Airport for five hours. With no extreme weather affecting their travels, the couple from Sittingbourne, Kent, decided to find out if they were entitled to compensation for the inconvenience. Scroll down for video . Michael and Gillian Vick (pictured during a cruise on the Queen Mary 2) were awarded £1,500 by Thomas Cook for a delayed flight to Barbados . Three years later following lengthy legal proceedings, the holiday company has awarded them £1,049 and £500 interest for their troubles. Now Mr and Mrs Vick, who have two children, plan to spend their money on another holiday and may even book their next trip through the travel company. Speaking of the flight in 2011, Mr Vick, 64, said: 'When we left the house in the morning it was misty but the weather wasn't bad. 'We could hear aircraft going overheard. When we arrived at the airport a few flights were delayed but for no more than an hour, including ours.' At 10.30am, two hours after they were due to take off, the couple, who have been married for 35 years, were no closer to arriving in Barbados. 'Eventually they said it had been diverted to Stansted and we couldn't figure out why. 'We were sitting there watching the world go by rather than being on our way to Barbados,' the retired customer services trainer added. After more than five hours, their flight took off at 1.40pm. The couple, pictured in Hawaii (left) and Bora Bora (right), have saved their entire lives to be able to travel once in retirement. They commended the travel company for being 'fair and decent' Mr and Mrs Vick (in Budapest, above) plan to spend their compensation money on another trip abroad . According to the Civil Aviation Authority, when your flight is affected by disruption, your airline must take care of you and get you to your destination. Once the disruption has been resolved, you might also be able to claim costs or compensation. If the disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances, then you will not be entitled to compensation, as long as the airline took reasonable measures to avoid the disruption. The EU law on flight compensation uses the term ‘extraordinary circumstances’ to refer to situations where delays or cancellations have been caused by things that are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the airline and outside of the airline’s control. For a full list of extraordinary circumstances which can affect  flights in Europe and for which airlines should not be held accountable, visit the European Commission website here. For more information on whether or not you are eligible to make a claim against an airline visit the Civil Aviation Authority here. Upon return to the UK, the couple decided to put their case to the Civil Aviation Authority to see whether or not they could be compensated for the experience. 'It was more out of curiosity. We'd seen an article which said we could claim so we got in touch. 'The CAA said they thought that Thomas Cook couldn't use the excuse of exceptional circumstance and said we would be able to take action in county court so we did,' Mr Vick added. After weeks of going back and forth with the company's lawyers, Mr and Mrs Vick were offered a settlement on November 26 of £1,049 with around £500 interest. 'We did it more out of hope than expectation but it's brilliant. 'They've done the right thing, they are a really good company. 'We'd never have claimed if it wasn't right but we spent hours researching things to check. 'If the CAA said we didn't have a case then we wouldn't have taken it on, but we were right. It wasn't our fault.' The couple, who saved their whole lives to be able to travel when retired, now plan to spend their settlement on another trip and said they would happily travel with the firm again. 'It's not put us off flying with Thomas Cook at all, as airlines go they're not the best or the worst. 'They have been fair and decent with us. We'd definitely fly with them again. 'But we just think how many other people are entitled to the same as us?' Thomas Cook has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

"A grandfather-of-eight died after a pharmacy gave him the wrong prescription, an inquest heard. Edlie Masters, 83, from Birmingham, ordered paracetamol to numb pain caused by an ulcer on his feet but was given another patients' prescription. Assistant coroner Heidi Connor recorded a verdict of accidental death and asked Hurcomb Chemists to put policies in place to stop it happening again. The grandfather-of-eight Edlie Masters, 83, died after being given the wrong prescription, an inquest heard . Mr Masters (pictured bottom right) pictured with his family who said they were 'devastated' by his death . The inquest at Birmingham Coroners Court heard Mr Masters died after taking Verapamil, a drug which is used to treat high blood pressure. Pharmacist Matthew Hurcomb delivered the drugs to Mr Masters' home after he placed a telephone order for the painkillers along with his prescription for a pre-existing kidney condition. The usual delivery driver for Hurcomb Chemists took the prescription to Mr Masters' home on August 13 but there was no answer so he returned to the pharmacy. Later that night, Mr Hurcomb took the prescription to the house himself on his way home from work. But he picked up the wrong prescription by mistake and instead of paracetamol, delivered Verapamil to the Birmingham grandfather. Mr Masters then took the tablets without looking at the packaging, the inquest heard. Mr Masters was given Verapamil, a drug which is used to treat high blood pressure, instead of paracetamol . When Mr Hurcomb realised his mistake he drove back to Mr Masters' home in Winson Green, Birmingham and reassured him the drug would have no adverse effect. But hours later Mr Masters woke up complaining of a shortness of breath and was rushed to Birmingham City Hospital. When paramedics tried to find out what drugs Mr Masters had taken, the pharmacy had no idea because Mr Hurcomb had failed to log the mistake. The grandfather-of-eight died of multiple organ failure five days later on August 18. Birmingham Coroners Court heard the retired lorry driver died as a result of the 'interaction' between the Verapamil and medication he took for his kidney condition. His family said they felt 'let down' by Hurcomb Chemists which hand-delivered the wrong drug to Mr Masters . Today, the family of Mr Masters said they felt 'let down' by the pharmacy. His son Leon Masters said: 'He (Matthew Hurcomb) basically took it upon himself to think ""well I am a doctor, I will make a decision"" which is where the government are saying pharmacies can make a decision to say what patients can and can't have. 'We are devastated by the loss of our father and grandfather in such tragic and avoidable circumstances. 'Watching him deteriorate in hospital was horrendous and his death has and continues to have a tremendous impact on us as a family.' Granddaughter Chantelle Masters added: 'It was devastating when we found out what had happened. 'It was just a basic procedure which should have been followed and it wasn't.' Phil Barnes, a lawyer from Shoosmiths Access Legal who is representing the family, said: 'There is no excuse for failing to check that the correct medication is given to the right patient because doing so can result in a tragedy such as this. 'Mr Masters' death was avoidable and highlights the importance of following basic medical practices and procedures.' His family said the death of Mr Masters 'continues to have a tremendous impact on us as a family' Coroner Heidi Connor recorded an accidental death verdict at Birmingham Coroners Court (pictured) Dr Anthony Cox, a lecturer in Clinical Pharmacy at the University of Birmingham, said: 'There are procedures within pharmacies when giving out medicines to patients or delivering them to check the name and address is correct and those are really important procedures. 'However obviously occasionally there are errors with medication. 'This particular type of mistake I would hope would not be too common. Pharmacists are taught early about the importance of getting the right drugs to the right patients at the right time. 'It's a procedure that is in place at all pharmacies. In this case it is extremely damaging to trust. 'All professions are working together to try and reduce the rate of medication errors. 'There are systems where we can try and learn and then feedback to practitioners to make sure that these types of errors never happen again.' Mr Hurcomb has since referred himself to the General Pharmaceutical Council but refused to comment about the incident.","Edlie Masters, 83, died after Hurcomb Chemists gave him the wrong drug .

"Christians were nailed to crosses in the Philippines today in a grim Good Friday reenactment of Jesus's suffering. Thousands of people watched as 17 devoted Catholics were 'crucified' in the gruesome annual ritual. Church leaders have condemned the practice which they believe are a distortion of the true Easter message. Grim reenactment: Three Filipinos are nailed to crosses in a Good Friday crucifixion in Barangay Cutud, San Fernando. The event attracted a crowd of around 10,000 people . Pain: A Filipino man has nails through his hands - and some more put through his feet as he is put on a cross in the reenactment. The event has been condemned by the Catholic church . Nine men were crucified in Pampanga province's San Pedro Cutud village today, while at least eight . others were crucified in neighbouring villages. The annual event - which dates back to the 1950s - drew an estimated crowd of 10,000 worshippers. Many take part to atone for sins, pray for the sick or for a better life, or to give thanks for what they believe were miracles. Agony: Woman penitent Percy Valencia has a three inch steel nail hammered into her foot in Paombong, Bulacan province, northern Philippines, today . Horror: Percy Valencia, 41, is hoisted up onto a cross before being 'crucified' for a few minutes today . Ruben Enaje, a painter, 51, took part in the crucifixions for the 26th time today. He began taking part in the annual event to give thanks after he survived falling from a building. 'This is not just for fun or for money. This is a calling,' he told Filipino website Tempo. He added that despite the crucifixions being condemned he still took part because the Church 'stay at home during Good Friday instead of reaching out to penitents to explain their side'. Agony: Bobby Gomez grimaces as a nail is hammered into his hand in the Good Friday celebration . Bloody: Jon Jon Tanael looks at the nail going into his hand as a man holds a rag covered in blood during the event. 17 people took part . 'This is a spiritual vow as a way of thanking God . for sparing my  life.' He had three-inch steel nails hammered into his palms during the ceremony. The spectacle is a unique brand of Catholicism that merges church traditions with Philippine folk superstitions.

"Britain will be forced to pay benefits to even more migrants under EU plans to be fought over in a politically explosive court case. Officials in Brussels last night confirmed that the European Commission is taking legal action to make Britain lift existing restrictions that prevent some migrants claiming child benefit and child tax credit in the UK. The news comes just days after David Cameron pledged to cut handouts in a bid to reduce soaring immigration. The case at Europe’s highest court will further anger the public and politicians who have called on the Government to tighten up Britain’s generous welfare system and make the country a less attractive destination for would-be immigrants. Scroll down for video . If Britain loses, it will either have to change the law to allow jobless migrant families to claim child benefit, or face paying millions in fines. Latest figures show 24,000 families are currently claiming child benefit of at least £89 a month for 38,500 children living abroad, at an estimated cost of £30 million a year, while 4,000 claim child tax credit. On Friday, the Prime Minister pledged to end the ‘exporting’ of child benefit, as well as to ban migrant workers from claiming tax credits until they have worked in the UK for four years. Last night Nigel Mills, one of the Conservative backbenchers demanding a tough limit on EU migrants, said: ‘Free movement is about the right to work, not the right to claim benefits. The EU should accept our rules are the will of the British people and Parliament. Prime Minister David Cameron who had pledged to cut handouts such as child benefits for migrants in a bid to reduce soaring immigration . ‘It just shows how big a battle we’ve got to get anything close to a sensible position. Even when we’re asking for things that are not unreasonable, it just suggests they’re going to push us to the exit door.’ The case, to be heard at the European Court of Justice, centres on the ‘right-to-reside’ test that EU migrants must pass before they can claim benefits in this country. Labour introduced it in 2004 as concerns began to be raised about the ‘open doors’ policy that would eventually see more than one million Eastern Europeans arrive over a decade. The test allows officials to check if benefit claimants are ‘economically active’ – in a job, self-employed or looking for work – or able to support themselves. But since 2011, the European Commission has been telling the UK that the right-to-reside rule is discriminatory, as it makes it easier for native Britons to access social security than migrants. Last year, employment commissioner Laszlo Andor, a Hungarian economist known as the ‘most Left-wing man in Brussels’, said he would take the UK to court over the test. It can be disclosed today that court papers were lodged on June 27 this year. In the claim form, the EC calls on the European Court of Justice to ‘declare that the United Kingdom, by the requirement that a claimant for child benefit or child tax credit have a right to reside in the United Kingdom, has failed to comply with its obligations’ under rules that guarantee all European residents the right to benefits in other member states. Its argument goes on: ‘The Commission maintains that in requiring a claimant of child benefit and child tax credit to have a right to reside in the United Kingdom as a condition of being treated as resident there, the United Kingdom has imposed a condition that Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 does not permit. ‘Alternatively the Commission submits that by imposing a condition of entitlement to social security benefits that is automatically met by its own nationals, the United Kingdom has created a situation of direct discrimination against nationals of other member states.’ The EC originally intended the case to cover a wider range of payments, including state pension credit, jobseekers’ allowance and incapacity benefit – in total claimed by an estimated 400,000 migrants in the UK. But it will now just consider child benefit and child tax credit, after a European Court of Justice case earlier this month ruled that a migrant woman in Germany could not claim a jobseekers’ allowance because she was not looking for work but remained entitled to child benefit. If Britain were to lose the crucial case, unlikely to be settled before next May’s General Election, thousands of migrants with no intention of paying taxes would be able to claim child benefit here. Immigrants queue up outside a polling station in Portsmouth to vote for a new Romanian president . At £89 a month for one child, and available to all but the highest earners, it is far more generous than in countries such as Poland, where parents get less than £15 a month, or Greece, where it is just £3. A defeat would also be a huge setback in David Cameron’s plan, announced on Friday, to stop new arrivals claiming most benefits until they have paid four years’ worth of National Insurance. He is already facing having to convince other European leaders to agree to re-write key treaties. Professor Steve Peers, an expert in EU law at Essex University, said: ‘This is a very important case regarding whether the UK can deny benefits to other EU citizens and could potentially have a big impact on Mr Cameron’s renegotiation plans.’ A Treasury insider insisted the right-to-reside test was ‘vital and fair’, adding: ‘We are not only fighting this, but pressing ahead with plans to strengthen the UK benefits and tax credits system to ensure it cannot be abused.’ Next month, the Luxembourg-based court will pass judgment in a separate case about whether or not Britain can opt out of a decision to give Turkish migrants more rights to social security systems in Europe. The UK has already lost two similar cases involving other countries outside the EU. One senior figure in the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Juliane Kokott, has already said Britain should not be allowed to opt out of the new rules for Turkey because there is ‘no room’ for an ‘a la carte Europe’. A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘It’s simply wrong for Europe to attempt this power-grab, which is why we are fighting these cases.’","Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more migrants under EU plans .

"Giant rats, the size of cows or even bigger, could one day fill a ‘significant chunk’ of Earth’s emptying ecospace. The terrifying scenario could become a reality as super-adaptable rats take advantage of larger mammals becoming extinct, an expert predicts. ‘Animals will evolve, over time, into whatever designs will enable them to survive and to produce offspring,’ said geologist Dr Jan Zalasiewicz, from the University of Leicester. Rats could grow to the size of cows or even bigger as they evolve to fill vacant ecological niches, it is claimed. Pictured here is the capybara - the largest rodent in the world . Rats are one of the best examples of a species that humans have helped spread around the world. They have successfully adapted to many of the new environments they . have found themselves in - they are now on most islands and continue to . prosper and adapt. The . result is that each island that rats are now present on is in effect a . laboratory of future evolution – and each will produce different . adaptive results over time. Dr . Zalasiewicz suggests that as ecospace empties, rats will continue to . re-fill a significant chunk of it in the mid to far geological future. Given enough time, rats could grow to be at least as large as the capybara, the world’s largest rodent. For instance, in the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs lived, there were mammals, but these were very small, rat and mouse-sized, because dinosaurs occupied the larger ecological niches. Only once the dinosaurs were out of the way did these tiny mammals evolve into many different forms. ‘Given enough time, rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara, the world’s largest rodent, that lives today, that can reach 80 kilos (17lb). ‘If the ecospace was sufficiently empty, then they could get larger still.’ The . largest extinct rodent known, Josephoartegasia monesi, which lived . three million years ago, was larger than a bull and weighed over a . tonne. Like its modern-day relative, the sheep-sized capybara, it lived in South America. A . hint of the nightmare to come can be seen on ‘rat islands’ - isolated . regions where rats introduced by humans have quickly risen to become the . dominant species. Dr Jan Zalasiewicz predicts that rats could one day become equal to, or bigger, than cows. The average cow is around 147 cm (58 inches) in height and 152cm (60 inches) in length . The largest extinct rodent known, Josephoartegasia monesi, which lived three million years ago, was larger than a bull and weighed over a tonne . Rat islands act as a ‘laboratory’ for studying the future evolution of the rodents, according to Dr Zalasiewicz. ‘Rats are one of the best examples of a species that we have helped spread around the world, and that have successfully adapted to many of the new environments that they found themselves in,’ he said. ‘They are now on many, if not most, islands around the world - and once there, have proved extraordinarily hard to eradicate. If giant rats sounds . far-fetched, imagine a world with giant snakes as long as buses that are . so fat that they can only just squeeze through the door. Turtles the size of SmartCars would hunt crocodiles, while horses as small as cats could be found roaming fields. This . was Earth around 55 million years ago, according to U.S. researchers . who have been studying the link between the size of animals, reptiles . and a change in climate. Last . year, scientists warned massive reptiles and shrinking mammals could be . found on our planet again if global warming takes hold. Jonathan . Bloch, a paleontologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told a . conference in Gainesville that there is a clear link between global . warming and unusual animal fossils. Dr Bloch has been looking at a period known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum which occurred around 55 million years ago. At this time global temperatures rose by about 6 °C over a period of 200,000 years. Dr . Bloch has seen evidence of these strange creature first hand. Last year . he helped discover 60-million-year-old South American giant turtle that . lived in what is now Colombia. Given enough time, rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara, the world's largest rodent, that lives today. It can reach 80 kilos (17lb) and is shown in between the baby lama and runner duck . ‘They’re often there for good, essentially. Once there, they have out-competed many native species and at times have driven them to extinction. ‘As a result, ecospace is being emptied, and rats are in a good position to re-fill a significant chunk of it, in the mid to far geological future.’ Gigantism is a well-known evolutionary response that occurs when a small creature steps into an ecological niche left by a larger species. Fifty million years ago, a distant ancestor of the blue whale was the size of a wolf, Dr Zalasiewicz pointed out. He expected rats to adapt in a host of other ways, besides some of them growing to a large size. A hint of the nightmare to come can be seen on 'rat islands' - isolated regions where rats introduced by humans have quickly risen to become the dominant species . ‘Animals can evolve to smaller as well as larger sizes,’ he said. ‘This will depend on what particular circumstances they find themselves in and what the selective pressures on them are. ‘Each island that rats are now present on is in effect a laboratory of future evolution, and each will produce different results. ‘So there will be future thin rats, future fat rats, slow and heavy rats, fast and ferocious rats, probably future aquatic rats - the list goes on. ‘Other animals will likely follow the same pattern, such as domestic cats, rabbits, goats and more.; . He suspects that rats will have a major influence on the geological future of the Earth and over time were likely to produce ‘some remarkable descendants’.","Jan Zalasiewicz from Leicester University says rats will grow to 176lb .

"Researchers have uncovered the history of Ebola - and found it dates back far further than they expected. The research shows that filoviruses - a family to which Ebola and its similarly lethal relative, Marburg, belong - are at least 16-23 million years old. They say the discovery could help find new ways to create a vaccine. Scroll down for video . A digitally-colorized scanning electron micrograph (SEM) depicts filamentous Ebola virus particles (blue) budding from a chronically-infected VERO E6 cell (yellow-green). The new study is helping to rewrite Ebola's family history. Filoviruses likely existed in the Miocene Epoch, and at that time, the evolutionary lines leading to Ebola and Marburg had already diverged, the study concludes. The research was published in the journal PeerJ in September. It adds to scientists' developing knowledge about known filoviruses, which experts once believed came into being some 10,000 years ago, coinciding with the rise of agriculture. The new study pushes back the family's age to the time when great apes arose. 'Filoviruses are far more ancient than previously thought,' says lead researcher Derek Taylor, PhD, a University at Buffalo professor of biological sciences. 'These things have been interacting with mammals for a long time, several million years.' According to the PeerJ article, knowing more about Ebola and Marburg's comparative evolution could 'affect design of vaccines and programs that identify emerging pathogens.' The research does not address the age of the modern-day Ebola virus. Instead, it shows that Ebola and Marburg are each members of ancient evolutionary lines, and that these two viruses last shared a common ancestor sometime prior to 16-23 million years ago. Marburg virus disease (MVD) (formerly known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever) was first identified in 1967 during epidemics in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia from importation of infected monkeys from Uganda. MVD is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the one that causes Ebola virus disease. These viruses are among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans. Both diseases are rare, but have a capacity to cause dramatic outbreaks with high fatality. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with severe headache and severe malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple sites. The Marburg virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons. Transmission of the Marburg virus also occurred by handling ill or dead infected wild animals (monkeys, fruit bats). Taylor and co-author Jeremy Bruenn, PhD, UB professor of biological sciences, research viral 'fossil genes' — chunks of genetic material that animals and other organisms acquire from viruses during infection. The first Ebola outbreak in humans occurred in 1976, and scientists still know little about the virus' history. The same dearth of information applies to Marburg, which was recognized in humans in 1967 and implicated in the death of a Ugandan health worker this month. Understanding the virus' ancient past could aid in disease prevention, Taylor says. He notes that if a researcher were trying to create a single vaccine effective against both Ebola and Marburg, it could be helpful to know that their evolutionary lineages diverged so long ago. Knowing more about filoviruses in general could provide insight into which host species might serve as 'reservoirs' that harbor undiscovered pathogens related to Ebola and Marburg, Taylor says. 'When they first started looking for reservoirs for Ebola, they were crashing through the rainforest, looking at everything — mammals, insects, other organisms,' Taylor says. 'The more we know about the evolution of filovirus-host interactions, the more we can learn about who the players might be in the system.' In the new study, the authors report finding remnants of filovirus-like genes in various rodents. Ebola (pictured) and Marburg are each members of ancient evolutionary lines, and that these two viruses last shared a common ancestor sometime prior to 16-23 million years ago. One fossil gene, called VP35, appeared in the same spot in the genomes of four different rodent species: two hamsters and two voles. This meant the material was likely acquired in or before the Miocene Epoch, prior to when these rodents evolved into distinct species some 16-23 million years ago. In other words: It appears that the known filovirus family is at least as old as the common ancestor of hamsters and voles. 'These rodents have billions of base pairs in their genomes, so the odds of a viral gene inserting itself at the same position in different species at different times are very small,' Taylor says. 'It's likely that the insertion was present in the common ancestor of these rodents.' The genetic material in the VP35 fossil was more closely related to Ebola than to Marburg, indicating that the lines leading to these viruses had already begun diverging from each other in the Miocene. The new study builds on Taylor's previous work with Bruenn and other biologists, which used viral fossil genes to estimate that the entire family of filoviruses was more than 10 million years old. However, those studies used fossil genes only distantly related to Ebola and Marburg, which prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions about the age of these two viral lines. The current PeerJ publication fills this viral 'fossil gap,' enabling the scientists to explore Ebola's historical relationship with Marburg.","Found Ebola is related to Marburg, a lethal virus .

"A 2-year-old girl was accidentally shot and killed by her 5-year-old brother while he was playing with a child-size rifle given to him as a gift, authorities in Kentucky say. Caroline Starks, a blonde, blue-eyed girl, was fatally shot in the chest by her brother's .22-caliber rifle only minutes after her mother says she stepped outside their home in Burkesville on Tuesday. The single-shot weapon fired is a rifle specifically marketed to children as 'My First Rifle' by company Keystone Sporting Arms, according to authorities. Worst nightmare: Authorities say Caroline's older brother, pictured with her here, fired the single shot from his .22-caliber rifle called a Cricket, fatally shooting her in the chest . Killed: Caroline Sparks, 2, was killed on Tuesday when her 5-year-old brother accidentally shot her in the chest with his rifle . Tragic dwelling: The dilapidated home in Cumberland County, Ky, where a 2-year-old girl was shot by her 5-year-old brother . It was given to the 5-year-old as a gift last year, Cumberland County Coroner Gary White told the Lexington Herald-Leader. 'It's a Crickett,' White identified the weapon used. 'It's a little rifle for a kid. ...The little boy's used to shooting the little gun.' 'Accidents happen with guns,' he continued. 'They thought the gun was actually unloaded, and it wasn't.' 'It was god's will. It was her time to go, I guess,' Caroline's grandmother, Linda Riddle, told Lex18 on Wednesday. 'I just know she's in heaven right now and I know she's in good hands with the lord,' Riddle said. Weapon: The 5-year-old boy shot dead his sister with a Crickett .22 caliber rifle (like the one pictured) that he was given a year ago . Tailored for youngsters: Keystone Sporting Arms also makes guns for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The smaller guns come in all sorts of colors, including blue and pink . Starting them young: Children fire rifles at a shooting range in pictures shown on the crickett.com website . The company, Keystone Sporting Arms, produced 60,000 Crickett and . Chipmunk rifles in 2008, according to its website. It also makes guns . for adults, but most of its products are geared toward children. The . smaller guns come in all sorts of colors, including blue and pink. The company's slogan is 'my first . rifle' and its website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of . young boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing the children at . shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts. The smaller rifles are sold . with a mount to use at a shooting range. The . shooting highlights a cultural divide in the gun debate. While many . suburban and urban areas work to keep guns out of the hands of children, . it's not uncommon for youths in rural areas to own guns for target . practice and hunting. Controversial: The crickett.com website carries the slogan 'My First Rifle' and sells a range of weapons . Popular: The website has a 'Kids Corner' section where pictures of young boys and girls are displayed, most of them showing them at shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts . Showing off: The 'Kids Corner' section has dozens of images of children and even babies (left picture, far-right image on second row) posing with rifles at home and on the range . 'Down in Kentucky where we're from, . you know, guns are passed down from generation to generation. 'You start . at a young age with guns for hunting and everything,' White said on . Wednesday. What is more unusual than a child having a gun, he said, is 'that a kid would get shot with it.' 'The goal of KSA is to instill gun . safety in the minds of youth shooters and encourage them to gain the . knowledge and respect that hunting and shooting activities require and . deserve,' the website says. The coroner said the gun was kept in a corner and the family didn't realize a shell was left inside it. It's 'just one of those crazy accidents,' White said. Accident: The Cumberland County Coroner maintains that the girl's death was an accident as the child's family now mourns her unexpected loss . Heartbreak: The girl's grandmother said she's coping with the loss through religion while personally assured that she's gone to a better place . In . a brief news release, state police said the shooting occurred when the . boy was 'playing' with the rifle, but did not elaborate. It is not clear whether any charges will be filed, said Kentucky State Police spokesman Trooper Billy Gregory. 'I think it's too early to say whether there will or won't be,' Gregory said. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday. Burkesville is a small town, with a population of just under 1,800. Tragedy: The 2-year-old victim was transported to the Cumberland County Hospital in Burkesville, where she was pronounced dead . It is located in foothills of Appalachia.  The median household income in 2009 was estimated to be $17,747. Bill McNeal and his son Steve McNeal decided to make guns for young shooters in the mid-1990s and opened Keystone in 1996 with just four employees, producing 4,000 rifles that year. It now employs about 70 people, according to their website. No one at the company answered the phone on Wednesday.

"Police were called to a Seattle apartment on Sunday after a woman reported seeing a drone outside the window of her 26th-floor apartment. Lisa Pleiss was not fully dressed when she spotted the unmanned drone, with a video camera attached, hovering outside at about 7.45am. She contacted the building's concierge who reported the incident to the authorities after two men were seen packing up film equipment outside the building. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Lisa Pleiss says she felt violated after seeing a drone hovering outside her 26th-floor apartment . Exposed: Lisa, who was not dressed when the drone was outside, said she thought her apartment was private . Despite having floor-to-ceiling windows, Ms Pleiss thought her 26th-floor apartment would have more privacy, so she was shocked to see a drone. 'It was freaky. You don't . expect to be walking around indecent in your apartment and then have . this thing potentially recording you,' she told KGW8. She described the encounter as 'nerve wracking' and said that she had tried to get a picture of the drone, which was carrying video cameras, but that it moved too fast. 'It was really scary and just felt really violating. Here I can normally go around my house anyway I want and by no means did I feel that way,' she said. After local media reported on the incident on Monday, the drone's owner came forward to deny he was spying on residents in the building. Business: Joe Vaughn says his company was using the drone, right, to film for a property client . The drone, which had a video camera attached, was spotted outside the Seattle apartment building early Sunday morning . Joe Vaughn of Skyris Imaging said the drone belonged to his Portland company, and explained that it was being used to photograph the city's skyline for property developers. He said he contacted police immediately to give them details of his company, and said his company also sought permission before filming. Mr Vaughn called Ms Pleiss to apologize on Tuesday morning, and said his company planned to send her a copy of the picture of her building's view. He denied that the drone was used to spy, and said if the company accidentally filmed inappropriate images, they blurred them. 'People who want us to collect information about other people, they . aren't our clients,' Mr Vaughn said. Room with a view: The scene from Pleiss's 26th floor apartment. The drone she spotted was filming the skyline for developers . The use of drones have been a contentious issue in Seattle after the police announced plans to use them last year. The proposal was later dropped on the orders of the mayor, Mike McGinn, after protests from residents. Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam said that the legality of drone use was becoming a problem. He told Q13Fox: 'You’re already getting a great amount of these out there and safety is going to become an issue along with legalities of people looking at their neighbors, spying on things.'","Lisa Pleiss says she felt violated after spotting camera mounted on drone .

"With less than a week of the transfer window to go, clubs will be trying to tie up deals to get the players they want. Here Sportsmail looks at 10 transfers all football fans want to see happen before the February 2 deadline. Ezequiel Lavezzi - Paris Saint-Germain to Liverpool - £12m . The 29-year-old striker has reportedly fallen out of favour with PSG coach Laurent Blanc and wants a move away from France. Liverpool sent scouts to watch the 1-0 win over St Etienne on Sunday but Lavezzi only played nine minutes after coming on as a late substitute. The only stumbling block to any potential move is the fact that Lavezzi wants to play Champions League football - something Liverpool can't guarantee. Ezequiel Lavezzi (left) is available for £12million and was reportedly watched by Liverpool scouts on Sunday . Yevhen Konoplyanka - Dnipro to Everton - £7m . The 25-year-old winger is wanted by Everton and Tottenham, as well as Roma. Everton have asked but been told Konoplyanka is close to joining Spurs. However, the London club want to wait until the summer for a deal when the player is out of contract and Everton may be able to steal him away if they offer Dnipro enough money in the next week. Yevhen Konoplyanka (right) is in demand with Everton, Spurs and Roma keen on the winger . Marquinhos - PSG to Manchester United - £60m . Louis van Gaal is an admirer of the 20-year-old centre back and United have asked about his availability. United value the Brazilian at £30m but PSG have told them to beat the £50m they paid for David Luiz from Chelsea. With United's defence still adjusting to Van Gaal's tactics and the race for the Champions League heating up, the Dutchman may be tempted to put in a world-record bid for a defender to boost his chances of recording a successful first season at Old Trafford. Paris Saint-Germain centre back Marquinhos has been linked with a move away from the French champions . James McCarthy - Everton to Tottenham - £25m . Tottenham like the 24-year-old midfielder but will have to put in a mega offer to tempt Everton to sell a player Roberto Martinez brought with him from Wigan. Arsenal were primed with a bid before January but realised it would take at least £25m and Tottenham have considered offering Aaron Lennon and Younes Kaboul plus money, but it still may fall short this month. James McCarthy (left) is a transfer target for Tottenham but Everton do not wish to sell their man . Dimitar Berbatov - Monaco to QPR - £1m . The former Manchester United and Monaco striker reportedly wants to leave France and return to the Premier League due to a lack of playing time. The enigmatic 33-year-old could provide the lift QPR need in their fight against relegation. Dimitar Berbatov is handsomely paid in the principality but is wanted by a raft of Premier League clubs . James Milner - Manchester City to Liverpool - £8m . Liverpool have predominately focused on bringig in younger players but Brendan Rodgers is a fan of the Manchester City midfielder, who is refusing to sign a new contract. City are increasingly worried that the 29-year-old may leave at the end of the season on a free and could be tempted to sell this January. Reds target James Milner (left) tries to hold off Middlesbrough's Jelle Vossen during City's 2-0 FA Cup defeat . Kevin de Bruyne - Wolfsburg to Manchester City - £30m . The former Chelsea man has blossomed since moving back to Germany, so much so that his international team-mate Vincent Kompany has urged City to buy him. With their title challenge faltering, Manuel Pellegrini has splashed the cash on £28m Wilfried Bony but De Bruyne will provide added creativity from midfield that City have been lacking. Manchester City are interested in former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who is now at Wolfsburg . Petr Cech - Chelsea to Liverpool - £7m . Much of Liverpool's problems this season have stemmed from the mistakes of Simon Mignolet in goal and they have been linked with a host of keepers this window. The 32-year-old Cech's agent certainly hasn't played down a move to Anfield, but with Mark Schwarzer having already left Stamford Bridge this month a deal looks more likely in the summer. Liverpool need a keeper and can't afford any more mistakes if they want Champions League football next season, which may force them to act quickly. Petr Cech looks helplessly on after conceding against Bradford during Chelsea's 4-2 defeat on Saturday . Memphis Depay - PSV to Tottenham - £16m . The Dutch winger shot to prominence after an impressive World Cup last summer and has also been linked with a reunion with Van Gaal at Manchester United. Tottenham are keen to sign the 20-year-old before the end of the window, however, having missed out on him last year. Memphis Depay scores for PSV against SC Cambuur Leeuwarden earlier this month . Diego de Girolamo - Sheffield United to Juventus FREE . The Italy Under 20 international is out of contract in the summer and has so far not signed a new deal offered to him by the club. Scouts have been watching the 19-year-old play for United's Under 20s and during his two loan spells at York. Italian scouts saw him score against Germany and he has been recommended to Serie A leaders Juventus. Sheffield United have offered a new contract to their highly-rated teenager Diego de Girolamo .","Ezequiel Lavezzi, Petr Cech and James Milner all linked with Liverpool .

The most valuable, however, is Constantine, made in 1905 and worth £15,000 all on his own. Mr Pang has spent the last 12 years amassing an enormous collection of rare toy bears dating back to the early 1900s worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. The eccentric collector has become so attached to his bears that he takes them wherever he goes, including to the theatre and top restaurants. These five bears are from a collection of 32, which will be auctioned next month and tipped to fetch £100,000 . 'When I started work in 2002 my office was opposite a teddy bear shop and after walking past it every day I finally caved and bought my first bear for about £100,' said the Oxford University graduate. 'I instantly fell in love with bears and I started collecting more and more, as a hobby and as an investment. Great investment: The bears belong to collector Jena Pang (pictured) and include some of the world's most significant examples . 'Originally I collected modern bears but then I realised that the vintage bears were where the value was. 'Most of my bears come from the early 1900s with the earliest dating back to 1904. 'They are more than just collector's items - they come with me most places I go, whether it be to dinner, the theatre or away on travel. 'I am selling them because I am planning on moving to Hong Kong and the bears simply wouldn't survive the humidity. 'As a collector it it my responsibility to ensure the survival of these bears so they can be enjoyed by future generations and unfortunately that means selling them. 'I will be very sad to see them go but it is better than risking losing them altogether.' The bears will be auctioned at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berkshire on December 4. Daniel Agnew, auctioneer, said: 'This collection is simply the finest single-owner collection of vintage bears to come up for sale in many years. 'The thing that makes it so special is the sheer number of bears that are in mint condition. The majority of them are over 100 years old yet they look like they were made yesterday. 'You might see one or two vintage bears in this condition at an auction but to have 32 in one sale is unheard of. 'Needless to say collectors around the world are very excited about this sale.' The oldest bear in his collection is a 'rod' bear from 1904. These are the first teddy bears made and can sell for over £4,500 .","Jena Pang spent the last 12 years amassing a collection of rare Steiff bears .

"Passengers have been struck down by an outbreak of gastric illness and confined to their cabins for the second time this month on a luxury ship operated by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines. It is not known how many passengers have been hit by the vomiting bug on the MV Balmoral, which is sailing to its home port in Southampton. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines confirmed staff are attempting to contain an ‘extremely contagious gastric illness’, just days after the ship underwent a ‘deep clean’ in response to an earlier outbreak. Passengers who have been struck down by the bug on the MV Balmoral are being confined to their cabins . A relative of a passenger who is currently on board the Balmoral said quarantine restrictions have been imposed at least twice during the 13-night return journey from Southampton to the Azores and Madeira. The relative told MailOnline Travel at least one swimming pool and casino tables were made off-limits to those on the vessel. It left the UK on May 11 and is scheduled to return on Sunday on a voyage priced from approximately £1,000 per person. The ship, which has a capacity of 1,350, is scheduled to depart the same day on a seven-night cruise to Amsterdam and Antwerp. A spokeswoman for Fred Olsen Cruise Lines told MailOnline Travel: ‘It is very frustrating that, even though we went to great lengths to “deep clean” and sanitise the ship before this cruise set sail, a number of guests have been affected by gastric illness. ‘The number of guests affected is smaller than on the previous sailing, but it is very disappointing that any guests should have their cruise holiday impacted in this unfortunate way. The Balmoral is nearing the end of a 13-night return journey from Southampton to the Azores and Madeira . ‘As always, we are doing all that we can to contain the spread of this extremely contagious gastric illness, in line with Fred Olsen's approved prevention and control plan. The spokeswoman said guests who are ill are required to remain in their cabins, with complimentary room service and entertainment, to minimise contact with other guests. It is not the first time Fred Olsen cruise passengers have been hit by gastric illnesses. Between October 2009 and May 2010, 130 passengers fell ill on its cruise liner Boudicca, a sister ship of that involved in the latest incident. In 2014, the company paid out £280,000 compensation to those affected. In March and April 2011, 12 passengers sailing around the Mediterranean became ill, again on Boudicca, with some later given £10,000 payouts. Then in 2013, the company reported an outbreak of 'a gastroenteritis-type illness' on Boudicca after it left Belfast for a 10-night 'Scandinavian Cities Cruise'. In that case, 72 passengers were affected. This was followed by an outbreak on the Balmoral earlier this month as it sailed to the Norwegian fjords. A law firm said it has been contacted by passengers to investigate the cause of their illness. She added: ‘The gastro-enteritis virus is spread very easily by contact with surfaces and from person-to-person, and all Fred Olsen guests are made aware of the importance of meticulous hygiene at all times.’ Earlier this month it was estimated hundreds of passengers were hit by a vomiting bug – believed to be norovirus – that forced Fred Olsen to cut short an eight-day cruise to the Norwegian fjords. The earlier outbreak on the ship – which was carrying 1,163 passengers at the time – was so bad it returned to its home port a day early to be ‘systematically sanitised’ ahead of its trip to the Azores and Madeira. Some of those who fell ill with diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever have instructed a law firm to investigate the cause of their illness. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines believed the illness was brought onto the ship, as the first case was reported within hours of its departure from Southampton on May 3, and it takes 12 to 48 hours for norovirus symptoms to appear. The company said it asks guests complete a medical questionnaire before each voyage, and reminds them to use sanitising hand gel and take other precautions on board. It also said frequent cleaning of all areas of the ship is carried out. The spokeswoman said: ‘At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of all our guests and crew is paramount, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry.’","The 1,350-passenger ship is currently sailing back to Southampton .

"A diabetic Brooklyn man says was escorted out of a movie theater Sunday for eating strawberries. Michael Kass, of Park Slope, was told by multiple employees he could not bring the berries into the theater but did so anyway. Kass, a type 2 diabetic, was at the Pavillion Theater to see ‘Divergent’ when the incident occurred. The guilty party: Michael Kass was escorted out of the theater by police for refusing to throw away strawberries . The berries were first spotted by a ticket collector who said he had to throw them out, Kass explained to NBC. He pleaded his case to a theater manager and then asked for a refund but was told no. ‘I probably thought I was calling her bluff,’ he said. ‘I didn't in a million years think they would actually call the cops on me for bringing strawberries into a movie theater.’ Kass walked into the theater with the berries and the police arrived soon after. It happened here: The movie theater that doesn't allow strawberries for people with diabetes . The man told NBC that he hopes this will convince theaters to add healthier snacks than the usual tooth-rotting and gut-busting fare. ‘I'm fully hoping to get gouged on strawberries,’ he joked. ‘I hope they charge me up the wazoo for them.’ The theater did not return a message left for comment.","Michael Kass suffers from type 2 diabetes .

"A Bulgarian politician today survived an extraordinary assassination attempt when a man stormed the stage and held a gun to his head as he was giving a speech. Fortunately for Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the weapon misfired giving him time to react and hit the would-be assassin's hand out of the way.

"A nurse who caught Ebola while treating the first patient diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. said today that she wasn't careless or a risk-taker and defended her decision to board a flight shortly before being diagnosed. Miss Vinson, 29, caught Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan in October at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She described her worst days fighting the Ebola virus in a special quarantine unit as a 'blur' where she felt awful and was unsure she would survive. Some have criticized the ICU nurse for her decision to fly from Texas to Ohio on October 10 after she treated Duncan. Nurse Vinson flew to her home state for the weekend to plan for her wedding next year to former college football star Derrick Markray. Scroll down for video . Nurse Amber Vinson, 29, contracted Ebola last month but has since recovered from the virus. She defended her decision to board a flight after treating an Ebola patient after she was cleared by her hospital. Miss Vinson is due to marry fiancé Derrick Markray (right) next year. Mr Markray is a former college football star who went on to the New Orleans Saints . Miss Vinson was pictured last month being transferred to Emory hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after being diagnosed with the Ebola virus . Miss Vinson, pictured this week, has spoken to an array of media outlets after she was criticized for traveling on a commercial flight after treating Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan . She told Today on Thursday that she would never have put anyone at risk and  was never told by her ICU management team or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that it was unsafe to travel. The nurse said she was completely healthy and 'felt great' when she landed in Cleveland, Ohio, to visit her mother, Debra Berry. She told People Magazine: 'I hung out with my mom and her dog, and we ordered pizza and relaxed. The next day, I went out to the bridal store with some of my bridesmaids and we had a great time.' She said that while in Ohio she learned that her fellow ICU nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, had contracted Ebola and that the news 'floored her'. Miss Pham worked the day shift caring for Mr Duncan, a Liberian national who had traveled to the U.S. at the end of September, before Miss Vinson took over on the night shift. Miss Vinson said: 'I was afraid for myself, for my family, because I did everything that I was instructed to do, every time, and I felt like, ''If Nina can get it, any one of us could have gotten it.''' Miss Vinson said reports that she had been feeling 'weird' before she boarded her return flight  were 'completely false' and deeply hurtful. She checked her temperature multiple times before boarding the plane and it was normal. Miss Vinson, 29, is pictured above during her Ebola treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. She was declared free of the virus on October 28 . 'I never felt ''weird,''' she said on Thursday. 'I felt fine, I felt completely normal.' Due to her concern, Miss Vinson called Texas Health before boarding her return flight and was once again cleared to travel. It was only once she landed in Dallas that she discovered that she had a temperature of 100.3F and reported to the hospital. When her fever became worse and she developed sickness and diarrhea, Miss Vinson said she knew that she had developed Ebola. She told People that her mom was strong but the news deeply-affected her fiancé. ""I was sitting next to Derrick, and I saw one big tear hang from his eye and fall... I rubbed his back and then I turned around and cried,' she told People. She said her condition initially worsened and that she prayed to God to save her life. But as she began to feel better she was able to contact family and friends via Skype and sent text messages with her colleague Nina. She said reports that she had traveled with Ebola symptoms had left her feeling 'terrible'. 'I'm not careless, I don't take risks. I'm an ICU nurse... I embrace protocol and guidelines because in my line of work it's a matter of life and death,' she said. The nurse admitted that she had not been given thorough training before treating Mr Duncan in the highly contagious stages of the Ebola virus. She described the training to People as 'a crash-course education'. She said: 'We did not get much training. The first time I put on the protective equipment, I was heading in to take care of the patient. We didn't get training in putting on and taking off the equipment... so we could feel comfortable with it.' Miss Vinson said that after treating Mr Duncan, she would dream about work and going over every little detail of her care while continually taking her temperature. Medics are seen assisting the 29-year-old nurse as she walks into to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta . The 29-year-old was infected while caring for Mr Duncan who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas on October 8. She told People that his death left her 'distraught'. She inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids, all while wearing protective gear. Ebola is only caught through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is contagious. Miss Vinson didn't show symptoms before flying to Cleveland, Ohio on October 10. She reported her temperature to the CDC, as part of self-monitoring guidelines, on October 13, and was cleared to fly back to Dallas. The next day, the nurse developed a temperature, and on October 15, she tested positive for Ebola. In Ohio, 163 people were  monitored due to contact or potential contact with Miss Vinson in a bridal shop and on flights. To date, no cases of Ebola have been reported. She was initially treated at her own Dallas hospital before being transferred to a specialized unit at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia. Miss Vinson received blood plasma from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly. She was declared free of the disease on October 28 and said today that she is feeling good but gets 'a little tired as the day goes on'. A family friend set up a GoFundMe account which has raised $20,000 for Miss Vinson. The nurse said that she would absolutely treat someone with Ebola again as it is her duty to take care of anyone that she sees is suffering. Her colleague Nina Pham, 26, who also was infected with Ebola was released on October 24 from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after being declared virus-free.","Miss Vinson, 29, caught the deadly virus from Thomas Eric Duncan but recovered after being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta .

"3D printing has been used to make everything from toys and plaster casts to parts for jet engines. And now one German automotive company has unveiled a revolutionary conceptual car body that it claims will only be made possible by using what is termed as 'additive manufacturing' or large-scale 3D printing. The internal structure is inspired by the shape of a turtle skeleton and is designed so that it will provide incredible protection and cushioning, just like the animal’s shell. Scroll down for video . A German automotive company has unveiled a conceptual futuristic car body (pictured) that it claims will only be possible thanks to the 3D printing process . EDAG created the concept to show what it thinks will be possible in the way of car manufacturing using 3D printing. Its structure is inspired by the shape of a turtle shell and is designed to provide protection and cushioning. In the future the car's internal body could be made using high-resolution fuse deposition modelling (FDM) machines. The internal structure would be 3D printed using a mixture of thermoplastic materials and carbon fibre. A metal casing would shield the 3D printed internal frame. Experts believe the concept is over a decade away from becoming reality. In the future the car body could be made in one piece using high-resolution fuse deposition modelling (FDM) machines and then sheathed in metal to protect it. EDAG’s ‘Genesis’ concept has gone on show at the Geneva Auto Show, which is focused on the future of car design. The car body is intended to be built using 3D printing and a mixture of carbon fibre and plastic. The company says its concept is ‘designed to demonstrate the revolutionary potential of additive manufacturing.’ The structure (illustrated bottom) is inspired by the shape of a turtle shell and is designed so that it will provide protection and cushioning, just like the animal's shell (pictured top) In the future the car body (illustrated) could be made in one piece using high-resolution fuse deposition modelling (FDM) machines . EDAG claims that cars based on organic structures ‘cannot be built using conventional tools’. The firm believes that 3D printers will one . day manufacture a car's entire body and envision a continuous strand of carbon . fibre being used within the printing process, helping to create an ultra-  strong outer shell of a vehicle in one piece. While hi-tech plastic might seem like an odd choice of material to build a car’s body from, the company said: ‘Unlike other technologies, FDM makes it possible for components of almost any size to be produced, as there are no pre-determined space requirements to pose any restrictions. 'Instead, the structures are generated by having robots apply thermoplastic materials.’ Cars need to be strong to withstand collisions so the German firm plans to introduce 'endless carbon fibres' to the 3D printed frame (illustrated) during the production process, which they say will give the body the strength and stiffness needed .

'I only saw it for a split second, just a head and a tail. I had a bit of an adrenalin rush, so I didn't really feel it.' Afterwards, he rode his bike 2km home and ate some breakfast, before his father demanded he go to hospital. 'I had some raisin toast, it was good,' Pearman said.

"A drunk driver murdered a pensioner by running him over in his van and dragging him 650ft just four weeks after getting his licence back from a previous ban, court heard. Josef Moscicki mowed down 83-year-old Bernard Smith in the early hours of Christmas Day last year after downing vodka and coke in a nightclub. Mr Smith - who was known as Jim - broke multiple bones and suffered horrific head injuries after he was dragged the equivalent distance of two football pitches. Moscicki,23, even returned to the scene in Stafford and deliberately drove over Mr Smith again as he lay dying in the road. Josef Moscicki (pictured left) was told he would serve a minimum of 21 years behind bars for the murder of 83-year-old Bernard Smith (pictured right) on Christmas Day last year . A court heard he had only just been given his licence back after an earlier ban for two drink-driving convictions in 2011. Moscicki, of Wokingham, Berkshire, admitted death by dangerous driving but denied murder. And he was found guilty of murdering the pensioner by a 10-2 majority after a five-week trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday. Sentencing Moscicki to life in prison, Judge John Warner told him he would spend a minimum of 21 years behind bars. 'Why Mr Smith was in Burns Avenue, we will never know' said Judge Warner. 'But he had the misfortune to come into contact with you in that van. 'I am satisfied that you were in a volatile, hyped-up state. You later went out in your van in an unfit state to drive. 'Mr Smith was wearing a high visibility jacket and the street lighting was good. 'The transit van was driven aggressively. I am satisfied this is linked to the collision of the van with Mr Smith. 'The jury has decided you intended to cause him at least serious injury. 'It was a truly horrific way for Mr Smith to lose his life. I know that no sentence I can pass can reduce the sense of loss felt by his family.' During the trial, the court heard Moscicki had gone out drinking in Stafford after joining his girlfriend, who lived in the town, for Christmas. He left the nightclub and disappeared to get a taxi after arguing with his partner and her relative . But he ran away from the taxi without paying the fare and had another row with his girlfriend when he arrived at her family's home. He then got into his white Transit van and careered along Burns Avenue in the town when he struck Mr Smith who was crossing the road. The court heard Moscicki failed to see the pensioner, who was walking home from a local social club, despite him wearing a high-visibility jacket. His body was found slumped at the junction of Shakespeare Road and Wordsworth Avenue on the Highfields estate in Stafford and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Prosecutor Robert Price told the jury: 'During the course of that journey along that stretch of road for 200m (656ft) Mr Smith received grave injuries as his body connected with the road surface. 'We say the features of the evidence demonstrate a clear and settled intention to cause Mr Smith at the very least really serious injury and at the worst to cause his death.' Moscicki then drove at an officer forcing him to jump out of the way when police spotted the van and attempted to stop it . The court heard Mr Smith's body sustained bruises, fractures to the ribs and pelvis, a broken leg, torn ligaments and a blood haemorrhage to his brain. Moscicki claimed he had no recollection of running the pensioner over but told the jury Christmas was 'never going to be the same'. He said: 'If I had known I had done that (hitting Mr Smith) I wouldn't forget that. It is something that will impact on your memory. 'It is upsetting and it is a sad thing that has happened. Christmas is never going to be the same for his family or for me. 'It is always going to be the day that Mr Smith died.' After the hearing, Mr Smith's family paid an emotional tribute to the 'kind and caring' pensioner. His three nieces, Jackie Hodson, Michaela Wright and Jaqueline Atherden, were present for the majority of the five-week trial. In a statement read out in court, Ms Hodson said: 'My uncle Jim was my last connection to my mum. He lived a quiet and unobtrusive life, keeping himself to himself. 'I found myself spending more and more time with him, keeping him company. I have realised my uncle Jim was the final key link that had held my family together. 'I now know fully what a kind and caring man he was.' Ms Atherden added: 'I was shocked and devastated to be told he had been killed. This was an elderly gentleman who you would expect to die peacefully in his sleep. 'The morning he was killed I came home to find a Christmas card on my doorstep from him that he must have posted before. It seems so unreal. 'My Christmas morning was spent phoning my family and friends to tell them the news. 'Uncle Jim was a very quiet, intelligent man who had spent most of his life looking after other people. He would never harm anyone and kept himself to himself. 'He had served his country in Korea, was a member of the Royal Engineers and a member of the Royal British Legion.' Speaking in a statement issued by police, the family added: 'Words cannot express the pain and anguish our family and friends have suffered since the brutal and tragic death of Uncle Jim. 'We have sat in court and listened and cried at the horrific injuries he suffered and the image of him lying there on his own is too much to bear.' Detective Chief Inspector Darren Harding, who led the investigation for Staffordshire Police, added: 'The conviction and sentence is to be welcomed and I hope it brings some comfort to Mr Smith's family. 'The death of any person in such circumstances is always deeply tragic, but at Christmas time it seems especially worse. 'We may never know why Moscicki was behind the wheel but his intentional actions ultimately led to the untimely death of a well-loved man who was walking home after a Christmas Eve out.'","Josef Moscicki was jailed for life for the murder of Bernard Smith, 83 .

"Ukranian model Valeria Lukyanova, who lives her life as a 'human Barbie' has revealed she doesn't consume food or water anymore. Some have said she uses plastic surgery and Photoshop to create her doll-like image, but her impossibly thin waist could actually be down to not eating for weeks. The model, 23, has said she is now converting to 'Breatharianism' - training herself to live off only light and air. Scroll down for video . Minute! Valeria had indicated that her tiny waist was a genetic gift from mom, saying, 'My mother¿s waist is as narrow as mine - I inherited that from her' 'In recent weeks I have not been . hungry at all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on . air and light alone,' she has said. The model and singer's new vice, . Breatharianism, is a cult that believes food - and possibly water - are not necessary. A breatharian is said to be someone who never . eats or drinks as they can exist on 'cosmic micro-food', according to . the International Business Times. The practice is criticised as potentially . lethal pseudoscience, and several practitioners have reportedly died of . starvation. None have submitted themselves for comprehensive medical . testing. With her pinched waist, skeletal arms, . enormous coloured contact lenses, thick make-up and vacant expression, . Valeria believes she has become a living, breathing Barbie - something . she sees as the ultimate embodiment of perfection. All genes? The model, spiritual teacher and self-professed 'alien' says she has never had plastic surgery, except for a breast augmentation . She . has courted international controversy by turning herself into a human . doll, confessing she wishes to be considered 'the most perfect woman on . the internet'. Based on the photos on her social media accounts, Valeria is sporting an increasingly thin frame. This is not the first time that Valeria declared something unusual. She has said that she is a spiritual teacher and can speak with . aliens through light, she thinks that has the ability to time travel and has had out-of-body experiences.

"New boss: Oil giant BG has sparked a pay row by handing its new chief executive Helge Lund (pictured) a bumper pay package worth up to £29m . Oil giant BG has sparked a pay row by handing its new chief executive a bumper package worth up to £29m, making him one of Europe's best-paid oil bosses. Helge Lund was poached from the far larger Norwegian rival Statoil to become its chief executive from March next year, with a package that has been criticised as ‘excessive’. He will be paid £1.5million a year, as well as bonuses worth up to £3million and another share incentive scheme that could pay out up to £9million if he hits performance targets and manages to turn around the flagging British oil and gas producer, based in Reading, Berkshire. Additionally, he could get another £12million in shares over the next five years if the pay committee decides he is doing a good job at Britiain's third-largest energy firm. This particular measure is so controversial that the company shareholders are being asked to vote for it at a special meeting. BG will also generously compensate Lund for the potential share awards he is leaving behind at Statoil to the tune of £3million. Lund, who celebrates his 52nd birthday today, is also being given £480,000 to move his family to Britain, and will have £450,000 a year put into his pension pot as part of the staggering deal. He resigned from his post of CEO of Statoil with immediate effect yesterday to take up the BG role next year. After a run of disappointing candidates, BG insisted it had to pay top whack to get a man suitable to lead the company. BG has been struggling following a string of production downgrades that cost the previous CEO, Chris Finlayson his job in April this year. Finlayson had himself taken over from long-serving Sir Frank Chapman in early 2013 but there were a number of profit warnings during his time in charge . Andrew Gould, BG’s executive chairman, defended the pay deal, saying: ‘The company needs a proven leader from the oil and gas industry to deliver the exceptional opportunities available to it.’ Luke Hildyard, deputy director of the independent think tank High Pay Centre, told MailOnline that the £29million pay package used to entice Lund to the BG post was 'extraordinary'. 'To be paying anyone a package worth up to £29million is too much to be paying anyone, especially who is a bureaucrat, a manager of a company, ' he said. 'The fact that it is seen as acceptable, a regular price to pay for a CEO represents a failure for corporate governance across the UK and that the reforms Vince Cable introduced are not really working.' The Business Secretary introduced changes which gave shareholders the power to stop pay packages that were too generous, enabling them to vote on company pay policies every three years. 'If you think about it you could reduce that package by one per cent of £29million and it would still put you easily in the top one per cent of UK earners and able to afford a lifestyle beyond the imaginations of most people,' said Mr Hildyard. 'He's getting 100 times more than someone who would still be seen as incredibly rich - why is that necessary?' 'The reforms the government brought in do not seem to have had much effect and the telephone number salaries have not stopped. Last year for a FTSE company CEO the going rate was still £4 or £5million and without further action I don't think we are going to see executive pay levels come down to something that is fairer and more proportionate.' In ten years Oslo native Lund was able to transform Norway's once domestic-focused state oil firm into a $77 billion global player. Package: Lund, who celebrates his 52nd birthday today, is also being given £480,000 to move his family to Britain, and will have £450,000 a year put into his pension pot as part of the staggering deal . Last year at Statoil he had earned a base salary of around £720,000, as part of a total package of a £1.3million package. '(Lund) has built a world-class exploration and production portfolio at Statoil, and the company is now widely admired for its technical expertise, financial performance and strong, values-based culture,' said Mr Gould. BG was formed in 1997 when part of the state-owned British Gas  was privatised and split off from other areas of the business, which now operate as Centrica and British Gas. Shares have fallen 20 percent since the start of the year as its important Egyptian gas business performed disastrously due to lower production for exports and its huge investments in Brazil have yet to prove their value. 'In terms of global industry leaders, it is hard to imagine a more suitable candidate,' Investec said in a note. Analysts have suggested that the company might be better focused if it were to spin off either its successful liquefied natural gas (LNG) business or its deepwater Brazilian interests, which promise more than six billion barrels of oil equivalents in recoverable reserves. Salary: £1.5million per year . Assorted bonuses: Up to £3million . Share incentive scheme: Up to £9million . Shares: Up to £12million (in shares) Compensation for leaving Statoil share benefits behind: £3million . Moving his family: £480,000 . Pension: £450,000 per year . 'For leaders, there comes a time when it's right to move on, both for themselves and for the company they run,' said Lund, who added that BG had approached him about the role six to eight weeks ago. 'I've wanted one more leadership challenge. I think I'm too young to retire. This (BG) is a challenge I find exciting, and that's the main motivation.' One of BG's biggest future projects may be an LNG plant in Tanzania, to be jointly built with Statoil, after the firms found more than 30 billion cubic feet of gas in several nearby offshore licence areas. 'BG's key priorities are the delivery of the large new projects, managing decline in its mature regions, the monetisation of some assets and a reinvigoration of its exploration pipeline. Helge Lund has proved successful at this, while at the helm of Statoil,' analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note. Statoil has already appointed Eldar Saetre, currently head of its marketing, processing and renewables division, as its acting chief executive while the firm searches for a permanent replacement for Lund.","Helge Lind poached by British company BG from Norwegian rival Statoil .

"Shunned: James Watson (pictured) sparked an outcry when he suggested that people of African descent were less intelligent than white people . A scientist who was part of the team that discovered DNA has been forced to sell his Nobel Prize after he was shunned by the scientific community for comments that linked race and intelligence. James Watson sparked an outcry in 2007 when he suggested in an interview with the Sunday Times that people of African descent were inherently less intelligent than white people. The American scientist said he had become an 'unperson' since making the controversial remarks and is now selling his prize in a bid to 're-enter public life'. The medal, the first to be auctioned by a living recipient, is expected to fetch as much as £2.5million when it goes under the hammer at Christie's in New York next week. Dr Watson shared the 1962 Nobel Prize, awarded for uncovering the double helix structure of DNA, with British scientists Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick. The discovery was made by Watson and Crick, who used experimental data that had been gathered by Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. Dr Watson, 86, said that he was fired from the boards of a number of companies after making the inflammatory race comments, adding that he has not given any public lectures since. He told the Financial Times: 'No one really wants to admit I exist'. He said he would use the money from the sale of the medal to supplement his income, which now comes solely from academic institutions. Dr Watson added that he would use some of the proceeds to give back to institutions that have supported him, including the University of Chicago, where he was awarded his undergraduate degree, and Clare College, Cambridge. He revealed that he would also like to buy an artwork, telling the newspaper that he would like to own a piece by David Hockney. He admitted that the comments had been 'stupid' on his part, and insisted he is not racist 'in a conventional way'. He said: 'I apologise ... (the journalist) somehow wrote that I worried about the people in Africa because of their low IQ - and you're not supposed to say that.' Pioneers: Dr Watson (left) shared the 1962 Nobel Prize, awarded for uncovering the double helix structure of DNA, with British scientists Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick (right) Esteemed: Dr Watson, now 86, is seen right accepting the Nobel Prize. His award (left) is the first to be auctioned by a living recipient and is expected to fetch as much as £2.5million when it goes under the hammer . Auctioneer Francis Wahlgren told the Financial Times he did not expect Dr Watson's previous remarks to affect the sale. He said: 'There are a lot of personalities in history we'd find fault with - but their discoveries transcend human foibles.' The auction includes papers belonging to Watson, including handwritten notes for his acceptance speech. Courting controversy: Dr Watson's views were also expressed in a book, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, that was published in 2007 . In an interview with The Sunday Times Magazine on 14 October 2007, Dr Watson was quoted as saying he is 'gloomy about the prospect of Africa' because 'all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours ? whereas all the testing says not really'. He said he hoped everyone was equal, but added: 'People who have to deal with black employees find this not true.' The views were also included in a book, published that week, in which he wrote that 'there is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically'. He said: 'Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so.' Four days later, the scientist was banned  from speaking at London's Science Museum. At the time, a spokkesman said: 'The Science Museum feels that Nobel Prize winner James Watson's recent comments have gone beyond the point of acceptable debate.' Days later, the scientist attempted to justify his theory that there is a genetic basis behind differences in IQ. He told The Independent: 'I have never been one to shy away from stating what I believe to be the truth'. He added, 'this has, at times, got me in hot water.' That week, Dr Watson was forced to cancel a book tour of the UK and fly back to the US after he was suspended by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island. Since the race row erupted, Dr Watson claimed that he was fired from the boards of a number of companies.","James Watson sparked race row after 2007 interview with Sunday Times .

"Four U.S. states and the federal government have padded Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber's wallet to the tune of $5.9 million since 2000, including millions connected to his work on the Affordable Care Act. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist has been pilloried for collecting $392,600 from the Obama administration's Health and Human Services Department while the law was being written, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Gruber's consulting contracts give states and the feds access to a proprietary formula that can determine how changes in a health care system's structure will affect costs. The 'Gruber Microsimulation Model' is what he sold to the White House. It helped Obama's team anticipate what the influential Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would say about various features of the final plan – and whether their costs would officially be considered 'taxes.' Scroll down for video . THE LATEST VIDEO: Jonathan Gruber told a Virginia healthcare research company in 2012 that he helped Massachusetts 'rip off' the feds for $400 million per year by shifting Medicare funds to cover the uninsured – and 'Romneycare' was born . Better days: In May 2009 Gruber was testifying before congressional panels as a respected economist with the magic touch and the ear of every Democrat in Washington . Gruber found himself in hot water this week when an old video surfaced in which he explains how the Obama administration wriggled out of legislative trouble by hiding 'Cadillac taxes' on expensive medical insurance policies – by shifting the costs to insurers and trusting them to pass the financial burden on to their customers. 'The stupidity of the American voter' let him get away with it, he said in one videotaped speech at the University of Pennsylvania. Gruber explained that the Obamacare law 'was written in a tortured way to make sure the CBO did not score the [individual insurance] mandate as taxes.' 'If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.' The Washingon Post reported Friday that the National Institutes of Health put about $2.05 million in Gruber's pocket since 2008 for consulting work related to Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The Justice Department has added $1.7 million more – mostly for 'expert witness' testimony – since 2000. And the State Department paid Gruber $103,500 in 2008 and 2009 for what the government vaguely calls legal services, according to an analysis by The Daily Caller. ILL HEALTH: The Obamacare law is wildly unpopular, according to an average of public polls, and the Gruber controversy will give Republicans new momentum to argue for its repeal . Of the eight U.S. states that have contracted with Gruber to get access to his computer model – Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin – four of them have published contracts worth about $400,000 each. If the other four followed suit, that would amount to another $1.6 million. Some of those fees were shared with other researchers who co-authored his reports. All eight used his services to help estimate insurance marketplace costs related to their state-based Obamacare programs. Gruber also worked extensively on the so-called 'Romneycare' law, a Massachusetts health insurance plan that formed the intellectual and philosophical underpinnings of Obamacare, and reportedly won a consulting contract with the state of California. The Vermont model he built along with Harvard School of Public Health economist William Hsiao is an attempt to construct a 'single-payer' insurance system that puts government in charge of health care costs for everyone in the state. The sixth in a long line of embarrassing videos emerged Friday, showing the two academics testifying before lawmakers there. One legislator quoted a newspaper op-ed warning that 'any Hsiao-Gruber-type health care mega-system will inevitably lead to coercive mandates, ballooning costs, increasing taxes, bureaucratic outrages, shabby facilities, disgruntled providers, long waiting lines, lower-quality care, special-interest nest-feathering, and destructive wage and price controls.' In the video, brought to light by Watchdog.org, Gruber is seen responding: 'Was this written by my adolescent children by any chance?' The room erupted in laughter, but the comment had actually come from the pen of two-term Vermont state senator John McClaughry, by then serving as vice president of the conservative Ethan Allen Institute. A St. Louis, Missouri blogger unearthed records on Friday showing that Gruber met with President Obama at the White House on July 20, 2009. That backed up a PBS Frontline interview he gave in 2012, in which he positioned himslelf as a major player in the Obamacare law's evolution. He saw Obama, he said, in 'summer 2009.' 'The big issue there is that he really wants to make sure I’m moving forward on cost control. I think that at this point he sort of knew we had a good plan on coverage, but he was worried on cost control.' 'So we had a meeting in the Oval Office with several experts, including myself,' Gruber continued, 'on what can we do to get credible savings on cost control that the Congressional Budget Office would recognize and score as savings in this law.'","MIT economist got $392,600 from the Dept of Health and Human Services for his Obamacare consulting .
National Institutes of Health paid him  $2 million for Medicare consulting .
Justice Department has added $1.7 million for expert witness testimony .
Four US states combined to pay him another $1.6 million for advice about health care laws, and contracts for four more states were unavailable .
If those states followed suit, Gruber's haul would exceed $7.5 million .
Gruber has become a thorn in Democrats' sides since videos emerged of him candidly discussing how the Obama White House misled Americans to pass the Obamacare law ."

"Two Chinese farmers got more than they bargained for when they pulled up the root of a fleece flower - and came face-to-face with the doppelganger of Homer Simpson. The large root appears to have two bulging eyes and a prominent nose - giving it an uncanny resemblance to the famous cartoon character.

"The hits just keep coming for MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the Obamacare architect under fire for his controversial statements about the health care reform law. Video unearthed today by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler shows Gruber agreeing that states' opposition to the Medicaid expansion dictated by the federal health law may be race-related. He also claimed states that rejected federal funds for Medicaid wanted 'to punish poor people,' which he said 'really is just almost awesome in its evilness.' The video released by Koffler on his news site, White House Dossier, is the latest in a series of damning videos of Gruber talking about the health care law that have popped up online recently. The comments have top Democrats, including President Barack Obama, disavowing both him and his claims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In this March photo Economist Jonathan Gruber is seen speaking at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the Affordable Care Act. He's taken fire over recently over comments he made about the latter . In previously released videos, the economist stated that the health care law 'was written in a tortured way' to ensure that the Congressional Budget Office did not label the individual mandate portion of the law as a tax. 'If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that,' he said during an academic panel in 2013. 'In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed… Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,' he continued. He then told the audience they could blame the 'stupidity of the American voter' for not seeing through Democratic spin. I wish 'we could make it all transparent, but I’d rather have this law than not,' he concluded. The video that emerged today features Gruber and the University of Chicago's Harold Pollack discussing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion on behalf of the website healthinsurance.org in April of this year. At one point in the conversation Pollack states that there's 'a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people... it’s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid even if it’s financially very advantageous to do so.' Pollack goes on to say that it's an 'important principle to defeat' politically 'because it’s such a toxic political perspective.' 'It has to be shown that that approach to politics doesn’t work, because otherwise we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places,' he said. To which Gruber replied, 'You know, that’s a great way to put it: There’s larger principles at stake here, when these states are not just turning down covering the poor people, but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that. 'They’re not just not interested in covering poor people, they’re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. I mean, it really is just almost awesome in its evilness. And I agree, you have to recognize there’s larger principles at stake here.' Left unsaid in the discussion was that the states that rejected the Medicaid expansion and the federal dollars that came with it in the short term were steered in that direction by Republicans in the state legislature or in the governor's mansion. At a press conference during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, last weekend President Barack Obama put as much distance between himself and Gruber as possible, arguing that the Obamacare consultant was never on staff at the White House . The White House has already addressed Gruber's other defamatory statements, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying last week that he 'vigorously' disagrees with the 'stupidity' claim. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Sunday morning on Twitter that Gruber is the one who's stupid. 'As one who worked hard to make ACA and its benefits clear, let me say: if you looked up ""stupid"" in dictionary, you'd find Gruber's picture,' he wrote. And at a press conference this weekend in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend, Obama made it clear to reporters that Gruber does not speak for his administration. 'The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,' Obama said. 'I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent,' Obama said. 'It was a tough debate.' While it is true that Gruber, who claims he 'helped write' Obamacare, never served on the White House staff, records show that the Health and Human Services Department paid him $392,600 consulting fees during the time the Affordable Care Act was being drawn up. The economics professor's 'Gruber Microsimulation Model' aided the White House with estimations of how different aspects of the plan would be scored by CBO and whether it would consider affiliated costs taxes. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also tried to disassociate herself from the Obamacare consultant last week by claiming to not even 'know who he is.' In the next breath she claimed that, 'he didn't help write our bill.' That directly contradicts a 2011 claim from Gruber that 'helped design the reform' as well as 'implement' it. Likewise, he said he 'was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well.' A March 2012 New York Times article also credits him with that work. 'After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation,' the article says. After video surfaced of Pelosi citing Gruber at a Nov. 5, 2009 press conference her office was forced to back track slightly, telling the Washington Post that she 'meant that she didn't know Gruber personally.' 'She said she doesn’t ""know who he is,"" not that she’s ""never heard of him,"" ' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said. Facet-checking website Politifact rated her claim as false however, pointing to the press conference incident as evidence that she did in fact know who Gruber was before the unflattering videos became national news. 'Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False,' it said in a piece dissecting her statements.","Video shows MIT professor Gruber discussing Obamaçare's Medicaid expansion with the University of Chicago's Harold Pollack in April .

"Charges of sexual assault against college football champion Jameis Winston from Florida State University that were dropped in December last year are being re-examined once again. An independent investigator claims to have found evidence that FSU administrators and Tallahassee police 'took steps to both hide, and then hinder' the investigation. A reporter for Fox Sports News has uncovered thousands of pages of documents. Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act. Scroll down for video . Accused, Jameis Winston: University's police chief obtained original police reports at least four days before the case was turned over to the local prosecutor responsible for investigating serious crimes and filing criminal charges . The main suggestion is that the Tallahassee Police Department seemingly let the case go dormant for nine months. Police reports were effectively 'sat on' for almost a year before they were given to State Attorney Willie Meggs, but which point the chance of bringing charges against Winston was far weaker. Fox Sports News claims that on November 8, 2013, a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times contacted Tallahassee police to request copies of reports of the alleged rape involving Winston. The Tallahassee police forwarded the reports to David Perry, chief of the Florida State University Police Department. FSU officials and campus police then attempted to learn more about the reporter seeking the documents. In an e-mail to Perry obtained by FOX Sports, Bonasorte asked, 'Do we no (sic) if its sports dept?' later that morning the Tallahassee police records clerk sent an e-mail to Perry identifying the reporter who requested the documents. The university's police chief forwarded the reports to a high-ranking administrator in the Florida State athletic department, and within days they ultimately wound up in the hands of Winston's defense attorney . There was then some debate over a series of emails as to whether a report had been released into the media. Four days later on November 12, a reporter from TMZ came by to ask for more information over the assault charges. This time, Jim Russell of the FSU police responded: 'I can advise you that Jameis Winston is not under any investigation by the FSUPD, nor has he been questioned regarding any criminal case by the FSUPD. I just called the on-duty shift to make sure nothing was breaking right now and they report nothing regarding Winston going on. Thank you for contacting me regarding this rumor – I am glad I can dispel that one.' Although Russell's e-mail was accurate, Winston, was the subject of an investigation by the Tallahassee Police Department, not the university police department . Russel then sent and email to the FSU Police Chief Perry and Jeanette M. DeDiemar, associate vice president for integrated marketing and communications saying: 'Wow – crazy! Rumor control!' Two critical witnesses signed affidavits backing Winston's version of the incident even before police had spoken to them . The following day, on November 13, Willie Meggs, Florida's State attorney was notified of the allegations against Winston. Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, had received the police reports days earlier. In the days that followed, Jansen met with Winston's teammates Chris Casher and Ronald Darby, who had witnessed some of the sexual encounter between Winston and the woman . A notary was hired who recorded identical statements by Casher and Darby swearing that the encounter was consensual before they had even spoken to the police. TMZ then published the first report of the allegations against Winston that night, hours after Meggs had first learned of their existence. By this point, it was almost a week after the allegations had been made and key witnesses had been . University administrators and Winston’s attorney, Tim Jansen, had a head start on the state attorney in Tallahassee responsible for investigating and prosecuting serious crimes. Florida State administrators, had all the police reports at least four days before State Attorney Willie Meggs was handed the case.

"Senior teachers at Catholic schools have been warned they face demotion or the sack for being openly gay, remarrying after divorce or cohabiting with a partner. New Church guidelines state that key staff and governors in a ‘non-chaste’ relationship  outside marriage could face an investigation and be removed from their posts. Education Secretary Michael today rebuffed calls to intervene, insisting schools only had to act within the law. Guidance issued to Catholic schools, such as St. John Fisher Catholic Primary School in Erith, south east London, covers the relationships which teachers and govenors are allowed to have . The advice is in a booklet written by Monsignor Marcus Stock, the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference. It urges heads, deputies, governors . and heads of religious education to avoid making ‘substantive life . choices’ that conflict with the Church’s teaching. The advice is aimed at the Church’s 2,100 state schools. The National Secular Society wants the booklet to be withdrawn. Director Keith Porteous Wood said: ‘A . growing percentage of teachers in Roman Catholic schools are not . Catholics, and a significant proportion of Catholic teachers will have . made life choices deemed incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic . Church. ‘Both groups have cause to sleep less . easily as the Church becomes ever more intolerant of lifestyles that . are becoming commonplace.’ The Catholic Education Service said the booklet was guidance rather than mandate. Head teachers, principals, deputy heads and heads of RE and most governors at Catholic schools are required to be practising Catholics. They must also conduct themselves in a way which does not conflict with the Church, the guidance says. It states: ‘There are also substantive life choices which are incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic Church and which may be detrimental or prejudicial to the religious ethos and character of a Catholic school.’ These could include: . Failure to abide by the rules could affect ‘their ability to govern or to lead and model Catholic life and faith with ecclesial integrity may cease to exist’, it adds. Breaching the guidance would trigger and investigation and in some circumstances ‘may necessitate a member of the governing authority of a Catholic school being removed from office or disciplinary action being taken against someone appointed to a key post’. Education Secretary Michael Gove has insisted it is up to schools to decide who to employ . The National Secular Society (NSS) said the lawful, private activities of teachers ‘should not be any business of prying employers’. It said it had written to Mr Gove asking for the document to be withdrawn. But the Department for Education said today: ‘This is a matter for schools and their governors. ‘Faith schools can consider whether a person’s conduct is in line with their religious values when dismissing teachers. However schools must also comply with employment law.’ Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the NSS, said: ‘A growing percentage of teachers in Roman Catholic schools are not Catholics, and a significant proportion of Catholic teachers will have made life choices which are deemed incompatible with the teaching of the Catholic Church. ‘However good they are as teachers, both groups have cause to sleep less easily as the Church becomes ever more intolerant of lifestyles that are becoming commonplace,’ he told the Times Educational Supplement. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Education Service told the magazine: ‘The recently revised document Christ at the Centre offers guidance to governing bodies, staff and parents about the ethos and values of Catholic schools. ‘It is a matter for governing bodies and dioceses to make staffing decisions based on local situations.’","Guidance issued to Catholic schools sets out 'substantive life choices which are incompatible' with the religion's teachings .

"Can foreign players ever recover from a slow start to life in English football? It is a question I have been asking myself since I was playing. Every year, when a raft of new signings arrive from overseas, a saying is trotted out with great regularity that is used to mask underwhelming performances from individuals. You will be familiar with it: ‘Give them 12 months to settle in.’ The theory is that it takes each foreign import a year to get to grips with the frenzy of the Barclays Premier League but, once they have done, you will see their form going up and away. Where, though, is the evidence to support that? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo: Falcao and Di Maria excellent players for Manchester United . Angel di Maria (left) has settled in to the Premier League style just fine, but Mesut Ozil (right) still struggles . Arsenal midfielder Ozil has a ‘crack in his knee’, which may rule him out for up to 12 weeks . Di Maria celebrates scoring Manchester United's first goal in the 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford . Two individuals got me thinking about this, namely Angel di Maria and Mesut Ozil. Let’s make the comparison with both men, first and foremost. Both arrived here from Real Madrid, both cost astronomical fees and both men tend to operate in the same areas of the pitch. They are both left-footed but prefer playing centrally. Di Maria has scored three goals in five appearances since his £59.7million switch in August and will be the headline act at The Hawthorns on Monday night. He has looked every inch a superstar and no apologies have been needed with regard to his form. Ozil, by contrast, finds himself enduring more frustrations this weekend. A ‘crack in his knee’ may rule him out for up to 12 weeks but, even when he returns to full fitness, I find it hard to see the German leaving his unconvincing efforts of last season behind. Arsene Wenger made me think in April when the Arsenal manager made the bold claim that Ozil, his biggest ever signing at £42m, was ‘fantastic’ and he ‘would put him on the list to be player of the season next season’. Wenger does not usually tend to be so assertive. Even before he had a knee- ligament problem diagnosed while he was away with Germany, Ozil had not looked like delivering the same stylish displays of his time in Madrid. Look back at all the great imports to the Barclays Premier League and you will realise they were operating at near-enough full throttle from a very early stage. Arsenal supporters should appreciate that more than most. Take Dennis Bergkamp. It is a myth to say he did nothing in his first campaign at Highbury. Yes, it may have taken him six games to score his first goal but he added another 15 in 41 appearances, the last of which — an 84th-minute winner against Bolton in the final game — took Arsenal into Europe. Thierry Henry was another. Did he need a settling-in period? If he did, it could be measured in weeks and nothing longer. Once he broke his duck in his eighth game, the goals flowed freely. He finished the 1999-2000 season with a haul of 26, including one sequence when he scored nine in eight matches. Keep thinking of names and you will see a pattern emerging. Didier Drogba? Helped lead Chelsea to the title and the League Cup in his first season with 16 goals; Gianfranco Zola arrived at Stamford Bridge in November 1996 and, by May 1997, the Football Writers had named him Player of the Year. Jurgen Klinsmann won player of the year in his first season and Eric Cantona won the League in his first season at Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo may have been too eager to try tricks and go down too easily when he initially joined Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon, but anyone who didn’t believe he was going to the top straight away was a fool. From a personal point of view, the best foreigners I worked alongside — Sami Hyypia, Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez to name a few — were all contributing in their opening weeks and months. You could see at Melwood with how they trained and prepared there would be no issues. The player who forced me to think again was Robert Pires. I didn’t rate him immediately but then, in season two, he took off and was sensational. Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra were slow starters at Manchester United but they joined in January, only played 11 games each and had found their true form by the start of the next campaign. Gianfranco Zola arrived in November 1996 and, by May 1997, he had an individual award to his name . Not all players struggle when they arrive in England; Here's Zola (left) picking up the Football Writers' Player of the Year award in 1997, with Jurgen Klinsmann (right) getting the same award two years before . Ozil played at the top level in Spain with Real Madrid, but hasn't replicated his form consistently in England . That’s why I was so interested in Wenger’s comments about Ozil coming to the fore, as I just hadn’t seen any evidence to support that before he got injured. I remain sceptical that he will have such an influence when he returns, too. If you don’t adapt to this league early, the likelihood is you never will. Andriy Shevchenko and Juan Sebastian Veron are fine examples of men who arrived as giants — they were stars of Serie A — but never recovered from those teething problems. It’s why I look at Tottenham, who travel to Manchester City on Saturday afternoon, and wonder how it will end for the men who arrived 12 months ago, during the record-breaking transfer of Gareth Bale (someone else who has had no issues with a new league in his first season) to Real Madrid. Eric Cantona (left) helped United to the title in 1993 and went on to become their star player, while Klinsmann also had a fantastic start to life in the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur . Di Maria has replicated the form he left Real Madrid with in the Premier League, scoring three goals . Thierry Henry (left) took eight games to score but ended the season with 26; Dennis Bergkamp (right) became an Arsenal great and had a fine season despite taking his time to score his first goal after his move . Of all the players who arrived during that £100m spree, only Christian Eriksen looked good. But with Roberto Soldado, Paulinho and Erik Lamela you can never see it turning, irrespective of Spurs paying a fortune to sign them. They are not the first and won’t be the last. Liverpool will also be hoping their new foreign stars start to perform in the next few months or they will be in the same situation. Should a player get in rhythm straight away, however, the signs can only be positive. That is why Di Maria and Diego Costa won’t fizzle out after their flash starts. They have set a classy tone. Juan Sebastian Veron is a fine example of a player never getting used to the demands of the Premier League . Didier Drogba (left) with the title in his first year in 2005, will Diego Costa (right) be holding it in May? Barkley should head to U21 finals . There has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the Under 21s in the summer after Gareth Southgate and his squad qualified for the European Championship. Arsene Wenger and Roberto Martinez have already come out and stated it wouldn’t be beneficial to their players to play and that’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs’ interests rather than the national team’s. That is a big problem in this country. My view is it’s not a black-and-white case. Ross Barkley (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) are two senior England players who still qualify for the Under 21s . Fully fledged regulars for club and country — like Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling — would benefit from a free summer. But for players like Calum Chambers, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and John Stones — squad players at the moment for the seniors, who won’t play 40-50 games this season — it would benefit them and the squad. That sort of tournament experience could be vital for the senior European Championship in 2016. Full internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Raheem Sterling could play for the Under 21s next year . This week I'm looking forward to... ...seeing how Younes Kaboul performs on Saturday afternoon. The Spurs defender was involved in the embarrassing 6-0 defeat at Manchester City last season, in a game which was the beginning of the end for Andre Villas-Boas. Now Kaboul returns to the Etihad, this time as Tottenham captain. A lot of people were surprised that he was given the armband by Mauricio Pochettino but he was excellent in the last away game, the 1-1 draw at Arsenal. The Frenchman has pace and power but lapses of concentration have cost him in the past. He cannot afford any slip-ups against one of the world’s best — Sergio Aguero — on Saturday. Younes Kaboul returns to Manchester City after the 6-0 mauling last season as Spurs captain .","The theory: It takes a year for foreign stars to adapt to the Premier League .
Where's the evidence to support? Look at Angel Di Maria and Mesut Ozil .
Di Maria has scored three goals in five games since his £59.7million move .
Ozil has struggled, and is now out until 2015 with a 'crack in his knee'

"Arsene Wenger  insists he would splash a club-record transfer fee on Mesut Ozil again as he came out in staunch defence of his under-fire playmaker. Ozil, Arsenal’s £42.5million signing from Real Madrid, was heavily criticised after his dismal performance in midweek. He was hauled off after 62 minutes against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. The German side tore Arsenal apart but, even though Ozil failed to perform and is frustrating fans with his lack of consistency since joining the club last year, Wenger said: ‘I would pay the money again, of course.’ Mesut Ozil looks despondent during his poor performance in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund . The German had an ineffective night in Germany on Tuesday and was substituted after just 62 minutes . Ozil looked similarly frustrated on Friday during Arsenal's training session at London Colney . Arsene Wenger has defended his £42.5million signing and says he would pay the same money again for him . The 25-year-old looked lost out on the left wing against Dortmund. But Wenger, whose side face Aston Villa this afternoon, defended his tactics. ‘Zinedine Zidane went to Real Madrid for £82m and he played on the left,’ Wenger, a graduate of economics, explained, adjusting the figure to take into account inflation for the French star’s £47.1m fee in 2001. ‘He had to play there because in the middle they had Raul and Ronaldo and he made room and played on the left. When you have the ball you play where you want and go where you want.’ Alongside Ozil, Arsenal have a host of attacking midfield options, most of who would prefer to play in a central No 10 role. But Wenger is determined to fit them all into a starting XI and is confident it can work, citing the great Brazil team which won the 1970 World Cup. Jack Wilshere returned to  training on Friday, and he has started games centrally, pushing Ozil out to the wing . He added: ‘It is a debate as old as the world. Since we played football. When you look at the Brazil team in 1970 they had Tostao, Rivelino, Pele, Jairzinho, Gerson, Clodoaldo. They played all No 10 in their club. They didn’t know what to do. They put them all together and they won the World Cup convincingly. ‘What is Jack Wilshere but basically a No 10? He played his whole life at No 10. Somebody had to go out (wide against Dortmund). Is it Wilshere, Ozil, Aaron Ramsey? Nobody is really natural out wide.’ Ozil's heat map during Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League defeat away at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday .

Meanwhile, Arsenal’s financial results for the 2013-14 season have revealed record levels of ‘free’ cash sitting in the club’s bank account, £173.3m at the end of May, some of which could be available for Arsene Wenger as a transfer kitty. The accounts indicate again what a successful club Arsenal are, financially speaking, with income up to £298.7m from £242.8m, driven by a leap in Premier League TV money.

"Landon Donovan brought down the curtain on his international career on Friday night as he played his last game for the US national team. The 32-year-old LA Galaxy striker, who will retire at the end of the MLS season, played for 40 minutes during USA's friendly against Ecuador in East Hartford. Donovan has been the face of the sport in America for more than a decade and bowed out to a hero's ovation on his final appearance for his country. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Landon Donovan's international career came to an end on Friday night in East Hartford . The 32-year-old played 40 minutes in USA' friendly with Ecuador in Connecticut . Donovan received a hero's ovation from the USA supporters at his final international match . The LA Galaxy striker goes on a lap of honour at half-time having been substituted in the 41st minute . The former Everton forward was replaced by Joe Corona in the 41st minute on Friday. Mix Disterud gave USA the lead in the fifth minute, but West Ham striker Enner Valencia snatched a draw for Ecuador with an 88th-minute strike. After being substituted, Donovan told ESPN: 'We've all put in a lot of work, and we deserve a night like this. What's next? I want to see the world, I want to hang out with my family, and come to games like this. 'I'm forcing myself to take time to get away and relax, but you'll probably see more than me soon. Donovan is USA's all-time leading goalscorer and one of the best footballers the country has produced . Donovan celebrated Mix Disterud's goal in the first half in East Hartford . Donovan challenges Ecuador's goalkeeper Maximo Banguera for the ball . 'I believe that things work out the way they're supposed to. I made a lot of mistakes, but I made them with good intentions, and I think they've served me well.' Donovan retires as USA's record goalscorer with 57 strikes to his name and he played every game of their 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cup campaigns. However, the 32-year-old was controversially overlooked by manager Jurgen Klinsmann for this summer's World Cup in Brazil. The German manager's decision to axe Donovan sent shock waves through America. Donovan addressed the media before his final game against Ecuador, and he insisted that he should have gone to the World Cup. He said: 'Although I didn't agree with the decision and I still know I should have been there, it was also good for me to say, you know what, it's not always going to go your way. 'And it took time for me to get to that place. I'm human. I had some very real emotions after. But after a while I said: Maybe this is a going to be a good thing. And I wouldn't have the opportunity to grow had it not happened. 'I certainly grew a lot more by that happening than if I had gone to the World Cup and played there, and in that way you can learn a lot from it. 'I had the opportunity to feel what other players have felt in my career. A lot of times when I made a team I was so happy for me that I forgot about the guy who got cut, so for the first time it kind of put that in front of my face.' A banner with the word 'legend' and a picture of Donovan is held up by USA supporters . US Soccer tweeted this message in tribute to Donovan as he made his final appearance for the side . Without Donovan, the U.S. advanced from a difficult first-round group by defeating Ghana, drawing Portugal and losing to Germany. The Americans were knocked out with a 2-1 overtime loss to Belgium, and Friday's match was their first at home since leaving Brazil. 'Three, four months ago, if someone asked if this day would happen, I would have said you're out of your mind and you're crazy,' Donovan said of the testimonial. 'I give all the credit to Sunil for sticking with me through some hard conversations and understanding what was important and making it happen. 'I believe this is a day I deserve. I believe this is a day my family deserves for all the sacrifices they've made.' Donovan anticipated 20 family members would attend, and he said the USSF had treated them 'like kings and queens' this week. It helped to alleviate some of his vexation. 'People forget, for those of us who weren't selected this summer to play in Brazil, it's not only difficult for us, it's difficult for our families,' he said. 'In many instances, our families had this amazing vacation trip of a lifetime planned, and that was taken from them.' Donovan and US Soccer president Sunil Gulati speak at a press conference before the game . Asked about his relationship with Klinsmann, all Donovan would say is: 'You know.' It took him awhile to accept Gulati's offer of a testimonial match. 'The thought of being in this environment again didn't seem all that appealing at the time,' Donovan said. 'But at the end of the day I looked at the big picture and realized what a special day this could be. It's almost like, if you care to believe this stuff, in many ways it's meant to be. I think it's no coincidence it's 10-10 today.' He's not quite sure what awaits. Attending college and travel are among the possibilities. He'll remain involved with the USSF, but how he's not sure. Coaching intrigues him, but not pros. Perhaps the under-17 team, the level where he first gained world-wide attention in 1999. 'I wouldn't want to deal with male soccer egos. That's a headache that I think nobody would want, even though some coaches take it on,' he said. 'I think being able to really be hands on early in people's careers would be helpful, because that's where I needed the most help.' Donovan received a special framed shirt following the match, made up of 19 national team jerseys that he wore during his long international career, and US Soccer tweeted: 'The end of Landon Donovan's USMNT career. Only one word: #LegenD.' Donovan received a framed shirt made up of 19 different jerseys from his international career .","Donovan played final game for USA against Ecuador in East Hartford .

"Britain could send military reinforcements to the Gulf if the dispute with Iran escalates, the Defence Secretary has revealed. Philip Hammond said the decision to send HMS Argyll as part of an international flotilla of warships through the sensitive Strait of Hormuz on Sunday sent a 'clear signal' to Tehran. And he warned that reinforcements will be available if needed. Iran has threatened to close the strait - through which 35 per cent of the world's tanker-borne oil exports pass - in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports. The news comes after Prime Minister David Cameron last night said Britain 'will not accept' Iran's bid to develop a nuclear weapon. Flotilla: The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (left), takes over from the USS John C. Stennis  in the Arabian Sea. The USS Abraham Lincoln later led the convoy through the Strait of Hormuz . British warship: HMS Argyll, the Type 23 frigate, which joined the U.S. vessels (file photo) Mr Hammond was speaking at a press . conference in London following the annual round of talks between UK and . Australian foreign and defence ministers. Australia's foreign minister . Kevin Rudd said his country would enforce the same ban on Iranian crude . oil exports agreed by the European Union yesterday. He and defence . minister Stephen Smith will attend today's National Security Council . meeting. It follows yesterday's rare joint statement . where German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Nicolas . Sarkozy and Mr Cameron warned Tehran it would face economic isolation . unless it abandoned its nuclear ambitions 'immediately'. They added: 'We have no quarrel with . the Iranian people. But the Iranian leadership has failed to restore . international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its . nuclear programme. We will not accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.' The statement, which concluded a day . of intense activity, was backed up by an 'unprecedented' package of EU . sanctions, designed to suck the lifeblood from the regime – including the . ban on importing  Iranian oil into Europe. Tehran responded with defiance, with . elements of the ruling regime warning it would shut the strategically . critical Strait of Hormuz – a move that would effectively close the Gulf . to shipping and send oil prices rocketing. Under pressure: USS John C. Stennis (L) and USS Abraham Lincoln (R) pictured last week. President Obama said in his State of the Union speech last night that the U.S. would keep at Iran to end its nuclear program . Threats: Iran has stepped up threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's crude oil flows, in retaliation for facing sanctions . The United States has warned Tehran . that closing the Strait, which carries one-fifth of the world's oil . exports, would trigger a massive military response from the West. The . message was underlined at the weekend when Britain, the U.S. and France . sent six warships through the Strait. The tensions come amid mounting concern that Tehran is close to developing a nuclear weapon. After talks to agree the new EU . sanctions, Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was 'no plausible . civilian explanation' for Iran's programme of uranium enrichment. Pressure: British Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was 'no plausible civilian explanation' for Iran's nuclear programme . He vowed to keep increasing the pressure on Tehran and said the sanction 'represented a significant increase in peaceful and legitimate pressure on the Iranian government to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme.' He added: 'Until it does so the pressure will only increase.' Between them, EU member states import . almost 600,000 barrels a day of Iran's crude oil exports – more than a . fifth of the total – although only a tiny fraction ends up in the UK. A . ban on exports of gold, precious metals and diamonds from Iran has also . been imposed, along with more economic and travel bans on members of the . hardline regime. Backing the EU stance, Mr Rudd said: 'It is not just that we endorse the actions taken in Brussels for Europe, we of course will do the same for Australia. The message needs to be delivered to the people of Iran, to the political elites as well as the government of Iran, that their behaviour is globally unacceptable. 'This is not a piece of idle philanthropy on the part of Australian foreign policy, this costs,' he said - pointing to tumbling exports to Iran'. He added: 'But it is a cost worth paying.' Oil imports from Iran to Australia were now 'negligible' however, he said. Mr Hague urged the regime to 'come to . its senses' and resume talks on its nuclear programme. Leading figures . in Tehran responded . furiously. Mohammad Kossari, deputy head of the Iranian parliament's . foreign affairs and security committee, said: 'If any disruption happens . regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of  Hormuz will . definitely be closed.' Senior politician Heshmatollah . Falahatpisheh added: 'In case of threat, the closure of the Strait of . Hormuz is one of Iran's rights.' British sources believe full closure . of the Strait remains unlikely because it would bring 'huge negative . consequences' for Tehran. But they fear Iran could engage in months of . threats and disruption which would ramp up oil prices in the West . without sparking a full military reprisal against Iran. A Royal Navy Type 23 frigate, HMS . Argyll, was part of the U.S.-led carrier group which passed through the . strait, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. Threat: The USS Abraham Lincoln and USS John C. Stennis during the handover in the Arabian Sea. The departure of the USS John C Stennis prompted Iran to warn the Americans not to send any more carriers . World map illustrating global sea trade in oil and highlighting the Strait of Hormuz . The USS Admiral . Lincoln, an aircraft carrier with a fleet of 90 planes, headed the . group. It was escorted by the Argyll, a guided missile cruiser and two . destroyers from the U.S. Navy and a French warship. Insiders said it was unusual for a . flotilla made up of ships from three separate navies to pass within a . few miles of the Iranian coastline. A defence source rejected suggestions . that it was a provocative move intended to increase pressure on Iran, . adding: 'It is a statement that makes abundantly clear that these are . international waters and all countries need to respect that. This shows . that we are working in partnership and solidarity.' Professor Paul Stevens, a senior . research fellow at the think-tank Chatham House, said he doubted Tehran . would carry out its threat to blockade the strait, for fear of sparking a . 'shooting war' with the U.S. Instead, he said, an oil blockade would . encourage hardliners in Iran to launch a wave of terror attacks. Professor Stevens said an oil blockade . was unlikely to succeed, because Tehran could ship its oil, which makes . up 50 per cent of its revenues, through pipelines to  Turkey and Egypt. He added:  'History is littered with failed oil embargoes. However, the . lessons of history appear to have passed by the decision makers of the . EU.' EU governments are calculating that the loss of European oil markets will persuade Iran to reopen talks on its nuclear plans. The ban has been phased in partly to ease the impact on EU nations facing economic difficulties and which are very dependent on Iranian oil. The UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands led calls for nothing more than a three-month delay before the sanctions bite, but Greece, which fears its economic woes will worsen if it cannot find alternative suppliers at Iran-style preferential rates - urged a much longer phase-in to ease the pain. Mr Hague said an oil embargo was designed to persuade the Iranian government to launch 'meaningful' talks with the international community on its nuclear intentions. Europe's foreign policy chief Baroness Catherine Ashton also insisted the sanctions were needed to bring Iran back to the negotiating table. An offer to Iran three months ago to begin new talks has gone unanswered, she pointed out. But concern remains that sanctions designed to hit Iran will inevitably hit some EU member states as well. Based in Plymouth, HMS Argyll is the longest-serving Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy. Built in the 1980s on the Clyde, she was commissioned in 1991. Following a £20m refit in 2009-2010, HMS Argyll is now one of the most up-to-date and capable frigates in the Fleet, with her weapons and sensors significantly enhanced. HMS Argyll, currently in the Middle East, is part of the Combined Maritime Forces - a US-led, 25-nation, multinational naval partnership promoting security, stability and prosperity across 2.5m sq miles of international waters. About 40 per cent of the world's shipping and a third of the world's oil passes through the region, most through the chokepoint of the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab-el Mandeb Strait and the Suez Canal. The ship's main tasks includes counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and building on established relationships with regional allies.

"Many will remember the rat-a-tat sounds they made during the war games they played as children. But these chilling images show that for youths on the Gaza Strip, the guns are all too real. The sinister summer camp hosts up to 10,000 boys at a time – and appears to have been designed  to mould its visitors into the terrorists of tomorrow. Dummy run: Two children practise kidnapping an 'Israeli soldier' in the desert sun . War games: The exercise drew comparisons with the capture of Israeli solder Gilad Shalit in 2006 . Leap: Others jumped over burning tyres at the sinister summer camp . Target practice: A future fighter aims his gun at the camp which aims to mould the terrorists of tomorrow . Youths aged between six and 16 were seen taking part in a range of exercises, including one that  simulated the capture of an Israeli soldier. Elsewhere in the mock warzone in the town of Rafah, budding fighters crawled under barbed wire, jumped through fire and ducked for cover behind sandbags in the desert terrain. Explosions and burning tyres helped to simulate realistic battle conditions, as boys were coached to flee from the enemy and shoot at targets. Bullets were fired overhead by their masked supervisors. The boys were also pictured marching and standing to attention as orders were barked at them to instil military discipline. Drilled: Youths wearing war paint and black uniforms assemble their weapons . Tiny: The camp's visitors can be as young as six .

Visitors to the camp, called Generation of Faith, are given AK47s that are bigger than some of the children holding them. Participants wear black uniforms bearing the camp’s slogan in Arabic, with a logo showing two fists, two guns and a map of the Gaza Strip. They are given lessons in Islamic studies as well as gruelling physical training, and it is believed that the camp’s purpose is to radicalise the next generation from a young age. It is feared that the cadets will join the 300,000 children estimated by Unicef to be currently involved in conflicts across the globe. The kidnapping ‘game’ witnessed yesterday, which drew comparisons to the capture of soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, involved a young boy being dragged by two gun-toting teenagers from an area marked with an Israeli flag. Shalit was finally released after more than five years in captivity, as part of a prisoner exchange. Lessons: It is believed the camp's purpose is to radicalise the next generation from a young age .

"Some will feel the scene is rather seedy. A barefoot young man partying on board a yacht grasps a plastic cocktail glass in one hand and the nozzle of a shisha, or hookah, pipe with the other, holding it to his mouth. The young man is Prince Harry, who, even at 30, has failed to shed his worrying habit of presenting the world with inappropriate images of the Royal Family at play. A picture of him sucking on the shisha on a yacht — hired for a lavish party by a Dubai branch of Mayfair nightclub Mahiki — has this week been winging its way round the world. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry pictured smoking a hookah pipe on board the Mahiki F1 Boat Party. His antics on board the yacht in Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina last Friday show even at 30 he is presenting the world with inappropriate images of the Royal Family at play. He ended his undignified weekend leaving a club at almost dawn . The colourful scene took place in Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina last Friday, two days before the Formula 1 season’s final Grand Prix was held in the emirate. Harry attended the race on Sunday, and when British driver Lewis Hamilton was crowned World Champion, he was publicly hailed by the Prince — in notably unregal style — as a ‘legend’. That evening Harry was to be found ‘twerking’ in a nightclub, which he didn’t leave until nearly dawn. All in all, a somewhat undignified weekend. The problem for the Prince is that everywhere he goes these days, people brandish their smart phones to snap him. At one point, Harry smiled for a photo with his arm round American R&B singer Tyrese Gibson. Despite the presence of camera phones, one British onlooker aboard ‘HMS Mahiki’ — as the yacht was christened by the London-based nightclub, which Harry’s friend Guy Pelly helped promote — says the Prince was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘in full view of everyone’ for a good 15 minutes. There is nothing illegal about the shisha, of course, but wasn’t it both foolish and irresponsible for the Prince to use one publicly? The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has been campaigning vigorously against the mushrooming of shisha bars around Britain because of their grave health risks to users. Though it originated in the Far and Middle East, the pipe’s mix of tobacco and fruit flavours is becoming dangerously popular with youthful users, who say it makes them feel ‘mellow’. Onlookers aboard the yacht in Yas Marina said Prince Harry, pictured here at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday in the UAE country, was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘in full view of everyone’ for a good 15 minutes . So Harry may receive a sharp reprimand from his grandfather, non-smoking Prince Philip, who has been patron of the BHF since its inception 53 years ago. As Professor Peter Weissberg, the foundation’s medical director, says: ‘There is a worrying misconception that smoking shisha is not harmful to your health. But strip away the fruity flavours and you’re left with the same toxic and addictive substances as cigarettes, including tar, nicotine, arsenic and lead.’ The BHF points out that in one puff from a shisha, a user inhales the same amount of smoke as from an entire cigarette. Using it for 15 minutes, as Harry did, is equivalent to smoking 25 cigarettes. Harry, pictured speaking to drivers  before the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit on Sunday, may receive a reprimand from his grandfather, Prince Philip, a patron of the British Heart Foundation . That did not deter Harry — a heavy smoker like his great-grandfather George VI, who was just 56 when he died of lung cancer. Conscious of the efforts by health professionals to persuade the public to stop smoking, Harry does his best to be seen as little as possible in public with a cigarette in his hand. But in the heady atmosphere of HMS Mahiki his caution evaporated, even though last Friday’s event was anything but a private party. Anyone could come aboard if they bought a £150 ticket, and when word got round that the Prince was on board, they certainly did. For Harry, the Abu Dhabi trip was the wind-down after a three-day official visit to the Gulf state of Oman, where he played in a charity polo match — raising almost £800,000 for his Lesotho children’s charity, Sentebale. ‘By the time he arrived in Abu Dhabi, he wanted to let his hair down and have a bit of fun,’ says a friend of the Prince. ‘But poor Harry has to be so careful these days.’ Not careful enough, it seems, as social media rapidly became awash with reports of the partying Prince, wisecracking intimately with a group of young women. For Harry, the Abu Dhabi trip was a wind-down after a three-day official visit to the Gulf state of Oman, where he played in a charity polo match — raising almost £800,000 for his Lesotho children’s charity, Sentebale . Of course, there were young women involved the last time Harry’s social life attracted such attention. Two years ago, he went to Las Vegas and played a sleazy game called ‘strip billiards’ with a group of girls he met in the lobby of his hotel and invited up to his room. Before you could say Your Royal Highness, the picture of Harry wearing nothing but an African necklace and bracelets was all over the internet and published in a certain red-top newspaper. How pathetic it sounded when one of his advisers complained he’d been the victim of ‘a nasty betrayal by a girl, who pretended she was on her phone, took a picture, and sent it to her boyfriend’. It seemed that Harry had grown up after his antics two years ago when he went to Las Vegas and played a sleazy game called ‘strip billiards’ with a group of girls he  invited from a hotel lobby up to his five-star room . Since then, it seemed that Harry had grown up. And it must be said that his informal, mischievous style has worked wonders for the Royal Family’s staid image. He is entitled to praise for creating the Invictus Games for injured ex-servicemen, and joining wounded soldiers on a trek to the South Pole. But he remains accident-prone, as well as naively trusting of strangers. Did he really think no one would photograph him sucking on a shisha in public? Two days after the Mahiki party, the Prince watched the Grand Prix from the Mercedes team garage, and after Lewis Hamilton crossed the line, Harry came on the team radio to applaud the British driver, telling him: ‘You are an absolute legend. Well done, mate.’ After that, Harry made it known he was ‘ready for a really big night out’. And he was certainly in the right company to find it, in the shape of ex-Wasps rugby player Adam Bidwell, who used to date mezza-soprano Katherine Jenkins. Prince Harry, pictured chatting to drivers at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Race, remains accident-prone, as well as naively trusting of strangers. Did he think no one would photograph him sucking a shisha in public? The 38-year-old rugby player-turned-stockbroker has been a friend of the Prince for five years and accompanied him on his notorious trip to Las Vegas. Intriguingly, the police protection officer who accompanied Harry to Abu Dhabi was also pictured next to him in a jacuzzi on his Las Vegas jaunt — suggesting that even after the furore over the naked pictures, Harry and royal security bosses are happy with the arrangement. He was likely to have been with him on Sunday at the Amber Lounge nightclub, the usual after-race watering hole for the F1 racing fraternity, where a table costs a mere £12,000. Hamilton and his girlfriend, former X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, were there, but only briefly. They didn’t stay long enough to see Harry merrily ‘twerking’ on the dance floor. Nor was Harry in any hurry to leave. It was 5am before he slipped out of the club and headed straight for the airport to catch his flight back to London. ‘There were loads of pretty girls throwing themselves at him,’ says a fellow partygoer. ‘Harry was having a great time. The man has stamina — he was partying hard.’ One observer tweeted: ‘Can’t believe I just seen Prince Harry twerking and I didn’t record it. What a guy!!!’ What puzzles many is how Harry, an Army officer, appears to be able to spend quite so much time on social manoeuvres. But after two tours in Afghanistan, his duties are now mainly ceremonial: organising events like the Invictus Games, being involved in the formal side of State visits and in contingency planning for civil disasters. The Ministry of Defence refuses to say how many hours he spends at his office in London but insists he has ‘a unique role’. The truth is that since breaking up with Cressida Bonas, Harry has been footloose. Certainly, the Queen would like to see him settle down and start a family, just as William has. Indeed, an intriguing closeness has been developing between Harry and his grandmother, with whom he has private meetings at the Palace. ‘She will often clear her diary when she knows he wants to drop in and see her,’ says a senior aide. ‘She recognises that he is the most popular member of the Royal Family, and is always interested in hearing what he has to say. And he’s very anxious not to let her down.’ With that in mind, perhaps he ought to think twice next time he finds himself offered a hookah pipe.","Prince, 30, let his hair down aboard the Mahiki F1 Boat Party last Friday .

"A rare 1,000lb thresher shark has been sighted leaping in mid-air as it swam alongside hundreds of dolphins off the Welsh coast. The 16ft shark leapt out of the water half a mile off the Pembrokeshire coast. The acrobatics were caught on camera by photographer Richard Crossen who was sailing with marine biologist Cliff Benson. Acrobatics: A thresher shark was spotted leaping through the air off the Pembrokeshire coast . The rare sighting occurred when the breaching shark swam with a pod of dolphins . Mr Benson said: 'This was an extremely rare sighting. 'Unlike dolphins, which breathe air, sharks rarely come to the surface of the water. 'If you offered to pay someone £1,000 to get a photograph like this, they would not be able to.' Sightings of the shark are so uncommon that only six were seen in UK waters last year. In 2011, the number was just two. Many of the sightings occurred after the sharks were caught in fishing nets. The researchers were following a pod of dolphins (pictured) when they saw the rare thresher shark . The team were able to get close to the pod of dolphins, many of which had calves (pictured) The group of researchers from The Sea Trust were observing a pod of common dolphins, as part of an ongoing 10-year survey. The pod was spotted near the site of a proposed Atlantic Array offshore wind farm. Threshers and other species of shark have been found off the Welsh coast because the sea is warmer due to this year’s hot summer. The leaping shark was seen on Monday afternoon, among a pod of several hundred dolphins - many of which had small calves. The dolphin pod was spotted by The Sea Trust team near a proposed Atlantic Array offshore wind farm . Thresher sharks could eat dolphins but marine biologists said they were hunting the same prey as the pod . Mr Benson, director of the Sea Trust, said: 'Sharks could potentially eat small dolphins, but in this case, the animal seems to have been feeding on the same prey as the dolphins - herring and mackerel.' Thresher sharks use their long flexible tails to whip and stun fish before eating them. Mr Benson added: 'It has a specialist hunting technique - it thrashes around and whacks its prey with its tail. 'They are lone oceanic wanderers. This animal could have been in the Azores three or four weeks ago.'","The 16ft shark spotted half a mile from the Pembrokeshire coast .

"The Turkish gunman who shot Saint John Paul II in the 1981 assassination attempt has seen his request to meet the current Pope ignored. Mehmet Ali Agca, who was jailed for 19 years for the shooting, asked the Vatican last week for permission to meet Pope Francis during his upcoming visit to Turkey, local media reported. Speaking at a press conference in Istanbul yesterday, Agca said he had not yet received a response from the Holy See - the central governing body of the Roman Catholic Church. Scroll down for video . Ignored: The Vatican is yet to respond to Mehmet Ali Agca's (pictured left, at a press conference in Istanbul yesterday) request to meet Pope Francis during his upcoming trip to Turkey . Mehmet Ali Agca shot Pope John Paul II four times as he rode in an open top car in St. Peter's Square on May 13 1981. He spent 19 years in an Italian prison for the assassination attempt - before being extradited to Turkey in 2000 - where he was jailed for a further ten years for the murder of prominent left-wing journalist Abdi Ipekci. Agca had already been jailed for this crime when he attempted to kill the Pope - and was on the run from Turkish authorities after escaping from prison six months into his sentence. Believed by many to be mentally disturbed, he was released from a prison in the Turkish capital of Ankara in 2010 after serving nearly three decades behind bars. Shooting: The gun of would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca is circled in this picture taken just seconds before Pope John Paul II was shot . Almost fatal: Bodyguards hold Pope John Paul II after he was shot on May 13 1981 in Saint Peter's Square by Turkish fanatic Mehmet Ali Agca . Recovery: Pope John Paul II sitting in his bed at the Policlinico Gemelli hospital in Rome following the shooting . Pardon: Pope John Paul II converses with his would-be assassin in Agca's prison cell in Rome in 1983 . During the shocking 1981 attack, Pope John Paul II suffered severe blood loss after being shot four times. On Wednesday May 13 1981 John Paul II was on his way to his regular weekly public audience - being driven in his white - and then unarmoured popemobile, through a crowd of 20,000 worshippers. The Polish pontiff had been elected as Pope less than three years earlier. At 5.17pm, shots rang out and John Paul II slumped back in his seat after being struck by four bullets - two of which hit him in the stomach. After a second of silence, people in the square began to scream: 'Hanno sparato il Papa! Hanno sparato il Papa!' (They've shot the Pope). A minute or so later, police grabbed a man running from the scene - Mehmet Ali Agca. A letter found in Agca's pocket read: 'I, Agca, have killed the Pope so that the world may know of the thousands of victims of imperialism.' Following a five-hour operation, John Paul II went on to make a full recovery. Two bullets struck his left hand and right arm while another two lodged in his lower intestine, narrowly missing his heart and other vital organs. Two bystanders were also hit by stray bullets. The motive for the attack remains a mystery but at the time the 23-year-old was a militant of the notorious far-right Grey Wolves movement. When police seized him, they found a letter in his pocket which read: 'I have killed the Pope so that the world may know of the thousands of victims of imperialism.' A number of theories have been put forward about who was behind the assassination attempt. An official inquiry blamed Soviet-sponsored assassins - who wanted the Pope dead because of his support for the democracy movement Solidarity. But in 2011 Polish communist leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski, who died this year aged 90, claimed  that Islamic fanatics sponsored the would-be assassination. 'Radical Islam detested the pope and saw in him a leader of crusades,' he told Poland's 'Jezus' Catholic magazine. In 1983, John Paul II famously pardoned Agca  and even visited him in his cell in Rome. Speaking about his desired meeting, Agca said: 'I've asked the Vatican unofficially to meet with Pope Francis but I have not received any response yet. 'While the world has been experiencing a big economic, political and humanitarian crisis, Pope Francis - who is exerting efforts to build peace and brotherhood - welcome to Turkey.' First visit: This will be Pope Francis' (pictured) first trip to Turkey where he is expected to discuss the threat of ISIS with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu . Agca said: 'I've asked the Vatican unofficially to meet with Pope Francis but I have not received any response yet' The Pope is due to visit Turkey for the first time from November 28 - 30, during which time he will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. The trip follows a series of security threats involving ISIS and the 77-year-old Argentinian pontiff will seek to emphasise his commitment to improving relations between Muslims and other Christians. Tomorrow, he is due to give a speech on the issue - and his visit comes at a time of increased violence against Christian minorities in the region. Habeeb Al Sadr, Iraq's Ambassador to the Vatican, said in September that there were indications of an ISIS threat against the Pope. After expressing support for US airstrikes against ISIS the ambassador said during one of his trips abroad that the Pope could be targeted. This week the Vatican was said to be stepping up security following concerns about a possible drone attack in St. Peter's.

"More than one in 50 babies has a birth defect - almost double the previous estimate, according to the most comprehensive report of its kind. Previous figures have suggested one in 80 babies suffers a defect, which include Down's syndrome, congenital heart disease and neural tube defects such as spina bifida. The report, from the British Isles Network of Congenital Anomaly Registers (Binocar), covers five registers of defects in England and Wales. Fragile: New figures show that one in 50 babies has a birth defect compared to one in 80 from previous estimates (picture posed by models) It includes babies born with a defect as well as those babies where the defect led to a termination of the pregnancy. The researchers estimate there were at least 14,500 babies with birth defects in England and Wales in 2009. Joan Morris, professor of medical statistics at Queen Mary, University of London and editor of the report, said researchers did not believe the overall incidence of birth defects is on the rise. 'We know that the incidence is not increasing,' she said. 'What we are now saying is that we have good figures on what it actually is.' However, she said large parts of the country, including London, do not submit any data, making it difficult to identify whether these regions are experiencing an increase in any types of defect. Tragic: More than half the birth defects studied in the report were picked up during pregnancy which resulted in 43 per cent of cases being terminated . The report included data from five . regional registers. No registers exist in London and the South East, the . North West and East Anglia. The . report said the most common defect is congenital heart disease, which . affects at least five in 1,000 babies and can require major surgery. Around  six per cent of babies born with a heart defect will die before the age of one. Parents whose newborns need special care are not always told about their baby's condition after birth, according to a survey. The poll of 9,000 parents whose infants were admitted to a neonatal unit, which specialises in the care of premature or ill babies, found a mix of positive and negative experiences. More than one in five (22 per cent) said a member of staff did not talk to them about their baby's condition and treatment after the birth and 81 per cent said their partner or family member was not allowed to stay with them overnight following delivery. Some 46 per cent of parents were not clearly told about the purpose of the machines, monitors and alarms used in the unit, but they were largely positive about the neonatal staff. The survey, carried out by the not-for-profit Picker Institute Europe, is supported by Bliss and the Department of Health. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of Picker Institute Europe, said: 'Although our survey showed some positive responses about care and treatment in neonatal units, it also highlights a worrying lack of support for parents in terms of the information they receive' Neural . tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect one in 1,000 babies. Most of . these cases could be prevented through women taking folic acid . supplements while trying to conceive and during early pregnancy. Gastroschisis - a defect where the intestines develop outside the abdomen - affects one in 1,000 babies. Regional . monitoring has shown that this condition has become more common in some . areas, including Wales, and that babies born to younger mothers are at . greater risk. Prof Morris said: 'Over the last decade, it's doubled in Wales. Your risk is much higher if you are a younger mother.' She said factors such as alcohol, smoking and lifestyle were believed to influence the risk. According to the report, the estimated incidence of cleft lip and/or palate is 15.2 per 10,000 babies. Some 27 per 10,000 babies across England and Wales are also affected by Down's syndrome, two per 10,000 by another chromosomal condition called Patau syndrome and seven per 10,000 by Edwards syndrome. London has the highest prevalence of Down's syndrome (34 per 10,000 babies) while the North West had the lowest (21 per 10,000). The report said these differences 'probably reflect the different maternal age distributions', with mothers in London tending to be older, thereby having a higher risk of Down's. More than half (53 per cent) of all birth defects studied in the report were detected during pregnancy. Where the birth defect was detected in pregnancy, 43per cent resulted in a termination. Of those babies born alive, where the time of diagnosis was known, 68 per cent were diagnosed at birth, nine per cent were diagnosed in the first week, seven per cent between the second and fourth weeks and 17 per cent after the first month.","At least 14,500 in England and Wales in 2009 .

"Ebola-stricken Dr Craig Spencer has been whiling away the hours in quarantine strumming on his banjo and exercising, it was revealed Wednesday. Spencer, 33, has been in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for the past two weeks, slowly recovering from the deadly virus he had contracted while working in Guinea as part of Doctors Without Borders. He was diagnosed with Ebola October 23 , a week after returning home from Africa. Scroll down for video . On the mend: Dr Craig Spencer has been whiling away the hours in quarantine strumming on his banjo and exercising . New-age recreation: Spencer has been doing yoga and playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' Last week, the doctor requested that someone bring him his banjo from his apartment so he could pass the time in quarantine playing music. Spencer also reportedly has been keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room. Spencer, 33, has been in isolation since October 23 when he was diagnosed with Ebola upon his return from West Africa . ‘HHC has done everything possible to keep our patient comfortable. At his request, we gave him a banjo and put an exercise bike in his room. He has been using both,’ Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the New York City Health and Hospital Corp, confirmed to the New York Daily News. Another source told the New York Post that Spencer also has been doing yoga and playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff, some of whom were not impressed by his taste in music. These latest developments suggest that Mr Spencer is well on his way to a full recovery. Last weekend, his condition was upgraded from 'serious' to 'stable,' and a source told the paper that he is expected to be discharged within the next few weeks. ‘He is an avid little banjo player and he’s self-taught,’ Chriselle Gardner, the mother of Spencer’s fiancee Morgan Dixon, told the Post. ‘I can tell you, he’s keeping his doctors amused.’ Dixon has been in quarantine at their apartment since October 25. She will be able to leave their home for the first time since Craig’s diagnosis on November 14. New York City health officials also announced Wednesday that a person who had been in contact with Dr Spencer is being released from mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to daily evaluations by a doctor, reported CBS New York. More good news: Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, will be allowed to leave their apartment November 14 after 21 days in isolation . Morgan's mother says her future son-in-law is a self-taught banjo player who is very passionate about music . The HHC emphasized that the person in question does not show any Ebola symptoms and does not pose any health risk to the general public. City officials revealed Wednesday that a total of 357 people were being actively monitored for signs of Ebola as a precaution, among them travelers from West Africa and Bellevue staff caring for Dr Spencer .","Dr Craig Spencer, 33, has been kept in isolation at Bellevue Hospital for two weeks now .

"A senior jihadist believed to be behind a deadly bombing at the U.S. embassy in Yemen has been reported killed, the third time his death has been announced. Said al-Shihri, the second in command of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was reportedly killed in an airstrike in Yemen in December, according to a news report by Arabic television network Al Arabiya. According to the report, the Saudi-born militant died after sustaining severe injuries from a joint U.S.-Yemeni airstrike that targeted his convoy. Terror leader: Said al-Shihri, sedonc-in-command of the Yemeni based branch of Al Qaeda has been reported killed - for the fourth time . The al Arabiya account, based on information from 'family sources', said al-Shihri went into a coma  and allegedly died soon after. It is the third time he has been reported killed. In 2009 it was announced that he was killed by an American cruise missile and in September 2012, Yemeni news sites reported he was eliminated by a U.S. drone strike. Al-Shihri was detained in Guantanamo Bay for six years after being captured in fighting in Afghanistan. He caused controversy in the U.S. after he was released back to his Saudi Arabia in 2007 and underwent a Saudi rehabilitation programme for Islamic militants, almost immediately returning to terrorist activity on his release. The al Arabiya report said he was involved in the failed operation that targeted assassination of the Saudi interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in 2009. Al-Shihri was reported to have been killed by an unmanned predator aerial vehicle in September, but released a statement denying it soon after . Al-Shihri is also reported to have been involved in the kidnapping of foreigners in Yemen and was allegedly the mastermind behind the 2008 embassy bombing. AQAP, a highly active branch of Al Qaeda, was behind a suicide bombing aimed at the British ambassador in Yemen in April 2010, and a rocket fired at a British embassy vehicle in October 2010. The Yemeni army, supported by the U.S., has been fighting Islamist militants in the south of the country for months.

Narrated by Sir David Attenborough, the series explores the effects of  slimate change on the polar regions - and the lengths scientists are going to understand it. The next episode in the seven-part series is to be screened on BBC 1 next Wednesday, November 2, at 9pm. Scroll down to see more images from Frozen Planet. Coming up for air: This stunning image shows a pod of fish-eating KIller whales spyhopping among the breaking sea ice in Antarctica . Cracked surface: The largest ice cap in the Eurasian Arctic - Austfonna in Svalbard - is 150 miles long with a thousand waterfalls in the summer . Not alone: Cameraman Mark Smith (left) with just the penguins for company while a this polar bear looks ready for action as she prepares to launch herself from the ice . Bear hug: A mother nurses her two cubs, caught on camera in a stunning aerial shot. Her milk reserves are running low as she has not eaten for five months whilst in the den . Awesome spectacle: Bones break and tonnes of blubber slam into each other as two male elephant seals fight amidst a beach of king penguins . Hitching a ride: Adélie penguins on an iceberg surrounded by masses of floating ice, in western Antarctica (left), while the sky over the Arctic peninsula turns a deep shade of pink as the sun sets on another day . On reflection: A stunning scene shows penguins standing at the shore against a dramatic mountainous landscape, their images mirrored in the water . Lone wolf: A rare Arctic species on Ellesmere Island in Canada. These wolves are extremely remote and unused to humans (left), while an elephant sea flicks wet sand on to its back (right) to keep cool as king penguins on the shore in South Georgia look on . Close encounter: Filming killer whales from a boat in the Antarctic Peninsula. Some orcas are mammal hunters - they kill seals by working as a team to generate large waves that wash them off ice floes . Intrepid: Frozen Planet presenter Sir David Attenborough at the North Pole (left) while two bears test their strength during the autumn in Hudson Bay, Canada (right) Lonely landscape: The first sunrise of the year in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is on February 15 or 16, after being beneath the horizon for several months . Breaking free: A frozen Arctic river flows after six months locked in ice. The immense release of freshwater from the Arctic's waterways into the Arctic Ocean triggers the annual sea ice melt and fuels the mass migration of fish, birds and whales . Showing them the way: A polar bear leads her cubs across the desolate landscape, perhaps in search of food . I spy: A group of penguins appear to be startled by the sudden emergence of an orca spyhopping through the broken ice . A nest built for two: A male Adélie penguin puts the stones in place and prepares for some female company (left) while the fur flies between these two bull seals as they battle it out for mating rights on the beach . Leap of faith: Cubs jumping  into the water as the pack ice breaks up in the summer. Polar bears are actually marine mammals and are completely at home in the water as adults . Solitary swimmer: A polar bear gliding through the water  in front of the Austfonna ice cap in Svalbard. Polar bears can swim for 60 miles in a day . Deep freeze: The melting ice forms elegant ice sculptures which float across a glacial fjord in Svalbard . Not too close: A crew film a polar bear from a boat in pack ice. Frozen Planet is the first series to adapt a stabilised aerial camera and mount it to the front of boats, enabling filmmakers to get close to polar bears in their melting summer ice world . Gliding over the waves: A black-browed albatross off the coast of South Georgia (left) while a grey wolf pup (right) sticks close to mum on Ellesmere Island, Canada . Caught in the act: Adélie penguins - a species common along the Antarctic coast - collect stones for their nests. Thieves try to steal them, but this one has been rumbled . Outnumbered: Cameraman Mark Smith is surrounded by penguins as he films in harsh weather conditions. Frequent snow storms and winds of up to 150mph kept film crews on their toes throughout their four months working alone at Cape Crozier, Antarctica .","Landmark series has captivated millions with its portrait of the frozen world .

"Islamic State commanders are liable for war crimes on a 'massive scale' in northeast Syria where they spread terror by beheading, stoning and shooting civilians and captured fighters, U.N. investigators said on Friday. The experts told world powers to make sure the commanders guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity were held accountable by the International Criminal Court. The latest report by the independent U.N. investigators is based on interviews with more than 300 men, women and children who fled or still live in Islamic State's northeastern stronghold, including Aleppo. Scroll down for video . Islamic State commanders are liable for war crimes on a 'massive scale' in northeast Syria, the UN said. Pictured is the terrorist group's leader - Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi . Experts told world powers to make sure the commanders guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity were held accountable by the International Criminal Court . Ajihadist video purporting to show the execution of Iraqi soldiers by ISIS extremists in the Salaheddin province, Iraq . 'In carrying out mass killings of captured fighters and civilians following military assaults, ISIS (Islamic State) members have perpetrated egregious violations of binding international humanitarian law and the war crime of murder on a massive scale,' said the report. Foreign fighters, many of them recruited by violent videos, have swollen the group's ranks and dominate its leadership structure, the report said. 'The commanders of ISIS have acted wilfully, perpetrating these war crimes ... They are individually criminally responsible,' it added, saying the group's leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi wielded 'absolute power'. Since U.S.-led air strikes began targeting Islamic State in Syria in late September, 'civilians living in Minbij (Aleppo) described how ISIS fighters began to position themselves in civilian houses and farms,' the 20-page U.N. report said. An Isis fighter gestures from a vehicle in the countryside of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane . 'Air strikes on ISIS positions have led to some civilian casualties,' it said, without giving an estimate. Around 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict, the United Nations says. Islamic State enforces its edicts, based on its radical interpretation of Islamic law, through al-Hisbah 'morality police' who order lashings and amputations 'for offences such as smoking cigarettes or theft', the U.N. report said. Children are pressed to inform on their parents, women are executed for unapproved contact with men, and Christians and other minorities are forced to pay taxes or convert, it said. 'ISIS has beheaded, shot and stoned men, women and children in public spaces in towns and villages across northeastern Syria,' it said. 'The mutilated bodies of male victims are often placed on display, a warning to the local population of the consequences of failure to submit to the armed group's authority,' it added. Executions have been recorded in Aleppo, Raqqa, Idlib, Al-Hassakeh and Deir Al-Zor provinces, the investigators said. 'Witnesses saw scenes of still-bleeding bodies hanging from crosses and of heads placed on spikes along park railings,' the experts added. The 47-nation Human Rights Council in Geneva authorized the commission to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria and to identify whenever possible those responsible, so that they can be prosecuted.","ISIS leaders liable for war crimes on a 'massive scale' in Syria, the UN said .

"The furious mother of a four-year-old boy shot in the face has hit out after the teenage gunman was slapped with a fine instead of a prison sentence. Hayley Horton said she had been left 'angry, disappointed and upset' at the sentence after the 17-year-old admitted shooting her son Zak Horton as he was walking home from school. The mother-of-three said: 'He should have had a custodial sentence. He shot a four-year-old boy'. 'Disappointed': Jack and Hayley Horton with their son Zak who's scar is clearly visible on his chin after being shot with an airgun in the chin while he was walking home from school in June . She added: 'I’m angry, disappointed and upset - it’s no punishment. It’s sending out the message that you can do something like this and get away with it.' The boy, who cannot be named, was fined £500 and referred to a youth offending team. Upset: Zak's mother Hayley said her son is still very scared about what happened and can't be on his own . Zak was running along an alleyway with twin brother Charlie when he was hit on the chin by a potentially deadly air gun pellet. He had been on his way home from . Studley’s Community Infants School in Warwickshire on Tuesday, June 19, . when he was shot in front of his mother. It happened at around 3.25pm, less than 100 metres from Zak’s school. He . was rushed to Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital where medics operated to . remove the pellet, but he has been left with a half-inch scar. Hayley . and father Jack, a 27-year-old Land Rover engineer in Solihull’s Lode . Lane factory, maintained a bedside vigil while their boy was sedated. Meanwhile, . Warwickshire Police had arrested the culprit and bailed him until . earlier this month, when he was charged with assault causing actual . bodily harm - a section 47 assault. The Studley teenager appeared at Leamington and Rugby Youth Court in Leamington, where he pleaded guilty to the charge. He . was told to pay £85 costs and £500 compensation to Zak on top of six . months with a youth offending team which will monitor his progress and . try to stop him committing more crimes. 'We’ve not told Zak about it. He would be frightened to know this ‘naughty boy’ isn’t with the police,' added Ms Horton, 28. 'He’s still very scared about what happened and can’t be on his own. Hospital: Since he recovered Zak (pictured in hospital) is still very scared and doesn't like being on his own . Worrying: Jack and Hayley kept a bedside vigil while their son Zak was sedated. The 17-year-old culprit was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm but has been spared a jail sentence . 'And so far we’ve avoided the area he got shot, but we’ll have to go there when the new school term starts. 'But what’s made it worse is that we weren’t allowed to go to court, so we don’t know what this teenager looks like. 'Whenever I see a teenage boy in the street now I think: ‘Was that him?’ If I knew what he looked like then I could make sure we avoided him.' The court ordered the teenager's airgun be destroyed.","Teenager, 17, admitted shooting Zak Horton with an airgun as he was walking home from school .

"If using your age, gender and marital status wasn't enough for companies to show you highly targeted ads, Apple has filed plans to use your emotions, too. The patent, filed by the firm earlier this month, proposes a system that uses 'mood-associated characteristics' to determine how a user is feeling and show the most appropriate adverts. This includes analysing which apps they’re using, websites they've visited, whether it's a national holiday or not, as well as heart rate and facial expressions. An Apple patent has proposed a system that uses 'mood-associated characteristics' to determine whether a user is happy, pictured, sad, angry and so. They can then show the most appropriate adverts. This includes analysing which apps they're using, websites they've visited, heart rate and facial expressions . If a user, for example, has been . playing game apps and watching funny videos on YouTube, Apple could . infer that they are happy, or in a positive frame of mind. The . adverts shown could not only be personalised, based on the type of . video or game, they could also be light-hearted and have a 'positive . tone.' Similarly, the system could take into account external factors to determine the mood. On . national holidays, or the user's birthday, the inferred mood of the . adverts could be lifted, while following a tragedy, or if the user has . been planning a funeral, for example, the mood could be 'downgraded.' It could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs, ballads or emo music, as an example. Apple could even record how much pressure is applied to a device's screen, in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels. The patent is called 'Inferring user mood based on user and group characteristic . data'. Apple's system would work on the current principle used in personalised and targeted advertising on websites. Currently, if users allow cookies to track them around the web, companies can show related adverts on other webpages, because they know what kind of products the user is interested in. For example, if a user is searching for a holiday, the adverts will promote holidays, flights and other related travel products or services. Yet Apple's system would take this a step further, by using a person's mood to personalise the adverts. If a user, for example, has been playing game apps and watching funny videos on YouTube, Apple could infer that they are happy, or in a positive frame of mind. The adverts shown could not only be personalised, based on the type of video or game, they could also be light-hearted and have a 'positive tone.' Similarly, the system could take into account external factors that may determine the mood. On national holidays, or the user's birthday, the inferred mood of the adverts could be lifted, while following a tragedy, or if the user has been planning a funeral, for example, the mood could be 'downgraded.' The patent also states other physical characteristics could be used to establish a person's mood, such as blood pressure, perspiration rate, body temperature and movement. This suggests the technology could be used in any wearable technology the firm releases, including its rumoured iWatch, concept pictured . It could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs, ballads or emo music, as an example. This patent image shows the proposed process of gathering clues to the user's mood, and serving appropriate adverts . Elsewhere, the patent states physical characteristics could be used to establish a person's mood, such as 'heart rate; blood pressure; adrenaline . level; perspiration rate; body temperature; vocal expression, movement characteristics and . facial expressions.' This means the technology could be used in Apple's phones and tablets, as well as any wearable technology the firm releases in the future, such as its rumoured iWatch. The facial expressions, in particular, could be recorded using a phone's camera. Apple's system could even record how much pressure is applied to a device's screen, in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels. According to the patent, discovered by AppleInsider: '‘Mood-associated characteristics can define characteristics indicative of a user's mood at a point in time. 'Mood-associated behavioral characteristics can include sequence of content consumed, e.g. sequence of applications launched, rate at which the user changed applications; social networking activities, pressure applied to a touch screen, and/or emotional response to previously served targeted content. 'Mood-associated spatial-temporal characteristics can include location, date, day, time, and/or day part.' The patent proposes creating a 'baseline mood profile' that will help to create profiles for each emotion.  A 'confidence score' will then be used to estimate the mood. Apple does explain that the system would be opt-in, and opt-out, and the patent has only been filed - it has not been awarded.","Patent describes Apple’s plans to serve content based on a person’s mood .

"A Spanish nursing assistant who contracted Ebola after treating two priests who later died of the disease has been released from hospital. Teresa Romero, 44, was taken into isolation on October 6 after developing symptoms of the deadly virus. She contracted the virus after helping treat two Spanish missionaries who caught the disease while working in Liberia. Scroll down for video . Teresa Romero, left, was kissed by her husband Javier Limon after she was discharged from hospital . The nursing assistant, left, has beaten the Ebola virus after being treated with some experimental therapy . After receiving the experimental treatment, Ms Romero's condition improved dramatically . She was the first person known to have contracted the disease outside of west Africa in the latest outbreak. Hospital doctors said Ms Romero received various treatments, including blood plasma from an Ebola survivor, but were unable to say if any had been effective. Ms Romero had treated two Spanish missionaries who died of Ebola in August and September after they were flown back from west Africa. Doctors said she will be able to live a normal life and poses no contamination risk. Ms Romero was said to be heartbroken after Spanish officials killed her dog Excalibur instead of putting it into quarantine over fears it may have contracted the disease. Ms Romero, who has been in quarantine since October 6, says she plans to get a new puppy - 'a little Excalibur' - after authorities had her old dog put down over fears it could spread Ebola . The nurse cared for Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo. Ms Romero is the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests. A new 80-bed treatment centre for treating patients suffering from Ebola funded by the British taxpayer has opened in Sierra Leone. The Kerrytown facility will be managed by Save the Children while a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army Medics will concentrate on health care workers struck down by the virus. The work was funded by the Department of International Development and the job was overseen by British Army Royal Engineers. British Army Royal Engineers took just eight weeks to build the new treatment facility in Sierra Leone . The treatment centre has also doubled Sierra Leone's capacity to test samples of the killer disease . In addition to the treatment beds, the facility has a laboratory to identify new cases of the disease. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Sierra Leone does not have enough hospital beds to cope with the scale of the Ebola crisis. Patients are being turned away from hospitals, reducing their chance of survival and allowing the disease to spread. 'That is why British Army Engineers together with Sierra Leonean construction workers have been working round the clock for the last eight weeks to get Kerry Town built. This treatment facility, the first of six British-built centres, will give patients the care they need to fight Ebola, limiting the spread of this terrible disease.'","Teresa Romero contracted Ebola in Spain while treating two missionaries .

"Michael McAllister, 23, was jailed for seven years after a jury rejected claims he was a sexsomniac when he raped a 16-year-old girl at a party . A man who raped a teenage girl at a New Year’s Eve party and then said he was a sexsomniac began a seven-year jail sentence tonight after jurors were told his claims were a sham. Michael McAllister, 23, who said the condition made him have sex in his sleep without his knowledge, was one of several guests at the party invited to stay over when it finished. Later that night, McAllister climbed into bed with a half-asleep 16-year-old girl. He touched her intimately and then had sex against her will as she lay crying, too scared to fight him off. She tried to get out of bed and escape but McAllister just grabbed her and continued raping her. When he was arrested after the attack in Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire, McAllister told police: ‘It’s not the first time I have had sex with someone while I am asleep.’ However, a former girlfriend told jurors at Preston Crown Court that the only thing she could remember him doing in his sleep was snoring. In his evidence, McAllister insisted he had been completely unaware of anything happening and was surprised when he was kicked out of the house by other guests. Giving evidence to the court, sleep expert Dr Chris Idzikowski said sexsomnia was a real condition. He said even though McAllister admitted having drunk significant amounts of Martini and vodka at the party he may still have suffered a incidence of the condition. The case is the latest in a series of controversial trials in which men have claimed they cannot be held accountable for rapes or sexual assaults because they suffer from the rare sleep condition known as parasomnia, which causes people to behave abnormally during sleep by eating (sleep-related eating disorder), walking around (somnambulism) or having sex (sexomnia). But prosecutor Francis McEntee told the court that McAllister’s assertion that he engaged in sexual activity in his sleep was a ‘sham’ and he had resorted to an ‘implausible explanation’. Judge Heather Lloyd jailed McAllister for seven years at Preston Crown Court, pictured. She said 'most men, even in drink, do not sexually assault, let alone rape young woman who are asleep' Jacob Dyer, defending, told the court: ‘Initially, he was trying his luck, not knowing really whether there would be any consent or not. ‘This was wholly out of character for him. He was very drunk. There is some degree of remorse, despite the failure to admit guilt. ‘There is at least a degree of amnesia, although not amnesia caused by a sleeping problem, but amnesia caused by alcohol. ‘Although there is no admission of guilt, he says he feels like a monster. Following his conviction he stopped drinking altogether.’ Sentencing him yesterday to seven years in prison, Judge Heather Lloyd told McAllister he had sought out his victim while she slept and raped her at the party last year. She added: ‘I accept had you been sober, you would not have behaved as you did, but most men, even in drink, do not sexually assault, let alone rape young women who are asleep. ‘You are saddened by your conviction. There doesn’t seem to me to be any particular remorse or insight or acknowledgement about what you have done and what has happened.’","Michael McAllister claimed he had 'sexsomnia' before Preston Crown Court .

More than 700 homes are taking part in the trial, which runs until the end of 2014 . Kassir Hussain, director of British Gas Connected Homes, said: ‘Current boiler technology means many engineer visits to investigate a boiler fault result in a return visits because engineers cannot carry every potential spare part with them for every visit.’ ‘Connected Boilers which can tell us what the fault is remotely mean we can fix boilers first time, much more reliably. ‘It’s never convenient when a boiler needs repairing - but this revolutionary new system will mean engineer visits are shorter. ‘In some cases, we’ll be able to contact the customer and arrange to fix the boiler before our customer even notices a problem.’","The smart boiler uses Worcester Bosch technology to diagnose faults .
