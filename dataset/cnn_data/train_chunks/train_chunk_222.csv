"(CNN) -- Three ballistic missile crew members have been punished for sleeping during a sensitive task, the Air Force reported Thursday. Two first lieutenants and a captain fell asleep on July 12 while in control of a classified electronic part that contained old launch codes for intercontinental nuclear missiles. It happened during the changing out of electronic parts used to communicate with Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. Maj. Laurie A. Arellano, an Air Force spokeswoman, confirmed to CNN they have been ""decertified from missile operations,"" been given written reprimands and will forgo part of their pay for two months. This comes under an Article 15 procedure that allows for discipline without court action. She said two squadron commanders are among six other officers who were sanctioned for their roles in the incident, and disciplinary letters are in their files. Two officers are under investigation for lying about destroying classified missile components, and another for alleged sexual misconduct, the military reported. A crew member formerly from the 91st Missile Wing told the military last May that he and another officer formerly assigned to the wing didn't tell the truth about destroying classified launch devices in July 2005, Arellano said. Such devices are approximately the size of a bandage and are used on equipment inside the launch control center to detect any equipment tampering, the Air Force says. Arellano said they were expected to destroy the items and they signed documents that said the material was destroyed. But the one officer who came forward said each man took one of the items home, Arellano said. That crew member who notified the Air Force turned over his device, but it is not known what happened to the other device, Arellano said. The two have been reassigned to other capacities while the investigation continues. Arellano said there is no security risk since the material that was expected to be destroyed had been overridden. Another incident involved alleged sexual contact at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. Arellano said the Air Force was told in March that a male crew member sexually assaulted a woman in December while they were on duty in a launch control area. The man also has been reassigned during the probe and Arellano said she didn't know the duty status of the woman. ""There is no more important mission anywhere than maintaining the readiness, safety and security of our nuclear weapons. We are fully committed to demonstrating to the American people we deserve their trust to do that mission."" said Gen. C. Robert Kehler, head of the Air Force Space Command, quoted in an Air Force news release. ""Each violation of our very exacting standards is fully investigated, and every person at all levels is held fully accountable for their actions."" There have been a string of Air Force mishaps and problems relating to weapons. A truck carrying an unarmed missile booster tipped over in North Dakota in July. The vehicle, which was carrying a Minuteman III rocket booster, tipped on its side on a gravel road about 70 miles southwest of Minot Air Force Base. The crew received only minor injuries. Last August, a B-52 bomber flew from Minot to Louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped missiles were onboard, and a shipment of components that arm and fuse nuclear warheads was accidentally sent to Taiwan in 2006. An investigation prompted by those incidents led to the firing of Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne and Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley.

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- An estimated 3 billion people -- nearly half the world's population -- still use an open fire as their primary source of energy for cooking and heating. But there's a problem: the smoke. ""You have respiratory issues, lung disease, you've got pneumonia, and you've got longer-term issues like cancer and heart disease as well that can result from exposure to indoor air pollution,"" said Radha Muthiah, executive director of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. The World Health Organization says this type of pollution causes nearly 2 million premature deaths each year. That's more than tuberculosis and three times as many as malaria. Everline Kihulla is among the people trying to do something about it. She works for TaTedo, which manufactures and sells ""clean cookstoves"" in Tanzania. TaTedo's stoves are made with clay liners that, along with other simple design features, emit far less smoke and fewer pollutants. And they use a fraction of the fuel. ""This (stove), we have improved it, and it currently uses almost 50%, compared to the traditional one,"" she said, crouching beside one of TaTedo's models. ""The charcoal consumption here is less, compared to the traditional one."" Another benefit is that these stoves are made locally. A nearby workshop employs 21 people and churns out 400 to 500 stoves each month. Each person follows a cookstove through every stage of production, from pottery to painting. This teaches each worker a variety of skills. Producing locally also boosts the economy and keeps costs down, although price is an issue. Cookstove prices start at about $6 (U.S.), a lot of money for many families in developing countries. Still, Lillian Njuu, a Dar es Salaam resident, thinks the expense is worth the health of her family. She has used a clean stove for two years, she said, and she plans to buy another. While the upfront cost to buy a cookstove is high, the fuel costs are lower because it burns less. That, in turn, has an environmental impact. Burning less charcoal or wood means there's less deforestation, something that has caused flooding and other major problems in many countries. ""It's one relatively simple intervention that has a multitude of impacts,"" Muthiah said. Now, the challenge is to get clean stoves into enough homes to really make a difference.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Presenting mooncakes to relatives and business associates may be an integral part of China's Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, but a new law aims to dampen the spirit of mooncake giving -- at least among government officials. As announced by the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency, the Chinese government has announced that officials will no longer be able to use public money to send mooncakes as gifts during the festival. This year's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 19. The new restriction is being presented as part of President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption and official largesse. ""Superior departments and officials should seize on the trend of these luxurious celebrations and be courageous enough to spot and rectify decadent behavior in a timely manner while setting an example themselves,"" the party circular read. The traditional pastry eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival is normally filled with salted duck egg yolk and lotus seed paste. The egg yolk inside symbolizes the moon -- each piece can contain up to 1,000 calories. Mainland China and Hong Kong are particularly devoted to mooncakes. Come the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, many bakeries set up special mooncake counters just to service customers seeking the pastries. ""Ninety percent of people who buy mooncakes give them to others,"" says Karlson Wong, head of sales and marketing at Kee Wah Bakery, one of Hong Kong's oldest bakeries. ""It's an opportunity to show respect and build relationships."" Mooncake graft . A traditional time for family members to gather, the Mid-Autumn Festival has a unique gift-giving culture. Although gifts and ""lucky"" envelopes filled with cash are exchanged during Chinese New Year, these must typically be accompanied by personal visits to people's homes. Not so for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Gifts can be sent by mail, opening up a whole new world of opportunity to pay respect to many people in a wide network all at once. In recent years, mooncake giving has exploded in mainland China. Boxes worth upward of RMB 2,000 ($318) are snapped up by businesspeople eager to bet their business relations on a cake. Expensive mooncake packages have been known to include high-grade tea leaves, bottles of alcohol or hidden envelopes of cash or coupons for luxury goods, riding the fine line between gifting and bribing. Last year, mainland authorities began enforcing a rule on gift packages, disallowing all non-mooncake items from packs labeled ""mooncake."" This year's law is meant to deliver an even stronger blow against Big Mooncake.","Chinese officials are no longer able to use public money to send mooncakes as gifts .

"Washington (CNN) -- While reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means, President Obama expanded his social media experience by holding a Google+ video chat room interview Monday afternoon. In an election year, it's probably not good politics to talk about what you look forward to doing after your time in the White House, but that's exactly what President Obama did when asked about the frustrations of living in the security bubble. ""It's the toughest thing about being president. Look, this is the greatest job on Earth, and it's such an honor to serve, but it is true sometimes, you get a little stir crazy,"" he said ""One of the things I look forward to after I've had this extraordinary honor is just taking a walk or waking up on Saturday morning, not shaving and going to the local Starbucks and not having to worry about it."" The president was also asked to sing and dance, (which he refused) to say hello to one of the questioners' young children, and from an Obama impersonator a question about the impact of comedy sketches on the election. ""I don't know if any of this stuff affects an election, but I know that it makes our country stronger that you can make fun of the president -- or anybody -- and everybody can get a laugh,"" President Obama said. ""And that also makes sure to remind me that I work for you guys."" Most of the forum, which came in the form of live video connections and video YouTube questions, focused on the economy. ""We're starting to see some signs that the economy is picking up. We've created 3 million jobs over 22 months, and we saw the largest boost in manufacturing jobs that we've seen since the '90s. Best job growth we've seen since 2005. But we've still got a lot more to do,"" President Obama said. ""I have to keep this recovery going, that's why it's so important for us to extend the payroll tax cut."" The live video chat room included five Americans in cities across the country. Participants were able to follow up with the president after his answers in real time. Jennifer Wedel in Corpus Christi, Texas, asked the president why the government continues to extend visas for immigrant workers when there are many people, like her husband, who have been out of work. President Obama offered to look at her husband's resume to help him find an engineering job. ""Forward me his resume,"" he told her. ""The word we're getting is someone in that high-tech field should be able to find something right away. I want to follow up on that."" The questions were chosen by Google team members from among the most top-rated of those submitted. Google maintains the White House had no role in the selection of the participants. Obama also held a similar Facebook town hall at the Web giant's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, in the spring, and a YouTube town hall at the White House in February.","President holds online town hall meeting via Google+ .

"(CNN)  -- Smokable herbal blends marketed as ""legal highs"" have become increasingly popular and as easy to buy as cigarettes. The blends of exotic herbs and other plants have been sprayed or coated with one or more chemicals that, when smoked, produce euphoria. They are commonly labeled as herbal incense to mask their intended purpose. These contain drugs that are dangerous and should be illegal. ""K2"" is a brand name for a dried herbal blend that can be smoked. It produces a high similar to that of marijuana but doesn't contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemical in marijuana. Instead, K2 contains synthetic chemicals, known as JWH-018 and JWH-073, that mimic THC by acting on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain. For another opinion, click here . JWH-018 and JWH-073 are produced in China and unregulated in the United States. Similar products have been produced and marketed under names such as Spice, Genie, Blaze, Red X Dawn and Zohai. Since 2009, the Drug Enforcement Administration has been receiving reports of the abuse of these herbal products. K2's key ingredients were invented by Dr. John Huffman at Clemson University in 1995 during medical research on the effects of cannabinoids on the brain. He found no medical benefits -- only negative side effects. Unfortunately, marijuana users reproduced the recipe, creating a legal alternative to marijuana. Although the company manufacturing K2 is unknown, it is legally available for purchase in the U.S. by anyone, including minors. In late 2008, herbal incense-type products that were being shipped from Europe to the U.S. were found to contain traces of another potent psychoactive chemical known as HU-210. It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance because it is a derivative of THC with a similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity. HU-210 was also developed for experimental purposes and can be from 100 to 800 times as potent as THC. In 2009, Germany banned the sale of Spice because tests revealed that it contained JWH-018 and yet another potent chemical, CP-47 497, developed by a drug company in the 1980s for research purposes. It produces effects similar to THC and is three to 28 times more potent. Spice is banned by some U.S. military commands, where the potential for its abuse has been recognized. Research has linked naturally produced marijuana to health issues, including schizophrenia. With synthetic marijuana being even more potent, it is frightening to consider its potential damage. K2 can cause increased heart rate, loss of consciousness, paranoia, hallucinations and psychotic episodes. Users report that smoking small amounts results in intense highs comparable to smoking large amounts of marijuana. Studies in 2008 revealed that users developed chemical dependencies, withdrawal and addictive behaviors. Increasing numbers of children are purchasing synthetic marijuana products because they are legal and easier to obtain than cigarettes. Because of the various chemicals being used, these substances are difficult to regulate. But the DEA is determining whether some or all of these products need to be controlled. More research is definitely needed. With young people using K2 more, some states are not waiting for the DEA and are moving to ban it. Let's face it: Anytime you consume an uncontrolled or unregulated drug or a drug with unknown effects, you are taking a risk. Products like K2 are not made in a controlled environment, and those who use it are playing Russian roulette. Schedule I drugs are defined as substances that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. At this time, the evidence suggests that these synthetic marijuana substances should be controlled and perhaps classified as Schedule I drugs. Making these drugs illegal makes it more difficult for dealers to push them to our children. It limits availability and sends a message that the drug is dangerous -- an extremely important message since history has shown that when youngsters perceive drugs to be harmful, they are less likely to use them. K2 serves no apparent useful purpose, and we do not need more addicted family members, drug-impaired drivers or drug-related deaths. The sale of synthetic marijuana is banned in Britain, Germany, Poland, France, South Korea and Russia. The U.S. should move urgently to protect the public from yet another dangerous and potentially deadly class of drugs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Calvina Fay.","Calvina Fay: Minors can buy smokable herbal blends sprayed with chemicals .

"Rome (CNN) -- Judges in the trial of the captain of the wrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia agreed Wednesday to his request for a new examination of the ship, Costa Cruises spokesman Davide Barbano told CNN from inside the court. Lawyers for Capt. Francesco Schettino had asked the panel of three judges on Monday for permission to tour the ship's bridge and engine room as part of a defense strategy he says will prove Schettino was not the only person responsible for the disaster. The move could delay the legal process for months. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised . Schettino's defense is trying to prove that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to the loss of 32 lives during the evacuation. A special team of divers will have to examine parts of the ship which are still under water, including the engine room and watertight doors. The liner, which crashed on the rocks off Giglio Island in January 2012, was rotated back to vertical last week after well over a year resting on its side. The unprecedented maneuver, called parbuckling, exposed a twisted mass of metal dotted with mattresses, passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship's previously submerged starboard side. Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship. Defense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship. How cruise ship tragedy transformed an island paradise . Prosecutors are expected to argue that Schettino's decision to take the cruise liner off course is what caused the loss of life, not secondary mistakes or malfunctions. Schettino also argued Monday that Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin's failure to understand his command to turn away from the rocks led to the crash. Rusli Bin and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements.","Judges agree to a request for a new examination of the Costa Concordia .

"(CNN) -- Four of nine teenagers sought in an Amber Alert are now in their parents' custody, but investigators are still searching for the five other missing boys in New Mexico, police said Saturday. Authorities confirmed that the four youths were in the custody of one or both parents, the New Mexico Department of Public Safety said in a statement. The Amber Alert remains in effect for five teenage boys, authorities said. The nine teens were attending a facility for troubled youths called the Tierra Blanca Youth Ranch, and authorities began searching for them after receiving allegations of abuse, police say. The Amber Alert for all nine teens was issued despite the fact that an attorney for the ranch director said all the teens were safe. The incident started Friday, when state police investigators went to the ranch to execute a search warrant and investigate claims of abuse, authorities said. The youths were not at the ranch and neither was Scott Chandler, the ranch director, the New Mexico State Police said. Pete Domenici, Chandler's attorney, said the teens had just gone on a trip and nothing was wrong. ""The boys from the Tierra Blanca Ranch have been on a previously scheduled activity away from the ranch for several days,"" Domenici said. ""They are safe and have already been picked up by their parents or their parents are en route to pick them up."" Despite the attorney's statement, the Amber Alert was not rescinded. State police on Saturday urged Chandler and the parents of the missing boys to contact them. Florida exhumes bodies at former boys school . ""This is still an active investigation,"" said state police Sgt. Emmanuel Gutierrez. ""We have not visually seen these kids to confirm their whereabouts, which is why the Amber Alert remains active."" The confusion seems to stem from allegations of abuse of the teens at the ranch, CNN affiliate KRQE reported. ""We have allegations of abuse,"" New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said, according to KRQE. ""We're required by law to investigate, and when you suddenly show up to the place and everybody's gone, it's of huge concern to us."" State officials were investigating claims that youths at the camp had been threatened, shackled and beaten, the affiliate said. Chandler has denied these claims, his attorney said, and he has filed suit against the state for the handling of the case, KRQE reported. The ranch director tried to resolve the situation in court, but a hearing had been delayed, the lawyer said. The Tierra Blanca Ranch in Hillsboro, New Mexico, is a 30,000-acre facility that bills itself as a ""new beginning for troubled at-risk youth,"" according to its website.

"(CNN) -- David Moyes' first Manchester derby ended in crushing defeat Sunday as his United team suffered an embarrassing 4-1 loss away to English Premier League title rival City. Moyes, facing the immense task in replacing Alex Ferguson -- the most successful manager in British football history -- could only watch as City netted four times in the first 50 minutes against the defending champion. Sergio Aguero scored the first and third, Yaya Toure made it 2-0 in first-half injury time and Samir Nasri put the result beyond doubt. It lifted City up to third in the table, with new manager Manuel Pellegrini vindicated in restoring Alvaro Negredo to the starting lineup as the Spain striker set up two of the goals. Moyes was robbed of the services of last season's top scorer Robin van Persie, who was ruled out with a groin injury, and Wayne Rooney was unable to continue the resurgent form he has shown up front this season until he curled in a stunning free-kick in the 87th minute. ""Every manager has bad days and bad results. I am no different,"" Moyes said. ""I have been here with Everton many times and I don't think I suffered a defeat like this with Everton. ""I talked with the players the same as I would at any other club. They are good pros here and they know when they are bang at it and when they are not."" While the result echoed City's 6-1 thumping of United at Old Trafford two years ago, which gave Roberto Mancini's men a five-point cushion at the top on the way to a long-awaited league title, this time the victory has merely kept the Light Blues in touch with leading sides Arsenal and Tottenham. The London clubs ended this weekend with a two-point advantage after Arsenal beat Stoke 3-1, with record signing Mesut Ozil having a hand in all three goals, and Tottenham edged Cardiff 1-0 thanks to an injury-time winner from Paulinho. United, meanwhile, dropped to eighth in the table with just seven points from five matches -- five behind the top two. Moyes' team also lost to Liverpool and drew with Chelsea in a difficult run of early fixtures. ""The start to the season could be a lot better,"" the Scot said. ""We did say it could be a difficult start. ""I wasn't convinced when the balls came out of the Premier League bag (for the schedule) and I'm still not convinced."" Pellegrini was understandably pleased with his best result since leaving Spanish club Malaga at the end of last season. ""I'm very happy. The way we played is the way I want this team to play, very similar to against Newcastle (a 4-0 win). We played the way we work all week,"" the Chilean said. ""We have been playing irregular in other games, but it is normal in this moment of the season. This was a high test today and the players had a great answer."" Aguero put City ahead in the 16th minute as the Argentina striker superbly hooked in a volley from Aleksandar Kolarov's left-wing cross, with Nasri also involved in the move. Toure pounced for the vital second just before the break, sticking out a knee to divert the ball into the net after Negredo rose highest to head down a corner. Negredo, signed for $26 million from Sevilla in July, was again the provider just a minute after the restart as he turned and put in the perfect cross for Aguero to volley home a much simpler effort than his first. Nasri was criticized for his performance in last season's corresponding fixture, a tempestuous 3-2 defeat for City marred by pitch invasions and coin throwing, but he has been a different player this campaign. The France midfielder calmly volleyed in the fourth goal at the far post from a cross by Jesus Navas -- another new addition to City's squad -- after captain Vincent Kompany stopped a United attack and charged upfield. Rooney is also in significantly better form this season, having flirted with a move to Chelsea but now seemingly committed to United. The England striker's late corner allowed Patrice Evra to head against the post, and soon after he gave City keeper Joe Hart no chance with his fourth goal in the last three matches. Arsenal's victory was the club's seventh in a row since losing 3-1 at home to Aston Villa on the opening day of this season. Manager Arsene Wenger hailed the contribution of Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil, who has settled in quickly since leaving Real Madrid on transfer deadline day. ""Once he is completely integrated we will see even more of him, but he has shown today that he is a great player,"" said Wenger said. ""Ozil is a player, when you look at his numbers, the assists are not a coincidence, it is just the reality of his game. ""You could see today he has a good pace as well. At the moment he focuses a lot on his passing, but he can create individually as well."" Tottenham needed a moment of magic from Paulinho, one of several new signings, as the Brazil midfielder backheeled the winner at Cardiff from Erik Lamela's pass. ""There could only be one winner,"" said Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas. ""We played so much football it would have been unfair to leave here with only one point."" In Sunday's other match, Swansea moved up to ninth with a 2-0 win at promoted Crystal Palace, which stayed second from bottom. Bottom club Sunderland sacked coach Paolo Di Canio on Sunday, following a 3-0 defeat against West Brom 24 hours earlier. The Italian was a controversial appointment on March 31 due to his past statements in support of fascism, but he kept the club in the top flight in 17th place. However, Sunderland has just one point from five games this season.","Manchester City wins 4-1 in Sunday's derby match against Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- If England's netballers are going to realize their goal of becoming the world's finest team, they're going to have to get nasty. No longer does Jo Harten want her colleagues to be out-muscled by their Antipodean cousins, who have ruled the roost at the sport's top table for many years. England's goalscoring hotshot thinks if her team can ally that physicality to an equally sturdy mentality, their aim of being world champions before the decade is out is within grasp. ""The likes of Australia and New Zealand, they can really take each other out, and as an English team we're striving for that,"" Harten told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I think in terms of mental and physical it's changing as the game progresses. The international scene is getting harder; you have to be physically prepared to get knocked to the ground for every ball. ""At the moment, as an English team we're trying to build our confidence and work on the mental side of our game to really try and get up there to be one or two in the world."" England have firmly established themselves as the world's third best team, and have now reached a stage where they are nipping at the heels of the two titans in front of them. A landmark 3-0 series whitewash over the current world champions Australia earlier this year was a mark of their progress, and a sign of the sport's resurgence in England. Heftier funding and a sustained drive to boost participation has seen people flood back to the sport, reflected in the prowess of the national team. Now, after bronze medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and 2011 World Championships, England want to gatecrash the duopoly that has held firm since the 1960s. No other nation has won the world title, except when there was a three-way tie with Trinidad and Tobago in 1979, while second-ranked New Zealand will defend the Commonwealth crown in Glasgow next year. A lot of England's hopes will rest on Harten, who already has 50 caps to her name at the age of 24, as the focal point of their attack. ""The challenge is that we're third in the world as an English team, and we want to be number one in the world,"" Harten explains. ""I think Australia and New Zealand have this monopoly over netball, and as an English team we're really trying to change and break the mold at the moment. ""We've started new training programs, we've started to beat the best teams in the world, but now it's for us to consistently start to do that, and that's a big challenge."" A netball team consists of seven players, with restrictions on each in terms of where they can roam on court. Played at a fast pace, players can only take two steps when holding the ball and are only allowed to be in possession for a maximum three seconds. Speed of thought and fleet of foot are essential, as is teamwork. As ""Goal Shooter,"" Harten is only allowed in the final third of the court and must rely on her teammates to supply the bullets. ""The main thing for us is working as a team on and off the court, week in week out,"" she says. ""You need to have outstanding team work because only two people can shoot, so getting the ball from defense to attack is all about how the team can control the pace, control what the opposition are doing as well. ""We just started a new program, so we're seeing each other every week on a regular basis. That really helps our combinations on the court; we do gym training together, running together and obviously tactical stuff together. ""The more contact time we have as a team the better we can produce in international matches."" More than 35,000 people have been reintroduced to the game since the ""Back to Netball"" scheme launched in 2010, allowing legions of women to rekindle the skills they learned at school. Healthy crowds turn out to watch the national team in action, with the latest figures showing participation up 34% in the last four years, to just shy of 160,000. Added to that, Sport England has committed Â£25.3 million ($40.4m) to netball for the next four years with Â£5m ($7.9m) targeted at the elite level. So how close is netball to being included on the Olympic roster? ""I think it's played enough over the world but it's not played by men, which is probably one of the boundaries netball has -- that the men's side of the game is not up there with the women's,"" Harten explains. ""Having a single-sex sport in the Olympics is unheard of -- there's only one or two. That, coupled with the fact that nations like America haven't fully embraced it. ""They are quite a basketball nation, so when things like that start to happen and that ball starts rolling hopefully it will get into the Olympics in the future."" Though the England team is thriving, the domestic eight-team Superleague does not pay players. As such players like Harten and Eboni Beckford-Chambers have gone to the other side of the world to compete semi-professionally for teams in New Zealand and Australia respectively. ""I'm probably one of the only members of the England team who is a full-time athlete, but I play my club netball in New Zealand because it's the only semi-pro league in the world,"" Harten says. ""When I come back I'm an athlete for the England national team and do some coaching part-time. ""Our captain works for Airbus, so she's got quite a good job. Others work for England Netball in different aspects -- regional development centers, coaches, that kind of behind-the-scenes stuff. ""They are not full-time athletes but kind of full-time netball brains."" For Beckford-Chambers, wherever she is playing, it is the camaraderie she revels in. ""The team spirit is what I love about the game -- that I can be with a bunch of girls with the same passion as me,"" she says. ""We go through all the highs and lows together, and we're all aiming for the same goal. It really is my second family, and I've definitely been through the ranks with some of these girls since I was 15 years old. ""It's something I hold close to my heart and something I just absolutely love doing -- traveling, seeing the rest of the world and playing.""","England's netball team aiming to become champions of the world by 2019 .

"(CNN) -- The budget battles continue to rage. Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins. At best, the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions, temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional. At worst, the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or Congress will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks. The impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy. Few dispute that our budget process is broken. But the nation is so buried in the weeds, trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle, that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process. Partisan strategy is one of the main culprits. Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. But in recent years, Republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff Democratic presidents. The strategy has deep roots. In 1966 and 1967, conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end. In 1995 and 1996, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts. Even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing, which had plummeted after the 1994 election, the GOP continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of Clinton's term, leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands. Since 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue. They have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default. To be sure there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents as well. The difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies, whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat. In a recent interview with The New York Times, New York Republican Peter King lambasted his colleagues, calling Sen. Ted Cruz's recent tactics, ""a form of governmental terrorism."" Another reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because, historically, once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic, the practice can become normalized. The best example is the filibuster. There was a time when members of the Senate were reluctant to use the filibuster frequently. They reserved it for high-profile issues, like civil rights, believing that ordinarily a majority should be sufficient to pass legislation. But since the 1970s, the filibuster has become a routine weapon in partisan combat. Senators have been willing to threaten or use the filibuster more frequently, and to do so on rather mundane issues. The result has been that the Senate became a chamber where a supermajority is required on most issues. We're seeing a similar dynamic with the budget. Whereas threatening a government shutdown was once seen as a highly dramatic act, in the current environment there are many legislators who seem to view it as a legitimate part of congressional debate. While there was a time when legislators warned that they would not vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling only when they knew that Congress was going to raise the debt ceiling, now more legislators are open to following through on the threat that the debt limit increase won't pass. Each time that they do it, the threat becomes more familiar, and more accepted by some. Finally, the budget wars are fueled by the 24-hour news media, with outlets on cable television and the Internet that are constantly in search of dramatic stories to win attention. The budget war offers great fodder. The possibility of a fiscal cliff offers political junkies a bit of the kind of thrill that ""Breaking Bad"" fans have felt every time Walter White extricates himself from another bind. As a result, legislators such as Cruz, who gained considerable attention over the past few weeks for his dramatic stand against Obamacare, are making a name for themselves and staying in the headlines. The budget process might not be good for the nation, but it is certainly a great way for a politician to receive attention. At some point there will be pressure to reform the process. The latest round of budget battles led a larger number of Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, to be openly critical of their colleagues and call for a very different approach. As Representative King, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, explained, ""I still think we should try to repeal the bill. But you repeal it the same way you passed it. You get bills through both houses of Congress, and you get the president to sign it."" Budget reform is possible. For instance, there has been some discussion about the possibility of repealing the need for a congressional vote to raise the debt ceiling. There have been several moments in U.S. history, such as in 1921 and 1974, when Congress overhauled the entire budget process. It might be time to start that debate again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Budget battles reoccur regularly, and each time seems worse .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- You almost have to feel sorry for President Obama. Almost. You know you're having a tough week when you're essentially being called untruthful by, of all people, Bill Clinton, who knows a thing or two about stretching the truth. At the very least, Clinton insisted that Obama -- in trying to sell Obamacare to the American people -- should not have broken his promise that, if they liked their doctor and health care plan, they could keep both. For millions of Americans, perhaps tens of millions, this hasn't been the case. Their policies were cancelled. Even while continuing to express support for the Affordable Care Act, Clinton suggested that people should be able to stay with what they had before the legislation took effect ""even if it takes a change in the law."" That is easier said than done. There is no easy fix that wouldn't rip out the foundation of Obamacare. Meanwhile, millions of Americans lose health care coverage that, defenders of Obamacare insist, wasn't very good anyway. Maybe not. But here is what is probably going through the mind of people like the ones whose individual policies were canceled or the single mom with three kids who was kicked off her company's health plan because she works part-time and must take her chances on the Obamacare exchange: ""It wasn't perfect but at least it was something."" Meanwhile, on the other end of the health care seesaw, according to official figures released Wednesday, just 106,000 Americans signed up. And that figure generously includes those who selected a plan but haven't paid yet. For what it is worth, only about 26,000 of those 106,000 managed to enroll through the troubled federal website that became a national punchline: www.HealthCare.gov. So, in other words, while we're only a month into this social experiment, those who have been inconvenienced by Obamacare outnumber, by a wide margin, those who have signed up to be helped by it. And if you think what is happening on the federal level is nutty, just take a look at the local exchanges. How's this for a math problem? In Washington D.C., just five people enrolled even though officials spent $133,573,928 to set up the exchange. That's $26,714,785.60 per enrollee. We knew that sometimes the safety net becomes a hammock. Now we know that, sometimes, the hammock is made of gold. None of this looks good. But it looks especially bad to Democrats who are up for re-election in 2014. Many of them are running for the hills. A group of about a dozen of them have given the White House until Friday to come up with a way for people to keep their health care coverage. You'll recall that every single Democratic lawmaker in both houses voted in favor of Obamacare, the very law that they're now trying to change. It would have been nice if they had made those changes through amendments before voting for the final bill. That's how it is supposed to work. After the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, President John F. Kennedy famously noted that ""victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan."" Well, it's not just defeat that has no parents. We learned this week that the orphanages are also filled with massive, costly and inefficient government programs that give new meaning to the phrase ""bureaucratic nightmare."" These programs fine people for not buying a product from a website that doesn't work right, and they have caused an upheaval where -- under the pretense of ensuring that all Americans have health insurance -- several million Americans who had health insurance wake up to find that they no longer do. Obama either knew this would happen and he lied, or he was grossly mistaken. Either way, an important promise has been broken and a sacred trust violated. And while, politicians break promises all the time, this one is in a whole different category. This isn't the metaphorical ""chicken in every pot"" that never materialized. This is about government coming into your home and taking away the chicken that you planned to feed to your family for dinner. There's a big difference. And voters know it. Many Americans don't just feel disappointed and underserved. They feel injured, betrayed and lied to by their leaders -- and especially by Obama. In a Quinnipiac University poll released this week, Obama's job approval rating has dropped to a record low: just 39% of Americans approve of how he is handling the job, while 54% disapprove. Only 19% of Americans say they believe the quality of their health care will improve in the next year, while 43% say it will get worse and 33% don't think it will impact their coverage one way or another. But here's the real problem for the White House and the entire administration. In the same poll, more Americans than not are questioning the president's integrity. A majority of voters -- 52% -- say that Obama is not honest and trustworthy, compared to 44% who disagree. It wasn't supposed to be this way. When Obama took office in January 2009, he promised to be an improvement on previous presidents. He promised an administration that was honest and transparent. The rollout of Obamacare has been neither of those things. Someone has to pay for that. And, if voters have anything to say about it next year, someone will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: It's been a tough week for Obama, including criticism from Clinton .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A man who cast himself as a victim of the recent attack on a Nairobi mall gave himself away as a possible suspect when a machine-gun magazine fell out of his pocket as he was being evacuated, a Kenyan counterterrorism source said Thursday. This Kenyan national, who was injured in the ordeal, is currently being held in a hospital at a military airbase, according to the source. It was not immediately clear if this man is one of the at least 10 individuals who Kenyan officials have said are in custody on suspicion of taking part in the Westgate Mall attack. Was 'White Widow' involved in mall shooting? There is increasing concern that some perpetrators escaped the mall along with fleeing civilians, and thus remain at large, U.S. law enforcement officials say. U.S. forensic investigators were granted access to the ravaged mall on Thursday. The onslaught began when militants stormed the upscale Nairobi shopping mall on Saturday, forcing shoppers and diners to run for their lives or scramble for safe hiding spots. It ended on Tuesday, by which time President Uhuru Kenyatta said authorities had overrun the gunmen and taken over the mall. Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based terrorist group with links to al Qaeda, took credit for the carnage. In addition to five terrorists, at least 67 people are confirmed dead in the attack. Officials fear that number could rise -- as many as 63 people are still unaccounted for -- as they sift through the rubble left from the collapse of three floors of the expansive facility.

"(CNN) -- Even from the moment they were set down in the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson's immortal words ""all men are created equal"" have always been awkward and challenging. They're not awkward and challenging because they're incorrect. On the contrary, they're some of the truest words ever put to paper. Instead, they're awkward and challenging because -- for a nation built by slaves, where only a fraction of the population owned land and even fewer could vote, where an entire gender was held at bay for centuries -- these words were the sand in our collective eye that urged us, always, to be better, fairer and more decent to one another. Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln's opponent in the historic debates of 1858, asserted that the Declaration was a contract between Englishmen only. That excluded not only African-Americans and Hispanics but also the Italians, the Swiss, the Asians -- almost anyone but Douglas and a few select friends. Lincoln retorted, ""Why, according to this, not only negroes but white people outside of Great Britain and America are not spoken of in (the Declaration). ... The French, Germans and other white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the judge's inferior races. I had thought the Declaration promised something better."" Though he lost that race to Douglas, a greater triumph awaited Lincoln. On his way to his presidential Inaugural, Lincoln stopped in Philadelphia's Independence Hall and said, ""I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence."" We are now 237 years into the history of the document that Lincoln so cherished, and even today, Jefferson's words are still awkward and challenging. We are still realizing the potential of ""all men are created equal."" Equality has come slowly. Less than a hundred years ago, women were finally constitutionally guaranteed the right to vote. Just five years ago, Hillary Clinton became the first woman to make a serious run at the presidency. This March, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was approved. Some opposed it or obstructed it because of a provision that would give Indian tribes authority by their own people to bring to justice a perpetrator of violence against a woman. There was also opposition to extending the law to apply to LGBT people and immigrants. Yet despite that opposition, the law finally passed. This week, the U.S. Senate at long last approved a law that has been before Congress in one form or another for decades. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is a simple bill that would outlaw workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, protections that are extended to all Americans on the basis of race, age, religion and other categories. The fact that this law does not already exist for the LGBT community will come as a surprise to many Americans. Eighty percent of the public believes that it is already against the law to fire, or refuse to hire, someone because of their gender orientation or identification. As Americans, we trust that Jefferson's words already apply to everyone, but that dream is not realized. Now, the Senate has brought us one step closer to that goal, offering sweeping bipartisan endorsement to this bill that is supported by broad majorities of Democratic, independent and Republican voters alike. But once again, it appears that the House of Representatives is prepared to stand in the way of progress. Speaker John Boehner said he will probably kill the bill by refusing to bring it to a vote. Boehner's office is offering three key arguments for stopping this civil rights legislation dead, and each one is more phony than the last. He's called it a job killer. (Why, then, have more than 100 major corporations -- many in the Fortune 500 --endorsed it? And why is the Chamber of Commerce neutral?) He's said it will increase frivolous lawsuits. (Only if you believe that being able to challenge your boss if he or she fires you strictly because you're gay is ""frivolous."") And his staff has said this problem is already addressed by existing law. (This one's just flat-out phony, and they know it. More than half the states in the country lack these protections.) Contrast Boehner to another Republican, Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who used his first floor speech since suffering a stroke in 2012 to address the issue of workplace discrimination. His speech was halting, but he felt compelled to speak because he ""so passionately"" believes in equal rights for all. ""I think it's particularly appropriate for an Illinois Republican to speak on behalf of this measure,"" Kirk said. ""In the true tradition of Everett McKinley Dirksen and Abraham Lincoln, men who gave us the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution."" Even now, in 2013, there are those in our society who, like Douglas more than a century and a half ago, cling to a narrow and incomplete view of Jefferson's immortal words and would prefer for only some of us to be granted the full light of equality. But today I still have hope that folks like Kirk on both sides of the aisle, as well as the broad majority of Americans who support this bill, will stand up, like Lincoln before them, and once again expand the circle of liberty to include everyone.

"Ann Arbor, Michigan (CNN) -- ""We did not have a right to choose where we lived ... freedom of speech, or freedom of actions. The traffickers had keys to our apartment. They controlled all of our movement and travel. They watched us and listened when we called our parents. They didn't let us make friends or tell anyone anything about ourselves. We couldn't keep any of the money we earned. We couldn't ask anyone for help."" -- Lena . Lena was an athletic student from Eastern Europe yearning to visit the United States through a study-abroad program at her college. She had visions of learning English and returning home to share her experiences with her family. But the human traffickers who ensnared her had a different vision for Lena, shipping her to America and exploiting her in the sex industry for profit. They met her at the airport with news that her study abroad placement had been changed. She was given new bus tickets and sent off to Detroit, Michigan. Once there they took her passport and her freedom. After almost a year of enslavement, Lena risked her life to make a daring escape. She is smart, resilient and funny, and I have been honored to be her attorney through the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School. Unfortunately there are thousands of adults and children like Lena who have not been able to escape their traffickers. These victims, especially the children, are in the same position Lena was: They're being exploited and can't ask anyone for help. The data on human trafficking is sparse, but what is known is terrifying. It's already the second largest criminal industry in the world -- behind only the trade in illegal drugs -- and it's growing fast. The global commercial sex trade exploits one million children annually. At least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 children in America are victims of sex trafficking each year. The grim reality of child sex trafficking in the United States is this: Human traffickers are selling sex with children in big cities and small towns throughout America. Child sex trafficking has been illegal in the United States since 2000 with the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Under this law it is illegal to recruit, harbor, transport, provide or obtain a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of a commercial sex act. Since the passage of the TVPA many states have passed their own human trafficking laws. Children who are selling sex in the United States are then, by definition, victims of human trafficking. Despite this, child victims of sex trafficking are frequently viewed as criminals rather than as victims. According to the Department of Justice in 2006, six years after the passage of the TVPA, 1,600 children were arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice. The children victimized by sex trafficking are often very young. On average, girls are first exploited for commercial sex between the ages of 12 and 14. For boys the average age is even younger -- between 11 and 13. But being a victim of sex trafficking does not have to be a life sentence. Victims can become survivors and build new lives. And while Lena is no longer the young college student she once was and it is too dangerous for her to return home, her speech and actions are now her own. She can choose where she wants to live. She is free. Through my work with Lena and other clients in the Human Trafficking Clinic we have identified a number of ways to fight sex trafficking. Raise awareness within your community: One of the biggest barriers to helping victims of sex trafficking is the lack of awareness about the issue. Human traffickers profit when we think human trafficking only happens in foreign countries. • Human trafficking happens everywhere, and sex trafficking cases involving children have been found in all regions of the country. No community is immune to the horrors of human trafficking. • Communities must prioritize the fight against human trafficking -- including providing enough resources to law enforcement. Change the conversation: Children who by law are too young to consent to having sex obviously cannot consent to selling sex, so: . • Victims should not be described as entering into prostitution; they are being exploited and should be described as victims of human trafficking. • Law enforcement officials often arrest and detain child victims of sex trafficking on either prostitution charges or other charges, such as truancy or curfew violations. Law enforcement must be trained about human trafficking. • Sellers of sex, especially when they are children, should not be guilty of a criminal violation. Buyers and pimps should be the only individuals at risk of criminal penalties. This would ensure that no victims are arrested or jailed. Reduce demand: The reality of sex trafficking must not be neutralized or glamorized. • Individuals who travel abroad to purchase sex from children are demonized in the media and identified as sexual predators, yet individuals who stay in the United States and pay to have sex with children are given the anonymous title ""john"" -- and frequently aren't even charged with a crime. • Individuals who pay for sex with children in the United States should be punished.

The launch aircraft will offer 302 seats total, with the business premier cabin housing 18 lie-flat seats, a premium economy cabin with 21 seats and two economy cabins with 263 seats total. The plane will also have 14 Skycouch rows -- a design unique to the Kiwi airline that turns a row of three economy seats into a three-seater ""couch."" New features also include a slimmer seat back due to more compact inflight entertainment monitors, allowing more personal space for the passenger. Following the Auckland-Perth route, Air New Zealand will be flying its fleet of 10 787-9 aircraft on Auckland-Tokyo and Auckland-Shanghai routes. More on the Dreamliner . The 787-9 is a bigger version of its predecessor, the 787-8.

"(CNN) -- More than half of the students implicated in last year's cheating scandal at Harvard University have been required to withdraw from school for a period of time, a dean said in a statement Friday. More than 100 students were investigated for plagiarism or for having ""inappropriately collaborated"" on a course's take-home, open-book spring final exam, said Michael D. Smith, Harvard's dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Many of those who were not forced to withdraw face disciplinary probation at the Ivy League institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the remaining were cleared. The school would not release the specific breakdown of the numbers of affected students. The Harvard Crimson, the school's flagship student-run newspaper, identifies the class in which the cheating allegedly occurred as Government 1310: Introduction to Congress. An attorney representing two students involved in the case said some students discussed questions on the exam and worked together to come up with answers. Other students e-mailed their exam answers to peers in the class, who in turn used those answers on their exams, said attorney Robert L. Peabody. He said Harvard tried to put together a disciplinary process that was fair, but that the school was too slow in its response. ""The process was mind-bendingly slow, delayed and postponed over the entire course of the semester, which added to students' stress and anxiety about how this was going to shake out,"" Peabody said. In a statement released when the cheating scandal first became public in August, Harvard University President Drew Faust said, ""These allegations, if proven, represent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends."" During grading, ""the faculty member teaching the course questioned the similarities between a number of exams,"" according to a statement from Smith during the initial investigation. The board then reviewed the tests and interviewed the students who submitted them. It eventually launched a wider probe into the allegations. CNN's Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.","NEW: Attorney representing two students says Harvard's response to the scandal was slow .

"New York (CNN) -- A Hasidic NYPD recruit is planning a lawsuit after being dismissed for refusing to trim his beard for religious reasons, his attorney said Sunday. Fishel Litzman, 38, was asked to leave the police academy on Friday, his attorney, Nathan Lewin, told CNN. He began the police academy in January, he said, was in the top 1% of his classes and is ""highly regarded"" by his peers. The dismissal, Lewin said, is a clear example of ""religious discrimination."" ""We are planning to bring a lawsuit,"" the attorney said. ""This should not be a practice of the NYPD."" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said in a statement the department ""makes reasonable accommodations in this regard."" Beards for religious purposes are to be kept to 1 millimeter in length, he said, adding that there are other Hasidic and Orthodox uniformed members who observe the accommodation. Litzman ""did not comply with the NYPD's reasonable accommodation to keep his beard trimmed,"" Browne said. ""He did not keep it trimmed to 1mm and he stated that it was his intention to never cut or trim his beard."" But Litzman said as an Orthodox Hasidic Jew, ""I have left my beard natural all my life. It's the law of the Torah."" In a March 18 statement to NYPD officials, provided to CNN by Lewin, Litzman wrote, ""It is absolutely forbidden in my religious beliefs to cut or trim my beard in any way."" When Litzman received the phone call that he was accepted into the police academy, it was the ""happiest day of my life,"" he said. ""The impact you can make in the community in a neighborhood and a people ... you can truly make a direct impact on a whole entire community as a police officer."" Litzman wrote that after receiving a 97.6% on his entrance exam last year, he ""inquired about keeping my naturally short beard intact"" and filled out a religious accommodation form. He received a short letter saying the matter would be addressed when he became a recruit. After being selected for the 2012 class, the father of five said he resigned his job. ""Since I had applied for an exemption before I was accepted and had already been photographed, I believed that the NYPD was aware of my religious needs and accepted me knowing I needed to keep my beard intact,"" he wrote. While in classes, Litzman three times was told he would have to cut or shave his beard, he said. Each time, he refused, citing his religious beliefs, Lewin said. He was also punished with the loss of two vacation days, according to Litzman's memo. He noted that other officers have beards, adding, ""I was told many times in the academy, 'Cut your beard, after the academy you'll never have to,'"" Litzman said. ""It's an unenforced rule."" ""I cannot, as a matter of religious conscience, follow that instruction because I may not trim my beard even temporarily to complete the academy,"" he wrote. ""One of the points that has been drilled home during my short time at the academy is the need to represent the NYPD with integrity,"" Litzman wrote to police officials. ""Although not knowing whether I will be punished for maintaining my religious beliefs has been very taxing on me and my family, I will not waver in my firm belief that I can be a successful member of the NYPD and an Orthodox (Hasidic) Jew at the same time."" He said that as his academic and physical scores show, ""I am focused on dedicating myself to being the best probationary police officer I can be."" Asked if other factors could have contributed to Litzman's dismissal, Lewin said, ""I don't think it's anything else ... He would -- will be, I believe -- an outstanding police officer."" Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer said in a statement Sunday he was ""deeply troubled"" by the reports Litzman was fired for refusing to trim his beard. ""The NYPD has done a commendable job in recent years of building a police force that tries to reflect the populations that they serve,"" Stringer said. ""Fishel Litzman should be no exception. I urge the police commissioner to reconsider this case as well as the NYPD's rules about religious accommodation more broadly and, in so doing, to make a clear statement in support of religious expression for all.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Killing"" was AMC's real zombie show. Netflix has struck a deal with Fox Television Studios to resurrect the rainy crime drama for a fourth season. That's right: ""The Killing,"" a show that's been canceled twice, is coming back to life for a second time. AMC axed ""The Killing"" after its second season last year, only to pick it up again after talks between the studio and Netflix sparked interest in another round. The third season aired this summer on AMC to fairly modest ratings (ending with 1.5 million viewers). In September, AMC cancelled the increasingly ironically titled ""The Killing"" â€” again. But apparently those cable executives didn't execute a proper double-tap to the head. Because Netflix is bringing ""The Killing"" back with a six-episode fourth and final season. Stars Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman are on board, and so is showrunner Veena Sud. ""The rich, serialized storytelling in 'The Killing' thrives on Netflix, and we believe that it is only fitting to give Sarah Linden (Enos) and Stephen Holder (Kinnaman) a proper send off,"" said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix. ""We are looking forward to offering fans â€” both existing and new â€” a series that we know is perfectly suited for on-demand viewing."" Netflix previously revived Fox's cult favorite ""Arrested Development"" for a 4th season, and is often a company that studios call when their shows are axed to see if there's any interest. The move could be a smart play for Netflix since it gives the company an exclusive lock on the conclusion of the show without a big episode commitment (AMC is not part of the deal). Whenever viewers stream ""The Killing"" for years to come, if they want to see how the series concludes, they'll have to watch it on Netflix (or a company that makes a distribution deal with Netflix). Unless ... of course ... this is not REALLY the end of ""The Killing."" A Netflix rep assures this order will conclude of the show, but unless the final shot of season 4 is Linden and Holder skewered on top of the Space Needle, there's always going to be a few fans wondering if The Killing could rise again, rainier and more murderous than ever.

""The next few months will tell us whether he will be remembered in the pantheon of successful/consequential presidents in the last 60 years or whether he will be a flawed president whose skills did not match the times."" After the President's lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday, Republicans were scathing in making the case it was too little too late and proof, to them, Obamacare was collapsing. Predictable, but an argument that has more weight now is that the President, using his terms, ""fumbled"" the rollout of his signature domestic initiative. At an Ohio event later Thursday, the President promised to vigorously fight any effort to ""gut"" the law, and as that debate continues, it is the mood among his fellow Democrats that is most important. Obama: 'I'm going to see this through' Initial reaction was hardly reassuring to the White House. Democrats in both the House and Senate mixed praise of the President's intentions with promises to not trust the administration to fix the problems without guidance from Congress. Senate Dem leaders holding off on legislative 'fix' for insurance promise . This is the new political reality: the President himself acknowledged the rollout was hurting his party's standing heading into the 2014 midterm election season. While he promised to work hard to turn the political tide, Democrats hoping to be in Washington beyond the end of 2016 -- meaning beyond the Obama years -- will be less and less reluctant with each passing day to trust their fate to his plans and instincts. Especially because of those polls the President suggested he doesn't read. For Democrats, especially given the timing, the numbers are numbing: Whether you look at the low Obamacare enrollment figures or President Obama's declining poll standing, what you see is a White House -- and a presidency -- at a crossroads, facing persistent questions about credibility and competence. Borger: How could Obama not have known? The question now consuming Washington is whether this is just a temporary bad turn or a tipping point. In a more sympathetic take, a senior veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the first White House term put it this way: ""I feel for him and my old colleagues. Tough when you're in the penalty box."" That view assumes the penalty clock expires, and the President rallies. Republican missteps in the past -- like the government shutdown -- give many Democrats hope the President's critics will overreach again and create an opening for a rebound. Poll: Approval of health care law drops . Less sympathetic, though, was another seasoned Democrat, this one a veteran of the Bill Clinton White House. ""They don't have the time, or the self-awareness,"" to objectively study and learn from recent mistakes, this longtime Democratic operative said of the President and his second-term team. ""What they do not appreciate is how far away they are from the end of the second term. We had not even had (Monica) Lewinsky yet at this point,"" the operative said, referring to Clinton's White House affair with an intern. Noting the sagging poll numbers and increasing public complaints from the President's fellow Democrats, this source, speaking only on condition of anonymity, predicted a rough stretch ahead: ""There will be a ton of stories about the need for new and fresh staff and how Obama needs to open his circle up to people who he does not know, or at least not well."" New polls showing the President at new lows in several categories are only increasing a case of Democratic jitters that began once it was clear the Obamacare rollout was going poorly, and that any political advantage Democrats gained from the government shutdown was fading. Obamacare promises: Where things stand . The latest Quinnipiac University poll found just 39% of Americans approve of how the President is handling his job; 54% disapprove. Those numbers are similar to President George W. Bush's standing at this point in his second term. In an especially troubling turn, that same survey found -- even though congressional approval ratings are at an all time low -- voters trust Republicans in Congress as much or more than the President on big issues like health care and the economy. In the past, the President's strong personal standing with voters has helped him through stretches when voters question his job performance. But there are signs he cannot, at least at this delicate moment, count on that traditional safety net. The Quinnipiac poll, for example, found for the first time more voters say the Presidency is not trustworthy. The timing is what makes this rut even more complicated -- and potentially consequential -- for the President and his second term. Every day brings the 2014 midterm elections closer, and with the President's standing low, loyalty within his own party becomes harder to maintain. House Democrats cool down after Obamacare meeting . Evidence of that is abundant, from the Senate Democrats pushing for Obamacare changes, to meetings between congressional Democrats and White House officials this week that turned testy as lawmakers aired their complains about the Obamacare rollout and how it was hurting the party politically. In Obama's 2008 campaign, he ran as much against the struggling Bush administration as he did against the GOP nominee. Back then, questions about the Iraq war and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina had put front and center the questions President Obama now faces -- about credibility and competence. Boehner: Obamacare ""a rolling calamity"" ""There is a very tender and important period for the President,"" said the veteran Democratic strategist. Instead of a Katrina analogy, this Democrat looked for a parallel within his own party -- the Carter presidency. ""Health care could become his energy shortage,"" the strategist said. Health care reform was the signature initiative and achievement of the President's first term, yet the continuing debate over the program, and the administration's rollout, is now holding his second term agenda hostage. A look back at the State of the Union address from the beginning of this year is a reminder that the President has realized nothing from his wish list, which included news jobs programs, an increase in the minimum wage and major immigration reforms. Getting things done in the second year -- the midterm election year in which Obamacare is certain to be the central issue -- would be difficult even if the President found a path to improve his political standing. Especially if Democrats lose faith in the White House as Republicans did with George W. Bush and his team. Cruz talks about 'vindication' with rocky Obamacare rollout .

"(CNN) -- Princess Anne's suggestion that Britons need to reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat was ""brave"" and reflects a sad decline in horses' value, the head of a horse welfare charity says. Addressing the World Horse Welfare conference Thursday, Princess Anne -- Queen Elizabeth II's daughter and the organization's president -- suggested that making horse meat more valuable might lead to better treatment of the animals. The Olympic equestrian referred to the transport of horses from countries such as Poland, the source of some horse meat, saying many horses left looking ""absolutely wonderful"" but suffered in transit. ""It's worth noting transport of horses itself is the problem -- not the horses or indeed the way they were brought up,"" she said. ""If that's true then and they value their horses -- they look after them well because they're in the horse meat trade -- and it's the transport that's the problem, should we be considering a real market for horse meat, and would that reduce the number of welfare cases?"" The princess suggested that ""our attitudes to the horse meat trade ... and the value of horse meat might have to change."" ""I chuck that out for what it's worth because I think it needs a debate,"" she said. She noted that Britain's attitude to horse meat was not universal. ""As I was reminded, not so long ago, by somebody who'd traveled in France, the most expensive piece of meat in the local butcher was a fillet of horse meat,"" she said. ""The value of the animal to every individual is slightly different, but if it has real financial value, then you look a little bit further ahead in the way in which you look after your animals."" World Horse Welfare chief executive Roly Owers said the Princess Royal had made her point ""within the context of the equine crisis we're currently in"" when ponies are being sold for as little as Â£5 ($8). ""Around 7,000 horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect and charities like ours are struggling to cope as winter approaches,"" Owers said in a statement. ""The economic downturn has driven prices for horses and ponies to rock bottom, and the sad fact is that from a purely economic perspective, they can now be worth more as meat. ""Many in the horse world have known this for a long time. Our president has been brave enough to say this openly in hopes of generating a thought-provoking debate."" Overbreeding in Britain . The underlying problem, Owers told CNN, was the issue of overbreeding in Britain. ""There are too many horses and too few homes."" Owers said he believed Anne was caring but also practical. ""She wasn't actually saying, 'Get out there and buy horse meat.' She was saying, 'We should be open to the debate about it -- and if the horse goes into the food chain, will it reduce welfare problems?' "" Owers said the option of sending a horse to a slaughterhouse was one that should be available to people. ""The issue is not those horses going to an abattoir -- it's not that they're going to slaughter that's the problem -- it's that they are simply not fit and healthy when they reach there,"" he said. Owers said he knew of people delaying euthanizing horses because they couldn't afford the expense to call out a vet and to dispose of a carcass. Emotional issue . Britain has a different attitude toward horses than some of its European neighbors, with the idea of eating horse meat an emotional one, he said. ""On the Continent they are viewed as farm animals to a far greater degree; here they are seen as pets, leisure or sport animals."" The debate would be different if horses were regarded in the same light as pigs, sheep or cows, he said. ""As a country we have eaten horse meat in the past -- we did in the Second World War, but you could argue that it was a time of crisis,"" Owers said. Britain's Royal Society for the Protection and Care of Animals said it welcomed any debate on horse welfare issues. ""Our centers, and those of other charities, are overflowing with horses which have been abandoned, neglected and abused, and we are struggling to keep up with the demands for our help,"" it said in a statement. ""The killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source, a sentiment the RSPCA has great sympathy with. ""However, the Society's primary concern for all animals killed for meat and otherwise is that they are cared for, handled and transported in a way which safeguards their welfare at all times.""","Princess Anne has suggested that Britons reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat .

"(CNN) -- Iraqi authorities executed 17 people, including an Egyptian man and two Iraqi women, most of whom were convicted of terrorism, Iraq's Ministry of Justice said in a statement released Monday. ""The Ministry carried out the executions against the terrorists after it was approved by the presidential council,"" the ministry said in the statement. The prisoners were put to death in what appears to be the latest of several executions carried out by authorities in recent months, despite a United Nations call for restraint. Nearly 70 people were executed in Iraq in 2013, according to CNN tally, and Human Rights Watch reports that more than 120 people were executed between 2011 and 2012. The executions come as Iraq smolders with sectarian tension and political infighting. Violence in Iraq surged in May, with 1,045 deaths, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq announced. That had been the deadliest month since 2008. In June, terrorism and other violence claimed 761 Iraqi lives. And in July, the death toll hit 1,057, UNAMI said. Insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist in the country, though violence has dropped dramatically since the peak of Sunni-Shiite clashes in 2006 and 2007. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda.","An Egyptian man and two Iraqi women are among those executed, a statement says .

"(HLNtv.com) -- An Ohio man who confessed in a viral video that he killed a man while driving drunk kept his word Wednesday, pleading guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and driving under the influence. Matthew Cordle, 22, appeared in a Columbus, Ohio as he told Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge David Fais that he wanted to change his original plea, entered on September 11, from not guilty to guilty. ""Yes, your honor,"" said Cordle, confirming his plea to the judge. Fais asked Cordle, who wore handcuffs and a khaki jail uniform at the hearing, multiple times about his decision-making on June 22, the date of the accident. Cordle told the judge he did not remember the events of that night because he ""blacked out"" from drinking too much. Cordle also told Fais that he has not drunk alcohol since the night of the accident, and he attended a two-week alcohol rehabilitation program. Cordle made headlines after a video was posted to YouTube on September 3 in which he confessed to driving while drunk and killing 61-year-old Vincent Canzani. In the video, he promised he would plead guilty and ""take full responsibility for everything I've done to Vincent and his family."" He also begged people watching the video not to drink and drive. Several days after the video appeared, Cordle surrendered to authorities and was charged for his involvement in the wrong-way crash. Canzani was driving a Jeep when he was struck by a wrong-way driver on Interstate 670 near Columbus, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Fais said in court Monday that he had not seen the video of Cordle's confession. Cordle will be sentenced October 10. Ron O'Brien, the attorney who is prosecuting the case, told CNN that Cordle faces a maximum sentence of 8Â½ years in prison for his charges.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- From bakery to barber shop, cafe to carpet store, Iranians stroll their capital with a renewed step, uplifted by how their newly elected president seeks something remarkable after decades of cold war-like relations between their country and the West. Iran wants to talk. With the United States. With Europe. With everyone who's been skeptical of the country. And Iran is willing to discuss its nuclear program, President Hassan Rouhani says. ""I just feel it. It's not like I've seen anything, but I feel it,"" said retiree Syed Ali Akbar. ""It's the best thing to do. We've been hurting ourselves for years."" International economic sanctions against Iran have strained day-to-day living in Iran, making essential goods such as medicine expensive and hard to come by. That punishment has taken a toll. ""The sanctions have hurt us. Prices have gone up. There are things you can't find,"" said Hossein Mohamadi at the Barbari Bread Shop. To many Iranians, Rouhani seems to be really advancing the ""hope and prudence"" slogan he used during his successful campaign to become president in June, posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservatives that characterized previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani had been Iran's national security council chief and its lead nuclear negotiator. ""With Mr. Rouhani here, we've become more hopeful that things will improve,"" Mohamadi said. Ramin Atouri, 28, is a part of the young generation to whom Rouhani appealed in his stump speeches. Atouri dislikes political isolation and applauds diplomacy. ""Everything is solved through friendship. War and sanctions and conflict never solve anything,"" Atouri said. One day, U.S. and Iranian president might shake hands . A new sense of optimism . Without doubt, the long years of hostility between Iran and the United States leave many Iranians wary and distrustful of Western countries. Those feelings endure and were captured by an open microphone that CNN set up Wednesday on a busy street in Tajrish Square, inviting passers-by to send a personal sound bite around the world. ""I say hello to all America,"" said one woman named Zahra. ""Your behavior is not very good. Your politics is about war and it's terrifying.... Don't create so many restrictions for us. Don't impose on us so many sanctions. Let us make progress."" In general, however, there's a whiff of euphoria for the first time in many people's memory. That was also expressed at the open mike. ""America is a great county and we want to have good relations with America, and our government is working to make that happen,"" said Reza, who didn't give her last name. ""We hope American politicians understand the circumstances, and through positive talks we can thaw this relationship that has been frozen for 35 years, so we can live side by side as friends."" A Tehran-based author and political analyst also sensed change in the air. ""So far he has done more than we expected,"" Sadegh Zibakalam said about the new president. ""Ever since the elections, there is a mood of optimism. There is a mood of hope. Wherever you go in Iran, you can see people happier."" Zibakalam went so far as to say Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also has altered his rhetoric, joining the prevailing hopefulness. ""I cannot fail to detect some changes with regard to the attitude of the supreme leader ever since the elections,"" Zibakalam said. Wherever Iranians gathered and did business, they spoke to how new ground was being broken -- and whether they believed it was for real. At a carpet store, Sadegh Kiyaei, 50, believed a new day was dawning. ""He's the hope of the future of Iranians, especially the way he's talking to the world and especially to America,"" Kiyaei said of the new president. ""We believe the two nations -- Iran and America -- they believe they need each other and like each other. They feel it's the right time to get together and start talking at least."" One mother, however, didn't endorse that sentiment. She is going to press ahead with her efforts to leave Iran. If there's a better future for her and her son, it's outside Iran, she said. ""In my view, I don't think you can get anywhere here in Iran,"" said the mother, Khoshvakht, who declined to give her last name. ""I haven't lost hope. I just don't think anything has changed. I'm just not that optimistic."" Her son, Omid, didn't like her mother's plan to leave. ""I want to stay,"" he said. ""My friends are here."" Rouhani calls for 'constructive' dialogue, end to 'unhealthy' rivalries . Wishing for an easier life . At the open microphone, several speakers didn't need prompting to broach perhaps the biggest subject on the international community's mind -- whether Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran says its controversial atomic program is for peaceful energy purposes. But several Western countries want Iran to fully comply with a United Nations agency's inspectors looking into whether the nuclear development is to build a bomb. ""Hi, America,"" said one man named Mohsen. ""As far as I'm concerned, I don't think they're making bombs."" Then, he added, ""With all the sanctions they put on us, it's like putting a gun on someone's head. ""You respect our civil rights and we'll respect yours. It's just humanity,"" he concluded. Hassan Ahmadi has been a barber for 30 years and has three kids. He wants affordable medicine for his family. ""There's been a lot of tough times and rising costs,"" Ahmadi said. ""One hundred percent, I want to see better relations, so we can live a little easier. ""I'm hopeful that change will happen so we can escape all the worry,"" he added. Those who held contrary opinions were equally effusive. ""I don't have hope because I don't think Rouhani is everything in Iran. He still has someone over the top of him,"" said Ali Ahadi at a newspaper stand. That superior is the ayatollah. A coffee shop owner agreed. ""The final decider is the supreme leader. Maybe if things change, then he'll change his mind. So in the end, I'm not optimistic,"" proprietor Amin, who declined to give his last name. ""We just want to live in peace. That's my only wish -- to live in peace."" Perhaps the most commonly shared view on Tehran streets was rejection of how Western leaders harshly characterize the country. ""I know they call us terrorists, but you show me which one of us is terrorists?"" Ahadi said at the newsstand. ""Iranians are (hospitable) and kind and honest."" Rouhani brings 'charm offensive' to U.N. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report from Tehran. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles.","Throughout the capital, Iranians sense a new future in the air .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- FEMA gave away about $85 million in household goods meant for Hurricane Katrina victims, a CNN investigation has found. These items, stored by FEMA, were meant for Katrina victims but were given to state and federal agencies. The material, from basic kitchen goods to sleeping necessities, sat in warehouses for two years before the Federal Emergency Management Agency's giveaway to federal and state agencies this year. James McIntyre, FEMA's acting press secretary, said that FEMA was spending more than $1 million a year to store the material and that another agency wanted the warehouses torn down, so ""we needed to vacate them."" ""Upon review of our assets and our need to continue to store them, we determined that they were excess to FEMA's needs; therefore, they are being excessed from FEMA's inventory,"" McIntyre wrote in an e-mail. He declined a request for an on-camera interview, telling CNN the giveaway was ""not news."" Photos from one of the facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, show pallet after pallet of cots, cleansers, first-aid kits, coffee makers, camp stoves and other items stacked to the ceiling.  Watch dismay over ""out of touch"" FEMA » . FEMA said some of the items were donations from companies after Katrina, but most were purchased in the field as ""starter kits"" for people living in trailers provided by the agency. And even though the stocks were offered to state agencies after FEMA decided to get rid of them, one of the states that passed was Louisiana. Martha Kegel, the head of a New Orleans nonprofit agency that helps find homes for those still displaced by the storm, said she was shocked to learn about the existence of the goods and the government giveaway. ""These are exactly the items that we are desperately seeking donations of right now: basic kitchen household supplies,"" said Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans. ""These are the very things that we are seeking right now. FEMA, in fact, refers homeless clients to us to house them. How can we house them if we don't have basic supplies?""  Watch the great FEMA giveaway » . Kegel's group works with FEMA and other local organizations to rehouse victims of Katrina, the 2005 hurricane that flooded New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people along the Gulf Coast. Community groups say thousands of people are still living in abandoned buildings in the city, though fewer than 100 people remain housed in tents. Kegel said FEMA was told in regular meetings that Unity was desperate for household supplies and that the group has been forced to beg for donations. But she said FEMA never told Unity and other community groups that it had tens of millions of dollars worth of brand-new items meant for storm victims. She said she learned of it from CNN, which found that those items never made it to people such as Debra Reed. ""An honest person like me didn't get nothing,"" said Reed, 54, who recently moved from a tent beneath a New Orleans bridge to a home with the help of Kegel's group. ""I'm gonna turn, 'cause I'm gonna cry. I didn't get nothing. I fought to get my money, but they wouldn't give it to me. So I ended up going under the bridge."" FEMA confirmed that it had kept the merchandise in storage for the past two years and then gave it away to cities, schools, fire departments and nonprofit agencies such as food banks. In all, General Services Administration records show, FEMA gave away 121 truckloads of material. McIntyre said that most of the items given away were not ""standard-issue type supplies"" that FEMA would have distributed after other disasters. He said that using the GSA, which manages federal property, to get rid of those stockpiles was ""standard process."" Asked whether FEMA believed that Katrina victims no longer needed the items, McIntyre wrote: ""If the state did not request the supplies, then FEMA would not know.""  Watch Kegel describe ""the needs are just overwhelming"" » . Pallets at the Fort Worth warehouse were piled high with boxes of buckets, boots, cleansers, mops and brooms. There were stacks of tents, lanterns and camp stoves for people still displaced, as well as clothing, bedding, plates and utensils. Meanwhile, Kegel said, Unity's clients can take only ""one fork, one spoon, one knife; they can only take one plate. We don't have enough to go around."" But FEMA said the items were no longer needed in the stricken region. So it declared them ""federal surplus"" and gave them away. Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Prisons, Postal Service and Border Patrol got first dibs on the material when FEMA started giving it away. Other agencies that received items include the National Guard, U.S. Marshals Service, the Air Force and Navy and the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security, according to a list the GSA provided to CNN. These items also were offered to all states -- yet Louisiana, where most of the people displaced by the storm live, passed on taking any of them. John Medica, director of the Louisiana Federal Property Assistance Agency in Baton Rouge, said he was unaware that Katrina victims still had a need for the household supplies. ""We didn't have anybody out there who told us they wanted it,"" Medica said. Instead, 16 other states took the free items. ""Louisiana Recovery Authority Director Paul Rainwater is taking the lead on determing where this serious breakdown in communication occured and ... is working to pursue options for the state to still make use of these important supplies,"" said Michael DiResto of the Division of Administration. DiResto said Rainwater has already taken up the issue with a FEMA official. Kegel said she could not understand how Medica could not be aware of the need in the New Orleans area. She said she had not heard of the agency and was not registered with them, but after CNN's interview, the agency contacted her about registering Unity of Greater New Orleans so it could qualify for available supplies in the future.","Bureau of Prisons, Postal Service and other agencies get free Katrina goods .

"(CNN) -- A 36-inch underground natural gas pipeline exploded into flames Monday in Johnson County, Texas, killing one and injuring at least five people before officials were able to shut the flow of gas, officials said. Cleburne Fire Chief Clint Ishmael said all 13 workers on the crew at the site when the blast took place were accounted for and that one was dead. ""There was a crew working on the line, and they apparently ruptured it somehow and caused an explosion,"" Cleburne City Manager Chester Nolen said. Nolen originally said that three people had been killed in the blast but later retracted that statement. Flames were visible eight miles away, he said. Video showed the site of the fire -- cattle country -- in the center of a patch of scorched grassland. No one was evacuated because no buildings were nearby, Nolen said. The line is owned by Enterprise Products out of Houston, he said. No one at the company answered a telephone call. The blaze was so fierce that crews could get no closer than 600 yards to the source of the fire, Ishmael said. Five people were taken to Glen Rose Medical Center in Glen Rose, Texas, where they were in stable condition, CEO Gary Marks said. The pipeline erupted around 2:40 p.m. (3:40 p.m. ET), and the shaking lasted about 10 minutes, said Laura Harlin, who lives about a mile away. ""Our house shook, glass shook,"" she said. ""We watched this huge plume of smoke or steam rising above our neighborhood.""

"(CNN) -- Ask a small farmer in Indonesia about the impact of the global financial crisis on his daily life and he will answer, ""Crisis? What crisis?"" As farmers, we know what a big crisis is. In 1997, we saw the collapse of the whole economy, driving thousands of unemployed construction and industry workers back to the villages, where their families already had difficulties making ends meet. But the current situation is different and raises some worrying alarm bells. Although national industry keeps hiring workers and new infrastructure projects continue to pop up, our daily life has worsened on several fronts. The most noticeable change is the increased pressure on agricultural land. Thousands of small farmers have been evicted from the fields they have cultivated for generations, because local or national authorities are giving concessions to large companies to exploit the land. Many Indonesian farmers do not have any clear land titles, as it is estimated that only 40% of ownership can be proven by formal certificates. Moreover, some territories on the national mapping appear as ""empty"", even if they have been inhabited for generations. In principle, most of the farmers' communities are covered by customary laws that are also recognized by the state. However, land deals are extremely profitable both for the authorities and for the companies who negotiate them. The lack of respect for people's rights to land makes it extremely easy for companies to brutally evict farmers. They are replaced by large plantations, including palm oil and rubber plantations, food estates, mines, roads and other infrastructure projects. This results in increasingly violent land conflicts as local communities resist eviction. The Indonesian Peasant Union (SPI) calculated that the number of land conflicts increased five-fold, from 22 in 2010 to 120 in 2011. A case involving the alleged killing of nine farmers in South Sumatra and Lampung Provinces is now being investigated by the Indonesian Parliament. Similar human rights violations are taking place on a daily basis in the archipelago. In 2011 alone, the farmer's union counted 20 deaths due to land conflicts in Indonesia. The government routinely prioritizes large-scale, export-oriented production over the needs of local growers and consumers. The financial crisis has accelerated this dramatic land grab as farmland is now seen by the finance industry as a considerable source of returns. Indonesia's fast rate of deforestation . Instead of protecting local farmers from massive evictions, the Indonesian government is further opening the doors to foreign investors. In the framework of the East Asia World Economic Forum that took place in 2011 in Jakarta, the chairman of the Indonesian chamber of commerce Suryo Bambang Sulisto announced that 14 transnational companies including Cargill, Monsanto, Syngenta, Bunge and ADM, had signed a partnership agreement with the government to increase food productivity in Indonesia. We are facing other problems. Uncertainty about commodity prices has increased tremendously since 2007. Whether we are producing for export or for the local market, prices have become unpredictable. Prices of inputs -- such as seeds, fertilizers and energy -- have become very volatile, making it impossible for us to assess our production costs. For farmers, price instability and volatility are worse than simply low prices: It makes it virtually impossible to plan what to grow in the coming season, what products we can buy, and so forth. There are a number of causes of this volatility, including a lack of food reserves and the arrival of global financial speculators in agricultural markets following the sub-prime crisis. We are also dealing with a surge of cheap imported products into the domestic market. In village markets on Java island, we now see potatoes and chillies imported from China at a very low price. The minimum production cost of potatoes in those villages is 7,000 rupiah a kilo, but Chinese potatoes are sold at 2,500 rupiah. This discourages farmers from producing, ultimately raising unemployment, encouraging more people to migrate away from rural areas and putting pressure elsewhere in the system, especially in our already stressed urban areas. For these reasons, we feel that even though farmers constitute almost half the Indonesian workforce, our economic sector is the most neglected in the country. We have the capacity and natural resources to feed the whole country yet we are deprived of our land, and our government has failed to pursue agricultural policies to enable us to continue our vital role. According to the Indonesian government's own figures, 2.16 million farmers had to leave farming in 2011 due to a lack of land and incentives. In our Indonesian villages, we don't currently talk about any particular ""world crisis."" We talk about the continuing daily struggle to make a living in extremely harsh conditions.

"(CNN) -- Two New York residents have been arrested on charges of conspiring to send aid to terrorist groups in Afghanistan, New York City officials said Thursday. Humayoun Ghoulan Nabi, 27, and Ismail Alsarabbi, 32, are charged with conspiring to solicit aid in support of terrorist organizations -- including the Taliban and al Qaeda -- fighting American troops in Afghanistan. Nabi, a Pakistani national, and Alsarabbi, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait, allegedly planned to supply warm winter clothing and electronics to militants in the region to ensure their attacks can continue during harsh Afghan winters, according to the Queens County District Attorney's office. Queens District Attorney Richard. A. Brown said winter jackets and electronics were ""as serious as supplying the enemy with bullets and bombs."" ""These defendants, as a result, were not merely conspiring to supply clothing items to people in Afghanistan, they were conspiring to make the enemy more effective in engaging and killing American soldiers,"" said Brown, in a press release. According to the complaint, Nabi admitted to engaging in a plan to provide outerwear and jackets to fighters in Afghanistan because he hates the United States, Jewish people and U.S. soldiers. ""The arrests of these two New York City residents, Nabi and Alsarabbi, demonstrate the spectrum of terrorism threats that the New York City Police Department must continue to guard against,"" said New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly in a statement. The investigation began in April 2011 when a confidential informant approached an NYPD detective and told him about Nabi's plans, the complaint says. The informant said Nabi compared his efforts to those of Osama Bin Laden and stated that the governments in Muslim countries cannot be trusted to stand up for pious Muslims, according to the complaint. Nabi told the informant he wanted to take a stand. According to the complaint, Alsarabbi and Nabi took money given by the NYPD to the informant and sent it to Lahore, Pakistan. From recorded conversation it was determined the money was sent to Nabi's father for ""merchandise to Afghanistan,"" the complaint states. Both men were arraigned on Tuesday in Queens Criminal Court and held on $500,000 bond. The next hearing date is set for October 25, the district attorney's office said. Nabi and Alsarabbi are charged with soliciting or providing support for an act of terrorism and conspiracy. If convicted on all counts, they face up to seven years behind bars. CNN was unable to reach Nabi's and Alsarabbi's attorneys on Thursday.","Pakistani national and U.S. naturalized citizen accused of plan to aid terrorists .

"(CNN) -- Take the magic of the ""Harry Potter"" novels, add in a story of forbidden love like ""Twilight"" and you have what publishers hope is the makings of another blockbuster in ""The Night Circus."" The new novel tells the story of two young magicians, Celia and Marco, forced to compete in an elaborate duel, but who instead fall in love. Set in the 19th century, the story plays out within the black and white striped tents of ""Le Cirque des Reves"" an enchanted circus of dreams, which travels the world and is open only at night. It's made up of acrobats and animal trainers, a tattooed contortionist and amazing displays, including a garden of ice and a maze made of clouds. Like the story, the writing is magical and mysterious, the characters cryptic and compelling. Overall it's an enchanting page turner, a modern fairy tale readers are sure to fall in love with. But is it the next ""Harry Potter""? Publishers and booksellers are betting on it. Doubleday won a bidding war for the book. The publisher gave author Erin Morgenstern, a first-time novelist, a high six-figure advance and ordered a first printing of 175,000 copies. Rights have sold to 30 foreign publishers. Summit Entertainment, the Hollywood company behind the hugely successful ""Twilight"" series, snapped up the film rights. David Heyman, the producer of the ""Harry Potter"" movies, is in negotiations to lead the big screen adaptation. Booksellers are swooning. Desperately in need of a hot seller, stores across the country and around the world are planning publication day parties for the book's release on Tuesday. The elfin-looking Morgenstern is helping build buzz for her book, attracting huge crowds at Comic-Con in San Diego and New York's Book Expo. She recently signed 2,200 first editions to be sent to stores across the country in what she called ""Signing-palooza."" She's heading out on a six-week, 14-city tour to promote the book. CNN recently spoke with Morgenstern; the following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Tell me about the inspiration behind ""The Night Circus."" Morgenstern: It kind of came about by accident, I was actually working on a different book. I started doing national novel writing month about eight years ago and I started writing this Edward Gorey inspired plot. I didn't know where I was going with it, so I decided to send all the characters to the circus. I started with these little vignettes and it didn't have a plot for the longest time, but that's kind of where it started. It's been a long strange trip. The idea came together in 2006. I worked on it in fits and starts and didn't take it real seriously at first. I wasn't thinking at that point about trying to get published, I was writing just to write. Then in 2008 I started to think I might have something. I tried to make the story a little more book shaped, not so sprawling and nonlinear and more resembling a novel. Then I started querying agents in 2009 and got a lot of favorable responses but pretty much everyone said it had no plot. So I ended up doing a lot of revising and that's actually the version of the book that ended up getting me signed. Then I did even more revisions. This book has been revised many, many, many times. It's changed so much that I didn't I feel like I was working on one book for that long because I wasn't working on it continuously and because it changed so much. CNN: Are you a fan of the circus? Morgenstern: I'm not really a circus fan, not a traditional circus person. My background is in theater. I have a degree in theater from Smith College and I like immersive performance, halfway between theater and performance art. I thought a circus environment would be an interesting venue to explore, where you didn't just have one tent with three rings and a show going on but where you could explore different things in different tents. CNN: On your website you say, ""All my works are fairy tales in one way or another."" How so? Morgenstern: I like that ""once upon a time"" quality, where the telling of a tale has an elevated sense of story. There's a whimsical quality to it. Sometimes in fairy tales more things seem possible, even though often they're real world based. I love that very traditional fairy tale where it's not all ""happily ever after."" I like all that old school, bloody, ""Brothers Grimm"" sort of stuff. So you have all those shades of gray in there. CNN: This is your first novel, it's generating a huge buzz, and I know you were a big hit at the Book Expo and at Comic-Con. Morgenstern: I did go to Comic-Con and it was amazing. There's quite a contrast between the Book Expo and Comic Con. I didn't expect the Expo to be as overwhelming as it was. I had a great time but the lines for my signing were around the entire convention center. I just never expected that sort of response. Then Comic Con was just craziness. It was a lot of people and color, and loud, it was such a sensory overload. It's been a lot of fun, but it was good that I had just a crazy few days and then I got to have some time off and recover. CNN: How are you enjoying the reaction to your book so far? Morgenstern: It's been fun, but it does seem very big, especially for my first book. There are days where it's just a little overwhelming, but the response has been great, especially within the book industry. I've been getting letters from booksellers saying how much they love my story; it means so much to me. After all the bells and whistles and Comic Con, and all the big stuff, really the fact that individual people are reading it and loving the book is just the best thing. One of the nicest things I've heard, though, I've had a couple people say to me this is not a book for everyone, which I really like, because I don't particularly think there are books for everyone. I think this is the sort of story that resonates particularly strong with certain people and maybe not as much with others. I think that's a hallmark of a really good story that it has readers that it speaks to more than others. CNN: There are plans under way to turn your book into a movie. How is that going? Morgenstern: I'm a little bit involved. I've heard bits and pieces; they're still in the early stages of production, trying to assemble the best team to put the film together. Everyone is so enthusiastic and really loves the book, so it seems like it's in really good hands. So I hope they can take the book and make it stand alone as a film. I don't want to have that much input anyway; it's not really something I do. I'm interested but I definitely just want them to run with it. CNN: Do you have any actors in mind for key roles? Morgenstern: The only character I ever pictured as a particular actor, Hector was always Geoffrey Rush in my head. There's something about his physicality and Geoffrey Rush's mannerisms that I pictured. He's good in everything. CNN: What's next? Morgenstern: I'm going to be very busy with the book's release but when I have time I am working on a new book. It's very different but I'm looking forward to exploring someplace new. I need to live in the world of story for awhile before I figure out the shape of the book. It's sort of a film noir with influences from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" so it has a sort of fantastic feel, like the magic of ""The Night Circus"" but with a little more '30s, '40s, '50s art deco feel to the story. CNN: Will you ever return to ""The Night Circus?"" Morgenstern: I don't think it will become a series, a direct sequel or anything like that, but there's a lot more material floating around the edges. There are lots of little tangential stories that could become part of a prequel, or collected short stories. I think that would probably be the extent of it but it would be fun to play with. There's a lot more material on all the side characters that didn't make it into the finished book.

"(CNN) -- On the record, Pakistan has persistently criticized the United States' use of unmanned drones to attack militant hideouts in its mountainous border region. But diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks reveal that in private the Pakistani government was not unhappy about the strikes and secretly allowed small groups of U.S. Special Operations units to operate on its soil. In a cable sent in August 2008, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan at the time, Anne Patterson, recounted a meeting with Interior Minister Rehman Malik and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. It coincided with a military operation in one of the restive frontier territories. Patterson wrote, ""Malik suggested we hold off alleged Predator attacks until after the Bajaur operation. The PM brushed aside Rehman's remarks and said, 'I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it.' "" On Wednesday, a governing party representative said there was some public support in Pakistan for U.S. missile attacks on suspected militants. ""There is a segment in the country who support the drone attacks, and they feel that drone attacks have been helpful in eliminating many of the militants,"" Pakistan People's Party spokeswoman Fauzia Wahab said. ""But of course there is another point of view in the country who do not favor the drone attacks, and they think that drone attacks are intervention and violating our sovereignty,"" she said. She did not directly answer a question about her party's position on drones. She also said there is some ""soft"" support for militants in ""every institution"" in the country, including the military, but said the government did not ""support those who are close to the militants."" Asked about Wahab's comment that there was some public support for drone strikes, Pakistan's ambassador to the United Kingdom stuck to the government's official line. ""No one supports drone attacks by the Americans,"" Wajid Hasan said Wednesday. But other U.S. records revealed by WikiLeaks make clear that there were meetings between American and Pakistani officials about drones. A U.S. diplomat, based in Peshawar near the border territories, mentions in a 2008 cable a meeting he had with a senior official whose name is redacted. The official ""said he wanted to say in an unofficial capacity that he and many others could accept Predator strikes as they were surgical and clearly hitting high value targets. He mentioned that fear among the local populace in areas where the strikes have been occurring was lessening because 'everyone knew that they only hit the house or location of very bad people.'"" The same official painted a gloomy picture of the situation, saying, ""Our house is on fire and we need to take drastic actions,"" according to the cable. It seems that Pakistan saw the drone attacks as so effective, it wanted some of its own. At a meeting in Islamabad in June 2009 attended by then-U.S. National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones, President Asif Ali Zardari ""made repeated pleas for drones to be 'put in Pakistan's hands' so that Pakistan would own the issue and drone attacks (including collateral damage) would not provoke anti-Americanism,"" one cable says. Zardari said the technology behind them was ""not cutting-edge"" and said he had raised the issue with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Similarly, Pakistan has been very sensitive to allegations that U.S. combat forces are at work inside the country. But one cable from Patterson written in October 2009 noted with satisfaction, ""The Pakistani Army has for just the second time approved deployment of U.S. special operation elements to support Pakistani military operations. The first deployment ... occurred in September."" That cable goes on to say that a request had come from the Pakistani military commander in North and South Waziristan, Lt. Gen. Masood Aslam, for intelligence and reconnaissance assistance from U.S. Special Operations units. That support would ""include a live downlink of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) full motion video,"" it says. Patterson adds that the move ""appears to represent a sea change in Pakistani thinking. Patient relationship-building with the military is the key factor that has brought us to this point."" But she cautions: ""These deployments are highly politically sensitive because of widely held concerns among the public about Pakistani sovereignty and opposition to allowing foreign military forces to operate in any fashion on Pakistani soil. Should these developments and/or related matters receive any coverage in the Pakistani or U.S. media, the Pakistani military will likely stop making requests for such assistance."" During discussions on the militant threat, the Pakistani leadership stressed that a short-term victory was unlikely. According to one 2009 cable, Zardari ""cautioned that the fight against militant extremism would be a long one, lasting not months but many, many years and that lack of vigilance on the GOP's part would be devastating."" In this case, GOP refers to the government of Pakistan. Zardari also did not miss the chance -- in speaking with Jones -- to have a poke at Pakistan's nemesis, accusing ""India of providing the precursor chemicals necessary to produce heroin, which he said was funding the Taliban in Afghanistan."" At the same meeting, according to the cable, Zardari praised the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, but with reservations. ""Singh is an excellent economist,"" he said, but he added that he thought Singh did not understand the constraints under which Zardari was operating. The cables also reveal great sensitivity on the part of Pakistan to any perceived tilt by Washington in favor of India. A cable prepared this year for FBI Director Robert Mueller says, ""Cooperation has frequently been hampered by suspicion in Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment about U.S. intentions and objectives. Among other things, the Pakistanis believe that we have favored India over Pakistan -- most notably, by approving civil-nuclear cooperation with India -- and that we aim to dismantle Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, which, in light of their conventional military disadvantage vis-a-vis India, they consider critical to their national security."" Referring to the Pakistani Taliban, the same cable says gloomily, ""In the midst of this difficult security situation, Pakistan's civilian government remains weak, ineffectual, and corrupt."" Support for strikes . There is some public support in Pakistan for U.S. missile attacks on suspected militants in the country, a governing party representative conceded Wednesday, diverging from the country's official position on drone strikes. There is also some ""soft"" support for militants in ""every institution"" in the country, including the military, Pakistan People's Party spokeswoman Fauzia Wahab told CNN. Pakistan's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Wajid Hasan, stuck to the government's official line, that U.S. drone attacks infringe on Pakistani sovereignty, when asked about Wahab's remarks. CNN'S Ravi Agrawal and Luke Henderson contributed to this report.","NEW: There is some public support for strikes, governing party spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Fox News' Bob Beckel believes that I, as an American-Muslim, should have fewer constitutional rights simply because of my religious faith. Beckel, the so-called ""liberal"" on Fox News, made this point on his show this week while discussing the horrific terror attack on the Kenyan shopping mall. Beckel opined that Muslims should not be allowed to build any more houses of worship in America, ""until you stand up and denounce what's happened in the name of your prophet."" Sorry Bob, you're dead wrong. If you would take a moment to read our amazing U.S. Constitution, you would perhaps understand the rights we are all guaranteed as Americans, such as freedom of religion. But when you hear Beckel speak, you get the sense he isn't a big fan of reading. Let me address this to Beckel: I have never built a mosque, nor do I have plans to. But if I wanted to build one, I could build one right next to your house. In fact, I almost want to start a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter.com entitled: ""Raise money to build a mega-mosque next to Bob Beckel's house."" This is not the first time Beckel has spewed this type of hateful garbage.  This past July he demanded that Muslim-Americans be prohibited from building houses of worship, ""until we find out who's a terrorist"" within the U.S. Muslim community. I'm curious: Does Beckel truly believes what he says about Muslims or is he simply giving the Fox News audience what it wants to hear? After all, a 2011 survey concluded,  ""that Americans who most trust Fox News are more likely to believe that Muslims want to establish Shari'a law, have not done enough to oppose extremism, and believe investigating Muslim extremism is a good idea."" Here's a news flash for Beckel: Just because a person claims to be a Muslim, doesn't mean his or her actions are based on the tenets of the faith, nor does it mean this person is an actual Muslim. Just look at the Kenya shopping mall attack. The terrorists there didn't say they carried out their attack for religious reasons. No, they made it clear the attack was revenge for the Kenyan government sending its troops to fight them in Somalia. So let's get to the crux of the issue: Should American-Muslims be required to denounce terrorist attacks perpetrated by so-called Muslims who commit horrible acts on other parts of the planet? Well, let's ask Ronald Reagan: ""We must reject the idea that every (time) a law is broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions."" Still, American Muslim leaders and organizations have consistently denounced terror attacks committed by Muslims -- including the recent Kenya attack. And not only did American Muslims denounce this recent incident, so did Muslim leaders in Kenya as well as the president of Somalia -- a Muslim. How could Bob Beckel not be aware of these facts? Maybe he hasn't figured out how to use Google yet? Or maybe he simply doesn't care about accuracy -- or both? And why would Beckel and his Fox News show have a discussion about Muslims without inviting at least one on? Do they not know even one American Muslim? Or is the reason more sinister? Does Fox News not want a Muslim-American on air to denounce the terror acts and present an American face of the faith because it undermines the narrative they have crafted about Muslims over the past few years? You will have to answer that. But I can tell you this: I personally wanted to get on Beckel's Fox News show to answer their questions and discuss a recently released comedy documentary I co-directed, ""The Muslims Are Coming!"" This film addresses the very point they are raising and uses comedy to dispel misconceptions about Muslims. But they said ""no."" So I will say it here: I absolutely despise the terrorists who kill innocent people -- be they Muslim or any other faith for that matter. They use the name of religion to justify an immoral and inhumane act. And the ones who claim to be Muslim are not--they are simply murderers. I still hold out hope that one day Fox News will invite more American Muslims on its network so that their audience can hear from Muslims first hand. My concern, though, is that day will only come when Fox News has moved on to demonizing another minority group for ratings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Fox's Beckel said no new mosques in U.S. till Muslims denounce terrorists .
Obeidallah: Does Beckel say these things to be Fox-like?
He says news flash: Kenya attacks about revenge against Kenyan government, not religion .
Obeidallah: Fox doesn't have Muslim Americans on air to conflict with network's narrative ."
"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Times headline said it all: ""Rep. Paul Ryan Fails to Close Republican Divide."" When this became Ryan's job, or whether his now ""controversial"" Wall Street Journal op-ed was even an attempt at doing that, is anyone's guess. But once again, Republicans have decided to cannibalize themselves viciously and needlessly instead of uniting over common goals. To be clear, the divide on the right isn't over policy. No Republican I've met thinks Obamacare is good legislation. No one is suggesting capitulation on the debt ceiling. Everyone wants spending cuts, entitlement reform and deficit reduction. Where we're divided is over tactics. Incidentally, Ryan hinted at this in September to Politico: . ""Yeah, there's a bit of frustration. ... We all believe the same thing, we all want to achieve the same goal, and so we shouldn't be questioning each other's conservatism over tactical disagreements."" Guess no one on Team Ted Cruz got that message. After Ryan's op-ed, which pushed for a strong-willed fight for entitlement reform in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, failed to mention the unholiest of Tea Party holies, Obamacare, he was nailed to a proverbial cross by Ted Cruz defenders, who then immediately told everyone at Golgotha -- or on Twitter -- of his betrayal. Cruz speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted, ""There is one big word missing from this op-ed. It's start (sic) with an O and ends with BAMACARE."" Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler was similarly snarky: ""Much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn't mention Obamacare in WSJ oped. #shutdown."" Over on Red State, Daniel Horowitz posted the questions, ""So we are going to ditch the fight over Obamacare, which is extremely unpopular, to fight for Medicare reform? Really, Paul Ryan? And they think we are politically stupid?"" Now, nowhere in Ryan's op-ed does he suggest ditching the fight over Obamacare. As Cruz's cheerleaders point out, Ryan doesn't even mention the health care law. But the thing that defies logic (and good manners) is the necessity of this kind of puerile bullying. Ryan's plan isn't in competition with or heretical to Cruz's message. It's simply another objective conservatives should fight for, both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, the sniping is just unseemly, and frankly, Cruz's defenders are only managing to make Ryan look like the grown-up. I don't recall Ryan jumping into the fray when plenty of Republicans were criticizing the strategy to defund Obamacare -- a position by Cruz that I have applauded as heroic. When Sens. Bob Corker and Orrin Hatch and Rep. Peter King were scolding Cruz for a plan they knew was ill-fated, Ryan was virtually silent on the move. This, even though Cruz has never been shy about his disdain for Ryan Republicans. Back in March, Cruz criticized Ryan's budget plan for its Medicare cuts. And he's made it clear he doesn't trust Ryan when it comes to budget negotiations. It's hard to argue that Ryan isn't a staunch conservative. To treat him like a traitor is preposterous and unproductive. And while I admire Cruz's conviction, and stand by his commitment to peel back a program as odious and ruinous as the Affordable Care Act, he has to learn to work with others on his own team. The Los Angeles Times headline isn't accurate. Instead of reading ""Rep. Paul Ryan Fails to Close Republican Divide"" it should read ""Team Cruz Rips Republicans Apart. Again."" If he keeps it up, he'll lose people like me who are with him on the policy, but quickly losing patience for his tactics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S.E. Cupp: Paul Ryan's proposal on entitlements has been attacked by Ted Cruz backers .

"(CNN) -- On the final episode of AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" Sunday night, Bryan Cranston's Walter White finally meets his broken-bad destiny, whatever that means. On the opening episode of the new season of Showtime's ""Homeland,"" the same night, Claire Danes' Carrie Mathison is about to undergo another very tough stretch. What does it mean about television, and ourselves, that these two very volatile loners -- Walter, the former high-school chemistry teacher turned murderous meth manufacturer, and Carrie, the bipolar CIA agent whose instincts are as good as her psyche is fragile -- have captured the pop-culture zeitgeist? It could mean that, ever since HBO's ""The Sopranos"" gave us permission more than a decade ago to embrace imperfect heroes, even anti-heroes, at the center of our TV dramas, it was only a matter of time, and a few short steps, before we could empathize with cancer-ridden Walter and, on ""Homeland,"" Damian Lewis' (literally) tortured POW Brody. We were led here in impressive increments: Michael Chiklis' Vic Mackey in FX's ""The Shield."" Denis Leary in FX's ""Rescue Me."" Lots of flawed characters on ABC's ""Lost,"" FX's ""Justified"" and other quality TV dramas. But really, credit the writers and the performers, and directors and other crew members, of these two dramas for raising the bar so high that their shows have become essential topics of conversation. At a time of ever fragmenting viewership, when fewer people are watching television in ""real time,"" ""Homeland"" and ""Breaking Bad"" continue to break through. Especially ""Breaking Bad."" ""Homeland"" hit a fever pitch its first season, and though it's still strong, is not as dominant a conversational topic as it was its freshman year. ""Breaking Bad,"" on the other hand, built slowly, brilliantly. By the time it got to the midseason break of its final year, it seemed the bandwagon pulled up and everyone, absolutely everyone, climbed on. ""Breaking Bad,"" regardless of its audience levels on AMC (another show from the network, ""The Walking Dead,"" draws almost twice as many viewers), is the show of the fall 2013 TV season. Doesn't matter what else is out there, or whether it's on broadcast or cable. ""Breaking Bad"" is it. Partly, this is because series creator Vince Gilligan has promised, and scheduled, an actual ending -- an approach that TV hit on in 1967, when ABC gave producer Quinn Martin enough advance warning that his ongoing narrative drama, ""The Fugitive,"" would not be renewed. Martin turned around and gave viewers the ending they'd been waiting for. Presto: In the dog days of August, that finale to ""The Fugitive"" drew the biggest ratings in the history of television up to that time. Since then, some of the most ambitious TV dramas have ended not with a bang or a whimper, but with a preconceived farewell ending. Some were perfect, like HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" and FX's ""The Shield."" Others were disappointing, like ABC's ""Lost"" and, most recently, Showtime's ""Dexter."" And some infuriated some while delighting others, like NBC's ""St. Elsewhere"" and HBO's ""The Sopranos."" But ""Breaking Bad"" may be in a category all its own. The last time, as a TV critic and as a viewer, I've anticipated a television drama as eagerly as I have ""Breaking Bad"" was in the glory days of ""Twin Peaks"" at the dawn of the 1990s. Back then, there was no Internet as we know it to spread the word and parse every image and line of dialogue -- but some serious-minded fans did the pre-Internet equivalent, and launched a monthly magazine devoted to ""Twin Peaks,"" called Wrapped in Plastic, the name derived from a key line of dialogue in the show. Had the Internet not been around for ""Breaking Bad,"" we might have another magazine on our hands: Yeah Science, Bitch! Instead, it is the very existence of new technology that has allowed new fans to find and embrace ""Breaking Bad"" so fervently, and to dive into ""Homeland"" so completely. Not only does the Internet, through fan and media sites, keep the focus on these shows and their ambitious story lines, but viewers can catch up by watching old episodes on streaming sites, or buying DVD sets. The constant, instant exposure helps, and so does the incessant media attention. But this infatuation with these dark dramas wouldn't occur if these TV series weren't as good as they are. Before I saw the pilot episode of ""Breaking Bad,"" the written premise in the press release was so grim -- meek science teacher with pregnant wife and teen son learns he has terminal cancer, and starts making meth to provide a nest egg for his family -- I had never heard of a show I wanted to see less. Now, as it reaches its conclusion, I can't think of a show I've ever wanted to see more.

"(CNN) -- Iran has struck up a new, conciliatory chord on negotiations about its nuclear program. And its leaders say it's eager to get down to business. Foreign minister Javad Zarif reiterated Iran's apparent haste to reach an international agreement on its energy program in a statement Monday. Zarif hopes that together Iran and the West will be able to work out a ""roadmap"" a day after Iran presents its latest plan at the U.N. to secure its energy independence and build international trust. He would like an additional meeting on Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland, with ministers from the countries from the P5+1 in order to hammer out the details, he said on his Facebook account. The meeting would include the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- the countries with permanent seats on the UN Security Council -- plus Germany. ""As I've said before, a rather difficult and time consuming process begins tomorrow,"" Zarif wrote. ""Hopefully by Wednesday we can agree on a roadmap to reach a solution. But even if the other party, in good faith, agrees on the details, a new ministerial meeting will be needed."" Good faith . Zarif's statement follows an apparent about-face in Iran's tone towards the United States and its Western allies that has set in since the election in Iran of its new president, Hassan Rouhani, who replaced Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad was known for caustic and threatening rhetoric towards the United States and Israel. Rouhani has struck a much friendlier tone. During his visit to the UN General Assembly in late September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw with Iran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Many fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb. Iran has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. On message . Zarif's Facebook post is not surprising and is on message with his own previous statements and with those of his colleague Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful speaker of the parliament and a close associate of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program, and is keen to resolve the issue ""in a short period of time,"" the speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview last week. ""From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,"" Larijani said from Geneva. ""If the Americans and other countries say that Iran should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that,"" he told Amanpour, ""then we can clearly show and prove that. We have no such intention. So it can be resolved in a very short period of time."" Nonetheless, Larijani said, the West must accept Iran's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes, as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to which Iran is a signatory. Critics have expressed suspicions over that enrichment, fearing the Iran may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb-grade materials. Relaxing sanctions . Some believe that Iran's recent opening and seeming willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program may be a result of crippling sanctions on its economy. Shortly after this year's U.N. General Assembly ended, a State Department official said the United States would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on Iran if it engaged in confidence-building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its disputed nuclear program. But this will take time and trust building. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is in Geneva, has made clear that the entire sanctions regime targeting Iran would not be lifted ""any time soon"" unless the entire litany of concerns about Iran's nuclear program were fully addressed. CNN's Jamie Crawford and Mick Kever contributed to this report .","Iran has struck up a new, diplomatic tone with the United States and its allies .

"(CNN) -- It speaks volumes that America's government could be shut down with its leaders blaming one another for bringing the country to the edge of the economic abyss, and the response of much of the world, including the leading financial markets, would essentially be a yawn. The most stunning thing about this first shutdown of the U.S. government in almost two decades is the degree to which it is a nonevent, considered par for the course given the sad state of affairs in the nation's capital. Voters may be angry. They may be depressed. But there are no mass demonstrations. Congress' approval rating may have hit new lows, but beyond that, the response has been a shrug. Here in Washington, traffic is still lousy. Lobbyists still schmooze over restaurant breakfast tables. People shake their heads in disgust. But no one even bothers to feign surprise. Speaking with institutional investors, I was struck to hear that they, too, consider this episode to be not much different from the histrionics of an unhappy child. Even financial professionals, whose world and well-being would be rocked by the cataclysm that would be triggered by America's failure to pay its debts, have not reacted with panic. (Today, during and after House Speaker John Boehner'sdefiant press conference, which seemed to presage a drawn-out crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average barely budged, remaining slightly positive throughout.) When financial professionals are asked why they remain calm, they say that someone will blink because someone always blinks. And they say if nobody blinks, perhaps a brief market spike downward would serve as a wake-up call to reason. But more important, nearly all those with whom I spoke believe the United States won't default even if the debt ceiling isn't lifted because there are ways the president can keep the checks going out -- such as simply paying the debt out of available cash and holding back on other payments not tied to the ""full faith and credit of the U.S. government."" The result is that rather than action, this pathetic standoff has produced a lot of media sound and fury signifying, just as Shakespeare once observed, nothing. Interested observers are understandably depressed, legitimately concerned that we have lost our mojo as a country, that this is a sign of decline, based on the fact that at this moment in U.S. history, our government just doesn't work. Although this is primarily the fault of the GOP and notably and undeniably a tiny fraction of crackpots within the party who are throwing a public tantrum because they didn't get their way on health care reform, it is equally undeniable that both parties have contributed to the pitiful state of a democratic system that was once a shining example to the world. Both parties are responsible for the gerrymandering that has produced a modern political reality in which the vast majority of members of Congress are in safe districts and never feel pressure from opposing views. They have no reason ever to compromise and, indeed, are penalized for doing so because their future depends on primary wins, and they see those who vote in primaries -- the most extreme members of the party faithful -- as the group to whom they must answer. Both parties have engineered and failed to challenge the corrupt campaign finance system that gives check writers power over law writers and undercuts the most basic principles of equity in democracy. Both parties have contributed to the shrillness of the debate. Both parties have used antiquated Senate rules to block progress by their opponents and the confirmation of nominees of presidents they oppose. And both have done these things for so long now that these flaws in our system are seen as enduring and impermeable to change. In the end, this is not a problem of a government shutdown or even of the impending breach of the debt ceiling, certainly not about the nonsense spewing from obstructionist tea party clowns who claim it is about defending ""individual liberties."" It is also not as simple as refusing to negotiate with political hostage takers as the president suggests, although he is absolutely right to resist their crude techniques. Rather, it is a governance crisis of the first order, one in which the solution can only be massive system-wide reform. It's a crisis that shows itself not just in the petty squabbles of elites, nor in the lack of a serious discussion about addressing the real problems confronting the country, but is best illustrated by the cynicism and relative indifference of the electorate. They are not protesting, not voting out the bastards. Rather, most disturbingly, they are saying, ""We don't believe you any more and we are starting not to care."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: It's alarming the shutdown is seen as a nonevent and par for the course .
No mass demonstrations, he says, and even financial professionals aren't panicked .

"(CNN) -- The Denver Broncos announced Wednesday night they had finalized a trade that sends high-profile quarterback Tim Tebow to the New York Jets. Tebow and a seventh-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft go the Jets in exchange for picks in the fourth and sixth rounds of the draft. The Broncos said Tuesday that superstar quarterback Peyton Manning, a free agent, would join the team, setting in motion efforts to trade Tebow. But the Broncos-Jets deal didn't come without a hitch. A snag was reported within hours of the Jets' saying they agreed in principle to the trade. ESPN, quoting a source with the Broncos, reported the hangup was over language in Tebow's contract. Sources told ESPN that the Jets believed Denver should pay $5 million in salary advances to Tebow. The Broncos have already paid $1.2 million of the advance, ESPN reported. The Jets have agreed to pay half of the $5 million in compensation back to Denver to finish the trade, ESPN reported late Wednesday. Tebow, an outspoken evangelical Christian, became the Broncos' starting quarterback last year amid great fanfare. He led the team from a 1-4 start to an 8-8 finish in the regular season and their first division title since 2005. The trade comes less than two weeks after the Jets and quarterback Mark Sanchez agreed on a multiyear contract extension. Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said Sanchez will retain his starting quarterback job and Tebow will play in a wildcat-style offense, which uses a quarterback more as a runner. ""It will be up to us to put him in the position to be successful,"" said Tannenbaum. ""We think he's going to be a player that can help us. He's a great competitor. He's gonna help us win."" A lot of the talk about Tebow, 24, has centered around his demonstrations of his faith. He wore Bible verses on his eyeblack when he quarterbacked for the Florida Gators. He won the Heisman Trophy in 2007. Throughout last season in Denver, Tebow's jersey was flying off the racks and ""Tebowing"" -- the act of getting down on one knee and praying while everyone around you does something else -- became an Internet meme and widely recognized symbol. Tebow quickly became the public face of FRS Co. and Jockey; for months, it was hard to click on ESPN without hearing his name. Manning, who missed last season because of an injury, was released this year by the Indianapolis Colts, the only team for which he's played in his 14-year pro career. In the subsequent weeks, the Super Bowl XLI victor -- who has been named the National Football League's Most Valuable Player a record four times -- has been hotly sought after by several teams. Broncos executive John Elway, in a statement issued Wednesday night, said, ""Tim Tebow deserves an enormous amount of credit for what he accomplished and how he carried himself during his time with the Broncos. From taking over a 1-4 team and leading it to the playoffs to energizing our fans and this community, Tim left an extraordinary mark on this organization. His time in Denver will always hold a special place in Broncos history."" Jim Daly, president of the Colorado Springs-based evangelical group Focus on the Family, teamed up with Tebow for an anti-abortion Super Bowl ad last year. The spot illustrated how comfortable Tebow is trumpeting his Christian beliefs. ""I think there is going to be this period of mourning for Tim Tebow's departure,"" Daly said. ""I think that that affection that people have for Tebow goes well beyond Denver and his ability to play football."" CNN's Dan Merica and Joseph Miller contributed to this report.","NEW: ""He's a great competitor,"" Jets official says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf will face charges of treason for his role in imposing emergency military rule six years ago, the country's interior minister said Sunday. ""I'm calling on the chief justice of Pakistan to appoint three high court judges to investigate former President Gen. Pervez Musharraf under Article 6 of the law,"" Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told reporters, referring to a section of the constitution covering high treason. Musharraf could face life in prison or receive the death penalty if he is found guilty of treason. A spokeswoman for the former military ruler said he is willing to face all charges against him. ""Gen. Musharraf has full faith in the judiciary and trusts the legal system to clear his name,"" Aasia Ishaque told CNN by phone. ""He is a man of his word, and he will let the court decide his fate."" The charges will be referred Monday and a special prosecutor to oversee the case will be selected, Khan said. Musharraf's return . Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating the constitution in November 2007. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamist extremism. The action drew sharp criticism from the United States and democracy advocates. Pakistanis openly called for his ouster. Under pressure from the West, he later lifted the state of emergency and promised elections. When those elections came, his party was dealt a serious blow. Musharraf stepped down in August 2008 as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He has not been allowed to leave the country since arriving back from self-imposed exile in the run-up to this year's elections. No love lost . It's not surprising that Sharif would call for Musharraf to be held criminally liable; there is no love lost between the two men. In the 1990s, when Sharif was prime minister, Musharraf was military chief. Sharif feared Musharraf was plotting his ouster. He fired Musharraf in October 1999 after the army's failed invasion of Kargil, in India-held Kashmir. And when Musharraf was on a flight to the city of Karachi, his plane was initially denied permission to land, purportedly by Sharif. The military responded by overthrowing Sharif in a bloodless coup. Musharraf took power, and a court subsequently convicted Sharif on hijacking and treason charges. Sharif managed to negotiate a period in exile in Saudi Arabia instead of prison. He returned to Pakistan to challenge Musharraf's rule in late 2007. His party didn't win. But he waited. This year, his party won a majority of the votes, putting him back in power. CNN's Saima Mohsin contributed to this report.","Pervez Musharraf returned to Pakistan this year after a self-imposed exile .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Green Beret charged with attempting to carry explosives onto a commercial airliner in Midland, Texas, was released from jail Friday. Sgt. 1st Class Trey Scott Atwater was let out on a $50,000 bond into the custody of his supervisor at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Two members of the Army picked up Atwater after a Friday court hearing to escort him back to the base. Atwater, 30, was arrested Saturday after Transportation Security Administration screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 in his carry-on bag. According to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas, prosecutors have ""uncovered no information that would suggest that Sgt. Atwater intended harm to any aircraft, or to the flying public."" However, prosecutors do view the matter as ""very serious."" U.S. Magistrate Judge David Counts set some other conditions for Atwater's release from jail, including that he will not possess any explosives or firearms, will not drink alcohol, and he must undergo a mental health evaluation. Atwater also had to surrender his Army passport and agree not to get another one. With all the conditions set by the judge, prosecutors said, they do not view Atwater as a flight risk or a danger to the community. A criminal complaint released Tuesday said that Atwater had told the FBI he was a demolitions expert with the Army's 7th Special Forces Group and had recently returned from his third deployment to Afghanistan. Atwater said it was his practice to carry at least two blocks of C-4 explosives for any operation. He said he brought the bag home with him and used it as a carry-on for children's items when he traveled to Midland for the holidays. He said he didn't realize there were any explosives inside and was ""surprised that the C-4 was in the bag when it was located"" by TSA screeners. The court document also said Atwater had another run-in with airport security while leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve en route to Texas when a military smoke grenade was discovered in his bag. In that instance, the grenade was confiscated; Atwater was ""admonished"" by security officials but allowed to continue on his trip. According to the complaint, Atwater did not bring up the smoke grenade incident while being questioned about the discovery of the explosives in his bag at Midland International Airport on Saturday. When asked about it by the FBI, he said he had ""forgotten to mention it."" No trial date has been set for Atwater on the charge of attempting to board an aircraft with explosives. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Atwater carries the rank of sergeant first class, and his service awards include the Bronze Star and the Army Commendation Medal, according to the Pentagon.","Trey Atwater out on a $50,000 bond, in supervisor's custody at Fort Bragg, North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- U.S. leaker Edward Snowden did not violate the terms of his asylum in Russia when claims surfaced that a National Security Agency surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin told Russian daily newspaper Kommersant. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, was granted asylum in Russia under the condition that he stops harming the United States. But Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is cited by Kommersant in a report published Saturday as saying that the reports published in the German press were not distributed from Russia. Allegations that the NSA monitored Merkel's cell phone sparked outrage among German leaders. Germany sent a delegation to the White House this week for talks on the matter. European Union lawmakers also visited Washington this week, where they met with National Security Council staffers. Top senator: Obama didn't know of U.S. spying on Germany's leader . Snowden was granted a year's asylum by Russia in August, after arriving there from Hong Kong in June. Snowden told The New York Times in an interview published last month that he gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow, and did not keep any copies for himself. Lawmaker: Snowden wants to testify in Washington . The United States has charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. But a German lawmaker who met with Snowden in Moscow on Thursday said that Snowden did not see himself as an ""enemy of America"" and that he wants to testify in Washington. Revelations of U.S. spying involving allied leaders and citizens have sparked calls for the United States to roll back its surveillance programs and triggered threats of repercussions. On Wednesday, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said authorities there have demanded an explanation from the United States about surveillance activities. In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the nation's intelligence chief will brief lawmakers about what Spain knows about U.S. activities in a closed-door session in Madrid.

Last week, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the end to a treaty with the United States allowing for the exchange of some banking data meant to help track terrorist financing.

"(CNN) -- The Obamacare website might still be slow, but the politics and context of Obamacare are shifting rapidly. On Thursday, to deal with some of the grousing about canceled insurance plans, President Obama announced an administrative fix to allow people to keep those crummy plans (that they think they like) for up to a year. This should quiet some of the complaints within his own party, though certainly not Republicans, who will just find another reason to attack Obama and health care reform. One hopes this fix will put the focus back on making Obamacare implementation as successful and effective as possible. It's certainly not there yet. On Wednesday, the Obama administration announced that just more than 106,000 Americans had enrolled in health insurance plans through Obamacare exchanges, and another 975,000 people had shopped for plans but not enrolled in a selection yet. No one is cheering these numbers — well, no one except those Republicans who didn't want anyone to have access to affordable, quality private health insurance options in the first place. The 106,000 enrollments are well below the 500,000 the White House had originally projected for this period before launch of the exchanges. The brouhaha over canceled insurance plans has muddied an otherwise positive law. But all of the above should be put in a broader context —the context of enrollment in past comparable insurance systems, the context of what health insurance was like before the Affordable Care Act passed, and the context of its opponents' repeated lies meant to distort and destroy Obamacare. So, here are three handy charts to help you understand the reality of Obamacare and separate fact from fear-mongering. CHART 1: Romneycare enrollment . Looking for an analog to what Obamacare enrollment might look like nationwide? Look no further than Massachusetts, which implemented a mini-version of Obamacare under then-Gov. Mitt Romney. In 2007, Romneycare wasn't even plagued by a bum website rollout — and enrollment was still gradual, as shown in this chart (click on it to expand) and explained by Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic. It can be expected that people who need Obamacare the most — either because they're sick or because they're sick of their current expensive individual insurance — will enroll first, but everybody else, especially those who are currently uninsured, will wait until the last minute to sign up before they face the individual mandate penalty. Plus, even people who want their new plan to kick in on January 1, 2014, have until December 15 to enroll in a plan. Also, choosing among the many options in the Obamacare exchanges does take time — which might explain, for instance, why almost 1 million people have logged into the exchange but not yet chosen an insurance option. With time, those numbers can be expected to grow. CHART 2: How bad it was before Obamacare . We may need a reminder of how disastrous our health insurance system was before Congress passed Obamacare. Just one way of looking at this is that health care spending as a percent of family income was already an astronomical 19% in 2009 but was projected to be 30% by 2019 and 48% by 2029 — unless something was done. This reality is particularly lost when discussing the estimated 2% to 4% of Americans who have private insurance plans that will ultimately be canceled because of higher coverage standards set by the Affordable Care Act. Many of those people will find they have even better options in the exchanges, and at better prices. But even the small percentage of folks who find themselves paying more for insurance should be seen in the broader context of health care and insurance costs that were already skyrocketing out of control, for all of us, before Obamacare was passed. CHART 3: About those canceled plans . Finally, yes, Obama will implement an administrative fix so people can keep their lousy insurance plans for another year if they want to. But insurance companies will now be required to tell people they have other (and in many cases, probably better) options in the new exchanges. This will hopefully stop the practice of insurance companies trying to trick people with canceled plans into buying much more expensive new plans from the same company rather than shopping around. But it will likely not stop Republican finger-pointing and accusations that President Obama lied. No matter that Obama apologized for the promise that people who liked their insurance plans could keep them, tried to clarify the situation and is implementing a fix in fulfillment of that pledge. But wait, aren't Republicans the ones who came up with death panels and keep asserting that lie even though it was not only disproven but also called the ""lie of the year"" by PolitiFact?  To make the point that Republicans really shouldn't be pointing fingers in the lie department, Steve Benen came up with this chart to put this into perspective: . So here's where this leaves us: Not enough people have signed up for Obamacare yet, but there's still plenty of time; enrollment was slow when Massachusetts did this, too. And the administrative fix announced on Thursday will, incidentally, ease the transition period to new plans while probably keeping enrollment numbers even lower since people can now keep their current plans an extra year. Meanwhile, even a slow and clunky Obamacare rollout is better than the runaway health care costs and millions of uninsured Americans we had before Obamacare. Republicans should stop trying to sabotage the law. Obamacare is slowly but steadily rising over the obstacles of our broken insurance status-quo -- and destructive Republicans. When Obamacare is finally, fully implemented, our families, our health care system and our economy will all be better off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: Obama's fix on cancelled health plan lets us refocus on implementation .
She says enrollment numbers lagging, but recall, Romneycare signups slow too .

"(CNN) -- Every day, more than 500 ships from all corners of the globe set out to navigate the bustling waters of the English Channel. Huge merchant vessels carrying every category of cargo imaginable -- from iron ore to wheat, and from crude oil to sugar -- sail amongst fishing vessels, passenger ferries, pleasure craft and more unorthodox traffic such as swimmers. Keeping this narrow body of water that separates England and France clear is vital for a wide range of economic as well as recreational travel purposes. See also: Introducing the world's biggest ship . But as passenger and cargo vessels become longer, wider and more frequent, ensuring a smooth passageway in a straight just 34 kilometers (21 miles) across at its shortest navigable point has come to represent a considerable logistical challenge. ""It is the busiest shipping lane in the world,"" explained senior watch manager of the Dover coastguard, Tony Evans."" And this is not including small pleasure craft (and) motorboats."" ""Today we have 12 attempts at swimming the Channel. Obviously that has some bearing on the traffic in the fact that vessels may need to take action to avoid them,"" he added. Sailing safe seas . Given the waterway's strategic importance, it is perhaps little surprise that the English Channel has long been at the vanguard of maritime planning and safety. The world's first sea-traffic separation scheme was set up here in 1972 creating two lanes of traffic that ships must follow to avoid collisions. Vessels traveling north have to use the French side, whilst the English lane is used for those traveling south. The basic premise of this system still exists today. See also: Can Danube boost European trade? Further lanes that dictate the flow of traffic from east and west -- east towards the North Sea and ports in Northern Europe and west towards the Atlantic Ocean -- have also been formed on both the English and French sides of the Channel (see traffic movement in video below). Today these routes are regularly plied by some of the biggest cargo ships on earth, including the recently launched Maersk Triple E which at 400 meters long is the world's largest operational vessel. Coastguard duties . According to Kaimes Beasley of the Dover based Channel Navigation Information Service, such high-value ships passing through the Channel mean coastguards in both England and France must be more organized and vigilant than ever before. ""The nature of the vessel traffic over the years has become significantly larger,"" Beasley explained. ""The navigational challenges remain the same, (in terms of topography, sandbanks and congestion). It is the job of the officers on watch of the vessels to make sure they navigate safely."" See also: Eight of the world's biggest infrastructure projects . To help with their daily duties, officers can call on a range of state-of-the-art tools to help direct and monitor maritime traffic. Detailed radar screens provide a real-time snapshot of all ships on the channel at any given moment. Automated Identification Systems (AIS) meanwhile present information on the larger vessels in the area, such as their size, name, course, destination and traveling speed. All vessels that weigh over 300 tons are automatically tracked by satellite. A captain's view . For those at sea, these hi-tech systems and services offer valuable guidance as well as reassurance. Many ships have similar access to AIS systems ensuring they are aware of what is around them at all times. ""The ships have got much larger and therefore ... the technology has had to increase to match it,"" explained David Miller, senior captain of the Spirit of Britain passenger ferry. ""The basic concept of seamanship has been replaced by integrated electronic systems,"" he added. Silk Road railways link Asia and Europe . But while such advanced technology has been a welcome development, Miller also points out the fundamental rules that govern movement on the Channel remain the same. ""The rules of the road are there for us all to obey them and if there is a risk of a collision we will follow (them),"" Miller said. ""As long as everybody observes (these) rules then there's room for us all.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are many superficial similarities between the worlds of the military and business, something Captain Robert M. Secher of the U.S. Marines knew only too well. U.S. Marines on an operation in Iraq. Secher was one of the instigators of the so-called Quantico Leadership Venture, an innovative cooperation between the Marine Corps' Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia, and the University of Pennsylvania's top-rated Wharton School of Business. The outdoor-based course, intended to show Wharton students how Marine-style leadership principles and teamwork can help in business, has proved enormously popular. Tragically, Secher can no longer appreciate the success of his initiative -- a year ago, while serving in Iraq he was killed by a sniper's bullet in Anbar province, in the west of the country. He was aged 33. Wharton has decided to give something back in appreciation of Secher and has just announced a new scholarship in his honor. The Captain Robert M. Secher Scholarship will allow one Marine Corps officer per year take a Wharton Executive Education course, something that would normally cost many thousands of dollars. Secher's parents attended the ceremony where officials announced the new scholarship. ""We are proud that he did such a good job and that he will be remembered,"" said his mother, Elke Morris. More than 1,000 Wharton MBA students have taken part in the Quantico Leadership Venture since it was set up eight years ago. Such is the program's popularity that each year more than 500 students apply for the 180 spaces available. ""Our partnership with the USMC (U.S. Marine Corps) and Officer Candidate School has greatly benefited our students and the USMC, with Marine officers participating every year in our leadership conference"" said Jeff Klein, director of the Wharton Graduate Leadership Program. ""To say that the investment both Capt. Secher and the Marines have made in our students is unparalleled would be an understatement."" The courts focuses on the Marine Corps' ""values of honor, courage, and commitment,"" said Klein. ""Courage, we say, is about making a difference, and we're proud to honor Capt. Secher and the USMC for making a difference with our students and in the world."" While Secher's links with the business education world were closer than most, his contribution in combining the military and commercial worlds is not unique. For example, the UK's Cranfield Business School has recently begun running a specialist MBA for senior military officers in association with the British military's own leadership college. Closer to Secher, fellow Marine Captain Erik Orient - who attended the announcement about the new scholarship - mused on the subject in Wharton's Leadership Digest journal. Until recently, he admitted, ""I thought the Corps had cornered the market on leadership [and] any leadership civilians did was merely 'management'."" He added: ""But as I began to encounter more academic and business professionals through my teaching work, I became more introspective, reevaluating my own leadership style.""

"(CNN) -- People have been crying for days. Thousands have left messages, seeking to understand this tragedy. Messages like, ""I never felt so empty and cried so much for someone I didn't know personally."" Marco Simoncelli was not just one of Italy's most promising motorcycling stars, he brought sunshine into a hard world, in hard times. And that's what makes his death at a race in Malaysia last weekend, at the age of only 24, so hard to bear. ""Someone says that God calls the best ones first; maybe that's why he had to go,"" said his father Paolo, before breaking into tears. It was one of the few times his father has cried. He gave a long television interview showing Marco's room -- that of a teenager not of a world championship rider, with posters of his hero Valentino Rossi still on the wall. After the crash at the Malaysia MotoGP in Kuala Lumpur where his son died, Paolo Simoncelli spoke a lot. Unexpectedly, he thanked everyone -- those who helped Marco, the journalists, the thousands of fans queuing in the rain for a last farewell. His father is dying inside, and we should be comforting him, but instead we wait for his words to try to comfort ourselves. He has every reason to be upset, but instead he talks to us serenely, thanking life for giving him such a shining son. Paolo tells us how positive Marco was to everyone, ""and that he was beautiful even when I saw him dead."" This is another gift we get from Marco Simoncelli -- joyful, smiling, happy when alive -- and now his family are still inspiring us to love life even when anger would be justified. Kate Fretti has been Marco's girlfriend since 2006. It's known that motorsport offers lots of ""fun'"" for drivers. Marco once said: ""Lots of girls come close, it would be so easy ... But I feel good with Kate, why would I mess everything up?"" They were building their house. Not the one of a millionaire. It is right beside Marco's parents' house, with a huge table to have dinner with all their friends. Despite all his money, they were a normal boy and girl of our times, trying to make their way. ""Marco didn't give a damn about money,"" Paolo Simoncelli said. ""He used to say: 'Can we buy food without looking at the price? So we are rich."" He had a unique talent for expressing his emotions on a bike. He was very open to the world, even if it sometimes landed him in trouble. Back in May, after being heavily accused by Spanish press and riders of causing Dani Pedrosa to crash and break his collarbone, several death threats were addressed to Simoncelli from Spain ahead of the Catalunyan GP. At first, his Honda team and his family hid those threats from him, knowing they would shock his sensitivity. A few days before traveling to Barcelona, they revealed what was going on at a dinner. Marco was scared, but most of all staggered. His girlfriend said that, while listening to his father, Marco reduced the wine cork he was holding into tiny pieces. He kept on repeating: ""Why do they threaten me? What I have done wrong?"" While a public figure might usually dismiss those threats as from some maniac, Marco instead questioned himself. He couldn't understand why this could happen. But he was not only a genuine guy, he was also a formidable rider. Valentino Rossi is the legend, while Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo are the leading lights now. But maybe nobody, not even Valentino, has the sense for overtaking and for going over the limit like Simoncelli. That's why he was so criticized during his battle with the Spanish riders. But the same things were said 30 years ago to Gilles Villeneuve and 25 years ago to another Formula One star, Ayrton Senna. ""He is dangerous, he is crazy, someone will soon be hurt,"" they said of Simoncelli. But Simoncelli was a real racer -- and that means overtaking. Carlo Pernat, his manager and a significant figure in the world of MotoGP racing, described him as: ""A driver not of this time, from an era where racing meant trying every second to go past your rival."" Obviously, a rider like this made his rivals nervous. Seven-time world champion Rossi, who loved Simoncelli as a brother, explains it best: ""Having a duel one-vs-one with Marco, it's like if you're going to have a punch against a huge guy: you already know you will always be the one beaten up."" Italy had a gem, a pure talent with a pure soul. That's why the tears can't stop. His mother Rossella was at home at Coriano, Rimini, when Marco died. A couple of hours after his death, some of his friends gathered outside the house, crying together. She walked out, the greatest pain inside her but dignity on her face, and told them: ""No guys, stop crying. Marco would be so sad to see you fall apart. You always laughed with him, just remember the good times you had together."" Marco Simoncelli is unique for us because -- despite how Italians feel aggrieved by his fate -- when we see him again on TV, when his interviews are replayed, we can't help but laugh. He was the hilarious cousin always in a good mood, the one you were looking forward to spend time. Funny, mamma mia, so funny. He was our ""Super Goof."" Would you ever imagine a celebrity saying this: ""When I wake up early, for example when I have jet-lag, I run to jump in the bed of my parents while they sleep. I'm crazy for that."" His nickname was actually ""Super Sic."" And now his last farewell has been given, bikes escorted his coffin to the church, and 60,000 people attended his funeral on Thursday. It was broadcast live by three Italian channels, while in some cities thousands of bikes gathered for a parade ended by loud roars in his honor. Spanish fans plan to go to 2011's final MotoGP race in Valencia next weekend with thousands of curly bushy wigs like his hair. The best way to say goodbye is remember him with his own words. Words of a kid who was always surprised by the world, and made us smile so much (see picture gallery above).","Funeral of Italian motorcyclist Marco Simoncelli held in his hometown Coriano on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- This week we mark Constitution Day, commemorating the electrifying moment on September 17, 1787 when the Philadelphia framers went public with their proposed Constitution. Over the ensuing year, Americans debated and ratified this audacious plan, and thereby gave birth to a far better world. Let's recall the central features of that year that changed everything so that we can measure how far we have come, and how far we still need to go, to redeem the Constitution's promise. After its public unveiling in mid-September, the Philadelphia plan was put to a vote across the continent, in a process that let vastly more ordinary folk than ever before in human history decide how they would be governed. In most states, standard property qualifications were lowered or eliminated for this special ratification election. New York, for the first time in its history, let all adult free male citizens vote -- no property qualifications, no race tests, no religious qualifications, no literacy tests -- for ratifying-convention delegates who in turn voted yes on the Constitution several months later. Later generations have nobly built upon this foundation, repeatedly adding the words ""the right to vote"" in a grand colonnade of amendments promising a permanent end to all sorts of electoral discrimination and exclusions. That's undeniable progress. But America no longer leads the world in the integrity and inclusiveness of our elections; several states are now shamelessly trying to roll back voting rights; the Supreme Court has renounced a key piece of the landmark Voting Rights Act; and Congress has yet to mend the tattered statute. Modern American free speech is a happier story, with robust free expression in almost every corner of the land. Here, too, we have 1787-88 to thank, a year when Americans dramatically embodied free speech in the very process of establishing the Constitution. No one was censored that year, and the document's opponents were not forever demonized or voted off the island. In fact, several of the Constitution's early critics came to rank among the new nation's highest leaders -- for example, President James Monroe, Vice Presidents George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry, and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The two camps that had sharply divided over the Constitution's ratification -- the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists -- soon thereafter found common ground in supporting a Bill of Rights. Is it too much to hope that today's polarized parties might learn something from this inspiring example, and try to find something -- anything! -- that they can agree upon? Perhaps because the Constitution's supporters did not try to muzzle skeptics, these skeptics, when outvoted, acquiesced. In several states, the document squeaked through only by the narrowest of margins -- for example, 30 to 27 in New York. Yet everyone accepted the basic principle of majority rule, even though the document itself did not explicitly specify this voting rule. Here, too, there are lessons for today. The entrenched filibuster has made the current Senate a deeply dysfunctional body, yet some senators seem to think that a supermajority-rule system has deep roots in founding principles and practices. These senators are mistaken. The early Senate followed the principles of 1787-88, and the key principle that year in every single state ratifying convention was simple majority rule. Everyone got to speak; and then votes ensued, and simple majorities prevailed. Period. Finally, let's note the extraordinary religious inclusion championed by the document first unveiled in mid-September 1787. Unlike most revolutionary state constitutions and the contemporaneous rules generally in place elsewhere on the planet, the Constitution opened its doors to office seekers of all faiths and philosophies. Last year, three of the four men atop the major party tickets -- Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Joe Biden -- were not members of the mainstream Protestant churches that dominated society at the founding. Today's speaker of the House is a Catholic, the Senate majority leader is a Mormon, and no Protestant sits on the current U.S. Supreme Court. One is tempted to say, ""only in America!"" but in fact there are other modern countries that are democratic and religiously pluralist. However, many of these democracies have been powerfully influenced by the American constitutional experience. Before the Constitution went public in 1787, pluralistic democracy existed almost nowhere on the planet, outside America. Thus it had always been throughout recorded history. Today, constitutional self-government reigns across half the globe, and it does so thanks largely to the legal, political, cultural, moral and military success of the American constitutional project. In short, the world is becoming more American (and America itself, thanks to trade and immigration, is becoming more global). So we should not say ""only in America,"" but rather ""only because of America"" -- and in particular, because of America's Constitution and because of the year that changed everything. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Akhil Amar.","This week marks the anniversary of the unveiling of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 .

"(CNN) -- A heavy police presence in Bahrain on Sunday limited marches by protesters organized to coincide with the controversial Formula One race in the kingdom, won by world champion Sebastian Vettel. Tensions in Bahrain remain high following the 2011 uprising, in which the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority. Some of the marches called for by anti-government protest leaders took place, but others were thwarted as police stormed the areas where protesters were gathering. Smoke poured from burning tires in many villages around the capital, Manama, that are home to the majority Shiite community. Witnesses reported arrests early Sunday at a high school in Zinj, a suburb of the capital, Manama, between hundreds of student protesters and police. See: Latest F1 standings and race result . Police raids were reported in some areas overnight, apparently as part of a crackdown by authorities to ensure calm ahead of the Grand Prix. Red Bull driver Vettel claimed his second win of the season in the 57-lap race, after starting at No. 2 on the grid, as he moved 10 points clear of Kimi Raikkonen in the championship standings. Raikkonen came in second for Lotus ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean in a repeat of the podium placings from last year's race. Two female protesters were arrested at the Sakhir desert track Saturday for chanting slogans as the practice and qualifying rounds were held. A TV crew from British broadcaster ITV News was ordered to leave the kingdom Friday ""as they reported on the violent clashes taking place in the buildup to the Grand Prix,"" ITV News said. Bahrain's state news agency said the ITV News team had visas to enter the country but ""insisted on violating laws and regulations governing the work of the media."" It stated that the kingdom was committed to an open-door policy regarding the media, including ""openness, transparency, disclosure of the facts."" Maj. Gen. Tariq Hassan Al-Hassan, Bahrain's public security chief, said meticulous planning had gone into the event, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday. ""Police are out in force to beef up security measures at the Bahrain International Circuit,"" he is quoted as saying. Security forces across the country are ""undertaking pre-emptive and precautionary measures"" to ensure people's safety and protect public and private property, he said. Human Rights Watch warned Thursday of ""the risk that the Bahraini authorities will use repressive measures to close down the protests."" The rights group also criticized the international racing bodies responsible for organizing the race, saying they ""have taken no steps to address human rights abuses that appear to be directly linked to the event."" The rights group reported earlier this month that Bahraini security forces had raided homes and arbitrarily detained a number of prominent anti-government protest leaders. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled after drivers, including former Formula One star Damon Hill, raised concerns after the death of at least 35 demonstrators in a clampdown on unrest. Last year, opposition calls for large protests raised fears that the Bahrain Grand Prix would have to be canceled for a second year running and pose a threat to car crews, workers and fans. But the race went ahead even as nearby streets were blocked with burning tires and trash. Anti-government protesters had labeled the race a publicity stunt by the country's rulers to make the nation appear more unified. Despite fresh protests in the run-up to this year's event, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the sport's regulator, and Formula One Management, the commercial rights holders for the sport, insisted the race would take place as planned. ""The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Formula One Management (FOM) wish to jointly confirm their belief that the Bahrain GP should go ahead this weekend,"" the two bodies said in a statement. ""The FIA and FOM also strongly believe that sport can often be a force for good and that the staging of the Grand Prix in Bahrain will come some way in helping soothe some of the issues which have been raised in the media."" While protesters have used the race as an opportunity to bring global attention to their struggle, the Bahrain government insists the event will bring long-term benefits to its people. ""F1 brings significant benefits to everyone in Bahrain, especially economically,"" the government said in a statement. ""Bahrain upholds the right to peaceful protest. It is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development. ""This is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way."" Security forces only respond when ""protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence,"" it said, and they use appropriate restraint. ""Some unfortunately believe that continued unrest on the streets affords them a political advantage, when it results in greater divisions between communities in Bahrain. Violence can never be tolerated."" The protests in Bahrain started in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the demonstrations failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Formula One racing is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million, though the scenes last year in Bahrain were viewed as a public relations disaster for both the sport and the country's authorities. Canceling the race in 2011 cost Bahrain from $480 million to $800 million in potential investments, according to estimates. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Frederik Pleitgen, Salma Abdelaziz, John Sinnott, Caroline Faraj and Schams Elwazer contributed to this report.","NEW: Clashes between police and protesters were limited amid a heavy police presence .

"(CNN) -- Just a week ago Victor Dubuisson was little known aside from the most ardent golf fan, but then came victory in the Turkish Airlines Open, beating Tiger Woods and a clutch of big names and now the 23-year-old Frenchman is firmly in the hunt for an even bigger prize. Saturday saw Dubuisson move to within one shot of leader Henrik Stenson at the World Tour Championship in Dubai with a stunning eight-under 64, including 11 birdies, one short of the European Tour record. Dubuisson has carded 52 birdies in his last seven rounds of competitive golf and aims to carry on that form into the final day on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates. ""I am very confident about tomorrow. I will try to do my best. And you know, sometimes it goes your way, sometimes not, but I will do the same as today and the first two rounds,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I'm very happy to play with Henrik tomorrow... he's a great guy and he's the best player of the year, so I'm very excited."" Swede Stenson, who can become the first man to win the European Tour's Race to Dubai and the FedEx Cup on the PGA Tour in the same season, knows he is in for a fight on the final day. ""Victor is playing incredible golf at the moment. I kept hearing that I was the hottest player in the world, but I think he's just jumped up and grabbed that title the last two weeks, winning last week and then shooting the score that he did today. "" Stenson is also being chased for overall honors by England's Ian Poulter, who carded a 66, but is four behind in third place. He drew level with his Florida neighbor on the back nine of the third round, but Stenson finished with four birdies in the last five holes to open up a significant advantage as he closed with a 67 for 17-under overall. ""I caught him today and I'll catch him tomorrow, it's whether or not I can keep hold of him,"" Poulter told the official European Tour website. A win for Poulter would mean Stenson would have to finish second to claim the Harry Vardon trophy, but the 37-year-old is not thinking that way. ""I am trying to avoid all that,"" he said. ""I know I can win The Race to Dubai even if I don't win here, but why not try my hardest to win this tournament? If I do I know that both trophies are coming home with me,"" he added. U.S. Open champions present and past, Justin Rose and Graeme McDowell, can also still deny Stenson the title with victory in Dubai, but at 11 under and eight under after both shot rounds of 68, it is an unlikely permutation. So can the man of the moment Dubuisson, but he would have to lift the trophy and see Stenson crumble to finish outside the top 30. But he has moved into the top 50 in the world and made a strong start to claim a place in the European Ryder Cup team next year at Gleneagles.","Henrik Stenson remains in lead in World Tour Championship in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man is facing several drug charges after he mistakenly texted a police officer to set up a drug sale, police said Tuesday in a news release. According to the Township of Sparta Police Department, Nicholas Delear Jr. sent a text last week boasting about marijuana he had for sale to a number that just happened to belong to the 10-year-old son of Lt. Eric Danielson. Danielson, who works for the nearby Andover Township Police Department in the northwestern part of the sate, stepped in and began texting Delear to set up a sting, according to police. ""I read the text message, and I was intrigued,"" Danielson said. ""So we attempted to pretend to be who he thought he was texting."" The exchange occurred on Friday, police said. Delear arrived at a pizzeria later that evening where Danielson had arranged to meet him in their texts, police said. Soon afterward, Delear was swarmed by police and placed under arrest, they said. Police said they found more than 4 ounces of marijuana on Delear, a digital pocket scale and $620 in cash. Delear, who is 33 and resides in Sussex, New Jersey, is facing numerous charges, according to the Sparta police: . -- Possession with intent to distribute marijuana. -- Possession of drug paraphernalia. -- Possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle. -- Several motor vehicle infractions. He was released Saturday on his own recognizance and is due in court later this month.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has arrested an Iranian-born man, accusing him of spying for Tehran. He was carrying photos of various sites, including the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, the Israeli government said Sunday. The announcement came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to the United States to address the United Nations General Assembly and meet with U.S. President Barack Obama. Netanyahu has been outspokenly wary of Iran's apparent efforts to improve relations with the West. ""I will tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk and the onslaught of smiles,"" he said Saturday, in the wake of last week's speech at the U.N. by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. According to a news release Sunday from the Israeli government, Ali Mansouri, a native of Iran who has also lived in Belgium, was arrested September 11 at Ben Gurion Airport as he was leaving Israel. He was traveling under the name Alex Mans, the statement said. ""He gave full details about the men that directed him and said they told him to cover up his visits to Iran, after he had been in Israel, where he reported to his directives and received instructions from them. His operatives hoped his Belgium identity would help him get around the security check at the airport,"" the statement said. Israel accused Mansouri of working for a special unit of the elite Quds Force. He was plotting to set up a spy network in Israel under the guise of a businessman who marketed services to restaurants and stores, the statement said. Mansouri was promised $1 million, the Israeli government said. An attorney for Mansouri told CNN his situation ""is more complicated than what was introduced by the (Israeli General Security Service)."" ""He didn't have any intention to harm Israel and also he doesn't have any anti-Israeli agenda or pro-Iranian agenda,"" said attorney Michal Orkavi. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said the ministry would comment once it finished its investigation into the matter. A U.S. State Department official, speaking on background, said Washington was aware of the report, but referred CNN to the Israeli government. Mansouri became a Belgian citizen in 2006, the Israeli government said. They allege he was recruited to become a spy for Iran in 2012. Rouhani spoke last week at the United Nations on his country's nuclear program, saying Iran is prepared to engage in talks and nuclear weapons have no place in his country's defense structure. Netanyahu said then that his country ""will not be fooled by half-measures that merely provide a smokescreen for Iran's continual pursuit of nuclear weapons.""

"(CNN) -- And here we were expecting a slice of key lime pie. Google has surprised the tech world by announcing that the next version of Android, its mobile operating system, will be named KitKat -- in honor of the candy bar developers munched on while they were creating it. ""We couldn't imagine a better name for our Android K release than the tasty chocolate that's been a favorite among the team since the early days of Android,"" said Marc Vanlerberghe, Google's marketing director for Android. The name keeps with a Google tradition, established in 2009, of naming versions of the industry-leading system after sweet treats. But it's the first time one of the nicknames has been a trademarked product and, as such, KitKat maker Nestle was needed to sign on. The Swiss food and drink maker did -- and in a big way. More than 50 million KitKat bars, specially branded with Google's green Android robot on their packaging, will be released, giving customers a chance to win prizes that include a Nexus 7 tablet and credits to the Google Play store. A small number of robot-shaped KitKats will also be shipped as surprises for customers. The company also got in on the act with its KitKat website, which has been overhauled to look like the site of a tech company rolling out a sleek new piece of electronics. That includes an earnest promotional video that could easily be read as a swipe at Apple, Google's chief mobile rival. ""Every corner, every edge, every finger of every bar has been carefully considered and crafted to create a beautifully immersive and multisensory experience,"" Chris Caitlin, Kit Kat's ""chief breaks officer"" says earnestly over a swelling orchestral arrangement not unlike the ones Apple uses to build excitement for new products. If there's any remaining doubt, the slogan ""There's a KitKat for that"" appears briefly on a tablet screen in the video. John Lagerling, director of Android global partnerships, told the BBC that the Nestle deal is ""not a money-changing-hands kind of deal,"" but was dreamed up by developers who kept KitKats, along with other snacks, in their break room while coding. He said the Android team didn't even know which company owned KitKat and that he cold-called the switchboard of Nestle's advertising agency in November to float the idea. The next day he was on a conference call, and the deal was sealed 24 hours later. To maintain the element of surprise -- an increasingly tough ask for big tech companies whose every move is scrutinized -- the Android team continued, even internally, calling the upcoming system ""Key Lime Pie,"" which had been the presumed name for months. Android has been developed by the company's engineers under dessert names ever since the release of Android Cupcake in 2009. The other iterations have been named Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich and Jellybean. Google is not the only tech company to name its products along a consistent theme. But Apple appears to have recently abandoned a similar practice with its Mac operating system -- OS X. In a departure, Apple's next Mac operating system will not be named after a cat. Instead, the 10th iteration of OS X will be called Mavericks, named for a popular surfing spot in Northern California. Previous version names have included Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, Tiger, Lion and Cheetah. A joint statement from Google and Nestle did not give a release date for Android KitKat, although some observers expect it to be launched this fall.","New version of Android mobile operating system will be named KitKat .

"(CNN) -- Something looked a little different on Monday night's 17th season premiere of ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars."" For one thing, the dancers and celebrities entered the stage on a red carpet set up just outside the studio, and then took their seats next to the judges' table on stage. What used to be an upstairs ""luxury box"" for teams is now a ""practice room"" for last-minute preparation, and some couples had prerecorded music to use along with live band performances. That, and the judges have moved from one side of the stage to the other -- or, as host Tom Bergeron called it, ""English style."" But the more things change, the more they stayed the same on ""DWTS,"" and the 12 teams brought their ""A"" games to the dance floor, to the delight of the audience. For ""Glee"" actress Amber Riley, Monday's premiere brought tremendous praise from the judges and a 27 out of 30 for her cha-cha. Riley's 27 is three points better than ""silver medalists"" Corbin Bleu and Elizabeth Berkley, each of whom earned a 24 with a contemporary dance. Fan favorite Valerie Harper also got off to a strong start thanks to a simple, classy foxtrot that earned her a 21 and a lengthy standing ovation from the audience. The actress proved to be quite nimble on the dance floor, so she could surprise in the coming weeks. The news wasn't as good for ""Science Guy"" Bill Nye, whose extremely awkward cha-cha, set to the theme song from ""Weird Science,"" garnered a 14 from the judges, including a 4 from resident malcontent Len Goodman. Nye stands in last place, three points behind football great Keyshawn Johnson, but the TV personality has no regrets. ""People don't regret what they do,"" Nye told CNN's Nischelle Turner backstage. ""They regret what they don't do."" His statement would get a hearty ""hear, hear!"" from Harper, who told CNN that she was focused on living life to the fullest with her new opportunity. ""Everyone should find their joy where they can,"" the actress said. ""There's so much nonjoy that is out there, that it is suffocating us in a way. If we could get out of our mind and our ego and into our spirit, that's a great entree into life. (Don't) waste your time worrying about dying. Live!""

"(CNN) -- The boy who wrote a letter to Santa asking him to help stop bullies from picking on his twin sister has a lot of new friends now. Friends like actor and comedian Stephen Kramer Glickman, who plays the manager of a boy band on the Nickelodeon show ""Big Time Rush."" When Glickman heard about 8-year-old Ryan Suffern's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his sister was experiencing at school, he was touched by Ryan's efforts. ""When I saw this, it hit me and I was like I gotta get in touch with this family and try to reach out to these kids,"" he said. In his letter to Santa Ryan writes that he wanted a remote control car and helicopter, but adds : . ""I don't want that anymor. Kid at school are still picking on Amber and its not fair."" ""I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy and needs your help."" At the end of the letter, Ryan also asks if ""Big Time Rush"" could come to the twins' birthday party: . ""Can you ask Big Time Rush to come to Amber's B-day party It will make her so happy. If you can't get them to come ... just get her everything she ask for."" Glickman said he understands the terrors of bullying. He was an adventurous dresser and heavier, and shorter than the rest of his peers at an early age, he said, and was routinely picked on in seventh and eighth grade. The bullying got so bad that he had to drop out of junior high school, and was home-schooled, he said. Watch Stephen Kramer Glickman's video to Ryan and Amber . ""Kids were terrible to me when I was in school,"" he said. Glickman recorded a video and sent it into CNN iReport for the twins. In the video, he tells Ryan and Amber to remember all the friends they have now. He was not only referring to himself, but also the ""Big Time Rush"" Nickelodeon band who now knows about Ryan's letter. ""I can't give too much information, but I can say this. I think Christmas might come early this year,"" Glickman says in the video. The Nickelodeon star wasn't the only one to reach out to the family. After Ryan's letter to Santa went viral, the Sufferns were overwhelmed by the generosity of others. Karen Suffern, Ryan and Amber's mother, said she could not imagine such an outpouring of support from people. Many have reached out to her, looking to donate gifts and money to the family. ""I'm not comfortable with that, I don't want it turn out that it was all about money,"" she said. ""I've been telling people thanks for your support and your prayers."" When she first shared the letter online with friends and people like blogger Tony Posnanski -- who first posted Ryan's letter onto CNN iReport where it gained thousands of views and shares -- she just wanted to spread awareness of bullying. Suffern flew up to New York on Wednesday to share her story with ""Good Morning America"" and has been contacted by ""Dr. Phil"" and the ""Today Show."" Suffern isn't used to all the attention, but she said the experience has humbled her and showed her the positive side of people. Even the twins are seeing some changes at school. Ryan knows something is happening, Suffern said, ""because when they went to school yesterday, he said 'Mommy, I have new friends.' "" ""Other people said they're going to help look out for Amber too, and make sure they don't mess with her. I thought that was so sweet,"" Suffern said. She said at first Ryan was embarrassed by all the attention, and even Amber was oblivious. ""She had no idea what was going on until she talked to the 'Good Morning America' producer,"" Suffern said. ""She didn't know Ryan wrote the letter.""","8-year-old Ryan wrote a letter to Santa after seeing his sister being bullied at school .

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy will stand trial on charges of incitement to conduct murder and ""thuggery"" relating to clashes near the presidential palace in December, state-run MENA reported Sunday. The country's general prosecutor ordered Morsy to stand trial along with 14 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the news agency said. No date was given for the trial. The charges stem from when pro- and anti-Morsy protesters clashed outside the presidential palace in early December. Demonstrators were protesting his then-recent edict granting himself sweeping powers and a proposed constitution -- drafted by an Islamist-dominated council -- that they feared would give him even more power. After Morsy supporters chased protesters from the grounds, both sides threw rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. At least 10 people were killed, according to the semiofficial al-Ahram newspaper. Citing investigators, it said that Morsy and his staff are accused of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry reportedly refused to do it. Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest over his rule, has been held in detention since early July. Egypt has been in turmoil since then, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. Each side blames the other for stoking the violence. Last month, about 900 people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. The deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo. Morsy was elected after longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak was toppled. Mubarak appeared in court last week as his retrial resumed on charges involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the popular 2011 uprising that led to his ouster. Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but he appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial. A court ordered Mubarak released last month and placed under house arrest. GPS: Have crimes against humanity been committed in Egypt?

"Washington (CNN) -- Jeffrey Chafin calls his daughter, Eris, ""my sparkle."" He says ""she's everything for me, she's phenomenal, she's my life."" Lynne Hales Chafin says the 5-year-old is ""quite happy"" living life with her as the custodial parent. What the estranged couple has to say about each other is not so cordial. Their custody fight is many ways a typical ""he-said, she-said"" dispute, but because it has been waged across international borders, the U.S. Supreme Court is now involved. The case of Chafin v. Chafin will be heard by the justices on Wednesday and an eventual ruling could establish an important precedent on the discretion of American courts to decide where children caught in parental fights should stay. In the middle is Eris, the girl who lives in Scotland with her mother. Her dad is an Army sergeant based at Ft. Stewart, Georgia. A federal court said under international treaty, Eris should remain overseas since it was her ""habitual residence."" That court also said the custody issue was moot since the girl was already overseas. Jeff Chafin eventually asked the justices to intervene on his behalf. ""I don't believe that (the current legal fight) is in the best interest of the child as it's going to go on for years and years to come,"" Lynne Chafin told CNN. Jeff Chafin wants to revive his claim of Eris' custody, arguing the child's normal place of residence is the United States. ""I told my little girl I would do everything I could to get her,"" he told CNN National Correspondent Joe Johns, ""to make sure she's safe."" He last visited his daughter overseas in July. The couple met in 2006 in Germany, where Jeff was stationed. Eris was born there the following year. It was while the father was deployed to Afghanistan for 15 months that the personal and legal troubles escalated. Lynne claims it was agreed she would stay with the child in Scotland as the de facto ""habitual residence"" while Jeff served in combat. U.S. courts later established that residency to conclude the child belonged with her mother. ""This is the heart of this treaty. The whole treaty turns on these two words -- 'habitual residence.' What is the ordinary, regular home of this little girl?"" said Stephen Cullen, Lynne Chafin's attorney. ""It has to be Scotland because the last time they ever agreed on anything was their agreement that Scotland was the child's home."" Upon Jeff's return from Afghanistan to Germany, the couple separated, then made various attempts at reconciliation. He was transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Lynne soon followed with Eris. But the domestic situation did not improve and the custody fights eventually played out there. Jeff Chafin and his supporters say the child was happy in the United States, ""fully engaged and immersed in her American community."" More importantly from a legal perspective, his lawyers argue his wife was fully committed to staying in the United States as a resident. But the relationship deteriorated and divorce proceedings began. Lynne Chafin said she wanted to leave with their daughter. That's when she said her husband called the police. ""I was removed from the house. I was taken to jail,"" she said. When police checked her status on a tourist visa, ""an immigration officer came out to see me. And he advised me that because my green card was still in the process, that I was actually there illegally and I would be deported."" It was after Lynne Chafin was sent out of the country without her daughter that she filed a ""Petition for Return of Child to Scotland"" under the 1980 Hague Convention's Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It grants parents in general a ""right of custody"" and a separate ""right of access,"" ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others. More than 80 nations are a party to the treaty, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Lynne Chafin did not see Eris for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in Alabama. She was allowed to return to the United States on a special visa just long enough to have a federal judge rule in her favor, allowing her to take Eris back to Scotland where they remain. ""I would like the Supreme Court to say that my case is moot,"" she said from her home. ""If they don't, if they rule in my husband's favor and he is allowed to appeal then this is going to go on for years which is ludicrous. None of us will be able to move on with our lives, we're stuck in this constant state of appeals, appeals, appeals."" But Jeff Chafin and his lawyers say the federal courts are at odds over what judges can and cannot do over the ""habitual residence"" question. They say in this case the full appeals process was not allowed to continue, denying the father his due process rights. ""The phrase miscarriage of justice comes to mind,"" said Michael Manely, the father's attorney. ""The other side's position is once a child leaves the boundaries of the United States, it's over. There is nothing you can do about it. And that has terrifying consequences."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor has unusual experience with this issue. As a federal judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, she dissented from a decision that she said too narrowly interpreted the impact of a custody order. She wrote in 2000 that the Hague Convention must have power to enforce a custody order that ""by its very nature limits each parent's unilateral decision-making power, including his or her power to relocate to another country with the child."" In an unrelated 2010 high court case, Justice Sotomayor succinctly summarized the delicate balancing courts around the world must maintain. ""The purpose of the convention is, which court will decide the life of that child,"" she said. ""And to avoid, as I understood the convention structure, this flight from court to court and this long, drawn-out process from country to country over who's going to make that choice."" Both sides agree clarity on the issue is needed, if not for them, then for other parents in similar situations. ""Ultimately what's at the heart of the treaty is the welfare of the child,"" said Cullen. ""And it's not good for a child to be like a ping pong ball going backwards and forwards between different countries. And that's why the treaty solves a problem."" As for the Chafins -- still technically married but apparently never again to be husband and wife -- both share a measure of regret over their broken union and a child caught in the middle, as well as anxiety over what the high court will do. ""I believe that if my daughter's returned to the U.S., I will never see her again,"" said Lynne Chafin, who said this fight is about Eris' future and well-being. Jeff Chafin is equally determined. ""I'm going as far as I can. Until I humanly, possibly cannot go any further, I will not stop fighting for my daughter."" The case is Chafin v. Chafin (11-1347). A ruling is expected by the spring.

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's odds of holding power ""are slipping away"" as the nearly 2-year-old revolt against his rule grinds on, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says. In an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" Medvedev distanced Moscow from its longtime Middle East client. But he repeated Russia's longtime insistence that outside powers shouldn't be picking Syria's leaders. Official: Russia invites head of Syrian opposition for talks . ""From the outset, the Russian Federation was not an exclusive ally of Syria or President Assad,"" Medvedev said. ""We used to have good relations with him and his father, but he had much closer allies among the Europeans."" Russia has ""never said that our goal was to preserve the current political regime, or making sure that President Assad stays in power,"" he added. ""That decision has to be made by the Syrian people."" Opinion: Why Russia protects Syria's Assad . It's the latest in a series of grim assessments of al-Assad's chances from Russia, which has been Syria's leading arms supplier since the days of the Cold War. President Vladimir Putin said in December that Moscow won't support al-Assad ""at any cost,"" and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov noted a few days earlier that the Kremlin ""can't exclude a victory by the opposition."" Russia Analyst: Russia wouldn't resist intervention in Syria . When the Arab Spring revolts erupted across the region in early 2011, Syrians took to the streets to demonstrate against al-Assad's rule. The Syrian leader quickly responded with a crackdown by police and the army that soon exploded into a civil war. The United Nations says the conflict has now killed more than 60,000 people, and opposition activists said more than 100 were killed Sunday. Rebel forces -- many of them led by former soldiers, others by jihadists linked to the al Qaeda terrorist network -- are now regularly battling government troops in the capital, Damascus, and the country's commercial hub of Aleppo. Read more: Leaving Syria ship before it sinks? Medvedev said he blames both the opposition and al-Assad's government for refusing to negotiate. He said he personally lobbied al-Assad to open up his regime to reform and that his resistance was an ""important, if not fatal"" mistake. ""The chances for him surviving are slipping away as days and weeks go by,"" Medvedev told CNN. ""But once again, it should not be up to us. It should be up to the Syrian people."" Russia has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership. Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to take action to end the conflict and force al-Assad to step down. Medvedev spoke to CNN at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His comments contrasted with those of Jordan's King Abdullah II, who said Friday that al-Assad is not likely to fall for months. ""Anyone who says that Bashar's regime has got weeks to live really doesn't know the reality on the ground,"" he said during a panel appearance with Zakaria at the World Economic Forum. ""They still have capability. ... So (I expect) a strong showing for at least the first half of 2013."" But Medvedev warned that if al-Assad's rule is ""swept away"" by the revolt, the result could be a conflict among its successors that could last ""for decades."" Asked about concerns that jihadists could use a successful campaign in Syria to spread into southern Russia, where Islamic militant groups have been battling Moscow for more than a decade, he said that prospect should alarm the West as well. ""They can travel to Europe. They tried to. And in the U.S.,"" Medvedev said. ""So it is alarming for all of us. It does not mean, though, that we should bring to power radical opposition leaders. It should be a difficult process, led by civil society.""","Syria's al-Assad faces mounting odds as the revolt against him drags on, Medvedev says .

But Medvedev says Syrians, not outside powers, should choose the country's new leaders ."
"(CNN) -- Online, you can project whatever identity you like. But for some people, it's easier to have no identity at all. A new social networking site, Social Number, caters to those who have a preference for anonymity. Instead of a name or a handle or a thumbnail photo of themselves, users are identified only by a number. In this way, the site encourages users to discuss anything, from a bad job to a hot-button social issue to a substance-abuse problem, without fear that the conversation could be connected to their real-world identity. ""I had been feeling for a while that there were privacy issues with most social networking sites,"" said the site's creator, who gives his name only as M.K. ""I just felt that any time you search someone's name, it pops up in every different way, from Facebook and Twitter and everyplace else ... I just felt that there was one site needed where people could come and talk ... freely and not worry about who's going to read it and what's going to happen."" Social Number is just the latest volley in a longstanding debate surrounding anonymity on the Internet. It's an issue that encompasses online bullying, trolling and hoaxes like the one involving Notre Dame football star Manti Te'o. For every person pointing out the value in online anonymity, such as for political activists in nations where free speech is threatened, there are others who warn of its dangers. The controversial site 4chan, where anonymous users have been known to post offensive material, has long reveled in its anything-goes spirit. Other apps and sites geared toward the college-age crowd, such as Bored@Baker and Whisper, encourage anonymous posting, while a new app called Spraffl allows users to post anomymous location-based messages about local happenings. But social networks built on anonymity are still rare. Most of us see our online selves to be extensions of our real-world identities, and plenty of people hide their actual identity behind a username. But M.K. argues that using a unique number makes the cloak of anonymity that much more secure. As he told CNN, ""a number has no association with who you are."" Politics, religion and sex . M.K. said he created the site as a more private space for those seeking to express themselves freely without the baggage of their online persona. Social Number's community is still small: Since officially launching the site in mid-December, M.K estimates his membership is less than 10,000, with 50% to 70% of his users residing in the United States. Here's how it works: A user signs up with their e-mail address and date of birth (the site aims to restrict membership to those 18 and older) to get a number. Then a user is free to post ""expressions,"" almost like status updates, on any topic they'd like, or they can search for ""pals"" or ""groups"" that share their interests. Ideally, M.K. envisions the site operating like any other social network by fostering potential real-life connections for users. Social Number might remind you of a message board, with discussion threads on such topics as ""Is Atheism a Faith?"" and ""Discuss your bad bosses and suggestions on how to deal with them."" The majority of posts are text only, with few photos, videos or links. So far, most topics have been centered around politics, religion and sex, M.K. said. But he claims nobody has posted anything that's caused him to investigate or remove a user. ""As long as people are doing legal activity on the site, it's a freedom-of-speech issue,"" M.K. said of his content guidelines. (The lengthy terms of use on the site includes a ""general prohibitions"" section that lists restrictions against bullying, intimidating or harassing a user; posting content that is hate speech, pornographic or threatening; or that is otherwise illegal or promoting illegal activity.) Content posted to Social Number is monitored, but users are also instrumental in policing each other and alerting the site if they see offensive postings, M.K. said. ""I knew people would be using it for taboo topics like politics, government, or drug abuse, dating tips, sex and those types of things,"" he said. ""Which has happened, there have been a lot of groups created around that. But I've (also) seen a lot of innocent groups. There's a group on soccer and a group on cooking."" Avoiding being branded . Social Number users say they find value in being able to openly mull sensitive topics without worrying about alienating or offending anyone. ""The anonymity aspect allows me to basically say everything that's on my mind,"" said Yuri Spiro, a 68-year-old publishing executive living in California. ""With Twitter, I'm an identified person, and I certainly don't want to get myself in a controversial situation with one of my friends or acquaintances ... they might decide not to be involved in activities with me. I definitely would not use Twitter in the same way."" Simrat Kaur, 38, agrees. While the software-marketing professional visits Facebook five to 10 times a day, there are certain topics she would rather broach on Social Number. That way, she avoids difficult conversations or judgment from Facebook friends and opens herself up to a new set of ideas. ""I would get perspectives and opinions (on Facebook) very similar to mine. I might have 80 percent of my friends who think just like I do,"" she said. ""So as a social network, Social Number helps me get viewpoints that may be dramatically different from mine that I may not have even considered."" Another user named Joni, a 45-year-old graphic designer who declined to give her last name, said she likes ""the idea of being anonymous, to be able to express political views without being branded in a sense of one way or another."" Joni said she doesn't post anything on Social Number that she wouldn't want to be discovered. Instead, the anonymity allows for her to be more passionate in her views. ""On Facebook, generally I would discuss jobs or things that are more feminine issues, maybe diet or hairstyles. (It's) much lighter; it's not the same,"" she said. Whenever she expressed opinions about politics or current events on Facebook, many of her friends would respond, ""Joni, I didn't know you felt that way."" ""Rather than have all of that, it's more fun to be totally anonymous, and you get your point across,"" she said. That kind of dual use -- Facebook for one type of discussion, Social Number for another -- is exactly what M.K. sees in Social Number's future. ""I think what'll happen is that you'll see most of the users continue to use their accounts for open social media (such as Facebook or Twitter), and then create an account on here,"" he said. ""It's like a second life. You want a place to go where nobody knows you.""","A new social network, Social Number, lists users by a number, not by name .

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- In the past 15 years, Chad Pregracke has helped pull more than 67,000 tires from the Mississippi River and other waterways across the United States. But that's just scratching the surface. He's also helped retrieve 218 washing machines, 19 tractors, 12 hot tubs, four pianos and almost 1,000 refrigerators. ""People intentionally dumped (these) in the river and also littered,"" Pregracke said. ""Even 100 miles away, (trash) will find its way into a creek or a storm drain and into, ultimately, the Mississippi River."" For Pregracke, removing this debris has become his life's work. Sometimes called ""The Rivers' Garbageman,"" he lives on a barge about nine months out of the year with members of his 12-person crew. Together, they organize community cleanups along rivers across the country. ""The garbage got into the water one piece at a time,"" Pregracke said. ""And that's the only way it's going to come out."" It's a dirty job, but Pregracke, 38, took it on because he realized that no one was doing it. It began as a solo effort, and over the years his energy, enthusiasm and dedication have helped it grow. To date, about 70,000 volunteers have joined his crusade, helping him collect more than 7 million pounds of debris through his nonprofit, Living Lands & Waters. Pregracke grew up in East Moline, Illinois, where the Mississippi River was in his backyard. As a teenager, he worked as a commercial shell diver and began to notice the heaps of debris in the fabled waterway -- one that supplies drinking water to 18 million people in more than 50 U.S. cities. ""I saw thousands of barrels, thousands of tires, cars, trucks and tops of school buses. ... I got sick of seeing it and just wanted to do something about it,"" he said. With persistence, sincerity and a lot of chutzpah, Pregracke got a small grant from Alcoa in 1997 and spent that summer cleaning a 35-mile stretch of the river by himself. He would transport the trash by boat and sort it on his parents' lawn to be recycled. By year's end, he had single-handedly pulled around 45,000 pounds of trash out of the river. His operation has become much more sophisticated since those early days, as his nonprofit now has a fleet of boats. And while he has resources and know-how, he depends on each community he visits to supply the manpower needed to get the job done. On average, Pregracke says he organizes 70 cleanups a year in 50 communities. The cleanups are posted on the nonprofit's website, Facebook and other outlets so people know where and when they can volunteer. At the cleanup sites, Pregracke's passion for the work is contagious, and his humor creates an upbeat atmosphere -- something he knows is necessary for the work that they do. His team uses skits, mock motivational speeches and music to get the volunteers amped up, and sometimes they might find themselves doing a little karaoke on their DJ boat. ""We do everything in our power to get people excited about it,"" Pregracke said. ""We want people to leave feeling good about what they did so they'll come back."" Teams also compete to see who can find the ""best"" garbage -- a poker-like game in which two bowling balls tops three refrigerators and a message in a bottle trumps everything. Pregracke has accumulated what he believes is one of the world's largest message-in-a-bottle collections, having collected 64 over the years. ""Picking up garbage, it's tough, miserable and hot. We try to make it fun,"" he said. At the end of the day, the volunteers head back to shore and make a human chain to bring the day's haul onto the barge and sort it out. Close to 90% of what they recover is recycled; Pregracke says the rest gets disposed of properly. He believes that volunteers get a huge sense of accomplishment from seeing the garbage piled up at the end of the cleanup, and he considers that just as important as the amount of trash they help collect. ""(I'm) creating a chance for people to go out there and do something positive,"" he said. ""Talking is great, but it doesn't do much at all. Action is what I'm about."" Throughout the year, Pregracke's flotilla travels on rivers throughout the Midwest. For the past three years, the group has visited Memphis, Tennessee, each spring to help clean up a harbor on the Mississippi River where the waters are thick with debris. During their most recent visit, they collected more than 120,000 pounds of garbage in 14 working days. ""It's a really negative deal, the worst thing I've ever seen ... (but) I've never been to a city that's had more people coming out saying, 'Let's do something about this.' It's a cool thing,"" Pregracke said. In addition to the river cleanup, Pregracke has launched a floating classroom barge, where his staff educates high school students and teachers about the damages of pollution on river ecosystems. And in 2007, his nonprofit implemented a program to plant 1 million trees along river shorelines to protect and restore the natural environment. The group is halfway to its goal. Pregracke says his nonprofit has already held more than 700 cleanups on 23 rivers, but he says that he's just getting started. He views his work as a different kind of service to the country. ""A lot of people call me a conservationist or an environmentalist, but the thing is I'm no different than anybody else,"" he said. ""I just want to be known (as) a hardworking American."" Ultimately, Pregracke says, his message is about much more than cleaning rivers. He believes his story is proof that anyone can make a difference: . ""If I had one thing to say, it wouldn't even be about rivers necessarily. It would be about finding (a) cause that's dear to you and taking action. ... ""Change is slow, like a barge or train, (but) once it builds momentum, it's hard to stop."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- While Real Madrid signed Gareth Bale in the summer's highest-profile football transfer and added several other big names, Manchester United fans were left largely underwhelmed by the Premier League champion's moves in the off-season. They might be even more disappointed after learning how much United made in its last fiscal year -- and therefore had to spend. The record 20-time league winner in England -- self described as ""one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world"" -- announced record revenues of $580 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 and said commercial revenues soared to a record $244 million. It left executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who replaced David Gill in the United hierarchy, to declare on United's website: ""It has been a little over a year since our IPO (initial public offering) and in that time we have delivered on our targets and objectives. ""Our commercial business continues to be a very powerful engine of growth enabling the team to continue to be successful."" But United, in its first season without legendary manager Alex Ferguson, was largely quiet under new boss David Moyes and Woodward as it defends its Premier League title, signing just Marouane Fellaini and relatively unknown Uruguayan Guillermo Varela. United was linked with Cristiano Ronaldo, Cesc Fabregas, Ander Herrera and Leighton Baines -- who all stayed put with their current clubs. ""It's been pretty disappointing,"" said Andy Green, a United supporter who tweets about football finances. ""I don't think it's Moyes' fault. He gives his targets to the club. I don't think he should be held accountable at all."" Meanwhile, city rival Manchester City bought four key players prior to August, Chelsea swooped for the likes of Samuel Eto'o and Willian and Arsenal smashed its transfer record by purchasing Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid for more than $65 million. Tottenham splashed out on more than half-a-dozen stars, attempting to make up for the loss of Bale. ""United's commercial acumen isn't of value because it doesn't lead to a bigger stadium, lower ticket prices or better players,"" said Green. ""You have all these commercial deals but it's no benefit to the football club."" United has made a lukewarm start to the league season, winning two of its four games, although it began its Champions League campaign with a win Tuesday against Bayer Leverkusen. United is ""delighted to have David Moyes lead our football team into a new and exciting chapter,"" Woodward said.

The victims have been identified as Ebehard Schaaf, 61, a German medical doctor; Sriya Shah, 33, a Nepali-born Canadian woman; Song Wondin, a 44-year-old man from South Korea; and Wen Ryi Ha, 55, of China, according to officials with the tourism and civil aviation ministry and at the base of the mountain. ""Climbers climbing down the mountain have said that they have seen the body of the Korean,"" said Tilakram Pandey, of the tourism and civil aviation ministry, by phone from the base of the mountain. The Korean had earlier been reported missing. There were reports of a Nepali missing as well, but those reports could not be verified, Pandey said. Overheard on CNN.com: Is Mount Everest like 'a morgue'? David Breashears, a climber and filmmaker who has reached Everest's peak five times, told CNN that anyone still unaccounted for after nightfall has poor prospects for survival. ""You will surely perish at night at those elevations and those temperatures without the safety of a tent and the protection of a warm sleeping bag,"" Breashears told CNN. The cause of the German's death has been diagnosed as high-altitude cerebral edema, according to Ang Tshering Sherpa of Asian Trekking, which organized his expedition. What is altitude sickness? Mountaineers often expend all their energy while ascending the mountain and do not think about energy needed to come down. ""As a result, they become weak and suffer from altitude sickness,"" Sherpa said. And Breashears said a ""tremendous number"" of climbers attempt to scale Everest at this time of year, sometimes leading to delays atop the mountain. ""It's a period when all the camps are in, all the supplies are in, the fixed ropes are ready and they're waiting for an abatement of the jet stream winds,"" he said. Saturday was also windier than usual. On Saturday a 73-year-old Japanese woman, Tamae Watanabe, had climbed the mountain from the northern side on the Tibet-China border to become the oldest woman on the summit. Bal Krishna Ghimire, a spokesman of the tourism and civil aviation ministry, said that mountaineers began summiting the mountain from the south side this spring season only since Saturday, about 10 days later than usual, because of adverse weather conditions. The spring mountaineering season, which lasts from March 1 to May 31, is the most popular season to climb the Himalayan peaks in Nepal. With these four deaths the number of people killed on Everest this year has reached six, ministry official Dipendra Poudel said. Two Nepali sherpas died on the mountain earlier this month.","NEW: Odds of surviving a night outside camp are poor, a U.S. expert says .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- At least seven people were killed and dozens other injured in a large fire that broke out late Tuesday at a knitwear factory on the outskirts of the capital, officials said. Muhammad Mahbub, director (operations) of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defence, told CNN that rescuers had pulled some charred bodies out of smoldering debris at the factory in in Sripur. The cause was not immediately known. Mahbub said nearly a dozen fire engines were trying to put out the flames, but it was yet to be under control at 2 a.m. Wednesday. Fire broke out at Aswad Knit Composite Mills Ltd in Sripur, some 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Dhaka. The fire began in the knitting unit and later spread to three other buildings in the compound, officials said. Officials said the factory was closed, but some people were doing additional work at night. Bangladesh earns about $20 billion a year, 80% of the total export, by selling clothes to European and American brands.

"(Budget Travel) -- Avoid the mile-long lines at the Times Square TKTS booth by buying discounted Broadway tickets using one of these eight approaches. Lining up at the Times Square TKTS booth isn't the only way to get discounted Broadway tickets. Crack the codes . When you're buying tickets online, the major agencies -- Telecharge and Ticketmaster -- ask for a promotional code, which can shave between 25 and 50 percent off the face-value price. You can find one of these codes by visiting Playbill, TheaterMania and BroadwayBox.com. These sites list promotional codes for many shows, including blockbuster productions like ""Hairspray."" Playbill and TheaterMania are more comprehensive but require registration. BroadwayBox.com posts a more limited number of codes, but you won't have to cough up any personal information. Insider's tip: If you buy directly from a theater box office, where you can also use a code for savings, you will avoid the fees that Telecharge and Ticketmaster slap on the tickets they sell online. Try a ticket broker . If you're gunning for one of Broadway's most popular shows, such as ""Grease"" or ""Spring Awakening,"" you're going to struggle to find discounted tickets from any source. Your best hope is to look for tickets during Broadway's slow months: January, February, September and October. You'll most likely find these tickets being resold by respected online ticket brokers, such as StubHub and TicketsNow -- often, though not always, at a discount to their face values. Buck the system at the 11th hour . General rush tickets and ticket lotteries are available to anyone looking to try his or her last-minute luck. Some productions, including ""The Color Purple"" and ""Chicago,"" sell a select number of discounted tickets, called rush tickets, at the box office on the day of the show. Others, such as ""Wicked"" and ""Avenue Q,"" hold lotteries in which people go to the theater a few hours before a show and enter their names in a drawing. Rush and lottery tickets usually cost between $20 and $30. Go to TalkinBroadway.com or Playbill.com for details on the rush and lottery practices of the top productions. Sit onstage . Two popular musicals offer onstage seating at a fraction of the standard prices. ""Spring Awakening"" sells 26 onstage seats at every performance for $31.50 a pop (which is far less than the typical $70 a seat); ""Xanadu"" sells 22 onstage seats for every performance at $41.50 apiece. These seats tend to have rear or side views that obscure some of the action, but they still sell out quickly because viewers get to sit so close. It's best to book ""Spring Awakening"" onstage seats about four months in advance; ""Xanadu"" onstage seats require a lead time of a week or two. Onstage seating is available at the box offices as well as through Telecharge. Tote the tots . Kids have some clout when it comes to ticket discounts. The Roundabout Theatre Company sells tickets for children under the age of 17 at half the price it charges adults. For example, in February a child's ticket costs only $25 for ""Sunday in the Park with George"" -- while an adult ticket is $50 (for a rear mezzanine seat in each case). Every winter, The Broadway League holds Kids' Night on Broadway. This year, anyone between the ages of 6 and 18 could see a Broadway show for free, when accompanied by a full-paying adult, on February 5, 6, 12 and 13. See details at kidsnightonbroadway.com. Take a stand . For theatergoers feeling light on their feet, sold-out shows can be a good thing. Many productions -- even hot shows like ""Jersey Boys"" and ""Spamalot"" -- offer standing room only (SRO) admission when no audience seats are left. Like rush tickets, most SRO tickets fall in the $20 to $30 range and can be purchased at the box office on the day of the show. Find out which productions offer SRO by visiting TalkinBroadway.com and Playbill.com. Become a member . The nonprofit Theatre Development Fund -- which also operates the red-and-white TKTS booths in Times Square and at the South Street Seaport that sell discounted, same-day tickets -- has a TDF membership program that offers advance tickets for less than $35 for some Broadway shows (without the hassle of standing in a line). To join, you have to be a student, a teacher, a union member, a senior, a civil service employee, a nonprofit or performing arts organization employee or a member of the armed forces or clergy. There's an annual membership fee of $27.50, but you can usually make up the difference in a single show, given that the average Broadway ticket goes for $76. Find membership details at tdf.org. Act your age . Students should check out theater company Web sites to see if any discounts are available. For example, the Roundabout Theatre Company's HipTix program offers $20 tickets, generally available two to three weeks before performances, for students and working professionals ages 18 to 35. Sign up for the program at hiptix.com; membership is free. Similarly, Lincoln Center Theater's StudenTix program offers $20 advance tickets for high school and college students. However, a limited number of people are accepted into the free program before membership closes every year; go to lct.org for more info. On occasion, a specific production, instead of a theater, will offer students discount tickets. For instance, Tom Stoppard's ""Rock 'n' Roll"" has been selling $26.50 student tickets at the box office of the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. Student rush is a final, tried-and-true method. Many theaters set aside a limited number of student tickets -- typically running between $20 and $30 -- to sell at the box office on the day of the performance.

"(CNN) -- A follower of the Unification Church set fire to herself and two others in South Korea Thursday, the local fire service said. Spokesman Song Sam-soo says the Japanese woman poured paint thinner on herself and a man, and another woman standing nearby was also injured. The man and woman suffered third-degree burns, while the bystander had second-degree burns, Song said. However, Steve Sakuwa from the Unification Church rejected the official account, saying, ""self-immolation is incorrect."" Sakuwa says the woman has a mental illness and was attempting to throw the liquid at a male pastor but accidentally doused herself as well. The incident took place in a village in Gapyeong, east of Seoul, where the church's global headquarters is based. More than 25,000 followers are expected to convene here Friday for the one-year anniversary of the death of church founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. It is one year by the lunar calendar. A self-declared messiah, Moon was a controversial figure. He founded the Unification Church in 1954 after the Korean War and was well known for officiating mass weddings.

"(CNN) -- He is merciless toward opponents, secretive to the point of being a recluse and a true believer in the cause of global jihad. And from his hideout somewhere in southern Somalia, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, the emir of Al-Shabaab, planned the most devastating terror attack in Kenya since the U.S. Embassy bombing in 1998. Zubayr, who is also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane, already has a price on his head. Last year, the U.S. State Department authorized a reward of up to $7 million for information on his whereabouts. And Saturday, his compound in the Somali port city of Barawe was the target of a raid by American commandos, according to local residents. The SEALs withdrew after a fierce firefight, and it was unclear whether their target -- still unidentified by U.S. officials -- was dead or alive. Zubayr's vision has been to transform Al-Shabaab from an insurgent outfit focused on Somalia into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond its borders. He has already directed two -- suicide bombings against bars in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2010, and September's Westgate mall siege in Nairobi, Kenya. In an audio statement released after the siege, Zubayr noted the attack took place ""just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 911 operations"" and called it an ""epic battle"" launched to punish Kenya for the 2011 invasion that drove Al-Shabaab out of much of southern Somalia. ""We tell the Kenyan public: You have entered into a war that is not yours and is serving against your national interests. You have voluntarily given up on your security and economy and lost many of your sons,"" Zubayr said. He warned Kenyans that they face ""a war of attrition inside your own country"" unless their government pulls its remaining forces out of Somalia. He added that ""it was also a retribution against the Western states that supported the Kenyan invasion."" Experts who track Al-Shabaab communications say there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the recording. Uganda, meanwhile, has more than 6,000 troops in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping mission supporting the transitional government in Mogadishu. After the 2010 bombings, which killed more than 70 people, Zubayr warned: ""What happened in Kampala was just the beginning."" And with a terror resume that now spans 15 years, he has been ""ruthlessly eliminating real and imagined rivals"" within the group, according to a well-placed source in Mogadishu with extensive knowledge of Al-Shabaab. ""Zubayr is creating Al-Shabaab 2.0,"" the source said. For Zubayr, the struggle has always been a global confrontation with ""disbelievers"" rather than just about Somalia. He also vowed that his group would launch a direct attack against the United States. Zubayr is 36 years old, according to most accounts, and originally from Somaliland, now a vaguely autonomous part of northern Somalia. He is slim to the point of wispy, as shown on the very few photographs of him, and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public. As a teenager, he studied at a Pakistani madrassa, thanks to a grant from a wealthy Saudi, and he returned home with militant beliefs and an appetite for trouble. He was thought to have been involved in the abduction and murder of several foreign aid workers in Somaliland, including the killing of Italian aid worker Annalena Tonelli in 2003. Among his close associates in Al-Shabaab's early days was Aden Ayrow, a towering force in the group and a ruthless and mercurial pro-al Qaeda hardliner. After Ayrow's death in May 2008 in a U.S. strike, Zubayr asserted his leadership of Al-Shabaab and immediately pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2009, he once refused to discuss a military offensive against government forces in Mogadishu with Al-Shabaab's allies until one of them apologized for remarks he had made critical of bin Laden. But bin Laden was wary of a merger of al Qaeda with Al-Shabaab. About a year before his death, he wrote to Zubayr that enemies would ""escalate their anger and mobilize against you: this is what happened to the brothers in Iraq or Algeria."" Bin Laden's deputy at that time, Ayman al-Zawahiri, took a different view. A letter dated December 2010, which was recovered from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad and was thought by researchers to have been written by al-Zawahiri, was critical of bin Laden's decision to rebuff entreaties by the Somali militant group. ""I see it to be very essential for al Qaeda to confirm and declare its linkage with its branches ... please reconsider your opinion not to declare the accession of the brothers of Somalia,"" the author wrote. In February of last year, Zubayr formally declared Al-Shabaab an affiliate of al Qaeda with a long message to al-Zawahiri, in which he said: ""We will go with you as loyal soldiers until doom and injustice disappear from Islam."" Zubayr has always rejected any negotiations with Somalia's Transitional Federal Government. According to another U.S. diplomatic cable leaked to WikiLeaks, Zubayr rejected an initiative in 2009 by then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to mediate in Somalia, telling him that once a true Islamic government was established in Somalia, he would move on to other countries, including Libya. He opposes elections, saying ""the reality is that democracy is something Allah made unlawful, and someone else cannot make it lawful."" As Al-Shabaab came under greater pressure from the African Union force stationed in Mogadishu, Zubayr turned to suicide bombings against civilians. In December 2009, an Al-Shabaab bomber killed 23 people at a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu. Some factions inside Al-Shabaab disowned the attack, but Zubayr was unmoved. As a northerner, unlike other Al-Shabaab commanders, he did not belong to a clan in the areas controlled by the group and was therefore less concerned about civilian casualties. According to a confidential U.N. assessment, Zubayr demanded more suicide attacks to supplement conventional fighting. His rejection of negotiations, poor management of military campaigns and the clan system soon led to dissent in Al-Shabaab. According to diplomatic cables in 2009, Zubayr wanted to declare an Islamic caliphate in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab, which included much of central and southern Somalia. Others in Al-Shabaab's leadership disagreed, saying the group had to gain greater public support before such a move. But fearful of assassination, they kept their counsel. The imposition of brutal Taliban-like law eventually alienated large sections of the population in southern and central Somalia. One prominent Al-Shabaab member, the American Omar Hammami, said in a video last year that other elements in the group were trying to kill him. He followed up with a series of tweets this year attacking Zubayr. ""Abu zubayr has gone mad. He's starting a civil war,"" he said. Zubayr responded by ordering the killing of Hammami, who was wounded by a gunshot in April. His intelligence wing finally caught up with Hammami and killed him in September, just days after he told the Voice of America that Zubayr had ""turned Al-Shabaab into an organization that oppresses Muslims in an effort to win control of Somalia."" Even longtime supporters and friends, such as Ibrahim al Afghani, have turned against Zubayr, and paid with their lives. Al Afghani was killed in a shootout in June in the southern town of Barowe. The Mogadishu source tells CNN that several prominent figures in Al-Shabaab -- including Sheikh Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, two of its old guard -- now fear for their lives. Zubayr's purge accelerated during the summer, leading Aweys to negotiate his surrender to authorities, apparently for his own protection. After Kenyan troops drove Al-Shabaab out of population centers in 2011, pro-al Qaeda hawks within the group gained the upper hand. The loss of the port city of Kismayo, the source of much of Al-Shabaab's income, weakened arguments that the group had too much to lose by embracing al Qaeda's global jihad. One reason Zubayr has emerged triumphant in these internal battles is that he controls Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing, known as Amniyat, a ruthless entity organized in cells and commanded by Mahad Mohamed Ali, also known as ""Karate."" Counterterrorism analysts say that as other units in the group have been weakened, Zubayr has come to rely heavily on Amniyat, into which he has poured resources and which he sees as the kernel for Al-Shabaab's transformation into a regional al Qaeda affiliate. And that may ultimately be a source of vulnerability. Zubayr's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside Somalia, and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to al Qaeda. After the Westgate attack, Kenyan and Western intelligence agencies will undoubtedly step up efforts to end Zubayr's reign of terror. But he should not be underestimated. A former Somali prime minister, Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, described Zubayr as the cleverest of Al-Shabaab's leaders.

"London (CNN) -- A new coat of arms to represent Prince William and his wife, Catherine, as a married couple was unveiled Friday, more than two years after their televised wedding was watched by people around the globe. The new conjugal coat of arms will ""represent them in heraldic terms as a married couple,"" Kensington Palace said in a news release. The coat of arms was approved by William's grandmother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, earlier this year but was shown publicly for the first time Friday. It follows the tradition for conjugal arms in showing the separate shields for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge side-by-side, the palace said. Prince William's shield was given to him on his 18th birthday by the queen and shows various royal emblems from different parts of the United Kingdom, while Catherine's shield is from the Middleton family's coat of arms. That coat of arms was granted to Catherine's father, Michael Middleton, in March 2011, ahead of the couple's April wedding, the palace said. According to the College of Arms, its three sprigs of oak, or acorns, refer to Michael Middleton's three children and echo the oak trees that ring the area where they grew up. After her marriage, Catherine was granted her own coat of arms by the Queen -- made by placing her father's arms beside those of her husband in what is known as an ""impaled"" coat of arms. If any British citizens living in England, Northern Ireland or Wales want to follow in the Middleton family's footsteps, they can also apply to the College of Arms in London for their own coat of arms, according to the body's website, while Scots can apply in Edinburgh. The heraldic records held by the College of Arms stretch all the way back to the 12th century, it says.","William and Catherine have a new coat of arms to represent them as a married couple .

"(CNN) -- Michael J. Fox's return to TV with NBC's ""The Michael J. Fox Show"" is an exciting and inspiring move -- there's no argument there. But will his decision help boost NBC's comedy slate to its once-untouchable highs? That's a question with a less straightforward answer. After leaving TV over a decade ago to manage his escalating Parkinson's disease, the 52-year-old industry icon has signed up for his first weekly starring role since ""Spin City."" Instead of trying to work around Parkinson's, he's chosen to work with it: The premise of NBC's new ""Fox Show"" has the actor portraying a New York news personality named Mike Henry, who also left TV due to Parkinson's, but has made a recent return, much to his family's relief. Michael J. Fox's triumphant return to TV . Executive produced by Fox, Will Gluck, Sam Laybourne and Richard Schwartz, ""The Michael J. Fox"" show was easily one of the most anticipated debuts of the 2013 fall TV season. And yet, says The New York Times, ""it doesn't take long to realize that something is off in 'The Michael J. Fox Show.' "" The critic, Mike Hale, found ""very little"" in the show's pilot episode that ""will force you to laugh. ... The show is more concerned with making (Fox's character) a saint than it is with making him funny."" The Hollywood Reporter said the show yields ""mixed results,"" and not only because the humor -- which includes jokes about Parkinson's -- is uneven. ""The pilot is asking you to, in a sense, laugh at Parkinson's jokes and the man suffering from its effects. The unspoken agreement is that if it's fine with Fox, then it should be fine with you. But that doesn't make it any less uncomfortable,"" THR said. ""It's clear that tone and direction on 'The Michael J. Fox Show' haven't been completely worked out yet. What isn't clear is what the audience reaction will be -- especially when patience needs to be the primary one."" If you disagree with that assessment of the pilot's comedy, Time magazine's James Poniewozik is right there with you. The ""ways in which the comedy uses his experience, irreverently but not snarkily, is by far the most remarkable part of the show,"" Poniewozik said. ""The problem with 'The Michael J. Fox Show' is how unremarkable everything else in it is."" Given how strong Fox is as an actor, fans shouldn't lose hope with the series as it finds its voice. ""The Michael J. Fox Show"" does use the same documentary-style approach that shows like ""The Office"" have used to success, which means many critics felt it was trying too hard to be like ABC's critically acclaimed ""Modern Family."" With patience, though, ""The Michael J. Fox Show"" may be able to stand out in its own right. ""The best part about 'The Michael J. Fox Show' is Michael J. Fox, who is still as sharp, sarcastic and on-point as ever,"" critiques E!. ""That's what makes this show so likable, even though the jokes about his Parkinson's might make some viewers uneasy. ... (I)f the show can figure out where that fits in, it's golden. It's striving to be 'Modern Family,' when it should be working on highlighting its strengths.""","Michael J.

"(CNN) -- Some people take many years to find their calling in life -- but for Adam van Koeverden, it was right in front of him in black and white. On a small section of his local newspaper, the Canadian boy who would become an Olympic champion saw his future flash before him. An advert, in the otherwise unremarkable Oakville Beaver, had caught his mother's eye. It was calling out for the next kayak superstar -- and her son had already tried everything else without much success. ""It was one of those turning points in your life where you look back and you're like, 'Wow that day really changed the rest of my life quite significantly,' "" van Koeverden told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It was a long time ago now. I wonder what would have happened with me and where I'd be today if instead of that newspaper article, my mum was reading something different or brought me down to another sports club? Or didn't at all? I think about that a lot."" As a 13-year-old who had tried his hand at a whole host of sports including soccer, basketball and volleyball, it was the kayak which caught the imagination of a determined teenager. After his first foray into the world of paddling, there was never a chance he'd turn back. ""Every kid wants to have something to brag about. I tried out for all the teams growing up but I just wasn't really showing any signs of any athletic prowess,"" van Koeverden said. ""In kayaking it was the sort of a thing I could go out there and practice on my own. It took a lot of concentration."" Unknown quantity . Some 18 years have passed since he first picked up a paddle, but van Koeverden has lost none of the boyish enthusiasm which propelled him from an unknown to one of the sport's most famous stars. From arriving as a virtual unknown at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he won gold in the K1 500-meter event and bronze in the K1 1,000-meter race, he went on to establish himself as an icon of the sport. But even now, with four Olympic medals, two World Championship wins and 26 World Cup stage victories to his name, van Koeverden is still desperate for more success. The opportunity to compete at Rio in 2016 is a huge lure for the man who grew up dreaming of the day he would compete at the greatest Games on earth. And at the age of 31, that dream still remains -- perhaps burning even stronger. Rio Games . ""I've definitely committed to Rio,"" he said. ""I'm training like I'm training for the Olympics, and it's just difficult committing to something that's so far away. ""I really have enjoyed the process of diversification and trying new things but I can't really get away from the fact that I'm a kayaker and I love to race, and there's a big race happening in Brazil in a couple of years' time. ""I'm not going to be too old for it. I don't want to retire ... but I don't want to be washed up. I don't want to be the old guy on the water. ""I don't want to think about retirement and I hope the next phase of my life is just as rewarding and provides me with the same opportunity to work hard."" Climbing peaks . Van Koeverden has stood on top of the world -- in more ways than one -- but he has not lost sight of the smaller things in life. The man who walked into Beijing's Bird Nest stadium holding the Maple Leaf aloft in 2008 is now busy flying the flag for children across the world who can only dream of becoming a Olympic hero. In November last year, van Koeverden climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania for charity Right to Play. By ascending the world's tallest freestanding mountain -- its peak is 5,895 meters (19,336 feet) above sea level -- he and six others helped to raise over $100,000 for children across the world. The scheme runs a whole host of educational programs which include seminars on AIDS and HIV, conflict resolution, healthy active living, sanitation and cleanliness. Van Koeverden proudly sports a ""Right to Play"" sticker on his kayak -- something which he is often asked about. ""When I'm racing my boat in Europe people always ask me, 'Is that like a gaming site, are they like your sponsors?' ""It's a good conversation starter because they don't know it's a charity that I do some work with. ""They're a children-focused charity that is helping to improve lives for those who aren't fortunate enough to be able to say that they can take sport and play for granted. ""Unfortunately it's not something everybody globally can take for granted. ""When I was 13, I just wandered into a canoe club and had access to a competitive sport with great coaching and great facility.

"(CNN) -- America can handle the truth. Even if that truth could include a coverup at the powerful IRS. The IRS mission statement pledges to ""enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all."" But public scrutiny has revealed details indicating a level of politicization totally at odds with that. Look at the two eye-opening developments that have happened at the IRS since May: An acting IRS commissioner resigned, and another powerful IRS official refused to answer questions before Congress, pleading the Fifth Amendment. Whatever is going on, there is only one way to proceed, and that is a professional and thorough investigation. For people who haven't been following a lot of this, let me quickly get you up to speed: . The IRS inspector general released a report on May 14 describing how the agency had inappropriately targeted tea party and conservative groups that had applied for tax-exempt status. Then the IRS put these groups through extra reviews, substantial delays and burdensome requests for information. The reaction was immediate. The next day, President Barack Obama announced that the acting IRS commissioner was resigning. That doesn't exactly happen every day. Obama went on to say, ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives."" After that shocking disclosure, several things happened: . • Senate and House committees launched investigations into the scandal. • The FBI began a criminal investigation. • The IRS inspector general expanded its ongoing investigation. • IRS official Lois Lerner exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions before Congress. Some interesting developments emerged from all that. For one, the original claim during IRS testimony -- that the scandal was the result of a couple of ""rogue IRS agents"" in the agency's Cincinnati field office -- didn't hold water. It turned out that, according to frontline IRS agents in Cincinnati interviewed by House Oversight committee investigators, the Washington IRS office had played a key role in the handling of the tea party applications. Retired IRS lawyer Carter Hull disclosed in testimony that IRS Counsel William Wilkins was one of his supervisors in the targeting of conservative groups. (The IRS has denied Wilkins' involvement in the targeting of specific groups.) The inspector general's report found that Wilkins' office had sent the exempt organizations determination unit on April 24, 2012, ""additional comments on the draft guidance"" for considering applications of tea party groups for tax-exempt status (PDF). Read the inspector general's report . The connections between Wilkins' office and the inappropriate profiling of conservative groups are especially noteworthy because there are only two appointees of the president at the IRS: the commissioner and the chief counsel. Cynics may view this controversy as typical when the House is in the hands of a different party than the president, but guess what? The Democrat-controlled Senate's Finance Committee has also weighed in. That committee has called for three things: a hearing, an investigation and a request to the IRS for documents. Montana Democrat Sen. Max Baucus, the committee chairman, stated bluntly, ""Targeting groups based on their political views is not only inappropriate, it is intolerable, unacceptable and cannot be allowed."" Baucus promised a bipartisan investigation and has been true to his word. When the first week of August arrived, Baucus and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the IRS failed to provide ""most of the information requested by the Committee."" New details reshape IRS targeting scandal . As chairman of the ethics watchdog group National Legal and Policy Center, I had filed a complaint with the IRS in May 2011 showing that a purported charity called the Barack H. Obama Foundation -- named for the father of President Obama and run by his half-brother, Malik Obama -- had been raising funds in the U.S. by falsely claiming to be an IRS-approved charitable group. I submitted proof that the foundation was not tax-deductible and had never even applied for that status despite the fact that it had been fundraising for about three years. In fact, one of the foundation's directors admitted that an IRS application had never been submitted. There was compelling evidence suggesting that the foundation was raising money on the Internet by misrepresenting itself as being IRS-approved when it really wasn't. Suddenly, the foundation rushed an application to the IRS in late May 2011. In the short span of about a month, Lerner -- the same person who took the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before Congress -- gave the Obama Foundation its tax-deductible status. And, the IRS made that status retroactive for three years. Even more curious, several of the forms submitted by Malik Obama were stamped as being received by the IRS in July 2011. That's one month after Lerner approved the group's new tax status. Generally, the approval process for charitable groups seeking tax-deductible status takes longer than it does for groups that merely want to be tax-exempt, such as most of the tea party groups. In any case, there's a good chance this scandal could last a while. Anyone who follows Washington scandals knows that investigations can take months, sometimes years. Consider Watergate. That story broke during the presidential campaign of 1972. The president's press secretary dismissed it as a third-rate burglary. The investigation was slow because there was an active pushback from the Nixon administration and the people being investigated. The end finally came in August 1974, when President Nixon resigned. 'Enemies list' won't be tolerated, says GOP lawmaker . Was there a coverup here, like there was in the Watergate scandal? I have no idea. But it could easily be argued that there are a lot of signs pointing in that direction: Multiple investigations were cut off; document processing was delayed; a key official took the Fifth Amendment. McConnell says Obama administration marked by 'culture of intimidation' When the issue involves the integrity of an institution as powerful as the IRS, the media and the public are entitled to a thorough, professional investigation. Anything less leads an already cynical public to become even more cynical. If it comes to the appointment of a special prosecutor, that, I believe, should be reserved as a last resort. The administration says there's no political basis for the IRS actions. If that's true, then it has nothing to lose. Sometimes, though, the truth hurts. But don't worry. Whatever happens, America can handle it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Boehm. Got a story idea or tip for CNN's investigations team?

"Washington (CNN) -- As he battles with congressional Republicans over the budget and the debt ceiling, and as a key component of his health care law kicks in, new polling suggests that President Barack Obama's standing among Americans continues to deteriorate. The president's approval rating stands at 45%, according to a CNN average of four national polls conducted over the past week and a half. And a CNN Poll of Polls compiled and released Thursday also indicates that Obama's disapproval rating at 49%. In the afterglow of his re-election and second inauguration, the percentage of those approving of Obama's job performance hovered in the low 50s as the year began, according to CNN Poll of Poll averages. But his numbers slipped to the upper 40s by spring and now have edged down to the mid 40s. At the same time, his disapproval numbers have edged up from the low 40s to right around the 50% mark. Anxiety and skepticism over the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, continuing concerns over the sluggish economy, and a drop in the president's approval on foreign policy -- once his ace in the hole -- all appear to be contributing to the slide of Obama's general approval rating. ""Not a precipitous drop, but more like a continued erosion in the president's numbers,"" says CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. ""The Boston Marathon bombings, Edward Snowden's 'big brother' revelations, the 'non-coup' in Egypt, the 'now we bomb, now we don't' policy in Syria, an economic recovery that remains disappointing, the uncertainty of how/what will change under the new health care system, shall I go on?"" ""It all adds up to an awful lot of uncertainty and unfairly or not, uncertainty tends to breed lower poll numbers for the guy in charge,"" added Crowley, anchor of CNN's ""State of the Union."" Besides being the main indicator of a president's standing with the public, a presidential approval rating is a good gauge of his clout in dealing with Congress. The drop in his numbers comes as the president pushes back against attempts by congressional Republicans to use deadlines to keep the federal government funded and to extend the nation's debt ceiling to try and defund the health care law. A slew of national polls conducted this month indicate that a majority doesn't support shutting down the government in order to defund Obamacare. But if the fight shifts to the debt ceiling, public opinion appears to turn against the president, who reiterated on Thursday that he will not negotiate with the GOP in Congress over extending the debt ceiling. ""As for not letting America pay its bills, I have to say, no Congress before this one has ever -- ever -- in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default, to threaten an economic shutdown, to suggest America not pay its bills, just to try to blackmail a president into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with a budget,"" Obama said at a healthcare rally in Maryland. But two surveys released Wednesday, CBS News/New York Times and Bloomberg National Poll, indicate that a majority of the public rejects the president's push to raise the debt ceiling with no strings attached. The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the debt ceiling, which is the amount the federal government can borrow to pay its bills, must be raised by October 17 to prevent a possible default. The president's numbers may be nothing to brag about, but his polling still soars over that of Congress. The approval rating Congress ranges from 13% to 24% in five national polls conducted earlier this month, with the approval for congressional Democrats slightly higher than their GOP counterparts. While the president's approval rating doesn't afford him much leverage, as Crowley points out, ""it's not anything Congressional Republicans can take to the bargaining table. Their approval ratings are consistently far worse than anything the president has posted."" The new CNN Poll of Polls averages four non-partisan, live operator, national surveys that asked the approval rating question: Gallup daily tracking poll (September 22-24); Bloomberg National Poll (September 20-23); CBS News/New York Times (September 19-23); and American Research Group (September 17-20). Since it is an average of multiple surveys, the Poll of Polls does not have a sampling error.","New polls suggest president's standing with Americans continues to erode .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Gun battles between rival militias raged in several parts of the Libyan capital on Thursday night with no immediate reports of casualties. The sound of anti-aircraft gunfire and blasts echoed across Tripoli in one of the most intense incidents of militia infighting in the city since the fall of the Moammar Gadhafi regime two years ago. At least two people were killed and at least 29 were injured Thursday night, according to the state news agency LANA, citing security officials in the Libyan capital. The clashes, between a militia from the city of Misrata and Tripoli militiamen, broke out after a Misrata militia commander died as a result of injuries he suffered on Tuesday. Commander Nuri Fairwan was injured Tuesday in fighting between the two militias that began with a dispute at a Tripoli checkpoint and escalated. Witnesses in parts of the capital affected by the clashes said residential buildings and a five-star hotel were hit by the gunfire. Tripoli's Radisson Blu Al Mahary Hotel, which houses Western diplomats and is frequented by journalists and business guests, was hit by several rounds of anti-aircraft gunfire, which caused some damage including shattered glass windows. Hotel staff and guests were led to the basement during the heavy fighting in the vicinity. More than two years after the end of Libya's civil war, the country remains awash in weapons and militias with competing interests. Many Libyans are concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the country and the increasing power of militias who continue to operate freely. The weakness of Libya's central government and its inability to build an army and police force was underscored last month with the kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan by a militia in Tripoli, which seized him for a few hours before another militia released him.","NEW: At least two people killed, security officials say .

"(CNN) -- ""I was suicidal in college,"" a Harry Potter-looking hipster recently told me. The young man's words stunned me. It wasn't his age or gender or style that took me by surprise. It was because he's black. Even though suicide is the third leading cause of death for black males ages 10 to 24, I had no immediate image, no ready reference for a young black man hurting so badly he wanted to die or for a black man so sick he was driven to kill. The recent mass shooting by Aaron Alexis at the Washington Navy Yard was horrific and tragic. It made me think about the interior lives of black men -- about how little anyone knows how black men feel when they're in agony or depression. Black man in pain is a story rarely told. Hip-hop is considered a safe and powerful space to tell black men's stories. Yet Eminem is the rapper best known for narratives about suicide, addiction and emotional pain. It's easy to imagine someone who looks like Eminem, Kurt Cobain or Alexander McQueen as suffering from depression. But Lee Thompson Young? Not so much. There's no quintessential cult movie -- a ""Black Boy, Interrupted"" so to speak -- where we see a black man who struggles with depression or distress. There are even fewer examples of black men seeking help. ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" ""Frasier,"" ""In Treatment"" and ""The Sopranos"" are all shows involving men in or providing therapy. They are all white. It's hard to believe what you've never seen. The conventional narratives about black men tend to be narrow and depthless. They are often presented in two distinct and superficial ways -- as the criminal or as the incredible. Sometimes you'll see them behind bars or in the courtroom. Other times you'll see them in the limelight. Just turn on the TV and the black men you see are actual or fictional lawbreakers. Or they are superstars. Aside from these two stereotypical identities, we know nearly nothing about the inner lives of black men. Are they complex? Are they unknowable, untouchable, undesirable or unworthy of help in our collective societal imagination? It is clear that Aaron Alexis was very sick. He had a ""pattern of misconduct"" while he was at the Navy. His symptoms weren't a secret. He even went to a Veterans Affairs hospital seeking help for sleep-related issues. There's been a lot of discussion about him slipping through the cracks and receiving security clearance, being able to enter the Naval Sea Systems Command building easily. But what concerns me is the fact that even though his behaviors raised eyebrows, he wasn't checked for mental illness. Alexis massacred 12 people like a mad man. The surveillance video showing him armed with a shotgun prowling the building is chilling. The question is: Can we as a society become more sensitive to black men who need help? We can start with the book ""Black Pain: It Just Looks Like We're Not Hurting"" by Terrie Williams, which provides an intimate and honest exploration of the interior lives of black men. We can also encourage the media to look more closely at black men and their emotional complexities. We have to be familiar with one another's pain. Knowledge can reduce ignorance and enlighten us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michaela Angela Davis.","Suicide reportedly is the third leading cause of death for black males ages 10 to 24 .

"Tooele, Utah (CNN) -- Syria has been given a year to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, or face the threat of a U.S. military strike. Yet it may come as a surprise that the United States has still not destroyed all of its massive supply of deadly nerve agents. In fact, neither has Russia. Both Washington and Moscow signed the Chemical Weapons Convention of the 1990s, which forbid the use, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. And both countries missed the convention's extended deadline last year to destroy all of their chemical weapons. This fact was highlighted during Friday's ceremony awarding the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is helping to eliminate the Syrian army's stockpiles of poison gas. ""Certain states have not observed the deadline, which was April 2012, for destroying their chemical weapons,"" the Nobel committee noted in its official announcement of the coveted peace prize. ""This applies especially to the USA and Russia."" The United States estimates it will be at least another decade before it completes destruction of the remaining 10% of its chemical weapons, estimated at more than 3,100 tons. Russia has more than five times that amount left to destroy, according to the OPCW. While it's unclear exactly how many chemical weapons Syria has, U.S. intelligence and other estimates put its chemical weapons stockpile at about 1,000 tons stored in dozens of sites. Syria's chemical arsenal at a glance . The United Nations has given Syria until mid-2014 to destroy that arsenal and U.N. weapons inspectors have expressed optimism that this deadline can be reached, despite having to dart in and out of battle zones amid Syria's bloody civil war. Wade Mathews, who once worked on the U.S. project to destroy its chemical stockpile, isn't so sure that Syria can meet that deadline. He said the U.S. effort took billions of dollars, the cooperation of many levels of government -- including the military -- and a safe environment to make sure the destruction was done safely. ""We had a coordinated effort, we had a government that insisted that it be done safely and that the community was protected,"" said Mathews, who now works with the Tooele County emergency management team, which makes sure the Utah community is aware of the project. ""I don't think those things are in place in Syria."" Mathews briefly worked at the Desert Army Chemical Depot in Tooele, a desert town bracketed by mountains outside of Salt Lake City where 43% of the nation's chemical weapons were once stored. The rest was stored at eight other sites around the country. The weapons were first warehoused at the Tooele facility in 1942, during World War II, and grew over time. At one point, the United States once housed the majority of its chemical arsenal --13,000 tons -- and a million munitions at the facility. Tooele was chosen because military leaders figured Japanese warplanes could hit the West Coast but not fly over the mountains to Utah without refueling, said Richard Trujillo, who spent 40 years working at the facility. ""There was mustard gas originally ... a lot of smoke-type bombs, smoke pods,"" Trujillo recalled. Then, in the 1950s, a lot of nerve gas was transported to the facility, he said. Eventually, the United States signed the international chemical treaty in the 1990s and got serious about getting rid of the chemicals in a way that would not harm the environment or the people working at the plant or living in the area. While the process was slow and expensive, Trujillo said there was not a single casualty despite the volatility of some of the chemicals. ""You know the whole task is nothing short of miraculous in my mind,"" Trujillo said. ""And I was part of it."" Today there are no weapons at the Tooele facility. The process of safely getting rid of these chemicals and munitions took 16 years, and was finally completed last year. Workers there will soon begin the process of dismantling the plants needed to do the job. Yet, there are still more than 3,000 tons of chemical weapons left in the United States, stored at two remaining facilities at Pueblo, Colorado, and Bluegrass, Kentucky. The majority is in Pueblo, where officials plan to start in 2015 destroying 2,600 tons of mustard blister chemicals stored in projectiles in liquid form. The process is expected to take four years. At the Bluegrass plant outside Lexington, Kentucky, there are 523 tons of mustard agent, VX and sarin nerve agents. Officials predict the job of destroying that arsenal, which is slated to start in 2020, will be completed in 2023. The world's attention turned to Syria's chemical weapons stockpile after the United States and other countries accused Syria of using chemical weapons in an August 21 attack outside Damascus, a strike Washington says killed more than 1,400 people -- including many women and children. Syria denies the accusation and says its own troops have faced poison gas attacks by rebel forces in the civil war that began in 2011. Last month, the U.N. Security Council later voted unanimously to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons or face consequences. The U.N. team in Syria overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons says the Assad regime is cooperating. Securing Syria's chemical weapons won't be easy . It's unclear how these weapons can be found, secured, and safely destroyed by next year in the middle of a protracted conflict, considering that it is expected to take the United States three years to destroy half of the chemical weapons that Syria is estimated to have -- and that's in a remote part of Kentucky with no civil war. Asked about that, the U.S. Department of Defense told CNN in a written statement that it's ""inaccurate to draw parallels between the U.S. chemical demilitarization program and the international cooperation that will be required to destroy the chemical stockpile in Syria."" Defected general says Syria will never give up chemical weapons . CNN's Elizabeth M. Nunez contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- A Colorado teenager is facing a first-degree murder charge, accused of stabbing her mother 79 times in the face and neck in the bathroom of their Aurora home. Isabella Yun-Mi Guzman, 18, is being held without bond at the Arapahoe County Jail in the August 28 stabbing death of her mother, Yun-Mi Hoy, 47. The teen's stepfather, Ryan Hoy, told authorities that Guzman and her mother had often fought in the past, but Guzman spit in her mother's face and became ""more threatening and disrespectful towards her mother"" in the days leading up to the killing, according to an arrest affidavit. Hoy told police that his wife showed him an e-mail Guzman allegedly sent her on the morning of the killing, which included the words, ""You will pay,"" the affidavit states. That e-mail prompted Yun-Mi Hoy to call police later that day and ask them to come to her home because her daughter had threatened to harm her, according to the affidavit. After speaking to Yun-Mi Hoy and Guzman, responding officers determined there ""were ongoing family issues between them and it appeared to be resolved,"" court documents state. Ryan Hoy told authorities that after the officers left, Guzman went to her bedroom and remained there the rest of the evening while her mother went back to work. When Yun-Mi Hoy arrived home around 9:30 p.m., Ryan Hoy said, she went upstairs to take a shower. Hoy told police he then ""heard a thumping sound coming from upstairs and his wife call his name,"" according to the affidavit. Hoy told authorities that as he tried to open the bathroom door, Guzman was pushing against it with her back to keep it closed. Hoy said he then went downstairs, called 911 and told a dispatcher that his ""wife and daughter were inside the bathroom and he could see blood coming from under the door to the bathroom,"" the affidavit states. Hoy also told police that when he went back upstairs, he saw Guzman standing in the bathroom doorway holding a knife. ""Hoy then observed his wife lying on the floor of the bathroom covered in blood"" with a baseball bat lying next to her body, the affidavit says. When police arrived at the home, they found Yun-Mi Hoy's nude body lying on the bathroom floor with numerous lacerations and stab wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene at 10:28 p.m. An autopsy showed she had 31 stab wounds to the face and 48 stab wounds to the neck, according to the affidavit. Guzman was arrested Thursday at a parking garage by Aurora police. On Friday morning, a judge ordered that she be held without bond. Calls to the Aurora Public Defender's Office to locate an attorney for Guzman were not returned.","Isabella Yun-Mi Guzman, 18, held without bond in mother's stabbing death .

"(CNN) -- In an age of streaming media, we're still a culture of digital hoarders. That may partly explain why on Tuesday, Apple introduced an iPad with 128 gigabytes of storage capacity, twice as much as any previous model. But will the average tablet owner need that much space? For casual users, tablets are media-consumption devices. We use them to watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, play games and read books and magazines. All those files take up memory on your internal hard drive. Today's high-resolution photos and videos are increasingly hogging storage, too. It's easy to see how someone with a lot of downloaded files might eventually run out of room on a 64GB tablet. But 128 gigabytes? That's the equivalent of about 100 DVD-quality movies, 30 Blu-ray movies, 30,000 songs or 40,000 photos, according to this graphic by a computer store in the United Kingdom. Everything else about the iPad announced Tuesday is the same as the current fourth-generation models: a 9.7-inch Retina display, a dual-core A6X processor, a FaceTime HD camera, 2 gigabtyes of RAM and an estimated 10 hours of battery life. So the new device, which goes on sale February 5, is all about giving users more storage space. That's why Apple is targeting the 128GB iPad at professional users such as architects, doctors or audio engineers, who often work with large files (and can afford pricey gadgets). ""Companies regularly utilizing large amounts of data such as 3D CAD files, X-rays, film edits, music tracks, project blueprints, training videos and service manuals all benefit from having a greater choice of storage options for iPad,"" Apple said in a news release announcing the new iPad. Some observers say the tablet's cost -- $799 (Wi-Fi only) and $929 (Wi-Fi and cellular), $100 more than the current 64GB model -- isn't worth it in an age when we can store movies, music, photos and documents on cloud-based servers instead of our own machines. ""Apple doesn't expect you to buy a 128GB iPad, not unless you're a professional-grade buyer, like an architect or a supervillain,"" writes Leslie Horn for Gizmodo. ""The 128GB iPad is like a $300/head steakhouse dinner. It goes on the corporate account."" Other pundits noted that at $929, the top-of-the-line 128GB model costs almost as much as the base-model MacBook Air laptop ($999), which is much easier to type on. ""Apple has set its eyes on the dying infrastructure of the PC industry and Microsoft's Windows operating system business,"" writes Dan Rowinski of ReadWriteWeb. ""That is really the only reason that Cupertino would unveil an iPad with 128 GB, a size that challenges many of the 'ultrabooks' that have become popular in the laptop market these days."" In that way, the launch of the new iPad seems poised to stave off competition from Microsoft's 128GB Surface Pro tablet, due February 9 in the U.S. and Canada. When it comes to storage capacity, though, these tablets aren't close to being the biggest. That distinction belongs to the Panasonic Toughbook H2, which retails for $3,579 and has a whopping 320GB of internal storage.","Apple introduces iPad with 128 GB of storage capacity. twice as much as previous models .

"(CNN) -- You might think of black holes as indiscriminate eaters, hungrily gobbling up everything in their vicinity. But the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is not exactly like this, new research suggests. Instead, this black hole -- and likely other black holes in the centers of galaxies -- must spit out a lot in order to swallow a little. It's been a mystery why black holes at the centers of galaxies in the present universe appear so much dimmer than quasars, extremely bright objects from the early universe that have black holes at their centers, too. As Albert Einstein noted in his famous formula E=mcÂ², energy is equivalent to mass times the speed of light squared. In a black hole, crushed mass gets converted into energy. Black holes in quasars eat a lot, creating the spectacular brightness associated with them. But we don't find as much radiation emanating from Sagittarius A*, or other black holes in the centers of galaxies in the present universe. So what's going on? Is the hot gas that Sagittarius A* is eating just not radiating as much as the colder gas that quasars capture? To find out, researchers used NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to take X-ray images and capture other signature of energy. The study is published in the journal Science, and led by Q. Daniel Wang, astrophysicist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Sagittarius A* has about 4 million times the mass of the sun. It is located 26,000 light years from Earth. That's still super far, as one light year is about 5.9 trillion miles, but it's close enough that human technology can help us see what's happening to the matter around it. The gas swirling around this black hole has a temperature of millions of degrees. Based on these new observations, researchers suggest less than 1% of the material that the black hole's gravity pulls near actually gets sucked in to the ""point of no return,"" which is called the event horizon. Instead, a lot of it gets spat back out. That's why the X-ray emission from the black hole is faint; in theory, the radiation output would be stronger if the black hole were swallowing more. ""Less than 1% of matter will be actually sacrificed for the freedom of 99% of gas,"" Wang said. ""So, 99% of gas can escape from the capture of the black hole."" Why is that the case? It appears that in order to be gobbled for good by the black hole, material must lose heat and angular momentum, which is a measurement of how an object or system rotates around a particular axis. The temperature is important because hotter material is harder to pin down, even for a black hole. Wang uses the analogy of a sink: You can pour cold water in and watch it spiral down a drain, but if it's steam, far less will actually go in; the water particles are more diffuse and energetic. According to Wang and colleagues, the black hole needs to throw out more than 99% of the material in order to accomplish this. That ejected 99%, in turn, heats up the environment around it, which affects the evolution of the galaxy as a whole. Cold and dense gas goes down easier into the black hole, though, and a black hole may sometimes capture a lot of it. This is the gas that tends to form a disk, called an accretion disk, around the black hole. In the accretion disk, the gas's energy and angular momentum dissipate, so more of it is swallowed up by the black hole. There was more cold and dense gas in the early universe, so black holes at that time were better at accumulating material this way. That's why we find quasars in the early universe that are so much brighter than Sagittarius A*. Quasar -- galactic beauty, deadly beast -- discovered 50 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The wife of George Zimmerman will not be at her scheduled arraignment Tuesday after pleading not guilty to perjury for allegedly lying about the family's finances as her husband faced murder charges, a court official said. Shellie Zimmerman's lawyer, Kelly Sims, on Friday entered a written not guilty plea and waiver for her not to personally appear at her arraignment, Seminole County, Florida, court spokeswoman Michelle Kennedy said Monday. ""Neither Ms. Zimmerman or her attorney are required to attend the arraignment,"" Kennedy said by e-mail. ""Ms. Zimmerman's name will remain on the docket, but her case will not be called."" Shellie Zimmerman was arrested June 12 on perjury charges, 11 days after Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. revoked her husband's bond and ordered him back to jail for misrepresenting how much money the family had when he initially set his bond in April. Prosecutors say he had $135,000 at the time Zimmerman's wife told the court under oath that they were indigent. The 25-year-old Shellie Zimmerman was released on bond later that day, and had been set to be formally arraigned Tuesday. Her husband, who has been free on $1 million bail since early July, faces a second-degree murder charge in the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who died in Sanford, Florida, in February. A probable cause affidavit claims Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, ""profiled"" Martin and disregarded a police dispatcher's request that he await the arrival of police prior to the shooting. George Zimmerman, 28, was arrested in April. While in jail before his initial bond hearing, prosecutors said -- and Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara has acknowledged -- that he and his wife spoke in code by phone when discussing their available funds. Those talks included the transfer of money from George Zimmerman's account to accounts of his sister and wife, according to an affidavit prepared by an investigator with the State Attorney's office. Records show $47,000 was transferred from George Zimmerman's account to his sister's account from April 16 and 17, authorities allege. Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her account from April 16 to April 19, the affidavit states. George Zimmerman asked his wife in jail calls to ""pay off all the bills,"" including an American Express bill and a Sam's Club card, prosecutors allege. George Zimmerman balks at interview over demands . At her husband's April 20 bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman was asked whether the couple had financial means to assist in his defense. ""Uhm, not -- not that I'm aware of,"" she replied, according to a probable cause affidavit. Four days later, after her husband was released from prison on bond, Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $85,500 from her account back to George Zimmerman's account, according to the affidavit. Kennedy, the court spokeswoman, also said that she expected Lester to issue a ruling ""sometime this week"" on a defense motion to disqualify the judge. Earlier in July, Zimmerman filed a motion in circuit court saying Zimmerman cannot get a fair trial because Lester used ""gratuitous, disparaging"" language in his second bail order. ""Mr. Zimmerman has lost faith in the objectivity of this court and has a reasonable, well-founded fear that he will not receive a fair trial by this court,"" his defense attorney said in the document. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Shellie Zimmerman is to be arraigned on Tuesday; she waives her appearance .

"Washington (CNN) -- The stakes of the stalemate are high -- and climbing. The partial government shutdown will enter its 14th day Monday, just three days before the U.S. government bumps up against its projected borrowing limit. Talks both on ending the shutdown and on avoiding the debt ceiling have shifted to the Senate, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, along with other top senators, began discussions this weekend. The Senate reconvened Sunday afternoon, with Reid saying he would do ""everything I can throughout the day"" to reach some sort of bargain with the chamber's Republican minority. But a source familiar with the ongoing Senate discussions expressed doubt that any significant progress would be made Sunday evening. And the Senate adjourned shortly before 5 p.m. ET, showing no signs of such progress. Still, Reid struck a positive note as he spoke on the Senate floor. ""I've had a productive conversation with the Republican leader this afternoon. Our discussions were substantive and we'll continue those discussions. I'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion,"" he said. The Senate will meet again Monday at 2 p.m. ET. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said earlier that a bipartisan group of senators was still trying to hash out a plan acceptable to both sides. ""We had 12 people meet yesterday, but just last night I had two more Democrats and a Republican contact me to offer suggestions and say they want to be part of our group,"" she said on CNN's State of the Union. ""It's taken far too long. We never should be in this situation,"" she added. ""But I do believe there's going to be a resolution this week."" Likewise, Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip, said he thinks that Congress will ultimately get the job done. ""I'm a hopeful person. I believe we can do it. I hope sensible people prevail, because at this point, it's not just a shutdown and all of the damage it's caused, but if we default on our debt, it will have a dramatic impact on the savings account, on the retirement account of average Americans,"" Durbin, of Illinois, said on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said he too thinks Congress will find a way out of the crisis before Thursday, when the United States hits the debt ceiling. ""We will have decided as a Congress that we need to avoid going over the debt limit, and we'll figure it out. And it will probably be a relatively short-term solution,"" Portman said. A weekend of rejections . Computer failure temporarily halts some food stamp payments . But while senators' comments and reports of talks were positive, the only actions over the weekend involved one ""no"" after another. -- Reid said Saturday that the plan Collins was assembling is no longer on the table, because it treated reopening the government as a ""concession."" Reid continues to demand that any plan include a ""clean"" bill, one that raises the debt limit and reopens the government with no strings attached. -- Republicans blocked a measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached, refusing to support a procedural vote that would have brought it to the Senate floor. -- House Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week extension of the federal debt ceiling. -- Meanwhile, Republicans objected to the prospect being floated over the weekend that the forced spending cuts known as sequestration, which have cut deeply into federal operations since March, might be rolled back under any eventual deal. Reid said that proposal ""is not anything that came from us."" The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1. And Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the momentum that seemed to be building last week toward a resolution has stalled. ""I do think we will see our way through this, but the last 24 hours have not been good,"" he said. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. She spoke to CNN's Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington. ""You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn't say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy,"" Lagarde said. Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown . 7 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Obama spoke by phone with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Sunday to discuss the ongoing battle over the shutdown, the White House said. The two agreed on the need for a ""clean debt limit increase"" and a ""clean continuing resolution to open up the government and end the shutdown."" Mindful that October 17 is just days away, House Republican leaders are considering all of their options even as Republican and Democratic Senate leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling, a GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN. One option Republican leaders are considering is sending back a measure to the Senate that would increase the debt limit; exactly what it would contain is unknown at this time. But the aide noted that the House is able to move quicker than the Senate, and this idea could come into play. If a decision were made to pursue this idea, then it would require Democratic support to pass in the House. Senate Democrats meet with president . Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon, and a Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified. ""Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills,"" said the aide. Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can ""cut through the clutter,"" the source told CNN's Dana Bash. The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly. Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made. ""I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans,"" he said. Will 2014 election solve anything? Even as he demanded a ""clean"" bill, Reid said he and McConnell are involved in ""cordial"" and ""preliminary"" discussions. ""I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world,"" Reid said. He said McConnell had approached him. ""This hasn't happened until now,"" Reid said.

"(CNN) -- Jeff Jones started shopping for health insurance as soon as the Obamacare insurance marketplaces opened on October 1. The Kentucky resident is like a lot LGBT citizens who have not had access to affordable health insurance in the past. If Jones, 47, had been able to legally marry, he would have immediately been eligible for coverage under his partner, Nathan Walker's, policy. Walker has domestic partnership benefits at work, but the couple haven't lived together long enough to qualify for them. ""I'm a diabetic, so I do want to make sure I'm covered,"" Jones said. Jones says he isn't the only person he knows in Lexington's LGBT community shopping for health insurance. Many have turned to Jones, who used to work in public health, for casual advice. ""A lot of what I've found with these exchanges is confusing, and I've got a Ph.D. -- and experience with insurance,"" Jones said. ""There are many individuals who don't have a lot of education, and these terms are completely new to them. It's daunting."" Obamacare navigators help patients sign up for health . As a whole the LGBT community has less experience with insurance than the general population. A survey done by the Center for American Progress found that about a third of respondents were uninsured. It's estimated some 16.3% of the general population is uninsured. In honor of National Coming Out Day on Friday, Out2Enroll's ""Be Out. Be Healthy. Get Covered"" campaign has launched a new LGBT-friendly website with advice about how to navigate the insurance marketplace. Kellan Baker, who heads the program, did focus groups and surveys with several hundred LGBT people and heard serious concerns about the current health care system. ""We've heard from people that health care is fundamental,"" Baker said. ""Yet we wanted to make sure we weren't steering the community to something that wouldn't work for them. We wanted to make sure the policies in place will be inclusive of the community."" While the community is not monolithic, it does struggle with some particular health challenges that become much more deadly if a lack of health insurance keeps them from regular checkups. For instance, studies show lesbians are less likely than other women to get routine screenings that could detect cervical and breast cancer. A woman's chances of surviving go up significantly if the cancers are caught early. Men who have sex with men -- the clinical term for gay men -- account for 63% of the estimated new HIV infections in 2010, according to the CDC. Regular HIV testing could help stop the spread of the virus. In light of this challenge, the Obama administration called a meeting of LGBT leaders in mid-September. Nearly 200 from across the country met with the White House to talk about the potential impact of Obamacare. It also looked at what LGBT leaders could do to spread the word. ""The purpose of this briefing was to equip community leaders with the tools, information and resources they need to get involved and help local LGBT communities get access to quality, affordable health care,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said. Obamacare ""is not about politics. It's about dignity."" Young and healthy needed to make Obamacare mandate . Out2Enroll worked with the administration to make sure the Obamacare law is completely LGBT inclusive. In years past, insurance companies were not required to allow coverage of domestic partners. Now marketplaces will offer policies that are inclusive and domestic partnership benefits will be clearly spelled out. The law also prevents insurance companies from turning someone away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. In Out2Enroll's focus groups they heard horror stories about companies turning applicants away because they didn't want to cover gay or transgender people. Before the Affordable Care Act, people with pre-existing conditions often couldn't get coverage. Now people with illnesses that involve ongoing treatment like HIV or with a chronic illness like Jones' diabetes will be able to get access to health insurance. Finally there will be no lifetime caps on coverage, which is particularly important to those who require constant checkups and who take medicine for chronic conditions. Obamacare open enrollment: Everything you need to know . Preventative care like counseling for obesity, drug treatment, smoking cessation programs and mental health are mandatory for insurance companies to cover under Obamacare. All could help the LGBT community. Studies show lesbians and bisexual women have a higher rate of stress, smoking and obesity than the general population. They're also at risk for heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death for women. Gay men also have a high rate of stress, smoking and substance abuse, studies show. Now with the marketplaces open, LGBT groups across the country are doing their bit to spread the word. Many have received grants and special training to help with this process. Open enrollment for the Obamacare insurance marketplaces runs through March 31. But to get covered by January 1 -- the deadline for everyone in the country to have insurance -- you must pay for a policy by December 15. People with lower incomes will get subsidies or tax breaks to buy them if they shop through the Obamacare marketplaces. In some states they may also qualify for Medicaid, which some chose to expand. Sean Cahill, director of health policy research at the Fenway Health Institute in Boston that focuses on LGBT health, says it will continue to spread the word about the Obamacare marketplaces. ""There are barriers that will finally be done away with in January; it's a great thing,"" Cahill said. ""We really want to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act and get the number of insured up and get our access to care numbers up, or at least on par with what the straight community experiences. There are so many opportunities here."" Doctor shortage, increased demand could crash health care . Unemployed since June, Jeff Jones is covered by COBRA insurance, but it comes with a steep price tag of a couple hundred dollars a month. ""I'm starting to realize just how good my policy was through work,"" Jones said. ""I used to only pay $26 a month, now next to my mortgage this is the biggest bill I have."" Jones says he will continue shopping around for the policy that will work best for him. He said the system crashed a couple of times when he was looking at it, but the navigators he called were nice. They, too, struggled to help, since their computers also kept crashing. Jones says he is undeterred. ""I'm pretty optimistic it will work,"" Jones said. ""And I will feel better knowing that I'm covered.""","Number of LGBT people without insurance is disproportionate to the general population .
About a third of LGBT survey respondents were uninsured .

"London, England (CNN) -- Whovians across the world can rejoice as the BBC confirms the discovery of nine lost ""Doctor Who"" episodes from the 1960s in Africa. The treasure-trove of missing episodes were traced to a relay station in Jos, Nigeria via Hong Kong using overseas shipment records by Philip Morris, director of Television International Enterprises Archive. ""I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words 'Doctor Who,'"" said Morris. ""When I read the story code I realized I'd found something pretty special."" Ending weeks of speculation, the announcement was made at a press screening in London Thursday attended by former companion actors Frazer Hines, Deborah Watling -- who appeared in the recovered episodes -- and Mark Gatiss, who has both written and acted in the show in recent years. The lost black and white stories are episodes from ""The Enemy of the World"" and ""The Web of Fear"" featuring Patrick Troughton as the second iteration of the time-traveling Doctor. The ""Web of Fear"" -- first broadcast in 1968 -- sees the eccentric chrononaut battling robot yetis on the London Underground and was also the first appearance of Nicholas Courtney as Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart. While introducing the episode in front of around 70 excited reporters Gatiss said: ""It's the quintessential 'Doctor Who' story ... the most British thing you could ever imagine."" During the 1960s it was common practice by television companies to erase videotapes of original episodes much to the dismay of fans today. Yet some classic installments were distributed internationally for foreign broadcasters to purchase. In 2011, two episodes were rediscovered by former TV engineer Terry Burnett after he bought them at a school fair. Morris described the newly materialized episodes as ""the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last 25, maybe 30 years"" and now brings down the number of remaining lost episodes to 97. The find is a fitting gift for fans of the long-running show as the British cult science-fiction series celebrates its 50th anniversary on November 23.

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Guardedly positive tones were sounded Tuesday as Iran and six world powers met in Geneva for the first of two days of talks about Iran's nuclear ambitions -- talks conducted amid a spirit of new optimism since President Hassan Rouhani took office this summer. Iran, which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits, laid out confidential proposals in the morning. A spokesman for the European Union's foreign policy chief called the presentation ""very useful."" The two-day talks in Geneva bring together Iran's representatives with those from the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Talks continued in the afternoon, and will resume on Wednesday. ""For the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said. Ahead of the talks: U.S. hopeful but 'clear-eyed' Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who is taking a lead role in the negotiations, said Tuesday that the ""negotiation's environment was positive,"" according to Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency. Many in the West fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb, but Iran -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is chairwoman for the talks for the P5+1 bloc, while Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is leading the Iranian delegation. Ahead of Tuesday's meeting, Zarif said he hoped that together, Iran and the West would be able to work out a ""road map"" toward a final resolution by Wednesday. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said that the mood was one of ""cautious optimism"" but that the ""ball is in Iran's court"" to respond to the bloc's concerns. The P5+1 bloc put forward its own proposals at a meeting with Iran in Kazakhstan in the spring, and these remain on the table, Mann told reporters earlier. 'Verifiably proven' The talks, which are being conducted in English for the first time, are due to last two days, but the timetable is fluid, Mann said. ""We have said we want Iran to engage constructively with proposals we have put forward. Or, if they want to, they can come up with their own proposals,"" he said. ""What matters is the end result -- that they address the international community's concerns about the purely peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program. ""We have to reach a situation at the end where they have proven, and verifiably proven, that there is no nuclear military program. That is the end result that is being sought."" The Iranians' PowerPoint presentation, laid out in English, was titled ""Closing Unnecessary Crisis, Opening New Horizons."" Araqchi said Iran's goal is to guarantee its citizens' rights to ""enjoy nuclear energy, including enrichment, along with the verification of its peaceful program,"" according to the Fararu news agency. Critics have expressed suspicions about Iran's uranium enrichment, fearing that Iran may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb-grade materials. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama and a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Zarif. Iran nuclear talks are key topic as Obama, Netanyahu meet . It was the first such high-level contact between the two sworn enemies since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze. Israel: Don't relax sanctions too early . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the international community not to relax too soon the painful economic sanctions that have put Iran's leaders under ""intense pressure"" to return to talks. ""I think it would be a historic mistake to ease the sanctions when they are so close to achieving their goals,"" he said. ""Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's military nuclear program. ""This opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on Iran, because it is that pressure that has brought Iran back to the negotiations in the first place. And it is that pressure which makes the peaceful dismantling of Iran's military nuclear program possible."" Iran's president: We're open to nuclear talks, but don't make threats . Israel's Security Cabinet also warned Tuesday against conceding too much too soon to the Iranians. ""Israel does not oppose Iran having peaceful nuclear energy. This does not require uranium enrichment or plutonium. Iran's nukes prog does,"" Netanyahu spokesman Ofir Gendelman said via Twitter. Could Revolutionary Guards sabotage Iran-U.S. thaw? A country that ""regularly deceives the international community"" does not have a ""right to enrich"" as Iran claims, he said. A senior Obama administration official told reporters in Geneva that the administration would be willing to consider quick relief on sanctions ""targeted in proportion"" to what Iran puts on the table, should it be prepared to curtail the pace and scope of its uranium enrichment program, offer steps to improve transparency of its nuclear program, and address concerns about its stockpile of enriched uranium. Larijani: 'We are ready' Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is keen to resolve the issue ""in a short period of time,"" Larijani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Geneva. ""From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,"" he said. Rouhani: Nuclear weapons have no place in Iran's security . ""If the Americans and other countries say that Iran should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that, then we can clearly show and prove that. We have no such intention. So it can be resolved in a very short period of time."" Nonetheless, Larijani said, the West must accept Iran's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes, as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iran is a signatory. Building trust . Some believe that Iran's recent apparent willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program is a result of the crippling sanctions on its economy. Shortly after this year's U.N. General Assembly ended, a U.S. State Department official said the United States would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on Iran if it took confidence-building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its nuclear program. But this will take time and the building of trust. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is in Geneva, stressed that the entire sanctions regime targeting Iran would not be lifted ""any time soon"" unless the array of concerns about Iran's nuclear program was fully addressed. CNN's Jim Sciutto reported from Geneva, Elise Labott from Washington, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Andrew Carey and journalist Banafsheh Keynoush contributed to this report.","Iran presents plan to delegates from six world powers in Geneva .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The widower of actress Brittany Murphy, found dead in his home Sunday night, was scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery this summer, a spokesman for the actress' mother said. British screenwriter Simon Monjack, 39, was pronounced dead after the Los Angeles Fire Department was called to his Hollywood home for a medical emergency, police said. There were no signs of foul play or criminal activity in the death, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alex Ortiz said. Roger Neal, a spokesman for Murphy's mother, Sharon, said Monjack delayed the heart surgery until after a fundraising gala for the Brittany Murphy Foundation in September. Murphy, his wife of less than three years, died just five months ago. Sharon Murphy found Monjack unconscious in his bedroom and called the fire department, a family friend said. An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's spokeswoman. Sharon Murphy, who shared the house with Monjack, ""loved him like a son"" and is devastated by his death, Neal said. It is the same Hollywood Hills home where Brittany Murphy lived. Murphy, 32, died in December from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and used to treat a respiratory infection, according to an autopsy. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" Monjack and Murphy were married in May 2007. The couple had no children. The foundation's gala, which still may be held, was organized to raise money for children to study music, dance and other arts, Neal said.","NEW: Simon Monjack postponed bypass surgery, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- An enduring legacy of the Great Recession has been the return to a profound sense of family. This was evident in polls throughout the downturn. Yet no one really knew if the feeling would stick in a recovery. Now four years into an expansion, new research from Merrill Lynch and research firm Age Wave suggests that family togetherness remains a powerful trend. So powerful that Merrill is rethinking its approach to serving clients, putting special emphasis on the needs of extended family members and how that factors into long-term financial planning. After a century of being torn apart by industrialization and job mobility, ""families are coming back together,"" says Andy Sieg, head of Global Wealth and Retirement Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""We're seeing a new level of generosity and willingness to help family members."" Six in 10 Americans past the age of 50 provide financial support to adult family members, according to the Merrill/Age Wave report ""Family & Retirement: The Elephant in the Room."" Most commonly this support goes adult children (68%). But 26% support grandchildren, 16% support parents, 13% support siblings and 14% support other relatives. TIME.com: Your grandma's favorite store reinvents itself as hip, experimental retailer . The level of financial assistance generally rises with ability, and the amounts can be substantial. The average level of family financial support is $14,900 a year. But those with at least $500,000 of liquid assets contribute an average $34,100 to family members each year. Baby boomers are the original sandwich generation, and it seems they just can't shake the financial pull of both their kids and their parents. This pull increasingly includes demands on their time as well as their money as elders require personal care giving. The Hartford found that 68% of boomers have missed work in the last six months due to care-giving duties. Yet the 50-plus population seems be rolling with it. The Merrill survey found that: . The vast majority who offer financial support do not expect anything in return. Only one in 10 stop helping family because it becomes clear they will not be repaid. In many cases (36%) they give without even asking how the money will be spent. Many 50-plus folks would make big sacrifices to help a family member with money. Three in five would delay retiring; two in five would go back to work if necessary; one in three would live more modestly in order to help out. Most value the intrinsic rewards of helping. They either feel more appreciated (54%), generous (36%) or proud (24%). Yet one in five say they feel taken advantage of. These findings throw a largely unforeseen wrinkle into retirement planning: the costs of helping those dearest to you. Most boomers simply plan for their own needs and adjust when they are thrust into the role of the family bank, which happens far more frequently than is generally expected. TIME.com: turkey drought? Bacon crisis? Don't believe the hype . Confronted with the reality of having to provide for a family member, the rate of those 50-plus who feel financially ready for retirement plummets from 33% to 9%--and remember that more than half end up in this situation. What can you do about it? If you have the means, build this expense into your retirement planningâ€”or understand that you may end up working longer or living more modestly than you thought. But you might also set limits on how much you are willing to help and communicate those limits within the family. That way no one gets surprised or hurt, and you can truly plan for the day when you call it quits for good. Are you helping an older family member, financially?

"(CNN) -- It is hard for me to recall a victory as total -- or surrender as ignominious -- as the Great Shutdown Showdown of 2013. Room S-230 of the U.S. Capitol, the office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is where the final deal was struck, and it will join Appomattox, the USS Missouri and Waterloo as the site of an unconditional surrender. They ought to put up a plaque where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delivered the tea partying Republicans their worst whipping in a generation. I'm not sure I have fully absorbed all we have been through these past two weeks in Washington. The 15-day shutdown saw a deadly shooting at the Capitol, a self-immolation on the National Mall, a citizen waving the Confederate battle flag in front of the White House and World War II veterans storming one last barricade. No one could have predicted all of that. But the outcome itself was a foregone conclusion. Republicans were seeking an unattainable goal: Repealing Obamacare during the presidency of Barack Obama. They were sure to fail. But the circumstances of their defeat -- and the Democratic hero who has emerged -- are worth noting. Faithful readers of my columns in this space will recall that I predicted the President would prevail in the government shutdown because his party is more united, more mainstream and more reasonable. And, while our President undoubtedly triumphed -- showing a steely resolve that critics thought he lacked -- the undisputed heavyweight champion of the shutdown showdown is Reid. He truly is the King of the Hill. While the House GOP conference exploded like the finale of a fireworks show, Reid held together a Senate Democratic Caucus that is significantly more diverse. From Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a socialist, to West Virginia's Joe Manchin -- who is so conservative that he shot a rifle at an environmental bill in one of his ads -- Reid kept his forces united. Calling Reid an ex-boxer is like calling John McCain an ex-naval officer; you really never depart from those deeply ingrained traits. In the gym at Basic High in Henderson, Nevada, Reid learned to box. He learned how to explore your opponent's defenses, how to probe with a jab, when to feint and when to cover up. And when you have your opponent on the ropes, you finish him off. Unlike the solitary sport of boxing, politics is a team effort, and Reid led his team with brilliance and bravery. Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Obama are three very different kinds of leaders. And yet they were yoked together in perfect balance; one would lean in while another held back; one would hold an olive branch while a third would talk tough. The poor Republicans were divided between the realists, who were depressed, and the true believers, who were delusional. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would strut and admire his plumage, while House Speaker John Boehner alternated between feckless and hapless. In the end it was McConnell who performed last rites on the corpse of Repeal Obamacare. To be sure, no victory is ever final. No defeat is ever permanent. Republicans went on to hold the House after their disastrous shutdown of 1995-96, and Obama rebounded from what he called ""a shellacking"" in the midterm elections of 2010 to win re-election comfortably in 2012. Reid understands that. He has been a student of politics and a creature of the Hill since he worked his way through law school as a Capitol police officer. You won't see him dancing around the ring, holding his championship belt over his head. Perhaps he'll have a quiet dinner with his beloved Landra. Then begin training for his next fight.

"(CNN) -- In Roger Federer's last tournament, he lost at the U.S. Open to a player he had beaten 10 straight times. Federer returned to the singles court at the Shanghai Masters on Wednesday and in defeating Andreas Seppi, ensured that another long winning streak didn't come to an end. Whereas Federer was upset by Tommy Robredo in New York five weeks ago, he improved to 10-0 against Seppi by downing the Italian 6-4 6-3. Having dipped to seventh in the rankings, Federer needs wins to ensure his participation at the year-end championships in London in November. He has appeared at the marquee event every year since 2002. Federer hasn't dwelled on his defeat to Robredo -- he told reporters this week he didn't want to think too much about it -- and is already looking forward to a ""great"" 2014 to dampen any talk of retirement. The Swiss veteran was certainly sharper against Seppi than Robredo, especially after overturning an early break deficit in the first set. Both players, however, hit more unforced errors than winners in Asia's top men's tournament. Federer was the overwhelming crowd favorite, with fans chanting, ""in, in, in"" when the 17-time grand slam champion challenged a forehand he hit that was called wide. ""It was great energy, I must say,"" Federer told reporters. ""It gives me unbelievable motivation, inspires me to train hard, work hard, push further for that particular day, but also wanting to come back again next year, and again and again."" Rafael Nadal watched part of his great rival's match and was mobbed by fans wanting his autograph. He obliged. The Spaniard, back to top spot in the rankings this week after a two-year absence, also advanced in straight sets over Alexandr Dolgopolov. The man he deposed as No. 1 did the same against Marcel Granollers. Novak Djokovic, the top seed because the Shanghai draw was made last week, needed a medical timeout for a foot problem but still thrashed Granollers 6-2 6-0. ""It was just an awkward movement,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""I was in an off-balance position. I was running and I made a quick movement that caused a sharp pain at that instant moment."" ""But after the match we determined that it's nothing serious, so it's all fine."" Murray withdraws from London . When Andy Murray announced he would be undergoing back surgery last month, it was thought the Wimbledon champion wouldn't return until 2014. But according to reports last week, Murray considered coming back at the year-end championships on home soil after a successful operation. Alas, Murray ruled out that possibility Wednesday. ""I'm really disappointed not to be playing this year,"" Murray told the ATP's website. ""I love playing in front of my home crowd. It's a great atmosphere. ""All the players look forward to competing in London and I'll be doing my best to qualify again for the tournament next year."" His withdrawal realistically means that five players -- Federer, Stanislas Wawrinka, Richard Gasquet, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga -- are vying for the final two spots in the eight-man field. All four have advanced to the third round in Shanghai except Gasquet, who fell Tuesday to Raonic's Canadian compatriot Vasek Pospisil. Wawrinka, who reached the last four in New York, meets Raonic on Thursday.","Roger Federer wins his first singles match since the U.S. Open by beating Andreas Seppi .

"(CNN) -- Young people around the world love their cell phones -- and a new Nielsen report sheds light on which phones they're using, how they choose their phones, and how they use them. The report focused on youth ages 15-24 from Brazil, Russia, India, China, Vietnam, Germany, Spain, Italy, the UK and the U.S. Some highlights: . In all countries studied, the majority of young mobile users own feature phones (basic phones that don't run apps) -- which isn't surprising, since they indicated that price is the main driver in their purchase decision (except for Russia, where design was ranked as slightly more important). In the U.S., only 33% of young mobile users have smartphones. Italy had the highest smartphone penetration among youth (47%), and India had the lowest (10%). One surprise: Most young U.S. smartphone users (55%) are female. In every other country studied, most young smartphone users are male. Across all types of phones, China and the U.S. have the most young users who use advanced mobile data services. ""84% percent of Chinese youth use their phones beyond voice and text, compared to 47 percent of Chinese adults."" said the report. Meanwhile: ""83% of U.S. youth use advanced data -- 32% higher than U.S. adults."" But in terms of mobile Web usage, Chinese youth are leading the way: 73% of young Chinese mobile users access the Web from their phone. Young American mobile users, while in second place, are far behind -- only 48% report using the mobile Web. The report took a special look at U.S. teen texting. ""If it seems like American teens [ages 13-17] are texting all the time, it's probably because on average they're sending or receiving 3,339 texts a month. That's more than six per hour they're awake -- an 8% jump from last year,"" said the report. Teen girls are doing most of that texting, the report said -- they send and receive an average of 4,050 texts per month. Who pays for young people's cell phones? This varies by age. In the U.S., only 27% of mobile users aged 15-19 pay for their own service; in Germany and Brazil, that figure is 56%. But once German and Brazilian mobile users reach the 20-24 age group, those numbers jump to 84% and 82%, respectively. For U.S. mobile users aged 20-24, 45% are paying their own mobile phone bills. Which is a bit surprising: Are most U.S. families really willing to foot the mobile bill for a 24-year-old? How do young people pay for their phones? In Russia, a whopping 98% of young mobile users have prepaid phone plans; in the U.S., only 19% do. However, prepaid plans are more common and diverse in most countries outside the U.S.; so this might not be solely an age-related issue.","A new Nielsen report focuses on cell phone use by youth ages 15-24 from all over the world .

"(CNN) -- Country music star Randy Travis, who pleaded no contest to public intoxication following the Super Bowl in February, was arrested again Tuesday after being found naked, smelling apparently of alcohol and lying on a remote stretch of roadway in northern Texas just before midnight, authorities said. He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated and felony retaliation, after allegedly threatening to fatally shoot highway patrol troopers who responded to a concerned caller who notified authorities of ""a man lying in the roadway"" Tuesday. The DWI offense is a misdemeanor, authorities said. While in custody, Travis allegedly threatened ""to shoot and kill the troopers working the case,"" Sgt. Rickey Wheeler of the Grayson County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Read more entertainment news on CNN's Marquee Blog . Travis, 53, allegedly refused to take a blood and breath test, and was later forced to submit to a judge's order for a blood specimen taken at a nearby hospital, Wheeler said. Travis was driving his black 1998 Pontiac Trans Am when the vehicle drove off the north side of a two-lane highway just west of Tioga, where he resides, and struck several barricades in a construction zone, said Texas Highway Patrol Trooper Mark Tackett. Travis was the only occupant in the one-vehicle crash, authorities said. Travis was found naked, Tackett said. When Travis was brought to Grayson County jail at 3 a.m., after the hospital visit, he still didn't have clothes, Wheeler said. ""He was given a paper suit, which is a jail uniform made out of paper,"" Wheeler told CNN. Travis was released from Grayson County jail after an acquaintance posted his $21,500 bail in cash at 10:40 a.m. Wednesday, Wheeler said. It's not clear whether Travis was injured in the accident, though his mug shot revealed a bruised right eye and several abrasions on his face. Neither Travis nor his representative could be reached for comment Wednesday. Travis, who has sold more than 20 million records, has won seven Grammy Awards, 10 Academy of Country Music statuettes, 10 American Music Awards, seven Music City News awards, five Country Music Association honors and eight Dove Awards from the Gospel Music Association, according to his website. Travis has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1986, his website said. Travis is now commemorating 25 years of making music with an Anniversary Celebration CD, which also features Country Music Hall of Fame members Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson; also on the CD are Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw and Don Henley, among other stars, his website said. In February, Travis was arrested for public intoxication while sitting in his car in front of a church in Sanger, Texas. On June 25, Travis' attorney entered a no-contest plea on the singer's behalf before Sanger Municipal Court Judge Kenneth Hartless, court administrator Christy Punches told CNN. Travis didn't appear in court, she added. Travis paid a $264 fine and was placed on a 90-day deferred, or probationary, status, Punches said. ""It's like a 90-day probation,"" she said. The 90-day probation period expires September 23, when the ticket violation will be erased from his record as long as Travis doesn't commit another offense in Denton County, Punches said. Travis' alleged offense this week won't impact his probation in Sanger because the incident occurred in another county in Texas, Punches said. Public intoxication, a class C violation of the municipal code, is an offense typically disposed of by the Sanger courts with a fine and a 90-day probation, Punches said. ""It's just a fine-only offense,"" Punches said. In February, Sanger police found a vehicle parked in front of a Baptist church in the very early morning hours and, upon investigation, discovered Travis in the car with an open bottle of wine, the Denton County Sheriff's Office told CNN. Police said the singer smelled of alcohol, the sheriff's office said. Travis was arrested and taken to the Denton County jail, sheriff's spokeman Tom Reedy told CNN on Wednesday. Travis was given a citation and held because of intoxication until 7:44 a.m., at which time he was released, Reedy told CNN. ""When somebody is intoxicated, you just don't let them go,"" Reedy said. ""They have to come in and be here for so many hours. It was a citation. It wasn't a DWI. It was public intoxication."" Travis listed his city of residence as Tioga, Texas, Reedy said. ""I apologize for what resulted following an evening of celebrating the Super Bowl,"" Travis told CNN in a statement after the February arrest. ""I'm committed to being responsible and accountable, and apologize for my actions."" Comments: Randy Travis, how did 'such a talented guy end up in a mug shot like that'?

"(Mental Floss) -- Perhaps your history teachers failed to alert you to these Civil War facts: Jefferson Davis nearly got mugged by an angry female mob; Abraham Lincoln loved the Confederate anthem ""Dixie,"" and Paul Revere was a Civil War casualty. ""Dixie"" was was a huge hit across the country and quickly became one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite tunes. The Civil War, in addition to being among the defining moments of U.S. history, is also the source of some bizarre and surprisingly cool trivia. 1. Lincoln's first solution to slavery was a fiasco . Early in his presidency, Abe was convinced that white Americans would never accept black Americans. ""You and we are different races,"" the president told a committee of ""colored"" leaders in August 1862. ""...But for your race among us there could not be war...It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated."" Lincoln proposed voluntary emigration to Central America, seeing it as a more convenient destination than Liberia. This idea didn't sit well with leaders like Frederick Douglass, who considered colonization to be ""a safety valve...for white racism."" Luckily for Douglass (and the country), colonization failed spectacularly. One of the first attempts was on Île à Vache, a.k.a. Cow Island, a small isle off the coast of Haiti. The island was owned by land developer Bernard Kock, who claimed he had approved a black American colony with the Haitian government. No one bothered to call him on that claim. Following a smallpox outbreak on the boat ride down, hundreds of black colonizers were abandoned on the island with no housing prepared for them, as Kock had promised. To make matters worse, the soil on Cow Island was too poor for any serious agriculture. In January 1864, the Navy rescued the survivors from the ripoff colony. Once Île à Vache fell through, Lincoln never spoke of colonization again.Mental Floss: 6 Historical Events People Love to Reenact . 2. Hungry ladies effectively mugged Jefferson Davis . The Confederacy's image hinged on the notion that the rebellious states made up a unified, stable nation. However, the hard times of war exposed just how much disunity there was in Dixieland. Civilians in both the North and South had to cope with scarcity and increased food prices, but the food situation was especially bad in the South because outcomes on the battlefield were directly linked to the CSA's currency -- rising food prices were hard enough to deal with without wild fluctuations in what the money in your pocket could buy. Invading northern troops, of course, poured salt on the wounds of scarcity, burning crops and killing livestock. But in Richmond, Virginia, those who couldn't afford the increasingly pricey food blamed the Confederate government. Hungry protesters, most of whom were women, led a march ""to see the governor"" in April 1863 that quickly turned violent. They overturned carts, smashed windows, and drew out Governor John Letcher and President Jefferson Davis. Davis threw money at the protesters, trying to get them to clear out, but the violence continued. So, he threatened to order the militia to open fire, which settled things down pretty quickly. 3. The Union used hot air balloons and submarines . The balloons, directed by aeronaut Thaddeus Lowe, were used to spot enemy soldiers and coordinate Federal troop movements. During his first battlefield flight, at First Bull Run, Lowe landed behind Confederate lines, but he was rescued. The Union Army Balloon Corps got no respect from military officials, and Lowe resigned when he was assigned to serve, at a lower pay grade, under the director of the Army Corps of Engineers. In all, the balloonists were active for a little under two years. Mental Floss: 7 Modern Flying Car Designs . In contrast, the paddle-powered Alligator submarine saw exactly zero days of combat (which is why it can't officially be called the U.S.S. Alligator). It suffered from some early testing setbacks, but after some speed-boosting tweaks, it was dispatched for Port Royal, South Carolina, with an eye towards aiding in the sack of Charleston. It was to be towed south by the U.S.S. Sumpter, but it had to be cut loose off of North Carolina on April 2, 1863, when bad weather struck. Divers and historians are still looking for the Alligator today. But the undersea capers don't end there. A few months after the loss of the Alligator, the CSA launched their own submarine, the H.L. Hunley, named after its inventor. The Hunley attacked and sank the U.S.S. Housatonic off the coast of Charleston, making it the first submarine ever to sink an enemy ship. The only problem is that it also sank soon afterwards, and all eight crewmen drowned. 4. ""Dixie"" was only a northern song . The precise details of when composer Dan Emmett wrote ""Dixie"" seemed to change every time he told the story (and some even dispute that Emmett was the author in the first place). But he first performed it in New York City in 1859, with the title ""I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land."" Emmett was a member of a blackface troupe known as the Bryant's Minstrels, but he was indignant when he found out that his song had become an unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. He went on to write a musicians' marching manual for the Northern army. Before and during the war, the song was a huge hit in New York and across the country, and quickly became one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite tunes. The day after the Surrender at Appomattox, Lincoln told a crowd of Northern revelers, ""I have always thought 'Dixie' was one of the best tunes I have ever heard. Our adversaries over the way attempted to appropriate it, but I insisted yesterday that we fairly captured it."" He then asked a nearby band to play it in celebration. 5. Paul Revere was at Gettysburg . Paul Joseph Revere, that is the famous Paul Revere's grandson. Unfortunately for fans of the first Revere and his partly mythical Ride, PJR was in the infantry, not the cavalry, with the 20th Massachusetts. He and his brother Edward were captured at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861. After being released in a prisoner exchange, the Reveres rejoined the fight. Paul was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in September, 1862, shortly before he was wounded in the brutal Battle of Antietam (a.k.a. the Battle of Sharpsburg). Edward, however, wasn't so lucky -- he was one of more than 2,000 Union soldiers who didn't make it out of Sharpsburg, Maryland, alive. By the following year, Paul was promoted again to Colonel, leading the 20th Massachusetts at Chancellorsville and, in his final days, at Gettysburg. On July 3, 1863, he was mortally wounded by a shell fragment that pierced his lung, and he died the next day. He was posthumously promoted again to Brigadier General, and is buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Mental Floss: 10 Things to Remember About Memorial Day . 6. Mark Twain fired one shot and then left . At least, that's what he claimed in ""The Private History of a Campaign that Failed,"" a semi-fictional short story published in 1885, after The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but before A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. In it, he recounts a whopping two weeks spent in 1861 with a Confederate militia in Marion County, Missouri. But he introduces the tale by saying that even the people who enlisted at the start of the war, and then left permanently, ""ought at least be allowed to state why they didn't do anything and also to explain the process by which they didn't do anything. Surely this kind of light must have some sort of value."" Twain writes that there were fifteen men in the rebel militia, the ""Marion Rangers,"" and he was the second lieutenant, even though they had no first lieutenant. After Twain's character shoots and kills a Northern horseback rider, he is overwhelmed by the sensation of being a murderer, ""that I had killed a man, a man who had never done me any harm. That was the coldest sensation that ever went through my marrow."" However, his grief is slightly eased by the realization that six men had fired their guns, and only one had been able to hit the moving target. 7. The armies weren't all-male . Hundreds of women on both sides pulled a Mulan, assuming male identities and appearances so that they might fight for their respective nations. Some of them did it for adventure, but many did it for monetary reasons: the pay for a male soldier was about $13 month, which was close to double what a woman could make in any profession at the time. Also, being a man gave someone a lot more freedoms than just being able to wear pants. Remember, this was still more than half a century away from women's suffrage and being a man meant that you could manage your monthly $13 wages independently. So it should come as no surprise that many of these women kept up their aliases long after the war had ended, some even to the grave. Their presence in soldiers' ranks wasn't the best-kept secret. Some servicewomen kept up correspondence with the home front after they changed their identities, and for decades after the war newspapers ran article after article chronicling the stories of woman soldiers, and speculating on why they might break from the accepted gender norms. Perhaps not surprisingly, in 1909 the U.S. Army denied that ""any woman was ever enlisted in the military service of the United States as a member of any organization of the Regular or Volunteer Army at any time during the period of the civil war.""

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman was the star witness Thursday in his trial for the death of Trayvon Martin -- for the prosecution, not in his defense. Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda tried to use the defendant's words against him, hoping to convince a jury that now has one more option than it once had: It can convict Zimmerman of manslaughter, or the original second-degree murder charge, after a decision earlier Thursday by Judge Debra Nelson. The third option is acquittal. No one else saw the February 26, 2012, altercation between Zimmerman and Martin. After that, the 17-year-old couldn't give his side. But Zimmerman has. And, de La Rionda argued Thursday, Zimmerman account that he was attacked and fired his gun because he feared for his life doesn't hold up. ""He brought a gun to a struggle, to a fight that he started ... wanting to make sure the victim didn't get away,"" the prosecutor said. ""And now he wants you to let him off because he killed the only eyewitness, the victim Trayvon Martin, who was being followed by this man."" The now 29-year-old Zimmerman declined to testify Wednesday, when his defense team rested its case, but his words were front-and-center Thursday. De la Rionda played in court excerpts of interviews Zimmerman had given to police and in the media, then picked them apart. He said that they showed that the defendant can't be trusted, suggesting that his account from that evening in Sanford, Florida, doesn't mesh with reality. ""(Zimmerman) always has an excuse, or they catch him in a lie,"" de la Rionda said. How, the prosecutor said, does a neighborhood watch volunteer not know the names of that neighborhood's three streets, getting out of his car to find an address? Why would a scared man get out of his car and walk around, after being told by a 911 dispatcher not to follow a man he thought was suspicious? Did Zimmerman walk toward Martin, or did Martin come after him -- as he seemingly said both? Should he have had more than a bloody nose and scratches on his head after being pummeled? On Friday, it will be the defense's turn, with lead attorney Mark O'Mara spending up to three hours giving a closing argument. After that, the prosecution will have as long as one hour to give a rebuttal argument. And then, likely sometime Friday, Zimmerman's fate will be in the hands of the six jurors, all of them women. Police urge calm as verdict nears . In his final words Thursday, de la Rionda reminded them that, while Zimmerman still has hope, there's no more special moments for, there can be no more photos of Martin. ""And that's true because of the actions of one person,"" he said. ""The man before me. The man who is guilty of second-degree murder."" Judge: Jury can consider manslaughter charge . What happened to Martin -- and whether Zimmerman was justified in shooting him -- has been debated intently for a year and a half. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, talked with police but wasn't arrested immediately after he admitted to the shooting. But in short time, community members and activists rallied against him -- claiming that Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had racially profiled the African-American teenager, tailed him over the objection of police dispatchers, then wrongly shot him down. The defense, in frequent media appearances by its lawyers and some by Zimmerman and his immediately family members, said that it was wrong to characterize Zimmerman as a racist. He acted to protect his own life, after being repeatedly punched and having his head slammed into the ground, they said. Justice Dept. 'peacekeepers' worked 'Trayvon' rallies, group claims . On June 24, the trial kicked off with opening statements. The prosecution called 38 witnesses in nine days, while the defense took parts of four days to call its witnesses. Some of the testimony appeared contradictory. Take, for instance, the panicked voice yelling for help as heard on the background of a 911 call from that night in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman's parents, Robert and Gladys, both testified that they knew the person screaming was their son. Contrast that to Martin's brother and mother, Sybrina Fulton, with the latter saying was ""absolutely"" certain the voice belonged to her child. For all the back-and-forth during the trial, the early part of Thursday's court proceedings was dominated by debate over what exactly the jury will be deciding. Prosecutors asked that the six women be able to consider manslaughter and third-degree felony murder, in addition to the original second-degree murder charge, in their deliberations. Defense attorney Don West reacted angrily to the third-degree felony murder charge, citing an element in it related to child abuse. ""Oh my God,"" he told Judge Debra Nelson, calling the charge a ""trick."" ""Just when I thought this case couldn't get any more bizarre, the state is seeking third-degree murder based on child abuse."" West also argued against the manslaughter charge, telling Nelson that Zimmerman believes that because the ""state has charged him with second-degree murder, they should be required to prove it, if they can."" In the end, the judge split the difference: The jury can consider manslaughter, but not third-degree felony murder. Having both options is ""enormous,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, especially given that Zimmerman could serve decades in prison on a manslaughter conviction. ""The jury can think to itself, well, ... we're compromising,"" Toobin said. ""If the jury convicts on manslaughter, that would be a win for the prosecution."" Ex-Sanford police chief: Zimmerman probe 'taken away from us' Prosecutor: 'Innocent 17-year-old kid was profiled as a criminal' The debate over the charges set the stage for de la Rionda to give his closing argument. Referencing a widely heard call to police that Zimmerman made to police that night, the prosecutor contended that the defendant was bent on going after Martin -- even if the 911 dispatcher told him otherwise, and even though he never asked the unarmed teen directly what he was doing -- after he spotted him walking through his neighborhood. ""This innocent 17-year-old kid was profiled as a criminal. He was one of those a**holes who get away,"" de la Rionda told jurors. ""He was one of those f***ing punks."" The profane language, de la Rionda argued, offers insight into Zimmerman's mind that winter night -- depicting someone who bore particular malice toward a person he had decided without justification was among the criminals who had plagued his neighborhood in the months leading up to the shooting. That's important, because to find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder, jurors will have to find that he acted with ""ill will, hatred, spite, or an evil intent"" in shooting Martin, according to Florida law. Opinion: What about Martin's right to 'stand his ground?' De la Rionda characterized Zimmerman as a wannabe police officer who wrongly took the law into his own hands and pressed the fatal encounter with Martin. The teenager was ""just doing a normal everyday thing"" -- going to a convenience store to get Skittles and a drink, then walking back to his father's fiancee's home before he ended up dead shortly after 7 p.m., the prosecutor said. ""A teenager is dead through no fault of his own, dead because a man made assumptions and acted on them,"" said de la Rionda. ""Unfortunately, because his assumptions are wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks on the earth."" ""He profiled him as a criminal. He assumed certain things, that Trayvon Martin was up to no good. And that's what led to his death,"" de la Rionda said before going on to attack many defense arguments about what happened that rainy night: . De la Rionda: . -- Argued that Zimmerman, who had taken criminal justice classes, fed police a story of escalating violence and exaggerated fear to meet the standards of Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" self-defense law. -- Questioned Zimmerman's account of Martin straddling him, pounding his head into the pavement and, at one point, covering his mouth and nose with his hands. Why is none of the blood seen on Zimmerman's face found on Martin's hands, he asked. And, if the attack was so violent, why was Zimmerman's jacket in such good shape afterward? -- Asked how was Zimmerman able to scream for help, as he has said he was, if his mouth was filling with blood and he was being smothered by Martin. -- Said the lack of Martin's DNA on Zimmerman's pistol refutes defense arguments that Martin had grabbed the gun during the struggle. Thursday's closing argument also marked the return of the foam, life-sized dummy that famously appeared a day earlier, when O'Mara grappled with it inside the courtroom to show rapt jurors the competing versions of what happened the rainy night Martin was killed. This time it was de la Rionda's turn. Characterizing Zimmerman's account of how Martin had straddled him -- while allegedly punching him, slamming his head and covering his neck and mouth -- the prosecutor questioned how the late teenager could have seen, much less reach for, the gun that Zimmerman said he'd had in a holster inside his waistband. ""The truth does not lie,"" de la Rionda said. ""... So how does he manage to get it out and get a perfect shot to the heart of a 17-year-old man?"" In trial, it's a jury of millions .

""There was no medical care there, (and) I was 350 miles from the nearest doctor,"" said Brock, who was working for a cattle ranch on an open range that spanned Brazil and what is now Guyana. Fortunately, he was able to recover on his own after more than a month. But many other people in the region weren't as lucky. ""When you got things like measles, influenza and malaria,"" Brock said, ""it was just absolutely devastating. ... Millions of people disappeared."" Brock saw this devastation firsthand while he lived among indigenous tribes. After his near-fatal injury, he realized that something had to be done. ""It kind of jarred my thinking into, 'Hey, let's bring these doctors a little bit closer than 26 days on foot,' "" he said. Brock took the initiative, getting his pilot's license and a small plane to bring medical care to the people that he worked with -- and even the animals for which he cared. ""Instead of taking weeks and weeks to get into that place, the airplane could get there in just a few hours,"" he said. ""(If) somebody was badly hurt or injured, we could put them in the back of the airplane and take them somewhere"" for care. In 1985, decades after he first started flying, Brock went the extra step and started a nonprofit, Remote Area Medical. Since then, the all-volunteer group has held more than 660 medical clinics worldwide, providing free health care to half a million people. ""(These) are not the people that can afford to go down the road and pay $300, $400, $500 for an eye exam and a pair of glasses, or sometimes thousands of dollars to get their teeth fixed,"" said Brock, 75. ""The patients ... are so grateful for what we're able to do for them."" From dropout to 'Wild Kingdom' Brock's life reads something like a movie script. When he dropped out of school at 16, he followed his parents from England to what was then British Guiana, where he got a job herding cattle. There, he learned the local language and sometimes went days without food and water. Brock's forte was the lasso, and he was eventually discovered and brought on as a co-host of Mutual of Omaha's ""Wild Kingdom,"" an educational television series that aired in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. (See him challenge a buffalo on YouTube) Today, Brock said, people still come up to him and say ""I grew up watching you on 'Wild Kingdom' "" or ""I became a wildlife biologist or a marine biologist because of watching you on 'Wild Kingdom.' "" But even though his new job made him well-known and allowed him to travel all over the world, he never forgot where he came from. ""I understand what it's like to be penniless, homeless and uninsured,"" Brock said, referring to his cowboy roots. His nonprofit started as a strictly overseas venture, helping the needy in hard-to-reach places. Volunteers would fly into remote regions, sometimes parachuting in, to aid people who didn't have access to medical care. Brock says it wasn't long, however, before he started to get requests for aid in the United States. The first request came in 1992 from Hancock County, a small, rural area in Tennessee. The local hospital had closed, and its only dentist had just left. ""We went up to Hancock County, and there were 100 to 150 people wanting their teeth fixed,"" said Brock. ""We took care of them, (and) it wasn't more than another week before I got the same request from the next county over."" Soon, Brock said, they were so busy in the United States that the group had to cut back on overseas commitments to meet obligations at home. Professionals filling a need -- on their own dime . More than 70,000 people have donated their time and expertise to Brock's cause over the years. Many are full-time doctors and nurses who work at their own practices or hospitals during the week and then volunteer on the weekend. Remote Area Medical, or RAM, runs about 25 clinics a year, serving hundreds of patients at a time. ""It always has been a very much volunteer effort, not only in terms of physical contributions, but in their financial contributions,"" Brock said. ""All these people, they're buying their own hotel and paying their own travel expenses to get here."" Medical supplies for the clinics are often donated, while RAM has purchased much of its larger equipment over the years. Last month, Brock piloted a single-engine, turbo-prop airplane to California, carrying 20 dental chairs and other supplies for RAM's 663rd mission. The clinic, held in Oakland, offered free eye exams along with glaucoma testing. Patients could receive prescription glasses that were made on site. Dental extractions, cleanings and fillings were also available, and medical services included pap smears, breast exams, acupuncture and testing for diabetes and HIV. A day before the clinic opened, lines began forming outside the city's coliseum. Pamela Gomez, 45, arrived the night before, sleeping in a tent along with three other people. She had recently found four lumps in her breasts, and without a job or health insurance, she didn't know where else to go. A nurse and doctor conducted two breast exams on Gomez and found the lumps to be benign cysts. ""I felt so relieved,"" she said. ""I'm not living in fear anymore. It was a big monkey off my back."" The medical services offered at each clinic vary and are based on the specialties of the doctors volunteering. But Brock said most people -- as many as 85% of the people on a clinic's first day -- are there to see a dentist or an eye doctor. That's usually because some insurance plans do not cover dental or vision care, and many patients can not afford to purchase new eyeglasses. Brock said there are plans to expand U.S. operations for his group, and he also wants to add a permanent clinic in Guyana and start up a program in Africa. ""This is a 365-day-a-year operation,"" Brock said. He sleeps at RAM headquarters, a ramshackle schoolhouse in rural Tennessee, and he takes no income for his work. He doesn't drive a car and -- other than a bicycle and some odds and ends -- he has no assets. ""I guess I'm your basic indigent CEO,"" he laughs. He is also humble, quick to deflect praise to the volunteers who have helped him through the years. ""It's those people that are making all of these patients either pain-free or more functional and better,"" he said. ""They're the heroes. All I do is show up and carry some of the luggage.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Former NBA star Allen Iverson launched an expletive-ridden tirade against police when a car belonging to him was pulled over for a traffic violation last week, at one point telling the officer, ""Take the vehicle, I have 10 more,"" according to a police report. Iverson, 35, was a passenger in a grey Lamborghini, spied by an Atlanta officer changing lanes without signaling about 6 p.m. on March 30, according to the police report obtained by CNN. The driver, identified in the report as Antwuan Clisby, couldn't produce any documentation for the vehicle, the report said. He then told the officer his passenger needed to leave the vehicle to eat dinner, and the officer said no one was leaving until the investigation was complete. With that, Iverson became ""irate,"" according to the police report, saying, ""I'm the (expletive) passenger."" The officer radioed for backup, and a second unit arrived, according to the report. Clisby and Iverson were asked to exit the vehicle, while Iverson continued to curse at the officer, the report said. When police scanned the identification number of the vehicle, which belongs to Iverson, it was found to have tags that expired in 2009. Iverson, former MVP for the Philadelphia 76ers, was told his car would be towed. ""Take the vehicle, I have 10 more,"" Iverson said, according to the report. ""Police don't have anything else (expletive) to do except (expletive) with me."" He then asked, ""Do you know who I am?"" The officer wrote in his report that ""For the next 20 minutes, Mr. Iverson went on and on about who he was. I stated to Mr. Iverson, 'It really doesn't matter who you are. You tried to conceal your vehicle with a fake drive-out tag due to you not paying for your tags.' "" Find out why LeBron James' mother was arrested in Miami . Iverson then said, ""I make more money than you will in 10 years,"" according to the report. Clisby, the driver, asked the officers, ""Would you want to pay $10,000 for a tag?"" the report said. The car was towed, and Iverson later ""came back and apologized for disrespecting the police,"" according to the police report. ""He stated he was just upset about his car."" Clisby was cited for failure to signal while changing lanes and the expired tag, the report said.","The former NBA star was in a car that was stopped by an officer .

"(CNN) -- In warm weather, the sound of music is everywhere -- in parks, at waterfronts and blasting from car radios. Like food, music is different (and often better) when sampled alfresco. It's not just a matter of acoustics: cool breezes, newly cut grass and open skies stimulate all the senses, heightening the total experience. A truly memorable encounter, though, means quality music performed in an inspiring setting. Across the United States and abroad, summertime heralds festivals and concert series in venues ranging from romantic to regal. Find the right outdoor concert and you're sure to remember it as a highlight of your year. Here are eight places to let the music move you. Red Rocks Amphitheatre . Morrison, Colorado . Even legendary entertainers should worry about this spectacular venue upstaging them. The Amphitheatre, opened in 1941, incorporates the natural formations of red sandstone in Red Rocks Park, 15 miles west of Denver. As if the geology alone wasn't dazzling enough, the region's typically clear skies mean concertgoers can expect to gaze up at sparkling stars. 6 hot resorts for adults only . The Amphitheatre is open year-round; in summer, the schedule is packed with acts of every genre. Among artists appearing this year are Keith Urban, The Avett Brothers, Bruno Mars, The National and Josh Groban with the Colorado Symphony. Tickets can be purchased through Ticketmaster. Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts . Katonah, New York . Wealthy New Yorkers Walter and Lucie Rosen established the Caramoor estate in Westchester County as a weekend getaway in the 1920s. The Mediterranean-style villa designed by Walter Rosen reflected their love of Italian culture; their affinity for music was expressed in intimate concerts they hosted there. In 1946 three public concerts were held on the estate; they became Caramoor's Summer Music Festival, which has grown in scope and fame in the decades since. Airports where architecture soars . The festival's program includes classical, opera, jazz, roots and Broadway music; this year it opens June 22 and runs until August 7, with events happening most days. Concerts are held indoors and out, so when purchasing tickets on the venue's website look for events in the Spanish Courtyard or Venetian Theater, or on the picnic lawns, where you can spread a blanket and have a meal. Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are playing in the Venetian Theater on July 13. Deer Valley Resort . Park City, Utah . Once the snow melts and the skiers go home, Deer Valley turns up the lights on its Snow Park Outdoor Amphitheater, where the Deer Valley Music Festival sends melodies ringing through the Wasatch Mountains twilight. It's part of a very busy ""off season"" in Park City, where relatively cool summers are ideal for hiking, mountain biking, and other outdoor activities. The festival runs from late June to the middle of August; its summer lineup pairs the Utah Symphony with acts like the Indigo Girls, Mandy Patinkin and Steve Martin with The Steep Canyon Rangers and Edie Brickell. Tickets can be purchased from the Abravanel Hall Ticket Office, 1-801-533-6683, or through ArtTix. Millennium Park . Chicago . This section of Chicago's historic Grant Park opened in 2004 and showcases some of the best urban design and public art in the country. The Grant Park Music Festival is held in the Frank Gehry-designed Pritzker Pavilion; other intriguing features include ""Cloud Gate,"" the already-iconic sculpture inspired by liquid mercury and nicknamed The Bean, and the Crown Fountain, which combines video images with running water. The festival draws top classical musicians from around the world to join the Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus on the shores of Lake Michigan. Dating back to the Great Depression, the Grant Park Music Festival is free and runs June-August. This year's performers include violinist Stefan Jackiw and pianist Valentina Lisitsa. 5 spectacular art fair cities . The Gorge Amphitheatre . George, Washington . As the Columbia River rolls majestically through central Washington State, it passes The Gorge Amphitheatre, beautifully located with views of the river valley and the Cascade foothills beyond. Take time to marvel at the landscape and its hues of green, brown and blue by reserving a spot at the on-site campground -- or ""glamping"" (a camping alternative for the less rugged among us) in a rustic cottage. The Gorge hosts big name contemporary acts and festivals of various genres. In late June, the two-day Paradiso Festival will feature DJ headliners Kaskade and TiÃ«sto. Tickets for all events can be purchased through Live Nation. Camping: Horror or bliss? The Greek Theatre . Los Angeles . Set amid the trees of Griffith Park in the heart of L.A., The Greek Theatre has garnered plenty of fame over its 84-year history. In 1972 Neil Diamond recorded ""Hot August Night"" here, the album that he said made his career. Nicholas Stoller's 2010 film ""Get Him to the Greek"" assumed everyone would know the landmark referred to in its title. The Greek's season runs from May through October, with a variety of genres represented. This summer's lineup has a nostalgic flavor, with acts like Cyndi Lauper, LL Cool J, and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson appearing. Tickets can be purchased through Ticketmaster. The places where masterpieces are born . Gendarmenmarkt Square . Berlin . Dominated by two cathedrals and a magnificent concert house, Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt Square seems purpose-built for the performance of sumptuous music. Since shortly after the fall of the Wall, that's exactly what it has hosted over a long weekend each summer. Concerts in the Classic Open Air Festival begin at 7:30 p.m., so you can watch the sun set to the strains of Vivaldi or Wagner. This year's festival runs for five consecutive nights, July 4-8. The program includes baroque, opera and pop, with fireworks on opening night and a light and laser show on July 6. Tickets can be purchased at Ticketmaster Germany. Princes Street Gardens . Edinburgh, Scotland . Beneath the rocky splendor of Edinburgh Castle lies Princes Street Gardens, site of the Edinburgh International Festival's concluding Fireworks Concert. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra provides the accompaniment to a colorful pyrotechnic display, and this is the spot from which to see and hear the extravaganza. The elegant park also hosts a lively carnival on July 21 as part of the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival. This year's Fireworks Concert is on September 1. Tickets may be purchased online or by calling 44-131/473-2000 .","Beautiful music with an outdoor setting to match is one of summer's can't-misses .

"Manila (CNN) -- The right punch Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez threw to knock out Filipino Manny Pacquiao in the sixth round of their non-title welterweight clash arguably registered on the Richter scale, with the aftershocks being felt from the posh MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada to the last-standing shanty in the typhoon-ravaged areas of Mindanao, the Philippines. When Pacquiao hit the canvas with a resounding thud, Filipinos all over the world cringed and felt the impact of the debacle down to their toenails. In the Philippines, where the fight was shown in cinemas, restaurants, and makeshift arenas, some stood in silence in utter disbelief while others unabashedly shed tears. The day following the fight, the front page of all the major newspapers in the country read like the obituary page. Pacquiao's loss could not have come at a worse time. Just days before the fight, Super Typhoon ""Pablo"" (international name Bopha) leveled several provinces in the Visayas and Mindanao. Downtrodden Filipinos were all counting on Pacquiao to lift their faltering spirit with another sterling performance in the ring, but the Pacman also ended up taking it flush on the chin. That Filipinos are also treating Pacquiao's loss as a ""natural disaster"" is not without a reason. Pacquiao is more than a boxer in the eyes of his countrymen. From the time he burst into the world boxing stage by knocking out Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera in November 2003, Pacquiao has been looked upon as a walking icon, a symbol of everything that is positive about the Filipino: God-fearing, resilient and tough as nails. After every major win in the ring, Pacquiao, who grew up in dirt poverty, made it a point to share his astronomical paycheck among the poor. Down the road, he explored other avenues to help out: he successfully ran for a seat in Congress and started moonlighting as a game show host who indiscriminately gave out prizes to contestants. The devastating loss to Marquez, however, sends the signal that Pacquiao is already feeling the brunt of the responsibility he has been made to assume. Before the fight, not a few noted that Pacquiao's focus on boxing had waned. He insisted that he was in control of the situation, but the observations were confirmed following the horrific knockout loss to Marquez. To some extent, Pacquiao has become a prisoner of the suffocating image he has created. Turning 34 on December 17, Pacquiao's career as a boxer is at the crossroads. Is it time to focus solely on boxing to give his career the glorious send-off it deserves? Is walking away from the sport with his health intact the best option available? Or should he again flirt with disaster by continuing to multi-task? Considering all that he has done for his countrymen, perhaps it is only proper for Pacquiao to finally look out for himself. Boxing is a dangerous sport and what happened in the Marquez fight is proof that even a supposedly invincible boxing champion is susceptible to a flesh wound. Then again, at a time when his countrymen are down on their knees and in dire need of a hero, it appears that Pacquiao is bent on lacing on the gloves to carry the fight anew for his people. There is this scene in the movie The Dark Knight Rises where Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, tries to convince Batman to leave Gotham City. ""You don't owe these people anymore. You've given them everything,"" Kyle tells Batman, to which the Dark Knight replies: ""Not everything. Not yet."" You can say that the Philippines' own knight is treading the same dangerous curve. We can only hope that he will emerge from his quest in one piece as nobody wants a repeat of the Marquez ordeal.","Tolentino: Pacquiao's knockout traumatized Filipinos around the world .

"Singapore (CNN) -- Millie Phuah arrived at Singapore's Bukit Brown cemetery on a humid morning, armed with a rake and gloves to clear fallen branches and decaying leaves from her ancestors' graves. ""I've got my great-grandparents on this side ... and my grand-uncle will be on this side,"" she said, pointing in opposite directions. An eight-lane highway, set for construction in 2013, will run though the middle of the cemetery. To make way for it, a swathe of graves -- marked by wooden stakes with painted numbers -- is being exhumed. The remains will be cremated by Monday, and if unclaimed for three years, the ashes will be scattered at sea. The highway is expected to be completed by 2016 and affect 3,746 graves, according to Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority. Afterwards, what remains of the cemetery area will make way for 15,000 new housing units and two mass transit stations, and all the graves -- including those of Phuah's family -- will be exhumed under the plan. With an estimated 100,000 graves, Bukit Brown is the largest Chinese cemetery outside China, according to Singapore's Heritage Society. Located near a cluster of reservoirs at the center of the island, the cemetery sprawls over several hills covered partly in rainforest jungle. Closed to new burials since the early 1970's, Bukit Brown now stands at the heart of a heated debate over development in tiny Singapore -- a nation that went from new and underdeveloped to one of the world's most prosperous in a matter of decades. In addition to pioneers and early migrants like Phuah's family, the cemetery holds the remains of Singapore's most prominent, like Lee Hoon Leong, the grandfather of Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore. The Government says the road is needed to reduce traffic congestion, pointing out that a country of just 714 square kilometers (275 square miles) has many more needs, including land for housing, defense, industry and utilities. ""In such a highly land-constrained setting, we need to make difficult decisions on land use for present and future generations of Singaporeans,"" a spokesman for the Urban Redevelopment Authority said. A shortage of land spurred rigid burial policies in 1998: Only one cemetery, Choa Chu Kang, remains open to burials, and there is a 15-year time limit for burial, after which remains are cremated. Singapore's National Environment Agency says at ""closed"" cemeteries like Bukit Brown ""exhumations are carried out only if the land is affected by redevelopment."" Claire Leow has no relatives buried in Bukit Brown but says her grandfather's grave at another cemetery was exhumed when it was cleared to make way for housing. After a visit to Bukit Brown several years ago, Leow founded a blog, ""All Things Bukit Brown,"" and now gives tours of the cemetery as part of a group of local activists, the Bukit Brown Community. The debate has drawn growing numbers to view historic graves, including young Singaporeans and students who clamber around the gravesites and pick their way through the thick overgrowth. Leow tells stories at the graves of early Singaporeans, those who began prominent businesses and those who fought the Japanese during World War II. In densely developed Singapore, Bukit Brown's vast green space also draws joggers, dog walkers, horseback riders and bird-watchers. One recent day, the rolling call of the straw-headed bulbul, a threatened bird, was far louder than the distant car traffic. Singapore's Nature Society says that roughly 25% of the country's threatened bird species can be found in Bukit Brown. To Singaporeans like Phuah, Bukit Brown gives roots to a young country known largely as a place to shop and do business. ""Singaporeans are more interested than the government thinks we are in our heritage. It's not just about hanging out in shopping malls here,"" she asserts. The Urban Redevelopment Authority says it doesn't take the decision ""lightly"" and is working with community members to come up with ways to preserve the heritage of Bukit Brown. Read about the Singapore Memory project . However, exhibits will not replace the cemetery's value, according to the Singapore Heritage Society. ""Ultimately, the struggle for Bukit Brown goes beyond saving a few graves or greenery. It is the struggle for the soul of Singapore.""","Swathe of graves is being exhumed to make way for highway .

"(CNN) -- Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's former finance minister, recently said his country is enjoying ""its best period in 300 years."" CNN looks at how the country emerged from communism to become one of eastern Europe's most stable and thriving democracies. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa addresses striking workers in Gdansk, Poland in 1989. Modern Poland gained independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Almost six million Poles, including the majority of the country's large Jewish population, died during the devastating six-year conflict. The shadow of Stalin continued to loom large over Poland after the war, when the communist-dominated government ensured that Poland would become a Soviet satellite state for the next 40 years. The following decades were punctuated by revolts against the repressive authoritarian regime in Warsaw, but none had a greater impact on Poland's political future than events in 1980 at a shipyard in western Poland. With a struggling economy and rumors of corruption and mismanagement within the state causing widespread discontent, a series of strikes by workers paralyzed the country. Eventually the government was forced to negotiate and on August 31, 1980, workers at the massive Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, led by an electrician named Lech Walesa, signed a deal giving workers the right to strike and form trade unions. This heralded the creation of the Solidarity movement, which would ultimately be instrumental in bringing Poland's communist era to an end. The presence in the Vatican at the time of Polish-born Pope John-Paul II was also a significant influence on the movement throughout the 1980s, as the Catholic church had remained a very potent force in Polish life. The Pope even made a visit to the country in 1979. Despite Soviet-endorsed attempts to slow the erosion of the regime's grip on power -- including the declaration of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1981 which outlawed Solidarity -- Poland's worsening economic situation, compounded by further nationwide strikes, meant that the government had no alternative but to negotiate a date for free elections with Walesa and the Solidarity movement. Solidarity members won a stunning victory in the election of 1989, taking almost all the seats in the Senate and all of the 169 seats they were allowed to contest in the Sejm or parliament. This gave them substantial influence in the new government. Activist and journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister, while Lech Walesa was elected as president the following year. After years of economic mismanagement under the communists, Poland embarked on a painful reform program under finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz -- especially in traditional heavy industries such as coal and steel -- which moved away from the inefficient state-controlled system of economic planning. Despite growing unemployment and a dilapidated infrastructure, Poland was slowly transformed into an investment-friendly, market economy. Banking and lending policies were reformed, while newly reshaped ownership relations, independent enterprises and strengthened domestic competition all had a massive impact. Over a relatively short period of time, Poland had become one of the most dynamically developing economies in Europe and by the mid-1990s, it became known as the ""Tiger of Europe."" Poland also liberalized its international trade during this period. The national currency -- the zloty -- became convertible to other currencies and internal convertibility was also established, providing another platform for dynamic economic growth. New markets in countries that had been treated not so long before as ideological as well as economic enemies were opened up to Polish companies. The EU and U.S. were now the key markets for Polish goods. This realignment of policy was emphasized by its accession into the European Union in 2004. It had also joined NATO in 1999. Unfortunately the continuing problem of high unemployment and the promise of better salaries encouraged many Poles to work in other EU countries after 2004. However this trend started to reverse in 2008 as the Polish economy enjoyed a boom period. Politically, Poland has also successfully transformed itself into a fully democratic country. Since 1991 the Polish people have voted in parliamentary elections and four presidential elections -- all free and fair. Incumbent governments have transferred power smoothly and constitutionally in every instance to their successors.","Poland was ruled by Soviet-backed regime after the Second World War .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the emotional aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing last year, Attorney General Eric Holder signaled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against admitted shooter George Zimmerman. ""For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law,"" Holder said in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot the African American teenager in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing. In words that now sound prescient, Holder described to reporters that day how ""something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard."" ""We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind,"" he said. Zimmerman's acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin's civil rights. The Department of Justice opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year, and a statement from the agency on Sunday said it was ongoing and will now include evidence and testimony from the Florida trial. In a speech in Washington on Monday, Holder said the Justice Department would ""continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law"" in examining what he called ""the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" ""Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,"" Holder said. ""We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass."" Separately, the White House said President Barack Obama would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed. ""Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. The president on Sunday called Martin's killing a tragedy for America, but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken. He acknowledged the case had ""elicited strong passions,"" but urged ""calm reflection."" Still, political pressure for a federal case is mounting. Demonstrators around the country are calling for Zimmerman to be punished, and hundreds of thousands of people have signed online petitions by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that call for federal charges. However, legal experts make the same point Holder did last year in saying the law limits the federal government's options. Watch Holder's speech . Because Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now is in private practice. To successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Department of Justice would have to show that Zimmerman ""caused the death of Trayvon Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or color,"" Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail, adding: ""This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn't exist."" Five Reasons for acquittal . CNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are ""in sort of a tough spot."" The hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents, Callan said, adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is ""very, very rare and I think in this case, it's going to be very hard to prove."" A federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges, it would not be double jeopardy for Zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity. Those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated, arguing that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, targeted Martin for special scrutiny because the teenager was an African-American. Regardless of how the shooting occurred, they say, the fight occurred because of Martin's race. ""The most fundamental of civil rights â€” the right to life â€” was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" says the petition on the NAACP website. Petition to White House . Rep. Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said racial profiling like what Zimmerman did to Martin ""continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them."" ""Men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed, stopped, or questioned,"" Fudge said in a statement Monday. ""This practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end."" A crush of petitioners crashed the NAACP website during the night, causing the group to set up a parallel petition drive on the liberal MoveOn.org website, said Derek Turner of the NAACP. A separate petition effort on the White House website generated nearly 15,000 supporters. Such political pressure evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a car chase prompted race-tinged national furor. When a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination. The Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging ""deprivations of federal rights under color of law,"" and two were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison. Weinstein said the Justice Department can't file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind. ""There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him"" other than the hate crime statute, which covers ""offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin,"" Weinstein added. However, Martin's family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time. Obama won't get involved in decision .

"(CNN) -- A 68-year-old Idaho man has been charged with misdemeanor battery after police say he struck a teen who would not turn off his iPhone while the plane they were in was taxiing for takeoff. The incident took place Tuesday evening on a Southwest Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Boise, Idaho, said Lt. Kent Lipple of the Boise police. The man, Russell Miller, was arrested after the plane landed, Lipple said. Miller told police that the 15-year-old boy refused to turn off his phone after directions from the flight crew. The suspect ""felt he was protecting the entire plane and its occupants,"" Lipple said. According to the police report, Miller said he smacked the boy with the back of his hand to get his attention. Officer, however, said the incident left a mark on the boy's shoulder.","Incident takes place on a flight from Las Vegas to Boise, Idaho .

"(TIME.com) -- Good Morning America host Amy Robach revealed on her show that a recent on-air mammogram had found she has breast cancer, but the diagnosis wouldn't have been made if she followed certain federal guidelines for screening. Robach is 40, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a group of independent experts convened by the government to review the risks and benefits of different screening practices, advised in 2009 that as a public health measure, the benefits of saving lives would outweigh the risks of screening if women started getting yearly checks beginning at age 50, rather than at age 40, as the American Cancer Society and other groups advise. The task force based its conclusion on the potential costs, both economic and emotional, of uncertain mammogram results, which would lead to follow up tests including biopsies and procedures like lumpectomies and mastectomies, most of which, the studies they investigated showed, ended up being negative. But maximizing public health and decreasing harm may be at odds with minimizing an individual woman's risk of dying of breast cancer. And that's the situation that ""we see every day in my field,"" says Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""We see real human beings getting screening mammograms so their cancer is detected at stages when we have curative treatments,"" Norton continues. ""When people talk about the downsides of screening, it doesn't compute in the minds of people who are actually in contact with human beings."" TIME.com: GMA's Amy Robach reveals on-air test led to breast cancer diagnosis . Robach wrote on Good Morning America's website that she has ""very little family history"" of the disease, and ""considered it virtually impossible that I would have cancer."" She only agreed to get the mammogram live on air, at the request of her producers and colleague Robin Roberts, herself a cancer survivor. Had she followed the USPSTF guidelines, which some doctors do, and upon which some insurers base reimbursement decisions, she might not have gotten a mammogram for another decade. ""I don't want to imagine what could have happened if she had her first mammogram at age 50,"" says Norton of Robach's case. And that's why, despite the public health advice, most doctors still recommend that their patients start getting regular mammograms when they turn 40. It's not that they are being ornery, or stubborn to change, but that there's a biological mandate to find potential tumors in younger women early. For one, the idea that the stage at which a cancer is detected, which has a lot to do with its size, determined a woman's prognosis, are fading away. What truly matters is the biology of the tumor itself -- understanding how it grows, what it feeds on, and whether it's driven by genetic factors -- is far more predictive of whether a woman will survive a breast cancer or not. ""Younger women tend to get aggressive tumors that are quicker growing and not fed by estrogen,"" says Dr. Jennifer Litton, a breast cancer specialist at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The concept of cancers growing slowly over years is more typical of older women who are past menopause than younger women in their 40s. There's also growing evidence that in breast cancer, tumors start to send out signals to other parts of the body to prime them for metastatic growths. ""The lungs change before the first cancer (from the breast) gets there,"" says Norton, ""and the lungs become a fertile field so when the first cancer does get there, it's ready to grow. And that's a time dependent process, so the earlier you intervene, you can stop the process of metastasis."" And once a cancer has spread, it's much more likely to be deadly. TIME.com: Mammogram guidelines: What you need to know . Why is the USPSTF conclusion so at odds with the breast cancer care that most doctors practice every day? Part of the problem may be that the studies the task force included involved older mammogram machines that did not provide the digital images that newer machines do, with better resolution and multiple views of the breast tissue to more accurately identify potential tumors. The task force guidelines did not rule out mammograms for women under age 50; women with a family history of the disease, or other risk factors such as exposure to environmental estrogens, being on the pill or drinking alcohol should talk to their doctors about starting screening earlier, the members said. The decision about when to start screening, says Litton, should really be a personalized one, made by a woman and her doctor, after factoring in her medical history. And for now, that conversation is likely to be an involved and difficult one, but will hopefully become easier as better methods for detecting the first signs of breast tumors become available. ""Screening is going to evolve, and we will have not just imaging but biologic tests such as biomarkers,"" she says. ""Wouldn't it be great to have a blood test, or be able to spit into a cup and then know whether you have cancer, and you wouldn't have to go through unnecessary biopsies?"" Study questions benefit of yearly mammograms . That day may be coming, but it's not here yet. In the meantime, women like Robach have to make their own decisions about when to start screening. They also have to understand that the risk factors for cancer don't always stand up and shout and make themselves obvious. Robach decided to undergo a double mastectomy to treat her disease, and wrote that ""I got lucky by catching it early. I can only hope my story will...inspire every woman who hears it to get a mammogram, to take a self exam. No excuses. It is the difference between life and death.""

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel adapted to ""tricky"" and blustery conditions at the Circuit of Americas to pip his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to pole position Saturday at the United States Grand Prix in Texas. There was simply no stopping the four-time world champion, who will be bidding for a record eighth straight Grand Prix victory and his 12th of the season when the race proper gets underway in Austin Sunday afternoon. Vettel looked to be second best to Webber until pulling out all the stops for a one minute 36.338 second clocking, just 0.103 seconds better than the Australian on his final run. It was Red Bull's fifth one-two on the grid this season and Vettel's 44th career pole. It served as the perfect 40th birthday present for team chief Christian Horner. ""Happy birthday to Christian,"" said Vettel. ""It's a good result to have both cars on the front row. It was a tricky session as the wind picked up quite a lot from this morning. It's not that easy round the high-speed corners. ""It was a good battle with Mark, he has got closer and closer as the weekend has gone on,"" he told the official F1 website. Webber was disappointed to miss out first place on the grid, looking to end his F1 career with a victory in one of the final two rounds. ""Today I let pole slip through my fingers. Well done to Seb. He put three sectors together and I put two-and-a-half together. It's not satisfying when you do that,"" he said. Romain Grosjean was third fastest for Lotus, with Kimi Raikkonen's replacement Heikki Kovalainen an excellent eighth, coming in at short notice for his fellow Finn who has undergone back surgery. Valtteri Bottas was also impressive for Williams to make the top 10 shootout and took ninth. Behind the top three, Nico Hulkenberg of Sauber and last year's winner, Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, were fourth and fifth. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg struggled in the windy conditions and with unresponsive tires to be back in 14th. Fernando Alonso was sixth for Ferrari and the departing Sergio Perez seventh for McLaren, out qualifying his teammate Jenson Button of Britain, who will start on the seventh row with Rosberg.","Sebastian Vettel claims pole position for United States GP .

"(CNN) -- It was only after I joined CNN on May 8, 1990, that I got to know Ted Turner and learn TV news and life lessons from him. In recent weeks and months, I've been thinking of those lessons as I worked on our new CNN one-hour documentary: ""Ted Turner: The Maverick Man."" Here -- in no particular order -- are five things I learned from the CNN founder: . 1. The news comes first. He would always remind all of us at CNN that we work for a ""news"" organization and when there's breaking news, that takes priority. Nowadays, that sounds so obvious, especially to all of us at CNN -- the world's news leader when it comes to breaking news. But when he created the first 24/7 television news network on June 1, 1980, that concept was not so obvious. 2. If you have a dream, pursue it. When he created CNN, a lot of folks thought he was crazy. The three broadcast networks already had a daily 30-minute newscast. But Ted believed people in the United States -- and indeed around the world -- wanted a lot more. He took what money he had and rolled the dice. He was, of course, right. There are now hundreds of local, national and international 24/7 cable news channels in dozens of languages around the world. In short, Ted did for television news what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs did for computers and the Internet. 3. Even after terrible life setbacks, you can recover and even thrive. Ted had a very unhappy childhood. His parents sent him away to boarding school when he was only 4. His father berated him for not getting into Harvard and stopped paying his tuition at Brown because he didn't like Ted's major. Later, his father committed suicide. Still in his early 20s, Ted went on to take a local advertising business and create a worldwide media empire. At his peak, Ted was worth more than $10 billion. Years later, Ted lost his media empire, and the love of his life, Jane Fonda. Even at his lowest point, he was able to turn things around and create a new business venture -- becoming a bison rancher and opening a chain of restaurants, which keeps him thriving and relevant today. 4. A smart person has a lot of interests. Ted loves more than just the news. He loves entertainment -- he created TNT, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, The Cartoon Network -- and sports. At one point, when he owned the Atlanta Braves, he took them from last place to a World Series win. He also has a passion for protecting the environment and eliminating nuclear weapons. And he puts his money where his mouth is. He made a $1 billion pledge to the United Nations. 5. Don't be afraid to admit you've made mistakes. Anyone who speaks with Ted will hear him acknowledge his many mistakes over the years -- from not being an attentive father to failing to understand what the Time Warner/AOL merger would mean for his involvement with his beloved CNN. He has no role in CNN today. The great thing about Ted is that he knows where he erred and is willing to learn and improve. By sharing the good and bad of his life, he hopes others will learn as well.","Ted Turner turns 75 years old this month .

"(CNN) -- What a difference a year makes. Last year, delegates at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy had a lot to contend with. The economic crisis was in full bloom and they had urgent concerns: Will Greece leave the eurozone? Will the euro survive? Is the project doomed? A year on, it seems those worries have eased; the mood has lightened and the crisis is finally over. Even if you don't feel it, the latest economic numbers show the eurozone is growing again and confidence has returned to the continent. Read more: Rail expansion plans bring fractured Europe closer together . Despite the optimism, concerns remain and I'm told time and time again here that Europe still faces a mighty task. That much I'm aware of, but what do the captains of industry feel needs to be done to get Europe growing and competing on the world stage? Unemployment . Andrea Marescotti, the Managing Director of Brembo, one of Italy's leading manufacturer of automotive brakes, tells me over an espresso that unemployment is his biggest worry. He tells me job creation should be Europe's priority ""to have stable growth, with growth of consumption, you need to create jobs. If you don't produce, you don't buy. So the question is how we can foster a stable increase in jobs."" Read more: Spanish exports are bright spark for economy . Antonio Tajani, the Vice-President of the European Commission is of the same opinion. In fact, he tells me this is his project: building new jobs for young people by creating a new education policy in Europe. To do this he says, we need to build ""a link between schools and small and medium- size businesses. This exists in Germany and Austria. We need this in every European state."" It's refreshing to see youth unemployment hasn't been ignored, after all, Spain and Greece are both struggling under the weight of 56.1% and 62.9% youth unemployment respectively. Read more: Royal Delft unfazed by copycats . But whilst the talk is promising, I find it rather strange that the discussion is being led by a group of middle-age men who know little of the challenges young people face. I know it, because I too have had to deal with student debt, job applications and random jobs on the side. But now I'm veering off-point. Cohesion . Alongside talk of unemployment, growth and competitiveness, key words crept up time and time again to my surprise: cohesion and political union. Marco Tronchetti Provera, the Chairman and CEO of Pirelli, felt strongly about this subject, arguing that to grow again and compete with the likes of China and India, Europe must work closer together. Read more: The Netherlands: A nation under water . He candidly told me: ""We have a Europe that needs a project that refines more deeply the countries. We have a Europe that doesn't have enough cohesion, there are no common projects on the many issues such as energy."" His words echo those of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who this week called for a ""Europe that is united, strong and open."" It all returns to his famous quote: ""we swim together, we sink together."" Stability and Complacency . This year at the Ambrosetti, there is definitely a sense that Europe is thinking together; acknowledging that there can be strength in their numbers. But for all the talk of Europe's economic achievements, of green shoots of recovery, there were reminders, alarm bells of sorts of the risks of complacency. Read more: Recession leaves bitter taste for Italian coffee makers . Francesco Caio, the CEO of Avio Group, was perhaps the most pessimistic on Europe -- warning about political instability and complacency ""there is still a need to be very alert. Stability is a competitive factor. We don't need a government crisis right now, "" he told me. Four days later in his State of the Union address, Barroso touched on the same subject when he said that the biggest downside risk to Europe's recovery is political. Of course, Barroso didn't single out any particular country, but the warning could have been directed at Italy whose coalition is facing an uncertain political future after the country's top court found former prime mnister Silvio Berlusconi guilty of tax fraud. There is no doubt that Europe is breathing a bit easier again. The crisis has abated and our politicians are smiling once more. But let's not start popping the prosecco, cava or Champagne just yet. The work is just beginning and the scars have yet to heal. Still, what a difference a year makes.","Spain and Greece are both struggling under the weight of 56.1% an 62.9% youth unemployment respectively .

"Athens (CNN) -- Most people travel to Greece to look at antiquities. But I've spent the last few days in Athens sightseeing the country's digital future. And what I've seen is surprisingly encouraging. The future isn't hard to excavate in Greece. Indeed, immediately upon arrival at Athens airport, travelers are confronted by spread of slick advertisements for a global bank. ""The future is full of opportunity. Be part of the future,"" one of these advertisements advises. ""Age will be no barrier to ambition,"" another promises. ""Even the smallest business will be multinational,"" a third guarantees. But today, in a Greece wracked by the most serious economic crisis for at least a century, the truth about the country's economic future is mostly the opposite of these advertisements. In Greece today, the future is mostly characterized by fear rather than opportunity. The problem is that this small country doesn't appear to be part of anyone's ""future."" Increasingly peripheral, even to the euro crisis, Greece is in danger of drifting back into its dark 20th century past: back to the self-destructive politics of anti-capitalist violence and ethnic hatred; back perhaps to the drachma, to economic autarky and perhaps even to a financial apocalypse equivalent to the Great Depression. Euro crisis: In-depth . In Greece, the ""smallest businesses"" in an economy still dependent mostly on tourism, are about as multinational as the crumbling remains of the Acropolis. In this classic Southern European gerontocracy in which at least 50% of young people are unemployed, age actually mostly represents an impenetrable barrier to ambition. And yet, amidst all the despair, there is a rebirth going on in Greece. It's a digital renaissance and it's being pioneered by a new generation of talented young Internet entrepreneurs who are trying to reinvent not only the Greek economy and society, but also Greece's role in today's global economy. The irony of this nascent Greek digital renaissance is that it probably wouldn't have happened without the economic crisis. In pre-crisis Greece, most Greeks grew up wanting to be public servants. But now that the old clientist state cannot offer lifetime sinecures for university graduates, young Greeks coming out of university now have little else to do except invest their labor in start-ups. ""There's no other option,"" Tasos Frantzolas, the founder of Soundsnap who splits his time between New York and Athens, told me about this entrepreneurial renaissance in Greece. ""People of my generation recognize this."" John Doxaras, the CEO of Warp.ly who studied physics at Cambridge University and who now divides his time between Athens and San Francisco, agrees with Frantzolas. Given the crisis, Doxaras -- a young man who is already on his third start-up -- believe that young Greeks have ""nothing to lose"" and are ""willing to take a risk."" There's a ""big opportunity"" in Greece, Doxaras told me because -- given the relative insignificance of the local market - start-ups have to be global, both in their organization and their market. Warp.ly, for example, which offers big brands tools for mobile marketing, has its biggest client in Kuwait and, of its 22 fulltime staff, four are in the U.S., six in Europe and 12 in Athens. In the Greek digital economy, even the smallest business have to be multinational. Europe's leaders are spinning plates . Christina Plakopita concurs with Doxaras. Plakopita, a 28-year-old woman who has degrees in economics and real-estate development from London and Columbia universities, came back from the US to Greece to start-up and run Netrobe, an iPhone app designed as a virtual closet for young fashionistas which already has 40,000 users. People said I was ""crazy"" to come back to Greece, Plakopita, who returned to Athens to live with her parents, told me. ""But it was a great decision,"" she explained, because digital is ""booming"" in Greece and it's an ideal market to ""think global and act local."" Like Doxaras and Frantzolas, Plakopita's confidence in the digital Greek rebirth is rooted in the wealth of human talent in Greece. I think they are correct. Having spent the last few days in the invigorating company of many Greek start-up entrepreneurs, I have been struck with their vitality, intelligence and ambition. From early-stage collaborative workspaces like CoLab and 123p, to entrepreneurs from promising local start-ups like Taxibeat, Radiojar, Parking Defenders, Dailysecret, Joolmaworks, CrowdPolicy.org and Cookisto, it is self-evident that there is something very promising brewing in this nascent Greek digital economy. So what could go wrong with this budding digital Greek renaissance? The biggest problem, of course, remains the oppressively bureaucratic Greek state that, in spite of the crisis, continues to be a major obstacle to entrepreneurial innovation. ""Failure in Greece in penalized,"" John Doxaras told me about a system in which entrepreneurs can end up in jail if they bankrupt their companies. And every Greek start-up entrepreneur I met complained bitterly about arcane and ever-changing bureaucratic regulations that make setting up and running a company frustratingly complex and time-consuming. Greeks pull money out of country's banks . As Stavros Messinis, the co-founder of CoLab told me, Greece remains a ""tough environment"" for entrepreneurs. What's missing, Messinis explained, is a both a legal and social acceptance of the idea of failure. There's no ""culture of forgiveness"" for business failure in Greece, Messinis explained. And thus most Greeks remains terrified of failing, even though failure is the unavoidable norm of even the most successful start-up ecosystem. Then there's the broader cultural challenge of rewiring Greek minds for the digital age. As Warp.ly CEO Doxaras explained, most Greeks -- even its younger generation -- don't ""get"" the idea that Greece, if it wants to compete in the 21st century global economy, has any other option but to become a start-up nation like Israel. Oddly enough, a possible Greek exit from the euro is seen by many entrepreneurs as a much a blessing in disguise for their businesses as a catastrophe. ""If you sell abroad you will get rich overnight,"" Fotis Evagelou, the CTO of Joolmaworks, told me. While CoLab co-founder Stavros Messinis acknowledges that any start-up with clients overseas would benefit from the inevitable devaluation of the local currency that a Greek exit from the euro would trigger. But does Greek economic failure really equal entrepreneurial success? No, it's not that simple. Messinis cautions that the return of the drachma would be ""superbly negative"" for entrepreneurs in the short-term, with exchange controls, massive layoffs, riots and empty supermarket shelves. John Doxaras even warns that a euro exit might result in significant power cuts thereby cutting off local digital companies from their lifeblood -- access to the global network. Yet in spite of the danger of a complete economic meltdown, the future remains full of opportunity for Greece's young digital entrepreneurs. It won't be easy, of course. But a country best known for its antiquities might turn out to be a key hub for radical innovation in our digital economy.","Keen: Greece's digital future is surprisingly encouraging .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will shoot down any part of the long-range rocket that North Korea plans to launch next month that enters its territory, the Japanese defense minister, Naoki Tanaka, said Friday. Speaking at a news conference, Tanaka said he had issued the official order after instructing the Japanese military earlier in the week to prepare the country's missile defense shield against the planned rocket launch. North Korea announced earlier this month that it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite between April 12 and 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Communist state. Pyongyang says the operation is for ""peaceful purposes,"" but Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. Firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Washington has suspended a recent deal to provide food aid to North Korea as a result. Japan says its military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, has begun preparations to deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptors in the Tokyo metropolitan area, as well as the Okinawa, Ishigaki and Miyako islands. The defense ministry says three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying sea-based Standard Missile-3 interceptors will also be deployed to the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. The ministry also says the military will deploy helicopter rescue units in order for the military to respond to any crisis in the event that rocket debris hits Japan.","North Korea says it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite next month .

"(CNN) -- For the first time Apple stores will soon let iPhone owners trade in their old phones for credit toward a new one, according to multiple reports. According to Apple-centric blog MacRumors, several sources say Apple store employees are currently being trained on the new program, which could go into effect around Apple's September 10 event, when new iPhones are expected to be introduced. That would let iPhone owners exchange their older handsets for an iPhone 5S, or whatever the new phone is called. In June, Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources saying that Apple was working with recycling company Brightstar and that trade-ins could be refurbished by Apple and resold in emerging markets throughout the world. During Apple's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said he was ""not opposed"" to in-store trade-ins. ""I see channels doing it, and I like the environmental aspect of it, and so that part of it really is encouraging to me,"" he said. The ""channels"" he referred to are third-party vendors of Apple products, such as Best Buy, AT&T and Verizon. The blog 9to5Mac says some Apple stores, including several in Dallas, Texas, already are running a limited pilot program. According to the reports, people who bring in an older phone, like an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S would get a gift card that could be applied to an iPhone 5. Presumably, the 5 would be added to the list of phones that can be traded in for a discount on the next iPhone. It's not clear whether earlier models, such as an iPhone 3 or 3G, would be eligible for trade-ins, although given their limited resale value that seems unlikely. Apple already has a similar mail-in rebate program. But the convenience of doing so in person, and walking out with a new phone instead of waiting for days or weeks, would be a big upgrade in terms of convenience. If recent history is any guide, Apple's next iPhone will go on sale in mid- to late September and will likely to be called either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S. The company has not made an official announcement, but multiple observers expect Apple to announce the phone September 10 and begin selling it in stores about 10 days later. The company has released a new iPhone model every year, and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall. The iPhone 5 came out in September 2012, the iPhone 4S in October 2011, and the three versions before that in the summer months. The company is also rumored to be working on a cheaper version of the iPhone that would be sold in emerging markets. Other reports have speculated on features ranging from a larger, 4.7-inch display screen to a fingerprint scanner to an option to buy a gold iPhone.","Apple reportedly launching an iPhone trade-in program .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's urban rich are making far more than they officially report, suggesting the wealth gap in the world's second largest economy is much higher than previously thought, according to a new study. The China Society of Economic Reform released a survey Monday that found ""gray income"" was 6.2 trillion yuan (U.S. $1 trillion), or 12% of GDP. ""Gray income"" can range from illegal cash from kickbacks to unreported income and gifts. ""The result has highlighted expanding social inequalities and policy issues surrounding official corruption and income distribution,"" said Wang Xiaolu, who led the research for the CSER, in an article in Caixin Online. ""The richer the household, the more likely it receives shadow income."" The study comes a day after Bo Xilai, a once high-flying politician, was sentenced to life in prison for bribe-taking,15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. Bo is appealing the verdict. The CSER surveyed 5,344 urban families in 18 Chinese provinces. The results suggest the top 10% of households earn nearly 21 times more than the poorest 10%. The National Bureau of Statistics places income disparity far lower, saying China's wealthiest make 8.6 times more than its poorest. ""China is in a dangerous zone as one the most unequal countries in the world,"" Wang wrote. The survey found that rich families gain 80% of their wealth from business and on average ""have decent gains"" in stock markets, whereas most middle and lower income families lose cash in the capital markets, Wang said. ""We can't rule out that some of these business gains are problematic, or even illegal, because many survey takers count kickbacks as business gains,"" he wrote. Much of the high gray income is linked to the loose credit handed out between 2009 and 2010, Wang wrote, as well as the rapid increase of government investment during the same period. ""To stop widening income disparity and unfair allocation, in addition to anti-corruption campaigns, there needs to be gradual but firm progress in economic, political and social reform that moves the country closer to the rule of law with public scrutiny over administrative power,"" he said.","Survey: China's urban rich are making far more than they officially report .

"(CNN) -- ""Hi, I'm back!"" Paula Deen wooed a Houston crowd Saturday during her first appearance since the revelation that she used a racial slur in the past, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. The Southern food diva looked straight into the lens of a camera, waved, smiled and winked as a sold-out audience of 1,500 cheered her on during a cooking demonstration at the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertainment Show. After a standing ovation, Deen wiped the tears on her face and told the crowd, ""These are tears of joy, y'all. I've said all along that the one place I'd want to make my first step back out was Texas."" Deen fan Lucas Boucher flew in from Los Angeles to meet the chef. ""I started getting teary-eyed and I just told her we got her back and I said, 'I'm sorry you're going through this.' And she was crying,"" said Boucher, who wore a T-shirt with Deen's face imprinted on the front. Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin in June after her deposition in a lawsuit brought by a former restaurant employee was released. In the video, Deen admitted using the ""N word"" in the past. 'We're sticking with Paula': Deen fans protest with butter wrappers .

In late August, a federal judge approved a deal dismissing the lawsuit, which leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment. The lawsuit was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning it cannot be filed again, according to a court filing. On Saturday, Houston residents, Kelly Eldridge, Stephanie Young and their friends, brought Deen face cut-outs and wore sashes with messages of support such as ""Love and Best Dishes"" and ""Hey ya'll."" ""I'm hoping she comes back. I'm hoping she gets another TV show, more books,"" said Eldridge. ""We just want her to feel better about everything and be supporters of her,"" said Young. Attendees paid between $75 and $400 for Deen event tickets. A teary-eyed Deen shared her feelings about the controversy with the crowd. ""I'm sure you know, unless you're living under a rock, the last few months have been difficult. It was an opportunity to learn. I learned a lot about my self and my business.

"(CNN) -- A man in the uniform of an Afghan soldier shot and killed a member of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, ISAF reported. The killing, which was still under investigation Sunday afternoon, follows a long series of ""insider"" attacks by Afghan troops or infiltrators on U.S. and allied troops, including one in September that killed three Americans in eastern Afghanistan. So-called ""green on blue"" attacks killed dozens of coalition troops in 2012, prompting the U.S. command in Kabul to stop some joint operations with Afghan security forces. Sunday's attack came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai worked out what Kerry called ""the major issues"" in talks aimed at keeping some American military forces in Aghanistan after 2014. But a potential deal-breaker, legal immunity for U.S. troops, was referred to a council of Afghan elders. In Iraq, the failure to agree on the immunity issue led to the withdrawal of all American troops at the end of 2011. Without an agreement on immunity, U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan with other NATO contingents at the end of 2014.","A man in an Afghan uniform killed a NATO service member, ISAF says .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta's coalition government survived a confidence vote Wednesday by a healthy margin, with 235 senators voting in favor to 70 against. The threat receded shortly before the vote when former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi unexpectedly dropped his bid to topple the government, saying his party's lawmakers would support the motion. Berlusconi's move came after members of his center-right People of Freedom Party signaled they would defy his orders and back the government. The lower house of parliament is still scheduled to vote on a motion of confidence in Letta's government later Wednesday. However, the prime minister has a majority in that chamber and is not in serious danger of losing the vote. Before the senators voted, Letta, of the center-left Democratic Party, appealed for their backing, warning that Italy faced a ""fatal"" risk with the confidence vote. Amanpour: Berlusconi turns Italy into a political circus . Letta, who took office five months ago, argued that the country needs political stability to help its recovery from its economic woes. ""A government and political crisis would only mean more economic difficulties,"" he told lawmakers. ""It means not going through with the reforms needed to boost the economy and help the unemployed and the country. It means that the rest of Europe still looks at us as 'the unfixable' messy country."" The crisis was triggered when Berlusconi on Saturday ordered ministers from his party to pull out of the fragile coalition government. But the former prime minister's political gamble appears to have divided his own party, resulting in his sudden climbdown. Italian news agency Ansa had earlier cited People of Freedom Party member Carlo Giovanardi as saying that more than 40 center-right lawmakers were willing to back Letta's government. Observers speculate that the reported fracturing within Berlusconi's party could be the beginning of the end of his checkered political career. ""I definitely do not believe that this time around Mister Berlusconi can escape his fate,"" Former Prime Minister Mario Monti told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Wednesday from Rome. ""He has been pronounced defeated and out of politics many, many times in the past. He has given proof of an incredible resilience, but I believe this time he will not."" A look at the life of Silvio Berlusconi . On Friday, Berlusconi will be the subject of a parliamentary committee that will consider whether he should lose his Senate seat after a conviction for tax fraud was upheld by Italy's supreme court two months ago. He has insisted the prosecutions against him are politically motivated. In an apparent reference to Berlusconi's legal difficulties, Letta told senators Wednesday that they must make a distinction between the judicial troubles of Berlusconi, or any other member of parliament, and the job of the executive. Letta said reforms to pull Italy out of recession must continue, and that political stability is the key to boosting growth and creating more jobs. Italians want to see their elected representatives govern, not indulge in political drama, he said. He appealed to the Senate to have the courage and strength to back the confidence motion, for the sake of the country. The formation of the coalition government in April ended weeks of uncertainty following inconclusive elections in February. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has dominated the lively history of Italian politics for the past two decades. For years, he has also been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached the Italian courts. He is currently appealing a prison sentence handed down in June for abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. CNN's Ben Wedeman and Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Prime Minister Enrico Letta handily wins a confidence vote in the Italian Senate .

"(CNN) -- U.S. raids in pursuit of two terrorists over the weekend threw a question surrounding President Obama into the spotlight: Does he have a guiding doctrine for foreign policy? The operations in Somalia and Libya, only one of which went as planned, come after the Obama administration silenced its drumbeat toward a possible military attack on Syria. Some analysts say the developments make Obama's ""doctrine"" more clear than ever. Others say what's more clear than ever is that this president doesn't have one -- which may, or may not, be a good thing. Yes to special ops, no to conventional wars . ""The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen,"" says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""For the White House, part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not, of course, consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."" Sam Brannen, a Democrat who worked under Obama in the Defense Department until earlier this year, concurs. ""I think he's really fighting the long war ... where you're using a variety of low visibility forces and increasingly unmanned aerial vehicle assets around the planet. And fighting an enemy who has incredible geographic span and seems to pop up everywhere there's a new crisis,"" says Brannen, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Key parts of Obama's doctrine, says Brannen, include: ""Defeat al Qaeda, minimize weapons of mass destruction, don't get us entangled in another Middle East war."" 'Lethal' Obama's al Qaeda doctrine: Kill . ""Barack Obama has been a lethal president,"" says Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics and Political Science. ""He has escalated the drone attacks against al Qaeda worldwide. He has basically given the CIA and the U.S. security forces a blank check to wage an all-out war, literally, against al Qaeda, using all elements of U.S. power."" ""The Obama Doctrine, when it comes to al Qaeda and its extremist allies, is really a kill strategy,"" Gerges says. The capture of alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi in Somalia over the weekend was a surprise, Gerges says. ""Because the Obama Doctrine is to kill."" How Syria fits in . Both Gerges and Brannen believe President Obama was reluctant to take military action against Syria, even though he pushed reluctant lawmakers and the American public to support his call for strikes. The president was under pressure from some in ""the foreign policy establishment"" and from certain U.S. allies including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, Gerges argues. And, he says, Obama boxed himself in by having warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line."" After a large-scale chemical attack which the U.S. blamed on al-Assad's regime, ""it was all about the credibility of the president,"" Gerges says. He and Brannen say they believe Obama was relieved when a Russian offer took hold. ""He was looking for any reason not to have to bomb Syria,"" Brannen says. ""And he got it with the Russian deal."" No doctrine, no consistency . Danielle Pletka, vice president at the American Enterprise Institute, has a far less charitable view. ""In the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president's vision for managing national security challenges around the world, I don't think Obama has a doctrine,"" says Pletka, who identifies herself as conservative. ""What I see are missteps and rhetorical policies that the administration either runs toward or away from."" ""I have a red line -- oh, of course, it's not my red line, it's the world's red line,"" she says, paraphrasing and combining different Obama quotes to emphasize what she views as his changing stances and messaging. ""Al Qaeda is on the run ... except when we deploy SEAL Team 6 in two separate operations in one weekend in Africa."" ""You can pretend that this is part of a coherent set of strategic choices,"" Pletka says. But if the president's statements were ""in an essay, the teacher would write 'F' because there is no consistency whatsoever."" ""I am always able to predict that he will do less than is necessary while dressing it in the glorying admiration of his own self-perception,"" she says. Other recent presidents including Clinton had clear visions for American leadership, she says. A look back at presidential doctrines . No doctrine? No problem. But if Obama doesn't have a so-called doctrine, that just might be a good thing, according to some analysts. ""The search itself is misguided,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria wrote in 2011. ""The doctrinal approach to foreign policy doesn't make much sense anymore. ""Every American foreign policy 'doctrine' but one was formulated during the Cold War, for a bipolar world, when American policy toward one country -- the Soviet Union -- dominated all U.S. strategy and was the defining aspect of global affairs. (The Monroe Doctrine is the exception.) In today's multipolar, multilayered world, there is no central hinge upon which all American foreign policy rests. Policymaking looks more varied, and inconsistent, as regions require approaches that don't necessarily apply elsewhere."" In a sense, Gerges agrees. ""Beyond al Qaeda, there is no Obama Doctrine,"" he says. Asia focus was 'Hillary Doctrine' Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton had a doctrine that helped guide U.S. foreign policy, says Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group. ""The Hillary Doctrine involved a pivot to Asia,"" Bremmer told Reuters. But since she left office, her doctrine ""has been buried by one distraction after another, whether Egypt, Syria, or Iran."" During a recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama did not mention East Asia except for a single reference to China in regard to Iran, Bremmer says. Nevertheless, former Defense official Brannen says working to ""rebalance"" the Pacific and represent U.S. interests remains a part of Obama's ""doctrine."" Obama remains committed to ""reinvigorating diplomacy,"" Brannen says, adding, ""I think he really does have a deliberate strategy.""","Obama's doctrine when it comes to al Qaeda is ""to kill,"" an analyst says .
He has no doctrine, unlike other recent presidents, an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- I was sitting in a wheelchair in an elevator of a hospital when the aide pushing me lay a binder on my lap. My medical record! It was heavy, hundreds of pages charting all I had endured since a runaway truck in Jerusalem broke my neck months before on May 16, 1990. I knew that medical charts were off-limits to patients. But I was 19 and hemiplegic (the left half of me paralyzed) and curious. And so, I opened it with my one good hand and read what a droll psychologist at Mount Sinai had somehow gleaned from our occasional games of chess: ""Joshua appears compliant and motivated and expressed good insight into the nature and course of his disability."" I closed the binder quickly, my mind at ease. Patients no longer have to resort to stolen glances. Ever since 1996, when Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, all of us (save a small number of people with severe mental health disorders) have had the right to read our records. But only a tiny percentage of patients do -- ""at most, 1 percent,"" says Tom Delbanco, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has long called for hospitals to offer patients easy and full access to their records. That patients ignore their medical records is understandable. Records are largely dry data: test results, medications, vital signs, physical examinations. But ultimately, they are accounts of lives and deaths. And when I recently read my own record -- a thousand-odd pages written over four months in three hospitals in two languages -- I learned a lot, felt in the know. Prager: Is our suffering God's will? That feeling of empowerment, it turns out, is typical. Starting in 2010, Delbanco and Jan Walker, a researcher at Harvard Medical School with a background in nursing, surveyed 20,000 patients at three hospitals who were invited by e-mail to read the notes their doctors had written of them. Great majorities of the patients who then read their records felt more in control of their care (81%) and were better at taking their medicines (69%) too. All but 1% wanted to continue to read their records. Doctors, meantime, were by and large reluctant participants in the study only to then concede that their worries had been unfounded. (""My fears: Longer notes, more questions, and messages from patients,"" wrote one doctor. ""In reality, it was not a big deal."") Not one of the 105 doctors in the study chose to stop inviting patients to read their notes. A second study published two months ago and conducted by Dr. Susan Woods, an internist at the Portland VA Medical Center, also concluded that transparency greatly benefits patients. (This study did not assess its effect on doctors.) And so, 17 years after HIPAA, its ramifications are finally being understood. Perhaps it is no surprise then that more hospitals are reaching out to patients. In the last year, the Veterans Health Administration and the Mayo Clinic began programs that grant patients easy and full access to their records online, the records just a click away for more than a million patients. And as more patients read their records, a second revolution in medical records may very well begin: caregivers writing them in collaboration with their patients. Here's why: In recent years, hospitals have digitized patient records. This has prompted many doctors to cut and paste text from one section of a medical record to another which in turn has led to billing abuses and also to the replication of mistakes. And so Delbanco and Woods predict that as more patients read their records online, they will begin to monitor and share them and, eventually, amend and comment upon them too -- much as the public does an entry on Wikipedia. This amended record will not simply be more accurate; it will be truer -- and truer and truer the more caregiver and patient collaborate. Doctors will no doubt shudder at the thought of collaborative records. But so did those doctors surveyed about granting patients access to their records only to then find that transparency bred trust, not lawsuits or even extra work. All agree that the goal of medical records is to improve patient care. And so, the question is simple: Would allowing patients to comment upon their own records improve their care? Well, how could it not? If doctors consult the ancient histories of patients to know them better, how could written responses from patients about their care, in real time, not be as valuable? Back in 1990, I would have loved to collaborate with my caretakers, to comment daily upon dosages and treatments and them too -- my saintly nurses Mary and Patrice, my patient doctors Frank and Tom, my skilled and kind therapists Katie and Beth. And, yes, there were a few horrible white coats to write of too who made us blue gowns pay for the audacity of independence and disagreement and minirebellion. Would my words have made a difference? I don't know. But now that access is here, collaboration is coming. It will arrive much sooner, patients, if you read your records. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joshua Prager.","Joshua Prager: Reading my medical record, I learned a lot about myself .
He says all patients have the right to examine their records but only tiny minority do so .
Studies find that access to records helps patients and improves care .
Letting patients contribute to the records is the next logical step, Prager says ."

"(CNN) -- Can you think of one sport where men and women compete against each other as equals? Stumped? Try horse racing, where female jockeys regularly jump in the hot seat alongside their male counterparts. But it's not just the riders facing-off as they thunder down the track. The horses carrying them towards the finish line are locked in their own battle of the sexes -- and it seems the animal kingdom isn't as different to humans as you might imagine. While male and female thoroughbreds are fairly evenly matched in physical ability, the girls must overcome commercial and even psychological constraints to get ahead in the sporting world. Sound familiar? ""At the top level, it does take a special filly to beat the boys,"" Paul Rogers, spokesman at the British Horse Racing Authority, told CNN. A man's world? It may seem like quite a stretch comparing women in the workplace to fillies in the field, but just like that so called boardroom glass ceiling, female horses are the minority in the racing world. Male horses -- known as stallions, geldings or colts depending on whether their manhood is still intact -- far outnumber females -- called fillies -- on the track. In British flat racing, 63% of horses are male, while 37% are female. It's a similar story for the overwhelming number of male winners -- 67% compared to just 33% for the girls. Even in America's most prestigious horse race -- the Kentucky Derby -- only three fillies have won in the competition's 138-year-history. Hormonal horses . So why do boy horses rule the roost? ""It tends to be that male horses are a bit bigger and taller than females -- a bit like men and women,"" said Rogers. ""A lot of it also has to do with hormones. Temperament-wise, female horses are probably a bit more placid. And when they come into season -- have their periods -- they can be unpredictable."" That said, stallions -- male horses which haven't been castrated -- can also be flighty, if somewhat more aggressive on the track, added Rogers. Even playing field? Yet compare their ability ratings -- zero for a dud to 140 for an unbeaten thoroughbred in the UK -- and both genders score around the same. Males have a median rating of 69, while females score 64. ""While size plays a role -- taller horses tend to have a longer stride -- I wouldn't necessarily say male horses have more stamina,"" said Rogers. ""In terms of distance, they're probably equally adept. It's more a question of parentage -- if mum and dad are sprinters, then their son or daughter will be the same."" The slight discrepancy in ratings, means male horses will often carry a few extra pounds in weights, to even out the playing field. Bred for success . The high number of male race horses may also be down to their profitability off the track. ""From a racing industry perspective, if a male horse is successful on the racetrack, they will also be worth a lot more money as a breeding stud -- anything up to around $150,000 per offspring,"" said Tim Whitaker, head of postgraduate study in equine science at Britain's Duchy College. ""With a mare however, she will only be able to produce one foal a year. But if you get it right -- and it is rare -- you could have a breeding stallion which earns millions."" Perhaps the best example of a super stud's earning power is British colt Frankel, which retired last year with an unbeaten 14-win record. Today, he commands a fee of $190,000 for each offspring and is expected to generate a staggering $150 million in his stud career. Leading ladies . That said, one of the most remarkable champions the racing world has ever seen also retired last year -- a female thoroughbred called Black Caviar. The Australian mare notched up 25 consecutive wins, becoming not just a national sports star but a celebrity who even graced the cover of Vogue magazine. ""Her allegiance level is phenomenal,"" Colin Madden, one of Black Caviar's eight owners, said. ""She's a powerful horse who just fronts up every time and people really like that consistency."" The girls may have some way to go in catching the boys. But it seems that even in the equine world, the race is far from over.","Horse racing rare sport where males and females compete against each other .

"(CNN) -- A newly discovered account of the shooting of Abraham Lincoln, and his death the next morning, gives a vivid and moving picture of the calamity. Dr. Charles Leale was in the audience at Ford's Theater when Lincoln was shot, and was the first to attempt to treat the stricken president. In a report believed written the next day, April 15, 1865, Leale writes, ""the report of a pistol was distinctly heard and about a minute after a man of low stature with black hair and eyes was seen leaping to the stage beneath, holding in his hand a drawn dagger."" Stumbling as he leaped from the president's box, the man ""ran to the opposite side of the stage, flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and disappearing behind the scene."" Leale ran to the president's box, about 40 feet from where he'd been sitting, where he encountered Mary Lincoln. She said, "" 'O Doctor, do what you can for him! Do what you can!' I told her we would do all that we possibly could,"" Leale writes. Then he saw the president. ""He was in a state of general paralysis, his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition."" Leale was just 23, and had only barely begun practicing medicine after his service in the Civil War. He describes how he tried to treat the injury, beginning with asking another man to cut off Lincoln's coat and shirt to find any stab wounds. Leale first believed Lincoln had been stabbed, because of that sighting of John Wilkes Booth wielding a knife. But soon Leale realized the president's injury was a gunshot in the back of his head. Leale writes that he ""passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball, and found that it had entered the encephalon. As soon as I removed my finger a slight oozing of blood followed and his breathing became more regular."" Lincoln is then given some brandy, and two more doctors arrive. The report was found by Helena Iles Papaioannou, a researcher for the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, at the National Archives in Washington. She discovered it among the papers of the U.S. surgeon general. Her group's mission is to collect all documents ""to and from Abraham Lincoln,"" she said, and she came upon a copy of Leale's report by accident on May 21. The report is not in Leale's own hand, but is a ""true copy"" written by a clerk. ""Its immediacy makes it so very moving,"" said Papaioannou. ""But it's also so very clinical, and you realize how awful it was -- the injury that Lincoln sustained was just horrific."" Read the full document . Standing outside Ford's Theater in downtown Washington, Papaioannou explained it was too far to take Lincoln to the White House, so the doctors took him to a house across the street. ""You can see how narrow the street is,"" she said, pointing from Ford's Theater across to the historic Peterson House, where tourists were taking guided tours of the site. ""Even that little journey was traumatic."" There is no indication that Leale and the other doctors had any way to save Lincoln. ""You get a sense of helplessness,"" said Papaioannou. ""I think it was fairly immediate that he realized that the president wasn't going to recover."" Papaioannou said that, to her, the most moving part of Leale's report is his account of covering Lincoln shortly after the president was carried to a back bedroom of the Peterson House. ""He talks about how the president's legs -- his lower extremities, from the knees down -- were cold, and they brought him hot water bottles and hot blankets. I find that a very touching part of the report."" The document also describes in clinical terms the president's deterioration that night. Near the end of the report it states: ""At 7:20 a.m. he breathed his last and 'the spirit fled to God who gave it.' "" The very last line of the report seems to relay how absorbed Leale became in the gravity of the moment. ""Immediately after death had taken place, we all bowed and the Rev. Dr. Gurley supplicated to God in behalf of the bereaved family and our afflicted country."" Papaioannou talks about the moment she discovered this document. ""I took it out of the box, and started reading through it -- reading parts out to my colleagues who sat at the same table as me. ... We realized we had something special on our hands."" John Elliff, with the Lincoln Group of the District of Columbia, said the newly discovered report largely corroborates the account that Leale eventually published over 40 years later, in 1909. While it adds only a few details to known accounts of Lincoln's final hours, Elliff said, ""this report has more exact times and pulse rate measurements through the night -- an intriguing new detail for historians."" Agreeing with the researchers who found it, Elliff said that the document has a compelling immediacy, and is unclouded by the passage of time. ""The original report does get you right close to the event -- knowing that the doctor leaves the bedside and writes it within the day,"" he said.","Newly discovered document adds historical detail to what is known about Lincoln's death .

"(CNN) -- China is a football backwater. A country where the domestic league is plagued by corruption and the huge population is largely indifferent towards the ""beautiful game."" The sport in the nation has been rocked by a bribery investigation which resulted in two former high-ranking officials being handed 10-and-a-half-year prison sentences, while four former national team players are serving shorter terms. So why would Didier Drogba, a soccer star who recently scored the penalty which crowned Chelsea champions of Europe, swap the bright lights of the English Premier League for mid-table mediocrity with Shanghai Shenhua? It seems strange, but the Ivory Coast striker is the latest in a line of high-profile football figures to take advantage of the attractive salaries on offer in the Chinese Super League (CSL). He will reportedly be paid $315,000 a week -- the highest in the CSL. Drogba seals big-money Shanghai move . ""All these players going over there are past their prime and looking for one last big payday which will see them through for the rest of their lives,"" football agent Rob Shields told CNN. ""It's definitely money motivated. ""It's the commercial side of it. That's what Chinese clubs pitch to the players and their agents. It's not the standard of football they are used to, but the money they can make on the commercial side is absolutely immense."" Drogba's former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka made the switch in January, joining Shenhua on a two-year deal. Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi was recently appointed at Guangzhou Evergrande, an ambitious club which has splashed out on South American players Dario Conca of Argentina and Paraguay's Lucas Barrios. Where Shanghai and Guangzhou are concerned, the recruitment drive is being funded by wealthy individuals who, according to Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy at England's Coventry University, see football as a way to gain political influence. Guangzhou is owned by Xu Jiayin, chairman of the Evergrande Real Estate Group, while Shanghai's chairman Zhu Jun heads online gaming company The Nine City. ""Essentially they are vanity projects,"" Chadwick told CNN. The idea behind bringing top-level players to the CSL is, he believes, related to an attitude which is prevalent within the Chinese national psyche. ""There is a Chinese phenomenon known as 'guanxi,' which translates literally as 'special relationship,' "" explained Chadwick. ""Buying a club gives an owner good 'guanxi,' because it enables you to connect with politicians and other business people. Very often owners buy into clubs for those reasons. ""If Chinese football is successful globally, it makes China look good and it makes the politicians look good. What buying a club does is give the owners a certain amount of political influence."" Despite luring stars such as Drogba and Anelka away from Europe's finest competitions, the CSL is yet to truly capture the public's imagination. This is partly down to the reputation the sport has among China's 1.3 billion inhabitants. A recent crackdown on corruption saw Nan Yong and Xie Yalong, two former directors of the Chinese Football Administrative Center, sent to prison for over a decade after being found guilty of accepting bribes. Former national team midfielder Shen Si, who played for China 39 times between 1995 and 2002, was sentenced to six years behind bars, while former teammates Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming will spend five and a half years in jail. ""There are a lot of allegations of bribery, match-fixing, corruption,"" said Chadwick. ""In terms of the general public, it is largely switched off to Chinese football, because they are aware many of the people involved in the game are not straight. ""Not only do fans not want to watch football which is fixed, at the same time parents don't want their kids associated with something which has got such a poor record and high profile in terms of corruption. ""There are far superior products out there, such as Spain's La Liga, the EPL and Italy's Serie A. The likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid think of China and big money, but the reality is football is a minority sport in China."" While investment attracts players with global reputations, it does little to aid the development of young Chinese talent, meaning little or no benefit is felt by the national team -- which is 73rd in the FIFA world rankings. With China struggling to establish itself as a true football power, Chadwick said the money being spent on foreign players could instead be redirected to develop an infrastructure which would help develop promising youngsters. ""If you look at Conca, he stands out from the crowd because he is so superior. The standard of his play is so superior compared to the local players,"" Chadwick said. ""Chinese football clubs are investing very little in grassroots. Investment and spending is heavily skewed towards the professional level and not towards the development of the game."" The current trend is for aging stars such as the 34-year-old Drogba and Anelka, 33, to head to lesser leagues such as the CSL in the twilight of their careers. Shields sees no reason why the migration cannot continue, and he expects others to follow that path -- Nigeria striker Yakubu, 29, is the latest player linked with a Chinese switch after almost a decade spent playing in England. ""(Chinese clubs) seem to be doing it the right way at the moment,"" Shields said. ""The stadiums are getting built, they're recruiting big names. ""They're not going gung ho, they're not going over the top and there are still some local players there. Another couple of big-name players will go over, perhaps in the next couple of months."" But, according to Chadwick, the modern Chinese population are not excited by over-the-hill players, and he said only a genuine football superstar will successfully engage the public. ""The Chinese are an interesting group of people because on one hand they're quite defensive about themselves,"" he said. ""But at the same time they're becoming more aware of their own identity. ""They're not prepared to accept Europe's castoffs. They don't want Anelka and Drogba. They want Barrios and Conca, and then the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Wayne Rooney and Sergio Aguero. ""Players who are in their early to mid-20s and reaching the peak, it would be those people who would be much more significant. Then the floodgates will open.""","Veteran Didier Drogba is the latest star name to join the Chinese Super League .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Want to be an Asian superpower? Then an aircraft carrier, it seems, is the minimum requirement for joining this elite club. In China, a retro-fitted former Ukrainian carrier dating back to the Soviet era is the flagship of the country's hopes for a ""blue water"" navy -- a fleet that can operate on the high seas thousands of nautical miles from base. India has launched its first home built aircraft carrier as part of a plan to operate three carrier battle groups by 2020. And Japan -- whose navy is officially classed as a self-defense force -- has controversially unveiled what it has classed as a flat-topped helicopter destroyer, but to China looks perilously akin to an aircraft carrier. This latest piece of must-have military hardware might be expensive to build, logistically complex to operate and costly to defend -- and in the context of drone and submarine technology, some argue, increasingly obsolete - but the aircraft carrier is still regarded as one of the strongest projections of a nation's military power. More image than action? The carrier race comes amid rising assertiveness of Asian's military powers and changing conditions in the region. For Japan, it's a counter to the rising power of China and the threat from North Korea. For India, its carrier flexes its muscle in the direction of Pakistan while China wants to project power along its trade routes and regional interests. Just 20 aircraft carriers are active throughout the world and the U.S. Navy operates 10 of them. For many military analysts, however, the value of a carrier lies in having one rather than ever using one. Ashley Townshend, Joan Rydon Scholar in Government at Oxford University, says there is a disconnect between what an aircraft carrier projects and what it can actually do. ""Needing an aircraft carrier and wanting one are two different things,"" Townshend told CNN, adding that Asia -- despite recent headlines -- has had a long history of aircraft carrier operation. ""India has operated carriers before; China hasn't but China is a new foray into carrier naval warfare/carrier naval operations,"" he said. ""Japan interestingly had the world's first aircraft carrier."" Costly carrier . As an indication of how much a carrier costs, Britain is plowing an estimated Â£5 billion (US$8 billion) into its new carrier Queen Elizabeth. It is so large that it is being constructed in sections at six shipyards around the United Kingdom before being slotted together at Rosyth in Fife, Scotland. Perhaps fittingly for China's biggest naval gamble, its refurbished Ukrainian carrier was once touted to become a casino in Macau, a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China and a gambling center. ""This is really its initial training platform,"" said Townshend. ""It's unlikely that this carrier would be able to pack the sort of punch that would make it useful as a power projection carrier outside of limited and asymmetric incidents in Asia. ""You could conceivably ship it down into the South China Sea for the purposes of intimidating weaker South East Asian nations -- but that carries with it a lot of risks not least the proliferation of anti-carrier anti-sea control platforms in Asia."" Vulnerable . He said submarines, ship-launched and land-based ballistic missiles all make aircraft carriers vulnerable to attack in the context of modern conventional warfare. ""The sort of things, interestingly, that China has been building to keep the U.S. out of the Taiwan Strait are also being built by South East Asian nations to keep large scale Chinese naval platforms from being as powerful as they might be in the region."" While India, China and Japan may have deep pockets, the technology and military infrastructure necessary to operate what amounts to a floating military city for thousands of personnel still lags among these Asian superpowers. Military analyst Michael Horowitz, associate professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, in his book The Diffusion of Military Power, says learning to operate an aircraft carrier is difficult and time-consuming . ""Carrier warfare is one of the only major military innovations requiring high levels of both financial intensity and organizational capital to adopt,"" he said. ""Operating a floating airfield and the ship itself, plus coordinating with support ships, is simply a much harder set of tasks than lining up the big guns of a battleship and firing."" Carrier losses . Aircraft carriers also have one of the highest attrition rates of any arm of the military. According to a study by Professor Robert Rubel of the U.S. Naval War College, between 1949 and 1988 the US Navy and Marine Corps lost 12,000 aircraft and 8,500 air crew. Analysts say that with China training less than 100 pilots to operate fixed-wing aircraft from carriers, its capacity to absorb losses is low. ""It's difficult to train pilots up to land on what is effectively a moving airfield,"" Townshend said. ""While China will learn from the successes and failures of every country that has gone before it, it does take a lot of time and China has less than 100 airmen who are being trained to fly their version of a carrier aircraft."" Meanwhile, as India and China size up each other in the carrier war, analysts say it has to be remembered that both carrier nations have ships that are a third the size of the U.S. Nimitz class ships. ""For the Chinese, a lot of it is tied up with a story about itself becoming a great power,"" Townshend said. ""For China to be a great power it must be a great maritime power and to be a great power it must have carriers and blue water naval platforms.""","China, India and Japan have turned to aircraft carriers as an extension of military prestige .

"(CNN) -- As Paris Fashion Week demonstrates, adults love playing dress up just as much as children. The only difference between junior and senior would-be masters-of-disguise is that kids don't need an excuse to don a costume; grown-ups, however, seem to feel more comfortable when there's a theme involved. In the market for an outfit to match your fetish? With Halloween on the horizon, we've rounded up some of the craziest costumed events out there. Getting geeky with it . Self-proclaimed (and a few closeted) nerds will find no shortage of events catering to the dweebiest of whims. Though it faces some stiff competition (the Roswell UFO Festival, which encourages participants to dress as their favorite alien, could give it a run for its money), Comic-Con is arguably the dorkiest event on the calendar. The San Diego variant is not only the original, it is also the biggest comic-related convention. Last year heralded in over 130,000 visitors, with costumes ranging from Stark Trek characters to comic super heroes and even the odd Disney princess. As it has become an 'it' event for any Hollywood franchise wishing to build a cult-following (and there's a lot of them), Comic-Con has even managed to make the geek a little bit chic over the years, with A-list celebs showing up in costume too. Eyes Wide Shut . Fans of Stanley Kubrick should head to Italy to take part in one of the largest masked festivals on Earth. During Venice Carnevale, the ""city without streets"" takes on an especially surreal vibe as thousands of tourists join the locals in donning elaborate masks and gowns for ten days of celebrations. Though Carnevale's roots date back to the Middle Ages, the modern version has only been active since the '70s (blame Napoleon, who put an end to the fun when he invaded in 1797). The city's Piazza San Marco becomes mobbed with tourists and photographers, who snap pics of professionals strutting their stuff in ornate robes and those creepy, bird-like masks the city is famous for. Time travelers delight . At the Scarborough Faire Renaissance Festival, which runs every weekend throughout April and May, the 242,000 annual visitors are prone to dress in period outfits. The festival is set in 1533, the year Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn. General manager Coy Sevier says that historically, during a royal wedding,the king and queen would tour all the villages in their realm. He notes that such an event makes a handy motif for a gathering dedicated to outrageous costumes. ""Of course, anytime the king comes to town, it's a good time to spruce up, put on your finest, and put on a good show,"" he says. Though the professional performers are held to a high standard, with costume guards making sure no detail is out of place, for everyone else, it's a free for all. Read more: The man behind the world's strangest holidays . ""We have guests that come in as Dr. Who. We have a whole selection of musketeers. Even though they're a couple hundred years off, they're more than welcome,"" he says. The Vikings are coming! The Shetland Islands in the UK is home to the world's largest fire festival, Up Helly Aa, which also happens to be a holdover from Viking times. As such, the event is celebrated with a procession of 1,000 ""guizers"", or men in Viking costume, making their way through the town of Lerwick until they reach the Valhalla, where they then toss lit torches into a Viking long ship. Though dressing up is mainly reserved for locals, anyone is invited to witness the event. Last year, 5,000 onlookers cheered the helmeted mass as they readied themselves to take down another ship. Unleash the dark . Lovers of the macabre will do well to visit Leipzing, Germany during the annual Wave-Gotik-Treffen, aka, the Wave and Goth Festival. The costumes are remarkably diverse; futuristic robots are as much the norm as darkly-clad, Byron-esque romantics. The one thing that seems to unify the 20,000 participants, however, is an affection for Goth culture (which just happens to be very varied). ""In the last few years, new music styles have developed within the scene. In many cases, fashion is connected to that specialist taste, which is why there's such a range,"" explains Cornelius Brach, the festival organizer. Won't you join the (blue) ball? In 1995, the small town of Nederland, Colorado (population 1,470) became an unintentional symbol for cryogenics. A few years earlier, the body of Norwegian citizen Bredo Morstøl was shipped out to the town to live stored in a frozen state in the home of his daughter, Aud Morstøl. When she was evicted for living in a house without electricity or plumbing, she went to the local press in the hopes of salvaging her father's remains. Read more: The world's weirdest food festivals . Today, ""Grandpa Bredo"" (as he's known locally) is stored in a shed, packed with 1,600 pounds of dry ice delivered by a team of volunteers. In 2002, the town decided to commemorate the event with Frozen Dead Guy Days, an annual three-day homage to corpses and cold. ""We're a very small mountain town, and it's hard to eke out a living. The Chamber of Commerce was like, 'well, we're known as the town with the frozen dead guy, so let's have a festival,'"" explains Amanda MacDonald, the event organizer. Highlights of the fete include a coffin race, hearse parade, costume polar plunge and the Frozen Blue Ball -- a necro-themed costume party. Though anything goes in terms of costumes, the theme tends to revolve around cold things. Penguins, says McDonald, are popular.","The Scarborough Faire Renaissance Festival attracts nearly 250,000 period fans.

"(CNN) -- Poland has become the land of the giants. In cities across the country artists have transformed the sides of houses and apartment blocks with enormous murals, some pieces stretching upwards of ten stories. The artists behind most of the colossal pieces are Przemyslaw Blejzyk and Mateusz Gapski, also known as Sainer and Bezt, and collectively as ""Etam"". The two twenty-somethings met at art college in the central Polish city of Lodz having been into graffiti in their teens. They now work together on many of the projects. The duo has also worked with Natalia Rak, another young Polish artist who has produced her own larger-than-life pieces in Poland and the United States. Most of the recent projects by Rak and Etam have been commissioned by local city festivals, which have given the artists permission to paint without worry about being caught or prosecuted. From a tumbling jockey to a fantasy tree house, the artists employ a mix of modern styles and motifs from traditional Polish folklore. Each piece takes around a week to produce, says Blejzyk, and the reaction from the public is usually positive. ""For us most the important thing is to create an illustration where people could stop in front of it and turn on their imagination for a couple of minutes,"" he says.","Polish street artists 'Etam' have been transforming the sides of buildings across the country .

"(CNN) -- John Lajeunesse said he was heading to the Renegade Mountain area to go four-wheeling, nothing out of the ordinary for a 16-year-old kid in rural Tennessee. How he and three other young people ended up shot dead inside a car on that same mountain is now a mystery before police and the small community of nearby Crossville. A passerby discovered the car with the four victims, including a young mother, parked along a country road near the Renegade Mountain community Thursday morning. Lajeunesse and a pair of 17-year-olds, Steven Presley and Dominic Davis, were the passengers. Rikki Jacobsen, a 22-year-old mother of a young boy, was in the driver's seat. Three of the victims were current or former students of the local school district. ""It's something that reverberates through the entire community,"" said Donald Andrews, Cumberland County's school superintendent. ""The loss of life is always tough, and especially (so) when it's young people."" Only one man has been publicly linked to the killings: Jacob Allen Bennett. Authorities said he was identified fairly quickly into the investigation and taken into custody around midnight Thursday without incident on a parole violation in nearby Rhea County. Randy York, the district attorney general whose territory includes the crime scene, told reporters Friday that his office intends ""in the very near future"" to empanel a grand jury to consider charges against Bennett related to the four killings. ""The citizens of Cumberland County and Crossville can rest assured that we have the person who committed the crimes in custody, that the community is safe,"" said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn. Profiles of the victims . The 26-year-old Bennett had been booked in Cumberland County five times before this, in addition to arrests in other counties and another state, said Sheriff Butch Burgess. He did not detail any of Bennett's alleged crimes, beyond the fact he'd been charged in 2009, convicted, sentenced to prison, then released on parole. If law enforcement authorities know more, they kept the facts close to the vest Friday -- including about how the killings were carried out and why. They have been working diligently since first learning of the deaths at 7 a.m. Thursday. ""They're kind of like robots, they're still going,"" said Burgess of the state and local investigators. ""To them, it's not a job, especially when they see the circumstances involve kids. It hits home."" And then there are the victims' families, struggling to make sense of the bloodshed in a place where -- as many insisted -- these kinds of things just don't happen. Michael Rick, who lives with Lajeunesse's family, said he dropped the 16-year-old at Presley's house on Wednesday afternoon. Lajeunesse mentioned that the pair were going to go four-wheeling at around Renegade Mountain and spend the night at his friend's house. The next day, Lajeunesse didn't call Rick to be picked up. ""You just get that gut feeling when nothing is right,"" Rick said. It wasn't until Thursday night that police were able to confirm what they feared: Lajeunesse was among those killed. According to the Cumberland County Board of Education, Lajeunesse had attended two local high schools, though most recently he's been home-schooled. Davis was a sophomore at Cumberland County High School, having recently moved with his family to Tennessee from Colorado, said Andrews. Another victim, Presley, graduated from The Phoenix School in May. As to Jacobsen, she had a son who attended a Cumberland County elementary school -- and whom she ""loved more than life itself,"" according to a friend who asked not to be named before they had not been friends for long. ""She was very nice, she was innocent, and she couldn't stop talking,"" the friend said. Located about 70 miles west of Knoxville and 110 miles east of Nashville, Crossville is a small city that serves as the county seat for Cumberland and its 57,000 people. It's a place that the school superintendent describes as a ""down-home type community"" where ""everyone seems to know everyone."" As a result, everyone has been shaken by this week's carnage. Students in the county's 12 schools, particularly its three high schools, were told about the killings Friday morning, then encouraged to talk about it in class or with counselors. ""Some were very quiet, some were reflective, some were more open,"" said Andrews. ""The mood at the schools was very subdued."" ""It was just a surprise. It's one of those 'this doesn't happen here' kind of things. It's actually a grim reminder to us all that we're all vulnerable,"" he said. But what, if anything, made these four victims particularly vulnerable, leading to their deaths, hasn't been revealed. Was it a drug deal gone bad? A theft? A fight? Residents want to know, but authorities refuse to speculate. Casey Cox, the sheriff department's lead investigator, explained that officials want to be careful about what they release, while acknowledging that this case is personal to many: ""There's a lot of emotion that goes into this case just simply based on the age of these children.""","A passer-by found 4 people shot dead in a car on a rural road Thursday morning .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Superjumbo, the world's largest passenger plane, has finally conquered the world's busiest airport. Korean Air kicked off its double-decker Airbus A380 service this week from Seoul to Atlanta, which celebrated Friday with a spectacular ceremony. Shortly after touching down, Flight 035 slowly taxied to its specially modified gate under a towering arch of water cannons. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport, which handled some 95 million passengers last year, is now the seventh U.S. airfield able to handle this ginormous aircraft. But nearly six years after the Superjumbo entered service, it's unclear whether bigger is necessarily better. Atlanta's airport spent about $30 million in passenger fees for runway, taxiway and jetway modifications, which enabled Bumshick Ehm -- one of Flight 035's approximately 350 passengers -- to easily exit the aircraft after a 13-hour, 7,100-mile nonstop journey. Vine video of the Korean Airlines A380 taking off Friday . Ehm was returning home to Atlanta with his 3-year-old daughter after visiting family in Seoul. ""Inside, when you're flying, it really doesn't feel that different from any other plane,"" said Ehm, 33. ""But when you see it from the outside, you're reminded how huge it is."" More floor space and quieter engines . Air travel is projected to explode in the coming decades. Airlines are looking to freshen their fleets, while aircraft makers are pitching their new planes as the wave of the future. The A380 boasts quieter engines and lightweight construction to save fuel. And it's roomy -- with 50% more floor space than its competitor, the relatively new Boeing 747-8, which seats 400 to 500 passengers. #ATL24: Behind the scenes at the world's busiest airport . More than four decades after the original 747 Jumbo Jet, it's hard for any giant airliner to avoid comparisons to the enormously successful icon. Korean Air has taken some of the Superjumbo's floor space and created a ""Celestial Bar"" lounge hosted by a bartender. Also aboard is a ""duty-free showcase"" where passengers can shop for cosmetics, perfumes, liquor and accessories. Upstairs, they can find luxurious Kosmo First Class suites and lie-flat sleepers spaced 6 feet apart. First class takes up the forward part of the lower floor with economy filling up the rear. Upstairs, it's all business class, offering comfy seating but less privacy. ""The cabin is really modern,"" Ehm said. ""I liked the duty-free shop, and the lounge made me feel like a VIP."" A cruise liner in the sky . ""The reality is that if you're on the upper deck, you don't know there's another deck below you,"" says Brett Snyder of Crankyflier.com. Â ""And if you're on the lower deck, it's like sitting on a 747."" In 2007, at the A380's American coming out party at New York's JFK airport, the plane was compared to a cruise liner in the sky. But the A380's reputation hit a rough spot in 2011 when a taxiing Air France Superjumbo clipped a smaller plane at JFK so hard it turned it 45 degrees. Clearly Boeing didn't think bigger is always better. In the 1990s Boeing briefly partnered with Airbus to collaborate on a new wide-body four-engine airliner before backing out. Instead, Boeing chose to build on its previous success. The newest version of the 747 -- the 747-8 entered service in 2011 with room for 51 extra passengers than its previous version -- falls short of A380's capacity, although it is longer. Boeing's new 747 warmed the hearts of countless aviation geeks who still crush on the plane's distinctive front bulge. And it's not just geeks who like it. A recent poll of 1,000 fliers by airfarewatchdog.com showed Boeing's 777 and 747 beating out the A380. Both Boeing and Airbus have suffered through mechanical problems with new aircraft -- the A380 with wing cracks and the 787 Dreamliner with overheating batteries. Seven U.S. airports can land the A380 . Nonetheless, after two years in business, Boeing's 747-8 has received more than 100 orders. Snyder points out that Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which seats up to 300 and has been in service for two years, has surpassed 900 orders. Compare that to the A380, which has been in service six years and has yet to crack 300. So now Atlanta joins six other American cities where travelers can fly the A380: Miami, Houston, New York's JFK, Washington's Dulles, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Is the A380 opening new routes? Not really, says Snyder, although the Superjumbo has ""enabled airlines like Emirates to put more seats on existing routes at a lower cost."" The 787, however, is opening new routes that traditionally haven't worked because of cost issues or range limits, he says, including United's from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. Â Or British Airways' from Austin, Texas, to London. In the end, which will dominate long-distance flight? Will we regularly soar above the clouds in four-engined, double-decker hotels? Or will travelers prefer single-floor planes with two engines and fewer perks? For Ehm and his daughter as they come to the end of their trans-Pacific journey, that's not really at the top of their agenda. They're just glad to be home.","Atlanta's becomes 7th U.S. airport where the giant A380 airliner can land .

"(CNN) -- Jon Sandusky, son of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, was arrested in North Dakota on suspicion of drunken driving by the Fargo Police Department, a jail official said. Authorities did not disclose additional information. But the North Dakota newspaper, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, said Sandusky was pulled over Tuesday morning for making an illegal turn. After field sobriety tests, Sandusky was arrested, the newspaper reported. Jon Sandusky is an executive with the Cleveland Browns football team. His father, Jerry Sandusky, 69, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Jerry Sandusky's effort to appeal his case was denied last week. Sandusky's adopted son, Matt, and six other victims of the former Penn State assistant football coach finalized settlement agreements with the university, attorneys said in August. The amounts of the settlements are confidential.","Jon Sandusky was arrested on Tuesday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- TLC, the superstar girl group of the 1990s, is officially back with new music, a movie about them and plans to tour. ""We had a great run,"" said Rozonda ""Chilli"" Thomas. ""To be here two decades later and have another chance to do even more, I feel like the sky is the limit."" Chilli and Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins had mounted other comebacks since Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes died in a car crash in 2002, but challenges -- including a brain tumor that blinded T-Boz for a time -- slowed them. ""This is our baby"" When VH-1 premieres ""CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story"" on October 21, a new generation of potential fans will learn about the groundbreaking trio. Chilli and T-Boz were closely involved from start to finish in developing the script, casting and preparing the actors, Chilli said. ""This is our baby."" T-Boz brings reality to TV . Actress-singer Keke Palmer plays Chilli, rapper Lil' Mama portrays Left Eye and Drew Sidora is T-Boz. ""We basically took them under our wings and we shared a lot of stories with them,"" Chilli said. ""We spent a lot of time with them, and they were very observant when it came to looking at how Tionne and I interact with each other, the chemistry that we naturally have."" ""We spent more time with Lil' Mama, since Lisa was not here,"" Chilli said. ""So we really had to spend more time with her. She looked at a lot of video footage. She did a lot of research."" The film includes sequences with Lil' Mama that closely echo the VH-1 documentary ""Last Days of Left Eye."" ""We're really proud with how she portrayed Lisa, and I know Lisa would be very happy and I know her family would be very happy as well,"" Chilli said. Lil' Mama may join TLC . Lil' Mama may be on stage singing Left Eye's parts when TLC tours to promote a new album set for release next year, they said. ""For sure, we're talking and thinking about it when we go on tour,"" Chilli said. She performed with Chilli and T-Boz this summer several times, including at Drake's OVO Festival in Toronto. The group is keeping details about next year's album -- their first in a decade -- a secret, other than to say it will have a lot of featured artists, including Lady Gaga. ""We have some other surprises,"" Chilli said. Fans can already hear a new TLC single -- ""Meant to Be"" -- that they recorded with Ne-Yo.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's the latest executive craze sweeping boardrooms across the globe, and a tiny score is becoming as sought-after as a low handicap on the golf course. Nintendo's DS-Lite: Breaking into markets beyond traditional gamers . ""Brain Training,"" or ""Brain Age"" as it's known in North America, is a collection of quick-fire maths quizzes, anagrams, music recitals and memory tests developed by Nintendo with Japanese neuroscientist Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. The game is part of Nintendo's attempt to widen the appeal of its game consoles, especially the cute little DS-Lite, beyond typical gamers -- in this case, to an older audience concerned with its health. ""Exercise is the key to good health both for body and mind,"" says the company's U.S. Web site. ""Playing regularly for just a few minutes a day has been found to stimulate parts of the brain related to thinking, creativity and concentration,"" claims the Nintendo Europe Web site. And the tactic is working: with over 10 million copies of ""Brain Training"" and ""More Brain Training"" sold worldwide, and with celebrity endorsements from Nicole Kidman and Patrick Stewart, Dr. Kawashima and his brain exercises have become a global phenomenon. But does Nintendo's ""Brain Training"" actually make you smarter? The expert's opinion . I spoke to Dr. Lauren Stewart, a cognitive neuroscientist at Goldsmiths, University of London, to find out what improvements I could expect to see in my brain. She reveals that it is hard to measure the impact that brain training could have on my day-to-day life. ""It is a complex thing to determine whether learning on one thing transfers to another thing,"" she explains. But can training on certain tasks make you smarter? ""It depends what we think being smart is all about,"" she says, adding that if the tasks were similar to IQ tests, I might see a small increase in my IQ. Dr. Stewart does point to research that suggests exercising one's brain does work -- and might even help to prevent those dreaded ""senior moments."" ""Learning of any kind does forge new neuronal connections,"" she reveals. ""Evidence seems to support the 'use it or lose it' mantra with respect to staving off neuronal degeneration in old age."" And Dr. Stewart is keen to dispel the myth that once we're adults, we're too old to learn. ""There are numerous examples of learning in adulthood and structural brain changes accompanying this,"" she says. So now it's down to me. Attracted by the prospect of a lean, mean, mind machine, I decided to put it to a three-week test. Watch out Kidman, here I come... Day 1 The DS-Lite arrives in the afternoon. Mmm, shiny! I test my brain age: it's 41, considerably older than my actual age, and far from a ""perfect"" age of 20. I sigh. Will I ever be as smart as Patrick Stewart? I work through the exercises. They're surprisingly fun, pandering as they do to my inner dork tendencies. Day 2 I play the brain training games on the subway and equal or improve my scores. ""What an improvement! I could almost cry!"" says Dr. Kawashima. I'm not quite so excited. I become so engrossed in ""Brain Training"" that I nearly miss my stop, leap off the train, stylus and console in hand, and stand at the bottom of the escalators trying to complete a game. My fellow commuters -- quite rightly -- throw me pitying looks. I'm so flustered I leave the tube station by the wrong exit and end up wandering dazedly around central London, trying to find my office. Worse still, my brain age is still a less-than-sprightly 40. Brain training? Brain draining! Day 3 Following yesterday's mishaps, I rule out brain age checks on the subway. My brain age drops to 30. Result! Day 5 After a stressful weekend moving house, I kick back and relax with a glass of wine and Dr. Kawashima. Big mistake! My tiredness and the alcohol leave me fumbling and just one drink raises my brain age to a wobbly 37. I cast blameful glances at the Merlot, and resolve to stay sober for testing. Day 6 I fluff the exercises, the new one's a nightmare and Dr. Kawashima is tormenting me with a 5x5 square of random numbers that I'm supposed to remember. Woe! Time to check my brain age. I expect to see it increase to 50+ on stress alone, but am amazed when, for the first time, I break through the 30 barrier! Brain age of 27: read it and weep, Kidman. Day 7 It's a week in; I zip through the exercises and tackle the test. My brain age drops again to 24. Woo hoo! Day 10 I skip a day. Day 11 Dr. Kawashima complains at me for not coming by yesterday. I'm not in the mood, but do the exercises anyway, stumbling on lots of the anagrams. My score plummets; elsewhere, I'm flatlining. I resist the urge to stab his irritating, bouncing face with my stylus and take the brain test. It seems grouchiness doesn't impact your score -- I'm back down to 27. ""Hmm, a little tired, are we?"" he says. Die, Dr. Kawashima, die. Day 14 Dr. Kawashima introduces me to a new, Tetris-style game that will, apparently, relax my brain. This is important too, I'm told. While the music is soothing, the game has me hooked. But ideal before bedtime? I'm up playing it 'til 4 a.m. Day 15 Exhausted from last night's small-hours game playing, I skip a day. Day 16 I've whittled my brain age down to 23, but by accident, I leave my DS-Lite on my desk -- no brain training in the evening, nor in the morning! I start to panic. Help! I'm addicted! Day 17 I time how long it takes me to do all the exercises and the brain age test. It's now taking half an hour a day -- a considerable chunk of my leisure time -- and I'm starting to resent that. Dr. Kawashima keeps asking me to get my friends to play with me. ""Please be sure to introduce friends and family to the quick play demo,"" he says. ""Share it with family and friends who want to try it out with no hassles!"" Sorry Doc, I don't pimp goods to my pals. Day 18 His patronizing comments are starting to get to me. ""Don't lose heart! Just try again tomorrow!"" he says, when my score drops. I want to punch him. Day 20 And then it all goes wrong. I stumble with the stylus and mess up the memory test. My brain age plummets to 37. I can't end like that! Day 21 The final day of my three week experiment. Can I redeem myself? I'm revved up for the tests and my brain age tumbles to 22 -- just two away from a perfect 20! But Dr. Kawashima seems less impressed. ""Your brain seems fairly young,"" he says. ""But with regular training, you can sharpen that brain even more!"" Is he never satisfied? I lost 15 years in a day! Perhaps I shouldn't have taken brain training quite so seriously -- after all, it's only a game... And the results? ""Brain Training"" was more fun than you'd expect, and left me feeling more confident performing certain tasks, like quick-fire maths, away from the console. My scores quickly improved as I became used to the software and the console, then leveled out. The game was surprisingly addictive and monopolized my attention. My usually yawn-filled commute zipped by; when I skipped a day's training I missed it; and, for a brief spell, my husband became a Nintendo widower. I was most taken aback by my strong emotional response to the game: when my scores improved, I felt jubilant; when they dipped, I felt distraught and stupid. But did ""Brain Training"" make me smarter? Call me a cynic, but I'm not convinced it's anything more than a cunning ploy to get non-gamers like me hooked on Nintendo's latest little console. And that certainly worked. ................................ Do you train your brain? How do you give your gray cells a workout? Share your thoughts and read others' views in the Just Imagine forum.

"(CNN) -- Henrik Stenson may have just become golf's $11.4 million man, but the Swede insists it's not all about the money. It is perhaps easier to say that after scooping the most lucrative prize in his sport, but the Swede insists ""at this stage of my career, I'm playing for trophies."" ""I'm not really out there for the money,"" the newly-crowned FedEx Cup champion told CNN. ""The money is a nice bonus, but to be able to beat the best players in the world gives me more satisfaction than a nice pay check."" The new world No. 4 won the $1.4 million Tour Championship in Atlanta to finish top of the FedEx Cup rankings, a position that comes with a cool $10 million check. Stenson's three-stroke victory at the East Lake Golf Club is the highest peak -- so far -- of a barely believable ascent up the rankings. He won the Players Championship in 2009 to reach a then career high ranking of fifth, but an alarming plummet followed and by January 2012 he had dropped to 230th in the world. But a standout 2013 has seen Stenson reestablish himself in golf's upper echelons when a joint third-place finish in July's Scottish Open was followed by a runner's up spot at the British Open. Stenson then finished third in August's PGA Championship -- the year's final major -- before winning the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier in September. ""It's just been an amazing run of play, from the Scottish Open through the British Open and all the way up until now,"" explained the 37-year-old Swede. ""It's the best season of my career by far and I've achieved some great things in the last couple of months. ""I think it says that we don't give up ... If I ever thought that I wasn't going to get back I don't think I would've. I'm hanging in there even when times aren't great. ""I've got a great support team around me as well, that support me in good times and bad times."" Bad times arrived in February 2009 when Stenson became embroiled in the Alan Stanford financial scandal, an episode which goes some way to explaining his philosophical view on his newly-acquired fortune. Stenson invested a significant amount of his own money in the investment company run by Stanford, who is now serving a 110-year prison sentence for running a Ponzi scheme.where investors are offered high returns in a very short space of time. The scheme operates on paying off the early ""investors"" from the cash from new ""investors."" ""It was not a great scenario,"" said Stenson. ""I wouldn't say it had much effect on my golf. Of course you're not going to be happy when you're involved in a thing like that, but there were a lot of other people who lost money too."" After successfully swelling his coffers at the weekend, Stenson has set his sights on addressing a significant gap in his trophy case. ""I want to win a major championship,"" he added. ""I'm excited, looking ahead to next year. We've still got a lot of golf to be played this side of Christmas and I've got a good chance to win the money title in Europe. ""The Race to Dubai final series is coming up -- four big tournaments -- so I'm going to try my hardest there to be No. 1.""","Henrik Stenson wins the FedEx Cup to pick up $10m winner's check .

"(CNN) -- It was his most famous speech, and the most memorable moment of the March on Washington. All eyes were on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on August 28, 1963, as he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech to a crowd of 250,000. But one photographer, there to document the event, trained his camera away from the civil rights icon and toward the crowd. The result was a visual document showcasing the diversity of marchers who gathered that day. ""This is the Day: The March on Washington,"" is a collection of 75 of Leonard Freed's photographs -- most published for the first time -- taken before, during and after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Freed's most recognizable image is likely a photo of King glad-handing supporters in Baltimore after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. But in ""This is the Day,"" there is only one photograph of King, an atmospheric shot taken from afar. Most of the images focus on anonymous marchers: black, white; union and nonunion; secular, religious; people from all over America, and from many different walks of life. ""Leonard Freed's moving photography offers still images of an America at once frozen in time and marching restlessly to its multicultural and multiracial future through the lens of a visionary artist,"" Michael Eric Dyson writes in the foreword to the book. Freed was an American Jew, born in Brooklyn, who spent time in Europe. He was living in Berlin in 1961 when he took a photo of an unnamed African-American soldier standing guard by the Berlin Wall. He was haunted by that image, according to Paul Farber, a contributing author to ""This is the Day."" ""(To Freed) that encounter was a contradiction of American culture: that a soldier could guard a country's freedom abroad, but would be denied those rights at home."" It compelled Freed to return to the United States to photograph the story of race in America. Freed's wife, Brigitte, recalled those images when she heard then-candidate Barack Obama say: ""I am here because somebody marched."" Those words prompted her to revisit her husband's archives from the March on Washington. Her husband died in 2006, but she hoped his images of that day would live on. She worked with Farber, a visiting assistant professor of writing at Haverford College, to curate the project, and ""This is the Day: The March on Washington"" was born. In this edited conversation, CNN spoke to Farber about Leonard Freed's photographs from the march and the importance of images in communicating the message of the civil rights movement. CNN: As a co-curator of the project, how did you and Ms. Brigitte decide which images to select? What criteria was used? Farber: What we did was look (at photographs) that Leonard had marked with a wax pencil, meaning this was an image he liked or would like to explore. We also sought images from the perspective of now, decades later, which images might stand out and be important to a contemporary viewer -- especially the ones that give us a view of the faces of the crowd. The goal was always that Leonard's own vision might be brought out from the day, but also that other images might participate in a broadened cultural awareness of the sweeping diversity and impact of the march. CNN: What would you say is the most powerful image from this collection? Why? Farber: One in particular that stands out is of young women in zip-up NAACP jackets standing at the base of the Washington Monument with American flags waving behind them. I think what you get a sense of is it took people out of their everyday circumstances and brought them together, here, against this monumental landscape of the National Mall. This was the people's gathering place. And using their presence as a way to create a collective -- that stands out -- and states belonging. The photograph to me is a feeling of a belonging. CNN: Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech is perhaps the most enduring symbol of the march. What do the photos reveal that history often forgets? Farber: One of the great historical facts about the march was the difficulty in pulling off an event that was pioneered by a number of organizations and individuals with different definitions and investments of social change at the march. (I see) the rich diversity of the ""we"": Although there are different groups and investments, you get a sense from photographs like these that it's not an ""us"" and a ""them"" but a ""we"". It's not to erase the differences, or simply streamline them, but in co-existing, you get a richer vision of what social change can be. CNN: How was this photography critical in the message of the march? Farber: Leonard captured some important private reflective movements. It's a lesson for us in thinking about great moments in history: what it takes to envision progress or possibility is both about moving forward and also about considering and questioning and stopping -- and having the patience for social change. Part of what photography gives us is ... a sense of the high points of these great moments in history, as well as the unexpected glances that really capture the subjects (as) they have their own thoughts and own ideas, (and) relate to the broader group's perception throughout the day.","""This is the Day: The March on Washington"" is a photo essay of the March on Washington .

"(EW.com) -- [SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen Breaking Bad's series finale, stop reading now.] . Believe it or not, some people actually made it out of the Breaking Bad series finale alive. And even though we won't get to see their lives unfold, those survivors still have a (potentially) drug-free lifetime ahead of them. So what comes next? If chapter one of their stories involved Heisenberg, lots of desert, and even more drugs, what is chapter two (or three) all about? Here's how we see the show's biggest survivors 10 years from now: . Badger and Skinny Pete: After burning through almost all of the money that Walt gave them for correctly using laser pointers, Badger and Skinny Pete decided that their drug days were behind them. Plus, the blue stuff was no longer on the market, so everything else kind of sucked in comparison. After getting clean, Badger took his crazy ideas to Hollywood, where producers thought he was insane, but he found a small comedy team that hired him as a writer. He thinks they're a drama group, but what he doesn't know won't hurt him. Skinny Pete, after getting clean, replaced drugs with food and now weighs more than 300 lbs ... but his friends still call him Skinny Pete. He moved to Hollywood with Badger and currently works as a bartender at the Hard Rock Cafe. He and Badger (and their girlfriends of the moment) share a duplex. They play video games and order pizza every night. But they now have to order two pizzas because, well, Skinny Pete eats a lot. EW: See full coverage of 'Breaking Bad' Brock and Jesse: After Jesse escaped the Nazis, he drove straight to the police station. He reported everything, gave the DEA his full cooperation and walked away without ever seeing the inside of a prison cell (blame his puppy eyes). And while he was at the police station, he got Badger and Skinny Pete to move his money to a safe location. After that was all tied up, he went to see Brock. Turns out, Andrea's mom had recently died of a heart attack, so Jesse formally adopted Brock. The duo now lives in Phoenix, where Jesse has his own carpentry business. He spends his days making perfect boxes and so much more. He also sells his drawings on the side. Brock, meanwhile, is big into soccer and a straight-A student who only ever gets in trouble at school for his over-use of the word ""bitch."" His favorite breakfast meal is a Grand Slam. Skyler and Marie: Skyler just recently went into remission after having battled lung cancer. She blames the stress of being married to Walt for her smoking, much like Marie blames her recent shop-lifting adventures on how she still misses Hank. But all in all, the sisters are doing well. They live together in a beautiful California home. Skyler has taken to swimming in the morning to start off her day, and she spends the rest of it writing (and still drinking a little too much). She's currently writing her second book, a follow-up to the story of a chemistry teacher who started cooking meth to make money for his family. The first one ended with the main characters getting involved with a drug lord, and the second one picks up with a flash-forward to a plane crash. She calls the series Breaking Bad. It's growing more popular with each book. Meanwhile, Marie is still a nurse. She's finally back to wearing purple, but Skyler has limited the amount of purple in the home to Marie's individual room. And hidden in the corner of Marie's purple room is her very own rock mineral collection. EW: 'Breaking Bad' - 10 questions we'll never see resolved . Walt Jr. and Saul: Now living on his own after college (he inherited a ton of money on his 18th birthday), Flynn has taken up residence with his girlfriend in Nebraska, where he works as a lawyer. His mentor? Some guy who looks a lot like Saul Goodman. Holly: Living in California with mom and Marie, Holly is (not surprisingly) a science prodigy. They suspect she'll go to college on a full-ride by the time she's 16. But whether she'll use that knowledge for good or bad is yet to be seen. Let's just hope she doesn't unknowingly buy out of a billion-dollar company for $5,000 and spend the rest of her life regretting it. After all, everyone keeps talking about how much she reminds them of Walt. She even asks Skyler to cut the crust off of all her sandwiches. Double flash-forward: Holly and Brock team up to create a drug empire! Too much? Huell and Kuby: Kuby finally rescued Huell from the hotel room where he filled him in on a little secret: He had been following the Nazis and knew where all of Walt's money was stashed. So with a few barrels worth of cash in the bank, Huell and Kuby moved to a small island somewhere off the coast of South America. They now spend their days doing absolutely nothing. And yes, they occasionally take naps on large piles of money. Gretchen and Elliott: They gave Walt's money to Flynn, and now, they keep busy doing what they do best â€” being rich and therefore throwing elaborate birthday celebrations. And let's not forget that Kaylee Ehrmantraut is now an official bada** in training. She wants to be a cop ... at least to start. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Every day, the federal government's partial shutdown brings more tragic and disheartening news to America's veterans, troops and their families. This week, the Department of Defense announced it would be unable to pay the $100,000 death gratuity benefit to support families of the fallen -- news that is insulting to those who serve and their families. For a government that readily claims to support America's troops and veterans by spending billions on service members and veterans, legislators failed to notice that this particular lack of funding, a mere fraction of the Defense Department's budget, would be cut off, causing needless pain to grieving families. The news drew quick condemnation from pundits, the military and veterans community, and members of Congress. Politicians from both parties, displaying a sense of urgency yet to be seen on the notion of ending the shutdown, rushed to condemn the decision and quickly called for the benefits to be reinstated. Fortunately, the military charity Fisher House Foundation has stepped up and will cover these benefits for the Pentagon until the problem is solved. The strong words and overwhelming bipartisan support on death benefits and veterans funding issues makes veterans wonder why Congress can muster such sharp and decisive action on a limited basis, especially when it involves veterans and the military community? Veterans and military families are left to wonder if the pledges of support are genuine, or do they just conveniently provide a symbolic fallback issue for legislators when governing in Washington gets tough? As part of shutdown politics, members continually retreat to the veterans community, to the point that they start tripping over each other to be first in front of the camera. This behavior was on display last week as well when members of Congress attempted to gain the upper hand in the public relations battle over the closure of the World War II Memorial. For ""the greatest generation,"" the World War II Memorial is more than pillars and a fountain; it is a shrine to the more than 400,000 Americans who gave their lives in lands far away from the United States for ideals that we still fight for every day in this country. It is a solemn place of remembrance for men and women who endured hardship, tragedy and suffering on levels that many of us simply cannot fathom. Once the government shutdown began, the site was supposed to be off-limits to everyone, including World War II veterans. But on the day the government shut down, 92 World War II veterans visiting from Mississippi made headlines by breaking through the barricades and paying homage to their fallen comrades. Suddenly, a war that ended more than 65 years ago became current a few hours into a government shutdown. The image of World War II veterans breaking through yellow tape and metal barricades went viral, and members of Congress from both parties quickly attached themselves to the fight. This shutdown has generated a style of bandwagon politics in the last week that is getting stale. Rather than focus on solving the problems that resulted in the shutdown, politicians are conveniently highlighting veterans and military families without doing the one job that will really help: Ending the shutdown. The threat for veterans and military families is all too real. A denial of some services and lingering doubt about the future will only add more financial and emotional anguish to a community that's already endured war for more than a dozen years. On social media via #Shutdownstories and calls to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America case managers, we hear from veterans in the Veterans Affairs backlog who will have to spend more time waiting for a claims decision than they spent in combat zones. Veterans who make up 27% of the federal workforce are now furloughed. National Guard drills are being rescheduled or canceled in many states, affecting troop readiness and pay. On base, services that military families count on are now closed. Veterans who rely on disability and GI Bill benefits are facing the very real possibility of not getting their benefits next month, as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki testified Wednesday. Photo-ops, shouting matches and gimmicks will not help veterans and military families who are hurting during the shutdown. These political events provide no long-term benefits for the military community and get us nowhere closer to ending a shutdown that is inflicting real pain on the men and women who fought for our country. The political games and posturing need to end. Make no mistake that veterans and military families appreciate compliments and expressions of support and gratitude -- but what we need most right now are solutions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick McCormick.","Nick McCormick: Death benefits were cut off to families of the fallen .

"(CNN) -- This week Iran and world powers finally commence long-delayed nuclear negotiations in Geneva. Was it a coincidence that just a few days ago, Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani engaged in a monumental 15-minute phone call and reopened a line of communication that has been closed for more than thirty years? It's clear that Iran's new president hopes to establish trust between the West and Iran so that sanctions on Iran's economy are removed. In return Rouhani, who says Iran has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, promises to offer complete transparency into the country's uranium enrichment program. Securing this trust between both Iran and the United States, however, will be no easy feat. Decades of political antagonism -- along with Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the U.S. Congress -- stand in the way of a successfully negotiated outcome. Iran and the U.S. have a number of areas of mutual interest: stability in Iraq, peace and security in Afghanistan, and the resolution of the conflict in Syria. Iran has control and influence over the region via its affairs with and support of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. All of these difficulties are compounded by the nuclear issue. But the resolution of the crisis through a grand bargain would in fact benefit not only the U.S., but also its allies in the region. And although the thought of a compromise with Iran concerns Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the emiratis of the region, that doesn't mean all is lost. ANALYSIS: U.S. hopeful, ""clear-eyed"" over talks . The stringent sanctions on trade with the U.S. and Europe have seen Iran gradually shift its oil and gas trade toward Asia -- namely China and India. But Iran's exclusion from the SWIFT currency clearing system has forced Tehran to deal in local currencies. When Iran trades with India it receives rupees in exchange for its oil. Iran then uses the rupees to buy Indian products, but it has ended up selling more oil than it has made in imports, creating a trade imbalance. Relaxation on sanctions on these trading partners will be easier to implement. While sanctions related to medical necessities have already been relaxed, and discussions about freer trade in petrochemicals and the loosening of trade controls on gold have been mentioned, Iran will hardly perceive these steps as sufficient. In reality, in the short term, Iran needs to be granted access to fund transfers via SWIFT. In the longer term, the U.S. will be asked to ensure Iran has access to the proper technology required for efficient oil and gas production. Projects â€” such as the pipeline that supplies Iranian oil to Pakistan and India, and thus benefits not only Iran but also Pakistan and India â€” will need to be allowed to be implemented. In exchange for U.S. help in removing some of the sanctions and in the opening up of exportation channels, Iran would need to agree to complete transparency and to the closure of some of its nuclear facilities. But the hurdles are many, and the most complicated and involved ones are with the U.S. Congress. The Obama administration has limited control over the actions of the legislative branch, and voting against Iran may be more politically expedient for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. This is one of the reasons why Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, has said he believes America is not reliable and cannot be trusted. Opinion: How Tehran got back to the negotiating table . Despite these difficulties, I believe there remains room to strike a deal. Iran may be willing to provide significant transparency, including extensive and thorough inspections of all nuclear operations, a reduction in the amount of nuclear material produced and stored in Iran, and even the dismantling of a few thousand centrifuges. But Iran will be reluctant to relinquish its 20%-enriched uranium, which experts believe can easily be weaponized, unless the West is willing to provide similar material for use in Iranian research facilities. For its part the P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- would need to make trade with Iran less burdensome by allowing a specified set of Iranian banks access to currency clearing via SWIFT. The U.S. and its partners would also need to remove a number of sanctions to allow Iran to more freely trade its oil with its partners to the East and be paid for it in tradable currencies. If trust can be established and a bargain can be struck, the sheer size of Iran's population of 75 million could make it the largest economy to rejoin the global system since the collapse of the Eastern bloc economies. Many Iranians are well-educated and eager to participate in the global market, providing an ideal situation from which many future businesses could emerge. If it is perceived by the Western world that Iranian discussions with the U.S. seem to be going well, the Americans will likely see enormous business pressure from others, including our European friends, to accelerate the process of reducing sanctions. Despite the complex and often-conflicting interests of the negotiating parties, I believe at least a partial deal will be struck between Iran and the West -- an agreement that begins to bring Iran back into the international fold and provides steps to end 34 years of what has been a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Fariborz Ghadar.","Despite areas of mutual interest, securing trust between Iran and U.S. won't be easy .
Iran must be transparent over nuclear program; U.S. must allow Iran access to SWIFT .

"(CNN)  -- Susan Denise Atkins, a former member of the Manson family who killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate during a two-day killing spree in 1969, has died, according to a California corrections spokesman. She was 61. Susan Atkins, here with husband James Whitehouse, died Thursday night after a battle with brain cancer. Atkins died at 11:46 p.m. PT Thursday (2:46 a.m. Friday ET) at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, said Terry Thornton with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins, California's longest-serving female inmate, was suffering from terminal brain cancer. Since she entered prison in 1971, she became a born-again Christian who worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children, among others, according to a Web site maintained by her attorney and husband, James Whitehouse. But Atkins was best known for her actions in 1969 when as a 21-year-old she and other Manson family members participated in seven murders over two days, a rampage that terrorized Los Angeles. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate, who was the eight months' pregnant, down as the 26-year-old actress pleaded for mercy, stabbing her 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After stabbing Tate to death, Atkins -- known in the family as Sadie Mae Glutz -- scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, according to historical accounts of the murders. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests -- Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring and Voytek Frykowski -- were killed. Also slain was teenager Steven Parent, who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. All of those involved -- Manson, Atkins, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles ""Tex"" Watson -- were convicted in connection with the five deaths that night and the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. They were all sentenced to death. But their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972. Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, 2008, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7. In July 2008, Atkins requested a ""compassionate release"" from the California Board of Parole Hearings. It was denied by unanimous decision. Her request was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. On September 2, a panel from the Board of Parole Hearings denied Atkins' suitability for parole in a hearing, her 13th. Atkins' hospital bed was wheeled into the hearing room for the proceeding, and she appeared to sleep through much of it. For her statement, her husband helped her deliver the 23rd Psalm. She spoke in a high, cracked voice. During the roughly six-hour-long hearing, Debra Tate asked the board commissioners not to free Atkins. ""There has never been any hate in my heart for these people,"" she said. ""I am incapable of hating. I commend them -- always have commended them -- for their good deeds that they have managed to accomplish within the walls of confinement. However, I do believe that the death of my sister, my nephew -- which would be turning 40 years old right now, this week -- is not an irrelevant cause."" Atkins was described as a model prisoner who accepted responsibility for her crime, but Tate said Atkins had never offered her an apology. Sebring's nephew, Anthony DiMaria, also spoke at the parole suitability hearing. ""I feel genuine compassion for Ms. Atkins as she deals with this disease,"" he told parole commissioners, ""but in no way should an illness dealt by fate mitigate punishment for crimes of this magnitude."" Atkins was housed in the California Institution for Women at Frontera until May 2008 when her declining health prompted a move to Central California Women's Facility. On his Web site, Whitehouse wrote that as of spring 2009, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair. Like most of the other former Manson family members, Atkins shunned Manson during her incarceration. ""He is a liar, a con artist, a physical abuser of women and children, a psychological and emotional abuser of human beings, a thief, a dope pusher, a kidnaper, a child stealer, a pimp, a rapist and a child molester,"" she wrote in a manuscript posted on her Web site. ""I can attest to all of these things with my own eyes. And he was all of these things before he was a murderer."" Atkins gave birth to a son while living at Spahn Ranch, an old movie set, with other members of the Manson family. While she was on death row, she wrote, he was legally taken from her because no one in her family was willing to raise him. ""His name and identity have been changed and sealed, so I have no idea where he is or how he is doing,"" she wrote. ""I have since been told his name was changed to Paul, and whether or not that is true I like it. ... My continuing separation from my son, even after all these years, remains an incredibly poignant and enduring loss."" Ironically, Sharon Tate planned to name her unborn son Paul. The gravestone bears the inscription Paul Richard Polanski.","Former Manson family member Susan Atkins dies at 61 .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican federales were facing questioning Friday after authorities accused them of opening fire on a U.S. diplomatic vehicle south of the capital. Two U.S. Embassy employees -- described by a senior U.S. government official as U.S. citizens -- were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening wounds; a member of the Mexican Navy who was with them in the late-model Toyota Land Cruiser suffered light bruises, according to the Navy, which issued a statement giving the following account of events: . The incident unfolded at 8 a.m., as the two embassy employees and the Mexican en route to a military facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco. Some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) earlier, they had left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias, a thinly populated area off the main road. When a vehicle containing Federal Police approached and its occupants brandished their weapons, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade them and return to the main highway. At that point, the police sprayed bullets into the black SUV with diplomatic plates. Moments later, three other vehicles carrying Federal Police joined the attack, also shooting at the U.S. Embassy vehicle. By now, the Mexican who was in the embassy vehicle had contacted personnel at a nearby military installation, who arrived after the firing had ended and cordoned off the site. Both embassy employees were taken -- under Federal Police guard -- to a hospital. Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat. The Federal Police officers involved were being questioned by authorities to establish what happened. They may be prosecuted. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy described the Mexican as a Navy captain and said the three individuals were en route to a training facility when they were ambushed. ""The vehicle attempted to escape, was pursued and sustained heavy damage,"" the statement said. ""They called for assistance from the Mexican armed forces, who responded. The two U.S. wounded personnel were taken from the scene, given medical treatment and are in stable condition. The Mexican Navy captain sustained no serious injuries."" The Mexican government said those members of the Federal Police who fired on the vehicle have been detained, the statement said. It added that the Mexican government ""has stated it will conduct a full and thorough investigation of this incident."" CNN's Jill Dougherty, Rafael Romo and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Embassy says the wounded Americans are in stable condition .

"(CNN) -- The one question we all desperately want answered may have gone to the grave with Aaron Alexis: Why? Why did he park at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, walk into Building 197, perch himself on an overlook above the atrium and open fire? The bullets that rained down killed 12 people and wounded eight others. Why? But that's not the only missing puzzle piece. Investigators are painstakingly trying to piece together the motive, the means and the method. ""No piece of information is too small,"" says Valerie Parlave of the FBI. ""We are looking to learn everything we can about his recent movements, his contacts and associates."" For now, here's what we know and what we don't know. What is security like at the Navy Yard? THE MOTIVE . What we know: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may have said it best Tuesday when he told colleagues that ""there is no explanation for the violence."" So far, investigators haven't offered any clue as to what motivated Alexis to kill. Friends say he had been frustrated over pay and benefits issues from a previous contracting job, and federal law enforcement sources said he may have contacted Veterans Affairs hospitals for possible treatment of psychological issues. But so far, investigators haven't said if either of those issues contributed to the attack. What we don't know: What he might have left behind in his Washington hotel room, either in writing or on any computers FBI agents may have found while searching the room. Terrorism hasn't been ruled out but seems unlikely, according to Washington Mayor Vincent Gray. THE SHOOTER . What we know: Throughout the day, authorities said they were looking for a second man. But by nightfall, they said they were ""confident"" that Alexis was the lone gunman. ""We have exhausted all means to eliminate that possible last suspect,"" said Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier. ""So we do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside of the base."" On Tuesday, Parlave, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, underscored that, telling reporters it's believed that Alexis acted alone. What we don't know: While authorities have stated they don't think anyone else besides Alexis opened fire at the Navy Yard, that doesn't mean others didn't help him or know about the plot. Alexis arrived in Washington on or around August 25, staying in hotels in the capital ever since, said Parlave. Shawn Henry, a former executive assistant director of the FBI, said he believed authorities will be talking to people Alexis has known for years -- including those he went to school with and served in the Navy with -- as well as looking at things like bank and cell phone records. THE VICTIMS . What we know: We now have all the names of 12 victims. They range in age from 46 to 73. Another eight people are recovering from wounds inflicted in the shooting, including three at MedStar Washington Hospital Center. Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said many of the victims gunned down in the Navy Yard's Building 197 were eating breakfast when Alexis shot at them from above. What we don't know: We have yet to find out more about many of the victims, such as what they did at the Navy Yard, where they were at the time of the shooting, etc. Victims from Navy Yard shooting identified . THE END . What we know: Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Tuesday that Alexis had ""multiple contacts"" with officers from several agencies during the shooting spree. The ordeal ended when Washington police Officer Scott Williams fatally shot Alexis, 34, Mayor Vincent Gray told CNN. What we don't know: Exactly how Alexis died, beyond the fact it happened after 30 minutes of gunfire, according to Gray. HIS HISTORY . What we know: He left New York after apparently helping rescue efforts at the site of the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, according according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. His father told Seattle police after a 2004 arrest that Alexis was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder related to that experience. He had served in the Navy, but officials moved to discharge him in 2010 over a pattern of misconduct that included insubordination, unauthorized absences and other infractions, according to a U.S. defense official. It wasn't enough for a general discharge, so Navy officials decided to grant him an honorable discharge, the official said. As a contractor, he worked in information technology, had medium security clearance, high enough to work at multiple Navy offices over the summer. He had an ID badge to enter the Navy Yard. His employer says the shooter jumped through all the right hoops. ""Alexis had a security clearance that was updated in July, approved by military security service personnel,"" said Thomas Hoshko, CEO at The Experts. ""There is nothing that came up in all the searches."" He appeared to become increasingly troubled in recent years, according to the source with direct knowledge of the investigation. He was hearing voices and having problems sleeping, the source said. He was growing increasingly troubled and in recent months had exhibited signs of mental problems, according to the source. Based on family accounts, it appears Alexis ""basically snapped,"" the source said. On August 7, police in Newport, Rhode Island, investigating a harassment complaint at a Marriott hotel encountered Alexis. He told them that an individual ""had sent three people to follow him and to talk, keep him awake and send vibrations into his body,"" according to a police report. These individuals, Alexis police, had followed him to three hotels in the area -- including talking to him through walls and the floor and using ""some sort of machine"" to send vibrations through the ceiling that prevented him from falling asleep. Police subsequently notified officials at a Navy base in Newport, the police report stated. Officials at Naval Station Newport referred CNN to the FBI on Tuesday when asked about the incident, and the FBI subsequently had no comment on the August police report. What we don't know: How he was able to get a security clearance with such a spotty background. Former Navy SEAL Cade Courtley says a poor or incomplete background check is to blame. ""Most people, when they get into that, they are given an interim clearance, and that means that the background check hasn't been done but it's in the process of being done,"" Courtley said. ""He may have started out with an interim clearance and a background check should have been done."" The former SEAL says just running Alexis' fingerprints would have turned up his arrest record. In Seattle, he fired several shots into the tires of a car during an altercation over construction near where he lived in 2004. There was also a weapons incident in Texas in 2010. Who was accused Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis? SECURITY AT THE YARD . What we know: Alexis drove onto the grounds of Navy Yard on Monday morning with a shotgun, according to federal law enforcement sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation. He proceeded into Building 197 and opened fire. He had access to the Navy Yard because of his contracting work, and he used a valid pass to gain entry. City police were the first law enforcement personnel on site within eight minutes of when the first shots rang out, according to Gray, and they were joined soon by SWAT team members. Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said there's ""no doubt in mind"" that law enforcement officers response to the shooting ""saved numerous lives."" What we don't know: Even to drive or walk onto the base, a person would be required to present credentials, said Navy Capt. Mark Vandroff. Building 197 has armed security at the door. How did he get the guns past them? Did cost-cutting compromise Navy security? Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican and a member of the Armed Forces Committee, thinks so. He wants a congressional briefing from the Pentagon inspector general on a Navy security audit that he says was released after Monday's shooting. ""It is my understanding that the IG report indicates the Navy may have implemented an unproven system in order to cut costs,"" Turner said. ""I also learned that potentially numerous felons may have been able to gain restricted access to several military installations across the country due to insufficient background checks, increasing the risk to our military personnel and civilian employees."" Audit reports Navy risked security to cut costs, says source . HIS WEAPONS . What we know: Federal law enforcement sources say authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting, including one -- a shotgun -- that investigators believe he brought in to the compound. The other two weapons -- handguns -- the sources say, may have been taken from guards. What we don't know: The sources, who have detailed knowledge of the investigation, cautioned that initial investigation information that an AR-15 rifle was used may have been incorrect. It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday morning's shootings. On Sunday, Alexis purchased a Remington 870 shotgun and a small amount of ammunition at Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in northern Virginia, the store's attorney, J. Michael Slocum, said. Alexis spent ""a couple hours"" there, including at its practice range, the lawyer added. In according with federal law, Alexis name and other applicable information was provided to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and he was approved to purchase the gun, according to Slocum. Alexis had the proper credentials to get into the Navy Yard, said Washington's mayor. But Gray added that it was unclear how he got the shotgun past security. Parlave, from the FBI, said Tuesday that Alexis may have gotten hold of the handguns after he got into the military facility. GUN DEBATE . What we know: The incident will certainly rev up the often explosive debate over gun control. But initial reports show Alexis obtained his primary weapon legally. What we don't know: Will the shooting at Navy Yard change the political landscape? High-profile shootings over the last several years have done little to move the needle in Washington. President Barack Obama pushed for universal background checks and other directives after the the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to cut down on the access Americans would have to firearms, but they never gained traction. At the state level, it's been a similar story. The successful recall elections last week of two Colorado lawmakers who backed new gun restrictions sent a shiver through the gun control lobby.","NEW: It's unclear how Alexis got a shotgun past security .

"(CNN) -- Questions about bruises on the body of actress Natalie Wood, whose body was found floating off Catalina Island in 1981, led the Los Angeles County coroner's office to change the cause of death from ""accidental drowning"" to ""drowning and other undetermined factors."" ""With the presence of fresh bruises in the upper extremities in the right forearm/left wrist area and a small scratch in the anterior neck, this examiner is unable to exclude non-accidental mechanism causing these injuries,"" wrote Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, the chief medical examiner. ""The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water. Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined."" Read more: 'Accidental' removed from Natalie Wood's death certificate . Based on a number of factors, including the lack of a life jacket, lack of a suicide note, ""this Medical Examiner is unable to exclude non-volitional, unplanned entry into the water,"" the report says. ""How injury occurred will be listed as found floating in the ocean,"" it adds. ""Circumstances not clearly established."" The change in the cause of death was made public last year, but the report outlining the reasons -- which was dated June 15, 2012 -- was not made public until Monday. The case is ""open and ongoing; nothing definitive has closed it,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. He said that Wood's widower, actor Robert Wagner, is not a suspect. A security hold was placed on the report when it came out because of concern ""that the frenzy that's surrounding this could contaminate the investigation,"" Whitmore said. The hold was lifted last week and the report made public Monday after next of kin were notified. Homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries in November 2011 after they were contacted by people who said they had additional information about the actress's death, the sheriff's department said last summer. The announcement persuaded tipsters to come forward with additional ""intriguing"" information, sheriff's spokesman Whitmore told CNN last January. Investigators did not comment directly on statements made in news reports in November by Dennis Davern, the captain of a yacht owned by Wood and her husband. Davern offered a previously unreported account of how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island following an argument between the couple. Wood died on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. Dressed in a flannel nightgown, socks and a down jacket, her body was found floating about a mile from the yacht, according to police reports. The autopsy report showed the 43-year-old actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms. ""My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,"" said Lana Wood, referring to theories that the actress may have voluntarily jumped from the boat, last year. Although the county coroner's office ruled at the time that Wood's death was an accident, others said then that that made no sense. Read more: Mysterious celebrity deaths . In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believed an argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN in 2011 that she did not suspect foul play. ""I just want the truth to come out, the real story,"" she said. Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his silence with an account of that day in ""Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,"" a book he co-wrote that was published in 2009. Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner. In an interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he believed the investigation was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regretted misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request. Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They invited Wood's ""Brainstorm"" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on the Thanksgiving weekend sail that preceded her death. The Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous of Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple. In his book. ""Pieces of My Heart,"" also published in September 2009, Wagner acknowledged being jealous and having fought with Wood. After Wagner then argued with Walken and broke a wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting. Embarrassed, Davern said, he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. ""They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,"" he said. A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing. Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper. Read more: Natalie Wood's star power lasted for decades . Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off. Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own, he wrote. He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood. The dinghy was found about a mile from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found. Wood's first starring role was as a child in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and Warren Beatty in ""Splendor in the Grass."" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for ""Love with the Proper Stranger"" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in ""West Side Story."" Wagner landed roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two series, ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968-70) and ""Hart to Hart"" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the ""Austin Powers"" spy spoofs.

"(CNN) -- And that's not such a good thing. Today's kids are less fit than their parents were at the same age, according to new research presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions, and that could mean health problems later on. The fact that younger kids are huffing and puffing more than their parents did at their age doesn't just mean they aren't in shape. It's also a red flag that they may more vulnerable to certain chronic diseases as adults. Researchers from the University of South Australia's School of Health Sciences analyzed and compared 50 studies on children's running fitness between the years 1964 and 2010. The studies included about 25 million kids between the ages 9 and 17 in 28 different countries. The researchers recorded running times over a specific time frame -- typically about five to 15 minutes -- or over a certain distance -- a half mile to two miles. They found that over the 46 years, the cardiovascular endurance -- measured by the times it took to run the various distances -- among kids declined significantly. From 1970 to 2000, U.S. children's cardiovascular endurance fell about 6% per decade, and among all countries, it fell about 5% each decade. In other words, today, kids are 15% less fit than their parents were, and in the mile run, kids are about a minute and a half slower than children were 30 years ago. TIME.com: Study: More active teens get higher test scores . The researchers say that cardiovascular fitness is one of the most important factors for good health, not just in childhood but in adulthood as well. ""If a young person is generally unfit now, then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life,"" said lead study author Grant Tomkinson in a statement. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control recommends that children get at least an hour of daily activity that involves the entire body, such as running, biking or swimming. Not only does the exercise benefit the body, but research shows that kids who are more physically active tend to do better in school too. This story was initially published on TIME.com.

"(CNN) -- The gathering was small, but activists say its impact is potentially huge. On January 5, in the ultraconservative heartland of Saudi Arabia, a small group of women held a demonstration calling for the release of detained family members. Their arrest, a short time later, caused great outrage and inspired even more people to take to the streets. It was in the town of Buraida, where activists say mothers, daughters, sisters and wives -- many who brought children of their own -- gathered outside the Board of Grievances building and demanded rights they say their loved ones have been denied for far too long. As Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy where protests are prohibited, it didn't take long for the police to show up. One amateur video purported to show what happened next, with security forces encircling the women before they're taken away. Saudi activists say kingdom trying to silence them . Amnesty International said 18 women and 10 children were arrested and it quickly issued a statement calling for their release. ""According to reports and photos from the protest, these women and children merely gathered peacefully and held placards bearing their detained relatives' names and the length of their detention,"" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Program Director at Amnesty International. ""There is no way the Saudi Arabian authorities can justify detaining people if they have simply peacefully exercised their rights to freedom of expression and assembly."" Activists say by early the next day, at least seven of the women had been released, but that wasn't enough to quell the rising tide of anger over the incident. In Saudi Arabia, the jailing of women is an extremely sensitive issue. In Buraida, which is the provincial capital of deeply conservative Qassim Province, the issue is even more sensitive than in other parts of the country. One amateur video shows a group of men angrily marching through Buraida at night. As they hold up signs announcing how the arrest of women is a red line that should never be crossed, they also chant slogans declaring themselves unafraid of the country's interior minister, Mohammed bin Nayef, and demanding he release the women. Saudi journalist Iman Al Qahtani, who has been covering the story, told CNN that when she went to Buraida to meet some of the women, she was followed by the Saudi secret police -- known as the Mubahith -- and felt compelled to leave the town. ""When I spoke to some of the women later,"" said Al Qahtani, ""they told me 'we will continue protesting until our husbands and relatives are released.'"" Saudis defend Sri Lankan maid's execution, hit back at criticism . Activists say small protests spread to other cities. In Riyadh, the country's capital, demonstrators called for the release of the women, while in Mecca, the Kingdom's religious capital, they called for the release of political prisoners, they said. In another video, a small group of women in Buraida begin chanting a refrain that's become familiar of late: ""The people call for the liberation of the prisons."" Rights groups say the Saudi Arabian government has detained thousands of citizens in connection with the country's counterterrorism efforts. Relatives say that in many instances, their loved ones have been held without being tried and with no access to lawyers. In the past two years, an increasing number of sit ins and demonstrations have been held. Family members of those detained have gathered outside the country's Interior Ministry in Riyadh as well as the Board of Grievances in places like Qasim, demanding freedom for those they call political prisoners. Opinion: America, the next Saudi Arabia . Last week, 101 Saudi clerics from Qasim signed a petition demanding that detainees held for security reasons should be given a trial or released. Motivated by what happened in Buraida, the clerics took issue with the treatment and arrest of the women. Saudi officials have been reluctant to comment on the original protest, the arrests or subsequent demonstrations. Major General Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, told CNN all the women arrested in Buraida have been released. When asked about demonstrators' claims that their relatives are political prisoners who should be released, he said Saudi government officials would not comment on cases currently being ""looked at by the courts."" Still, many wonder if demonstrations will continue despite the risks faced by those who participate. ""The question is, is there going to be more protests in Saudi over other issues?"" asks Al Qahtani. ""Or will the protests only be about calling for the release of the detained?"" In their petition last week, the group of clerics warned that the issue of detainees has ""led to growing discontent ... which has become apparent through demonstrations and sit-ins that are increasing and intensifying."" ""It would be wise to expedite resolution of the issue,"" the petition said.","Arrest of female protesters in Saudi Arabia sparks outrage .

"(CNN) -- Friday's verdict came swiftly, the evidence robust, the policing stellar. But the legacy of the young woman who was killed can't just be five convictions and laws improved on paper -- it must be to end the violent culture of sexual entitlement that led to her death. The death penalty will not stop assaults on women. Only two things can bring that change: certain justice, brought by nuts and bolts improvements to the criminal justice system, and mass public education. A U.N. study this week uncovered this difficult truth -- one in four men surveyed in the Asia Pacific region admitted to raping a woman. Almost three-quarters of these men did it because they believed the woman didn't have the right to say no. Unless this attitude of sexual entitlement is dissolved, the violence will go on, the police will continue to register a fraction of sexual assault complaints (encouraged by police commissioners who blamed increased rape on ""promiscuity""), marital rape will continue to be legal, doctors will see no reason to stop using the ""two finger test"" (to show a woman is used to having sex -- a practice linked to lower convictions, easy sentences). So, the good news is there is a way to do it, and we know it can work. Public education has proven to be effective when it is evidence-based, well-targeted and resourced. Success stories show that education campaigns can limit the misogyny and patriarchy that fuel attacks. Huge education and awareness drives have slashed HIV infection rates in this country and across the world. Here in India, the ""Bell Bajao"" campaign reached more than 240 million people in five years -- its spread made possible by funding and support from the central government. Evaluations of the campaign found a three-fold jump in awareness of the law against domestic violence, the willingness to discuss domestic violence jumped by 70%, and the campaign helped stop domestic violence in many homes. And India has shown it can conquer seemingly insurmountable problems -- take polio, for example. In 2009, this country still accounted for over half the world's polio cases, but after two years of intensified public education to overcome fear and perform widespread vaccinations, only one single case was reported in 2011. Only the central government has the reach and resources to lead such a campaign. It needs to commit serious money to end this epidemic of violence. That means an investment of at least 50 rupees a year for every Indian citizen in a mass public education campaign -- to reach every corner of our country. Although this seems a lot, it's small when you consider the rewards, and much of this cost could be covered via partnerships with private media. Second, the government must show that this campaign is here to stay: a full-scale media and outreach barrage should last at least four years, while education programs in schools and other grassroots education efforts should be permanently instituted. India's done it before, we are a country free from the scourge of polio and HIV was beaten back not only through drugs, but largely through mass awareness. Then, it was supported by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting -- now it should be done for women's equality. Third, the prime minister must establish a responsible body with the best brains and the power to oversee this project -- drawing from the advertising industry, the most powerful ambassadors from our film industries and cricket, and the most committed campaigners in government, the women's movement and other non-profits. To state the obvious, there is no dearth of talent in India to do this brilliantly, and such a high profile will make the campaign popular and visible, as well as accountable. And finally, the government must establish goals and targets for the reduction of sexual harassment and assault, so that progress is carefully monitored and policies are adapted and improved based on results. Only the government has the power to lead something this ambitious, because of the funding and scale such a project requires. In the past few months, thousands have been on the streets across the country and more than a million people have backed Avaaz's call for the Indian government to launch this public education campaign. Just this week, thousands have written directly to Minister of Communications Shri Milind Deora calling for fast action. There is a huge mandate for action. The good news is that Shri Deora has already promised publicly -- in response to a question I put to him on a TV panel -- that he would back a public education campaign to help realize women's freedoms. It is time for him to put forward a timetable and a fully costed plan. The trial that ended Friday brought some justice. But more than 24,000 women and children raped last year are struggling through a slow, often misogynist criminal justice system. Real justice will only be served though, when millions of women like that young therapist are able to work, play, loiter or go out for a walk alone in the middle of the night if they like, their freedoms intact.

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- It's official: Ted Cruz is Democratic enemy number one. In the span of a year, Cruz has transformed himself from a little-known Senate candidate into the face of a government shutdown that has roiled Washington politics and raised questions about the viability of the American political process. Democrats are now raising his profile at every turn, in political campaigns from Brooklyn to San Diego, casting him as a right wing zealot and hoping to hang the controversial tea party icon around the necks of every Republican office-seeker in the country. Cruz: Use debt ceiling debate for leverage . The first-term Texas senator, a shrewd and often shameless promoter of stand-your-ground conservatism, is currently starring in a slew of television ads, talking points and a raft of fundraising emails attacking Republicans over the ongoing government shutdown. Far from being an object of fear, Cruz is a welcome newcomer for Democrats -- the embodiment of what they claim is dangerous tea party obstructionism, and a far more useful villain than Mitch McConnell, John Boehner or any of the buttoned-up regulars straight out of Capitol Hill central casting. DNC targeting key Republicans over shutdown . Cruz might be responsible for pushing the United States government to the apogee of dysfunction, but for Democratic operatives charged with winning elections, any Cruz is good news. ""It's not that we're making Cruz a bogeyman,"" said Mo Elleithee, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee. ""It's that Republicans are making him their leader. We're more than happy to have a debate with them over whether that's a good thing for the country or not."" With helpful prodding from top Democrats in the nation's capital, the ""debate"" over Cruz is playing out in races around the country, far from the halls of the Congress. When Carl DeMaio, a Republican House candidate in southern California, made a sympathetic remark about Cruz during a speech to the Downtown San Diego Lions Club last week, operatives from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington quickly packaged the clip and circulated it to local reporters under the slug: ""Carl DeMaio's model legislator: Ted Cruz."" In the New York mayor's race, long shot Republican nominee Joe Lhota said in a radio interview that he favored delaying the Affordable Care Act's individual insurance mandate by a year. The campaign of Democrat Bill de Blasio immediately turned their cannons on Lhota, accusing him of ""marching in lockstep with Republican extremists like Ted Cruz."" Gingrich: The startling CNN poll . Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Democratic Senate candidate Cory Booker name-dropped Cruz during an attack on his GOP opponent Tuesday. 'The Ted Cruz strategy' And over the past two weeks, strategists working for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have been carpet-bombing local reporters in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and West Virginia with statements accusing GOP Senate candidates in those states of supporting ""the Ted Cruz strategy"" of political brinksmanship. The Texan also appears in a pair of new television ads about the shutdown from MoveOn.org and Organizing for Action, the White House's political operation. Washington's warm bath of celebrity and self-interest . Then there's American Bridge, the well-funded Democratic research group that launched a cheeky website, ""SpeakerCruz.com,"" after reports surfaced that the Texas senator was brazenly advising GOP House members from across the Capitol before the shutdown began. The website depicts Cruz telling an anguished Boehner, ""I got it from here, bud."" ""Ted Cruz is a powerful tool for Democrats for the same reasons he's so popular among the Republican base: he's perfectly emblematic of where today's Republican Party is and where it's headed,"" said Chris Harris, a spokesman for American Bridge. ""The tea party loves him for leading the Republican Party into this shutdown, but the vast majority of Americans see it as the disaster it truly is."" Nowhere has this theory been put to the test more than in the Virginia governor's race, where Cruz chewed up more than a week's worth of campaign oxygen in the closely watched contest between Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Cruz promises Republican victory in shutdown fight . After the government lurched toward shutdown last week, Democrats were handed a well-timed gift: Cruz had been previously booked to deliver the keynote address at a conservative gala in Richmond where, as it happened, Cuccinelli was also scheduled to speak. McAuliffe's campaign cut a television and radio ad binding the two Republicans together, just as the 170,000 Virginians who take home a federal paycheck were bracing for furloughs and service cutbacks. ""Look who's coming to Virginia this weekend,"" a stern-sounding narrator intoned on the radio ad, which was still on the air as of this week. ""Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas who is the leader of the government shutdown. Cruz is coming in to campaign for another radical Republican, Ken Cuccinelli."" The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a similar broadside, blitzing households with robocalls admonishing Cuccinelli. American Bridge got in on the act, too, creating a ""Dump Cruz"" petition demanding that Cuccinelli not appear with the Texan. Zelizer: D.C. crisis could jump-start case for reform . An uncomfortable position . Forget that Cuccinelli, himself a tea party darling, was technically not holding a campaign event with Cruz. The onslaught put Cuccinelli in a vise grip, drowning out his message and putting him in the awkward position of demanding an end to the government stalemate while dodging questions about Cruz's role in the Beltway drama. When Cuccinelli finally did speak at the Family Foundation dinner on Saturday night, he made only a passing reference to the shutdown and made no mention of Cruz, one of the GOP's biggest stars who happened to be waiting backstage only a few yards away. He slipped out the Richmond Convention Center in a hurry, well before Cruz took the stage. Aside from surveys that show the shutdown to be deeply unpopular, the blame-it-on-Cruz strategy is, at the moment, more of a safe bet than a poll-tested message. Polls show a vast majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown, and a CNN/ORC poll on Monday showed Republicans in Congress shouldering slightly more of the blame for the stalemate than Democrats or President Obama. Yet while Americans seem to have clear opinions on the shutdown, Cruz is a much less defined figure. In a poll from Quinnipiac University released last week, almost 60% of Americans said they did not know enough about Cruz to have an opinion about him. Among those who did, opinions were slightly more negative than positive. Democrats working on the Virginia governor's race tested Cruz's name in a focus group with roughly 30 undecided voters race this past weekend, according to a person familiar with the session, which was held in the Washington suburbs where the shutdown's impact is felt most acutely. According to the source, Cruz was not a well-known personality among the voters. But when the Democratic operatives described Cruz as a tea party leader with a prominent role in the shutdown, and said he was appearing with Cuccinelli at the gala Saturday night, impressions of both men soured among the focus group participants. Some Republican pragmatists, already worried that emboldened conservative hard-liners are tarnishing the party's brand, acknowledge that Democrats appear to have found a potent weapon in Cruz. David Kochel, a 26-year veteran of Iowa politics who managed Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in the battleground state, said bluntly that ""swing voters are repelled by Cruz."" Opinion: Will glitches derail Obamacare? Little personal downside for Cruz . But there is little personal downside in the high stakes fight for Cruz, an in-demand figure on the conservative speaking circuit who has designs on the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Having a Democratic bulls eye on his back only boosts his stature on the right, Kochel argued. ""It's an interesting strategy that works to the benefit of Democrats who want to attach his brand to the GOP at a time when he's underwater in approval ratings, but it also works to Cruz's benefit because it elevates him with the GOP base,"" he said. Rick Wilson, a Florida-based Republican strategist, said Cruz is custom-built for today's political environment, in which political leaders are often rewarded for combat and punished for compromise. ""The base loves him, he's become the Official Enemy of the Left, and he's raising major bank,"" Wilson said. ""This is the United States of Ambition, and he's making his bones, fast."" Cruz's white-hot profile could easily fade in the coming months, well before the 2014 midterm cycle begins in earnest. But the Republican has shown a remarkably canny ability to maneuver his way into the national conversation. As long as Cruz remains in the spotlight, Democrats have plans to use him to their advantage. ""Right now, Ted Cruz and the tea party has become a synonym for the problem, and we're going to continue to use that against the Republicans who voted with him,"" said one national Democratic strategist working on a number of House races. ""How big that will be next year, the verdict is still out on that."" Is shutdown a sorry spectacle or shock treatment?","Democrats cast Cruz as right wing zealot, hope to hang him around every Republican office-seeker .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner pleaded guilty Tuesday to felony false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges for his behavior against three women. Filner entered the pleas as a part of an agreement with prosecutors. The felony charge accuses Filner of ""false imprisonment by violence, fraud, menace and deceit."" That charge says Filner used force to restrain a woman at a fundraising event on March 6, a prosecutor said in court Tuesday. One of the misdemeanor battery charges says he kissed a woman on the lips without her consent in San Diego City Hall last April 6. The other misdemeanor battery charge says he grabbed a woman's buttock at a rally last May 25 after she asked to have her picture taken with him. Who are Filner's accusers? The victims were identified as Jane Does 1, 2 and 3. Filner will be sentenced on December 9, and he has a plea agreement with prosecutors. Under the agreement, Filner would be confined to his home for three months and would serve probation for three years, during which he would undergo treatment directed by a mental health professional, said the California attorney general's office, which assisted in the investigation. If Filner violates his probation, he could face up to six months in jail. Under the plea deal, Filner would also have to surrender any mayoral pension benefits he accrued since the date of the first offense, March 6, until he resigned in August, the attorney general's office said. Filner was elected mayor last November after serving as a congressman for 20 years. He resigned after a total of 19 women this year accused him of offensive behavior during his tenure as mayor and as a congressman. Filner resigns - but says he faced 'lynch mob' hysteria . Under the agreement, Filner also would be prohibited from ever seeking or holding public office again, the attorney general's office said. Filner also would not be able to vote, serve on a jury or own a firearm while on probation. Fines, court fees and restitution will be determined at his December sentencing. ""This conduct was not only criminal, it was also an extreme abuse of power,"" said California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris. ""This prosecution is about consequence and accountability. No one is above the law."" Filner and Harris are Democrats. A prosecutor told the judge that the plea agreement strives for ""a right balance between justice and closure."" Filner, also a former 10-term Democratic congressman, resigned from the mayor's post in August after at least 19 women came forward publicly to accuse him of inappropriate behavior during his time as a congressman and, since 2012, as a mayor. Hooters blackballs San Diego mayor . The one-by-one emergence of the women accusing Filner of sexual harassment or other misconduct became a daily scandal for weeks that withered his political standing. Numerous public officials, including all nine City Council members and the state's two U.S. senators, urged him to step down. So, too, did a majority of locals, according to polls. After the City Council voted 7-0 to accept his resignation, Filner spoke at a council meeting and offered a ""deep apology ... to all the citizens."" ""The city should not have been put through this,"" the 70-year-old mayor said. ""And my own personal failures were responsible."" A short time later, though, Filner went on the defensive, even alleging that his ouster was ""a political coup."" While admitting that his behavior toward women was inappropriate at times, he insisted that he ""never sexually harassed anyone."" Did San Diego mayor target victims of military sexual assault? In the process of ""trying to establish personal relationships,"" the mayor explained, ""the combination of awkwardness and hubris, I think, led to behavior that many found offensive."" He added, ""Not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court."" ""But the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob,"" Filner said, criticizing an environment in which ""rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall."" Blasting politicians and members of the media who ""unleashed a monster,"" the mayor said, ""The hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo."" CNN's Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles, Kyung Lah reported from San Diego, and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Under plea deal, Bob Filner would serve three years of probation, receiving treatment .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel canceled controversial plans to construct thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank, hours after the announcement sparked strong criticism. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel to reconsider long-term plans to build more than 20,000 units, according to a press release from Netanyahu's office. ""This step does not contribute to settlement,"" the statement said. ""On the contrary, there is damage here for settlement."" ""This is a meaningless step -- legally and in practice -- and an action that creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with Iran. At this time, the attention of the international community must not be diverted from the main effort -- preventing Iran from receiving an agreement that will allow it to continue its military nuclear program. As a member of the government, action must be coordinated and have the benefit of forethought."" Ariel said he would accede to Netanyahu's request, according to the press release. Lior Amihai of the activist group Peace Now said the Housing Ministry issued 23,786 planning tenders two weeks ago; the tenders are issued to companies to draw plans to be used in possible future construction. The construction was to have taken place in a number of years, after the plans went through various stages of government approval, he said. Lara Friedman, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now in Washington, said the plans had included construction in areas deep in the West Bank, east of the barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank. ""This is planning for areas that cannot possibly remain part of Israel or become part of Israel under any negotiated agreement,"" Friedman said before Netanyahu's announcement. ""It's impossible."" A member of the PLO executive committee also said earlier that Netanyahu appeared to be intent on scuttling any hope for a solution in peace talks recently relaunched by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. ""Obviously, Netanyahu is using settlements as a weapon of mass destruction to destroy the chances of peace and torpedo the negotiations,"" Hanan Ashrawi said. ""It is an affront to the whole world and particularly to John Kerry and a deliberate violation to international law."" There are currently more than 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, according to the Israeli Bureau of Statistics, and about 200,000 in East Jerusalem. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Israel cancels plans for thousands more settlements .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama reframed U.S. foreign policy priorities on Tuesday by focusing his administration's immediate attention on Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the Middle East conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. ""While these issues are not the cause of all the region's problems, they have been a major source of instability for far too long, and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace,"" he said in a 50-minute speech on the opening day of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. At the same time, Obama challenged the world body to enforce its ban on chemical weapons by agreeing to crack down on Syria -- even militarily -- if the regime of President Bashar al-Assad fails to turn over control of its stockpiles. ""There must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there must be consequences if they fail to do so,"" he said. ""If we cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the U.N. is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws."" His speech, which received little reaction from the gathered world leaders, sought to project a robust commitment to defending U.S. interests abroad while declaring receptiveness to potential diplomatic openings that have emerged. It's not about regime change or asserting U.S. dominance, he insisted in calling for more unified international action in the world's most persistent and contentious trouble spots. Noting that new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have stated their nation only seeks the peaceful use of nuclear power, rather than nuclear weapons, Obama said the issue comes down to Iran demonstrating its sincerity. ""To succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable,"" he said, noting that ""this isn't simply an issue between America and Iran -- the world has seen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past, and has an abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its obligations in the future."" Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, both will attend a Thursday meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Discussions will surround restarting talks on Iran's nuclear program. Obama sounded cautious about any possible breakthrough, saying ""the roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested."" Later Tuesday, Rouhani said in his U.N. speech that Iran was prepared for immediate nuclear talks that are ""time-bound and result-oriented ... to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties."" The Iranian leader also said he Iistened carefully to Obama's speech and hoped that the United States ""will refrain from following the short-sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups"" so that the two nations ""can arrive at a framework to manage our differences."" Rouhani touched on one of those differences, criticizing what he described as ""structural violence"" against Palestinians. While he never mentioned U.S. ally Israel by name, the intention of his comments was clear. ""Palestine is under occupation; the basic rights of the Palestinians are tragically violated, and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes, birthplace and homeland,"" he said. ""Apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression against the innocent Palestinian people."" Obama earlier called for ""the entire international community"" to support renewal of the Middle East peace process, noting that Israeli and Palestinian leaders ""have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks."" ""Now the rest of us must also be willing to take risks,"" Obama said. ""Friends of Israel, including the United States, must recognize that Israel's security as a Jewish and democratic state depends upon the realization of a Palestinian state. Arab states -- and those who have supported the Palestinians -- must recognize that stability will only be served through a two-state solution with a secure Israel."" On Syria, Obama addressed both the August 21 sarin gas attack on suburban Damascus that he blamed on al-Assad's regime and the civil war that has raged for more than two years and killed over 100,000 people, according to U.N. figures. Critics at home and abroad contend the United States was too slow in backing rebels fighting the Syrian regime, which allowed al-Assad's forces to gain the advantage with help from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon. At the same time, Obama's threats of a U.S. military attack on al-Assad's forces to try to prevent any further chemical weapons attacks failed to generate support from the United Nations, due to Russia's opposition, as well as normally reliable NATO ally Great Britain and Congress. Some Obama opponents argued he showed weakness by not attacking Syria anyway, despite the lack of international support. Obama said such criticism ""mirrors a contradiction that has persisted in the region for decades."" ""The United States is chastised for meddling in the region, and accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy,"" he said. ""At the same time, the United States is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region's problems, and for showing indifference toward suffering Muslim populations."" He outlined U.S. foreign policy for the remainder of his presidency, declaring a willingness ""to use all elements of our power, including military force"" to secure core interests in the Middle East and North Africa. Obama specified that the United States would confront aggression against allies and partners and ensure the free flow of Middle East oil to the world, adding that ""although America is steadily reducing our own dependence on imported oil, the world still depends upon the region's energy supply, and a severe disruption could destabilize the entire global economy."" He also pledged to continue the fight against terrorist networks by working with other nations and taking ""direct action"" when necessary. In words clearly directed at Iran, Obama specified that ""we will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction."" ""Just as we consider the use of chemical weapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national security, we reject the development of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, and undermine the global non-proliferation regime,"" he said. Noting that the United States was emerging from a ""perpetual war footing"" after more than a decade of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama acknowledged that unilateral American action -- particularly military action -- was unable to achieve the desired development of democratic systems, open markets and respect for human rights around the world. ""Iraq shows us that democracy cannot be imposed by force,"" he said. Obama also directed a challenge to his fellow world leaders, noting that the United Nations was created in ashes of World War II so that nations could work together to confront global challenges and conflict. ""The question is whether we possess the wisdom and the courage as nation states and members of the international community to squarely meet those challenges; for the United Nations to meet the challenges of our time,"" he said. That means answering the inevitable call for action, Obama said. ""While the U.N. was designed to prevent wars between states, increasingly we face the challenge of preventing slaughter within states,"" he said, adding that ""in such moments, the international community will need to acknowledge that the multilateral use of military force may be required to prevent the very worst from occurring.""","NEW: Rouhani says Iran is ready for ""time-bound and result-oriented"" talks .

"(CNN) -- Less than a year before it stages the World Cup, Brazil is once again in the news for the wrong reasons. Brazilian football players protested Wednesday and said they could take more action -- possibly ""drastic measures"" -- if their confederation doesn't make changes to the country's overcrowded calendar. They want, among other things, more vacation time, longer preseasons, fewer games and a bigger voice in decision making. In some matches, the players crossed their arms before the opening whistle. In others they did so after the whistle blew. And in some instances, they passed the ball from one end of the field to the other after the referees threatened to give players yellow cards. Also in a game, players from both sides unfurled a banner in the middle of the pitch while the national anthem played. It read: ""For a football that is better for everyone."" In a statement, Common Sense F.C. -- not a club but a movement symbolizing the changes the players want -- said on its Facebook page: ""If there are attempts to prevent players from expressing themselves in a peaceful way, drastic measures will be taken. ""We expect an official position followed by moves that will benefit Brazilian football."" According to Brazilian media, the future measures could include players crossing their arms for a longer period of time, wearing red clown noses or even halting a game. There was no official reaction on Friday, which is a national holiday in Brazil. The protests came two weeks after a former professional football player was found decapitated in Rio de Janeiro.","Brazilian footballers cross their arms in games to protest against their confederation .

"(CNN) -- As the 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible rolled down Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, three shots rang out in Dallas, their echoes lodging in the memories of America's youth for years to come. Derek L. Farthing was in third grade in Jersey City, New Jersey, when the school's janitor came to tell his teacher, Ms. Melvin, the horrific news. ""Her hands rose to cover her face and to still her ... shocked voice from raising our concerns,"" he told CNN iReport. ""After composing herself, she turned to us and stated, 'The President, President Kennedy, was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.'"" Farthing was released from school early and went home to tune in to the black-and-white CBS broadcast of Walter Cronkite, who famously removed his glasses as he confirmed JFK's death. Amid cloudy conspiracy theories swirling around the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22, 1963, many baby boomers have a moment of clarity from that day; they remember where they were when Camelot fell. One JFK conspiracy theory that could be true . Flashbulb memories, as they're called by memory experts, are vivid remembrances of significant events; a mental snapshot of the who, what, when and where -- and the emotional fallout. These memories, according to neuroscience writer and professor W.R. Klemm, can be particularly reinforced by the images associated with them. Kennedy was the first TV-ready president. His charismatic good looks were a deciding factor in an early debate victory over Richard Nixon, and he went on to use television to deliver unprecedented live press conferences to the American people. Clinical psychologist Ditta Oliker, who blogs about childhood memories on Psychology Today, said for many, the Kennedys were America's couple upon a hill -- wealthy, well-connected and glamorous. Their newfound vulnerability made the country feel vulnerable. JFK's assassination: a look at the facts . ""Before that dreadful day, we worried about whether we could dye our peau de soie shoes the exact same color as our party dresses, and whether we could get a nice bouffant,"" Marcia Wendorf told CNN iReport; she was 13 at the time. Children who previously hadn't a care in the world now knew death firsthand. Kathi Cordsen, who was 11 then, told iReport: ""More fear came over me when Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, because what came into my head was this was going to keep going and going until finally they kill every man -- including my dad. I was so emotional and very afraid."" CNN iReporter Gail Powell was just 8 years old when America's 35th president was assassinated on that sunny November day. 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination . ""What upset me the most was seeing my mother so upset about what happened to Kennedy,"" Powell told CNN. ""I was young, but I understood enough that something terrible had happened and that many people were very sad."" Klemm said memory is reinforced by dramatic circumstances, ""and this was certainly an emotionally charged circumstance."" For many children of the '60s, the assassination was also the first national event played out on television, its scenes repeatedly flashing onscreen over several days. Even on this day 50 years later, the images remain instantly recognizable. Klemm said this repeating retrieval of a memory only strengthens it in the brain. These types of memories are similar to what later generations would experience after images were played on TV news of the second airplane crashing into the World Trade Center or of Columbine High School students running out of the building with their hands in the air. For some, it's even O.J. Simpson's white Ford Bronco leading a slow-speed chase on Interstate 405. Oliker said a powerful reaction from a parent or another adult also makes a huge difference in how children encode a memory. Then-5-year-old Natalie Montanaro remembers having to go to bed early on that day in 1963, amid the hushed whispers of her parents in the next room. ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" The iReporter remembers those words replayed over and over. She would later join the Peace Corps, which Kennedy established in 1961, to commit to that promise. For many children, the events of November 22 signaled their loss of innocence most of all. ""Back in that era, prior to JFK's death, I think we lived in an idealized world, where it seemed that all things were possible, that nothing was foreclosed, and certainly that a presidential assassination was not even possible,"" Paula Matuskey, who was 15, told CNN's iReport. ""It was an exciting time, in other words, and a pretty happy time."" Farthing echoed her sentiment: ""I believe that the death of President Kennedy gave more awareness that there was more to just where I lived. I became more aware of the nation and the world."" Where were you when you learned of John F. Kennedy's assassination? Please share your experience in the comments below. CNN's Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","Many children of the '60s can recall exactly where they were on November 22, 1963 .

"(WIRED)  -- Six buses, 40 teams, 48 hours and one winning business idea: The StartupBus is as close to blood sport as Silicon Valley entrepreneurship gets. Part road trip, part code jam, the annual competition plunges participants, known as ""buspreneurs,"" into two days of frantic business development on the open road to the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. Once the geeks climb aboard the StartupBus, the clock begins ticking. ""Everyone needs to bring their absolute A-game for 48 hours straight,"" says Jonas Huckestein, one of the winners who emerged from last year's inaugural StartupBus contest. ""This can potentially bring about incredible performance. Much like a man may be able to run much faster and fight much stronger when in mortal danger."" Most startups headed for SXSW have developed their ideas for months if not years. They arrive with high hopes of becoming the next Twitter or Foursquare, both of which took off during Austin's annual gathering of the geek elite. By compressing the time from concept to prototype, the StartupBus becomes a pedal-to-the-metal business incubator, a rolling microcosm of what participants will encounter when they hit SXSW's packed panels and parties, March 11 to 20. In fact, the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup: Organizers this year are developing an online game, the StartupBus Stock Exchange, in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they're built on the buses. Players can upgrade their firms and win badges for accomplishments, all while real-world actions by the startup teams affect their standing. From San Francisco to Austin . This year's race began at 8 a.m. Tuesday, with two buses leaving from San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood and headed toward Texas. Teams now have two sleepless days, undoubtedly punctuated by rushed roadside meals and bouts of car sickness, to create the best startup prototype they can. WIRED: SXSW geeks defend their Foursquare turf . When the buses arrive in Austin, development stops. After the mental and physical brutality, teams present their hurried masterpieces to a panel of expert judges during the interactive portion of this year's SXSW festival. Because of the networking opportunities, the publicity from last year's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking, StartupBus founder Elias Bizannes was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs. In 2010, 50 people applied and 25 were selected. This year, 1,200 expressed interest when the StartupBus site launched, 300 were invited to apply, and 160 are actually going. But the numbers are only one way the project has grown. ""We've had better applicants with more impressive pitches than the ones we've seen in the job openings at the places we work,"" says Bizannes, who is a financial manager at search engine Vast.com and a scout for the AngelList group of investors. Two teams won last year: DormDorm, a startup designed to rent colleges' vacant dorm rooms to travelers during the summer, and DateBrowsr, a Hot or Not for dating profiles the service pulled from several sites. Neither actually became real businesses, but many people involved in the StartupBus' virgin voyage claim the experience was integral to both their personal and professional development, whether from skills learned or from connections made. Mick Johnson from the DormDorm team was accepted into startup funding firm Y Combinator and launched Whereoscope, which tracks family members by their cellphones. WIRED: SXSW keeps Austin weird, wired and wild . ""I've made at least a few very close friends in the experience,"" says Huckestein, now one of this year's San Francisco bus conductors, who does double duty as an IT worker during the beat-the-clock coding marathon. ""I believe this is largely due to the incredible constraints."" Over the last year, the competition has grown from one bus to six. Buses also left Tuesday morning from New York, Cleveland, Miami and Chicago, amid send-off party hangovers. (Yes, even nerds love beer.) The San Francisco teams drained a keg of Spaten Monday night at the offices of startup networking site YouNoodle. The meet-and-greet gave the buspreneurs a chance to sniff out potential teammates and competitors. And to exchange quips. ""You look like an Android user,"" said Volly founder and CEO Max Mullen to Ghost Nest founder Reid Evans, who is, in fact, an iPhone user. For an actual athletic competition, drinking the night before might be bad form. But beer is an integral part of the startup lifestyle. It takes the edge off the pressure. When the buses arrive in Austin, the buspreneuers will be rewarded with a tour of the local tech culture during the Startup Crawl, which promises ""hot tech [and] cold beer."" The exact prizes for this year's StartupBus competition are still being decided (iPads and incubator access have been mentioned), but perhaps the most important rewards for participants are the networking opportunities and the potential for publicity. WIRED: SXSW is a band's social network like no other . Several documentary filmmakers are capturing the event and CNN, CNET and All Things Digital have reporters on board some buses.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown checked out of a rehab facility, but he will continue the program as an outpatient, his representative told CNN on Thursday. The singer entered an in-patient rehabilitation center last month, a day after he was released from a Washington, D.C. jail following his arrest on an assault charge. When Brown entered the rehab program on October 28, Perna said, ""His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point."" ""Chris is continuing his rehab program as an outpatient and is also completing his community service in the Los Angeles area,"" rep Nicole Perna said Thursday. ""He appreciates all of your encouragement and support."" Brown must complete 1,000 hours of community labor in Los Angeles as part of his punishment for beating former girlfriend Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009. The behavior that has landed Brown, 24, in legal trouble over the past several years has been anger management. His arrest on a sidewalk near the White House on October 27 put Brown on a path toward a possible prison sentence because of his California probation. The U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia charged Brown and his bodyguard with simple assault for a brawl last month in which a 20-year-old Maryland man suffered a broken nose. The Rihanna incident resulted in a felony domestic violence conviction that carried a lengthy probation period. A judge found Brown in violation of that probation in August because of discrepancies in proving he fulfilled the court-ordered 1,400 hours of community labor. He imposed another 1,000 hours of work. Brown is in a vulnerable position. The Los Angeles judge overseeing his felony probation could order him to complete as many as four years in prison for the beating of Rihanna if he is found in violation of probation. Secret Service report could help Chris Brown's defense . Brown is due in a Los Angeles court on November 20 for a probation status hearing. Prosecutors are waiting on the probation officer's report due next week to decide whether they will seek to put him behind bars, a spokeswoman said. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office appears in no mood to cut Brown any breaks, which suggests that prosecutors will ask for jail time for him because of the arrest in Washington. The probation officer's job is to prepare a report for the Los Angeles judge. While the simple assault charge is a misdemeanor, it could trigger a probation revocation. Going to rehab -- as his rep said ""to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior"" -- could allow Brown lawyer Mark Geragos to argue that the entertainer is getting proper help for his core problem. The statement from Brown's rep did not disclose where the singer is going for rehab or what might be a ""healthier vantage point"" for him. Rihanna and Chris Brown's relationship through the years .

"(CNN) -- Babette Beatty laughs when asked whether she's seen the cover of this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. ""You have to understand, where I live, we don't get stuff,"" she said with a chuckle recently. Beatty, born in Germany and raised in Brazil and Canada, now lives in the rural hamlet of Halfway, Oregon, near the Snake River. You would think that seeing the next iconic cover would appeal to Beatty. In 1964, on that very first swimsuit cover, Beatty was the star of the show. It wasn't a big deal to her then. ""It was just another job,"" she said. ""I never expected it to be big. It just didn't even enter my mind. It was really no big deal for me. I was just working, trying to survive in New York."" Beatty was doing more than just surviving. She had been featured in the Paris collections and on the cover of Elle and other fashion magazines. She was one of the top-paid models in the world. Beatty, whose last name was March then, said she looked at the swimsuit shoot as a 10-day expenses-paid vacation to Mexico. The pay wasn't memorable. Beatty thinks it was about $100 a day. She basically went for the trip -- which was wild. Beatty and another German model stayed with the crew in Cozumel, which in the early 1960s was relatively undeveloped. It was home to some fishermen, but in '61, famous ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau declared it one of the best diving spots in the world, and it gradually became more of a tourist destination. Beatty remembers staying in what could be described as a less-than-five-star hotel, flying to shoots in the morning and then partying late with members of the Mexican air force. She described photographer Fred Smith, whom she had worked with before, and the editors as ""great."" She never really cared whether she got the cover. Through the lens of 2011, it's an innocent cover. Beatty stands in the clear water in a white bikini, as if she's emerging from a dip in the surf. Kind of ""wholesome""-looking, Beatty says now. She had no idea what it would lead to for the magazine. Back then, it wasn't even called the swimsuit issue. It was just five pages of a 17-page spread on diving and popular winter resorts, mostly travel stories. Beatty didn't even get her name on the front. Over the years, the SI swimsuit cover reveal has become one of the biggest moments of the year for the magazine, which is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner. The issue sells more than a million copies, and according to the Wall Street Journal, about 10 percent of the magazine's revenue comes from that one issue. The issue boosts business for the companies that make the swimsuits and jewelry featured inside. And these days, the cover model gets a huge boost to her career. It wasn't like that in 1964. Sports Illustrated never told Beatty that she was on the cover. ""I found out through my agent,"" she said. In fact, she didn't even have her own copy of the famous issue until just a few years ago, when a man sent her a few copies to autograph. She called him and said she'd sign it if he let her keep one. She still gets lots of mail from across the country -- all from guys, she says -- asking for her autograph. The continuing interest intrigues her. Beatty, who turns 70 this year, is an artist now. After her retirement in 1976, she tried several things, including being a chef. In 1992, she and her husband took a trip west, fell for Halfway and moved into an abandoned church. Beatty runs an art gallery (she paints) and hikes every day, even through the snow. She loves living in Halfway with 349 other people. It's gorgeous, she says. Kind of like the woman on the cover of the January 20, 1964, issue of Sports Illustrated, a photo that launched an institution.","Babette Beatty was on the January 20, 1964, cover of Sports Illustrated .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal completed a perfect sweep of his matches in Group A of the ATP World Tour Finals by beating Tomas Berdych Friday -- his victory enabling a grateful Stanislas Wawrinka to accompany him into the semifinals in London. Wawrinka and his supporters breathed a sigh of relief after Nadal wrapped up a 6-4 1-6 6-3 victory over his Czech opponent to go through as group winner. The match had been in the balance when Berdych hit back to level at one set all with a display of power tennis that had the top seed wobbling, but he could not sustain the effort. Nadal, who has never won the end of season showpiece, waited until the eighth game of the decider to make the breakthrough, taking advantage of two double faults by fifth seed Berdych. He then served out for victory, completed with a flashing forehand winner and customary fist pump. Nadal was also fully aware he had done Swiss star Wawrinka, who is making his debut in the finals, a big favor. ""I have a great relationship with him, so I'm happy for Stan, sorry for Thomas,"" Nadal said. ""Before the match Stan came to the locker room and told me 'come on', "" he revealed. Wawrinka, who would have been on the edge of the seat as Berdych made his move, tweeted: Vamooooos!!! Next diner is for me @RafaelNadal !! Good job!! He had earlier battled past Nadal's compatriot David Ferrer in a thrilling afternoon match at the O2 Arena. Wawrinka, who beat Berdych in his opening match before losing to Nadal, raced into a 5-2 lead in the opener before Ferrer battled back to force a tiebreaker, which he took 7-3. But Wawrinka hit back to level the second set with a single break and then dominated the decider with two further breaks, sealing a 6-7 6-4 6-1 victory. Saturday will see Group B decided with Roger Federer taking on Juan Martin Del Potro to decide who goes through to the last four with defending champion Novak Djokovic.

"(CNN) -- The bigger its touchscreen, the more tempting it is to use a smartphone for watching movies, as a GPS device, or to check out the latest happenings on social media. People in the United States with smartphones that have screens 4.5-inches and larger use 44% more data than those tapping away on smaller phones, according to a recent report from the NDP group. The wider-screened devices were used to gobble up an average 7.2 gigabytes a month in data, while smaller phones had closer to 5 gigabytes. The larger screen real estate might be more inviting for wasting time with Internet-connected apps. The most popular apps for the larger-phone users are Facebook, Google Maps, YouTube, Amazon and Pandora. People with larger screens use apps more frequently across all the major categories. Social media is the most popular, followed by navigation, video, retail and music. The apps do things people on smaller phones might switch over to tablets or computers for. Larger smartphones are becoming more common, with some newer models creeping toward small tablet sizes. Last year, 11% of available smartphones sported large screens, but now that number is 28%. At the same time, overall data usage for smartphones has jumped 11%. Even Apple increased its smartphone screen size with the iPhone 5, and there are constant rumors the company is considering going larger for future phones. For now, bigger screened devices are still in the minority of phones sold, but if bigger screens do translate to more time spent on phones, it could be a smart business move for hardware manufacturers and wireless carriers to push the costlier devices. More usage means more app usage and potentially inflated wireless bills for people who don't have unlimited data plans. The NPD group tracked how 4,500 people used their smartphones during May, June and July of this year for the report. They looked at both Android and iOS users who used their phones on wireless and cellular connections. For current large-phone owners concerned about overdoing it on data, the best way to keep those bills down is to wait and connect to Wi-Fi instead of the cellular network before doing any heavy streaming.","People with larger smartphones tend to use more data, a new study has found .

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN)  -- The coffee was brewing and we were just starting our day when the telephone rang the morning of July 5, 1999. It was a call that every parent prays never will come. The Army colonel was calling from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where our son was based in the U.S. Army. A fellow soldier had attacked our son, Barry Winchell. He had been taken to a civilian hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. We raced to the Kansas City airport. When we arrived at the hospital, Barry was clinging to life. His face was unrecognizable. Contrary to what the colonel had said on the telephone, Barry had not been kicked in the head by the other soldier. He had been beaten with a baseball bat as he slept in the barracks. The doctor said he had irreparable brain damage and recovery was unlikely. Barry had been a victim of constant, vicious harassment after another soldier -- one of two involved in his murder -- started a rumor that he was gay. Several of Barry's superiors were witnesses to the harassment, yet did nothing about it. Some of those superiors not only did nothing to stop the escalation of violence that would lead to our son's death, they also took part in the harassment. One staff sergeant eventually stopped participating and started telling others to stop. Barry was one of his top soldiers and he noticed the effect the torment was having on him. The staff sergeant decided to file a complaint with a commanding officer, but it was ignored. Army values were one of the things that attracted Barry to the service. Loyalty: Be true to your country, the Army, your unit, and other soldiers. Respect: Treat others with dignity and respect and expect others to do the same. Selfless service: Put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and your subordinates before your own. Integrity: Do what is right, legally and morally. Honor: Live up to the Army's values. Clearly, many stationed at Fort Campbell were not living up to these values. And it cost our son his life. On July 6, we said goodbye as the machines that kept Barry alive were turned off. Barry was only 21. He loved the Army. He loved serving our country. And he was among the best in his company. Barry was awarded two Army Commendation  Medals and one Army Achievement Medal with the Oak Leaf Cluster. He wanted to be the best he could be and eventually become a helicopter pilot. Barry's death was -- and remains -- a heart-wrenching tragedy for us. In the days and months afterward, we were comforted by the hundreds of letters and e-mails we received. Many of the authors were gay service members. We realized that our son was not alone in the torture he endured. We realized that ""don't ask, don't tell""  essentially makes it impossible for gays or those, like Barry, who are perceived to be gay, to seek the help of their superiors without risking investigation and discharge. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to ensure that Barry did not die in vain. We have spoken around the country, advocating tirelessly for repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" That is because DADT amounts to an endorsement of harassment and discrimination. It says to other service members that gays in the military are second-class citizens, that they are not worthy of the respect dictated in the Army's values. Those who assert that the  law serves to protect gays in the military are wrong -- it corroborates the fears and bigotry of those who are anti-gay. Worse, it encourages those who are prone to violence to act on their rage. Our son could be with these brothers and sisters in arms today, but he was taken from us just as he was beginning to realize his dream. He was a quiet, compassionate and strong young man -- the kind of dedicated soldier our country needs as we fight two wars. Nothing will replace him. Nothing will take away the pain that haunts us to this day. The attitude of society toward gays serving in the military has changed in the 17 years since DADT went into effect. It's no longer the divisive issue it used to be. When we go to Capitol Hill, we talk about the change we've witnessed in our lifetimes on LGBT -- lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered -- issues. It's clear to us that the younger generation of service members couldn't care less about sexual orientation. But they couldn't care more about integrity and honesty, serving one's country and being supportive of their comrades. Our work to repeal the law that contributed to our son's death has given us focus. We look forward to the day when this law is repealed and when the armed forces adopt a policy that demonstrates clearly that all service members, including those who are gay or lesbian, are worthy of serving our country with dignity and integrity. Only then can our sons and daughters feel safe in reporting harassment. Only then will their superiors, up the chain of command, be held fully responsible for protecting our sons and daughters equally, no matter what their sexual orientation. Soon, members of the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to ensure that Barry's death was not in vain, that no other young man or woman will be denied the chance to serve the country they love simply because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen has said it is the right thing to do. We urge senators to stand with Admiral Mullen and be on the right side of history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pat and Wally Kutteles.","Pat and Wally Kutteles have worked 10 years to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell""

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional approval ratings hovered at historic lows. Republican and Democrats hurled insults at each other and among themselves. The political circus in Washington even made its way to ""Saturday Night Live: -- in a sketch featuring Miley Cyrus, at that. It seemed that nothing would break through the partisan stronghold that left Capitol Hill at a standstill in the weeks leading up to and during the partial government shutdown. But at the same time some lawmakers were loudly pledging to dig in and hold their ground, a bipartisan group of 14 senators was working behind the scenes, churning out a plan to get the country back on track and avoid a possible default. Seven Republicans, six Democrats and one independent came together after Sen. Susan Collins of Maine stormed to the Senate floor on October 5 -- a Saturday -- and urged the chamber to actually work together, to ""stop fighting and start legislating."" The three-term senator, who's up for re-election next year, got a call from two other Republicans that same day, Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. From there, they got to work. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia became the first Democrat to sign up. He was followed by lawmakers from all corners of the country: Sens. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota; Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana; Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota; Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire; and Angus King, I-Maine. Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Jeff Flake of Arizona also hopped on board. A week later, with more members in their ranks, the group presented its plan to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected it. Time to throw out my guy in Congress? But the Senate was not back to square one. Some of the plan's elements were roped into the final agreement reached by Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, the eve of the deadline to avoid default. Like the new agreement, the Collins' framework reopened the government, moved the deadline, included income verification provisions to prevent fraud in Obamacare and called for a budget conference between the two chambers of commerce. Most importantly, the plan seemed to light a fire under Senate leaders, and signs of progress and talking finally began taking shape in the days following the rollout of Collins' plan. ""Today is a big loss for blame-game politics,"" Pryor said Wednesday from the Senate floor, with his cohorts also on the floor. So who are these lawmakers? And why were they able to work together? Four of them joined the Senate this year. Six of them are women. Three face re-election in a year. One of them is retiring. All of them are considered moderates in their respective parties, with many coming from states with a mixed political climate. Republican Collins' home state of Maine, for example, has voted for a Democrat in the last six president elections. Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, Shaheen and Pryor are from states with large swaths of conservative voters. Conservatives defiant in face of GOP troubles . For these senators, the political risk of lining up with ""the other side"" isn't so high. But with the country growing more polarized, lawmakers who find themselves in those situations are becoming a rare breed. As they stood together Wednesday, the group promised it was only the beginning. Their next battle? The era of brinkmanship. ""This group of 14 people (is) committed to staying together to address other issues of importance,"" McCain said Wednesday. ""This isn't the last crisis that we're going to go through. But I think we have the framework for the kind of bipartisanship that the American people need and want."" While it certainly opens them up for criticism from some who don't like seeing their representatives mingle with the opposition, King said that's the price to be paid to get things done. ""That's what leadership is. It's the willingness to bear criticism, to stick (one's) neck out,"" he said. In a subtle blow to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Klobuchar said the definition of ""courage"" is working across the aisle. ""It's not gonna just be standing here by yourself making a speech with no one out there."" 9 things we missed during the shutdown . Cruz famously carried out a 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor in the final days before the shutdown. Acknowledging that sports analogies are cliches, Murkowski nonetheless argued that moving the ball down the field is all about teamwork. ""Just one person -- you don't get anywhere,"" she said. ""We cannot work together as individuals and expect to accomplish the work that is needed ... we've got to be working together."" Both the House and the Senate will have a chance to work side-by-side when select members go to conference to hammer out a long-term plan in the coming months. The question is whether they can invoke the same spirit demonstrated by the recent gang of 14 -- because if they fail, the circus starts all over again.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Republican member of Congress in charge of investigating the Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed said Monday that questions remain about what happened that night but he does not think the Obama administration formulated a ""complete cover-up."" Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Georgia, chair of a House Intelligence subcommittee, said incompetence is the likely culprit. ""I don't think they knew what they were doing,"" he said. He said the various arms of government involved -- the State Department and intelligence agencies -- ""got their communications mixed up."" ""I think what ended up happening, you had the State Department trying to tell one story and you had the security, the intelligence community that may have been trying to sell another story,"" Westmoreland said on CNN's ""New Day."" Westmoreland's subcommittee interviewed five CIA contractors who were at the compound that night. More than a year after the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, questions still linger as to what led to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The House Intelligence Committee has held 15 hearings on the attacks. Benghazi Consulate Attack Fast Facts . In the days following the September 11, 2012, attacks, the Obama administration said the incident was not a planned attack but was a protest turned violent. That story quickly unraveled and the administration has been accused of a cover-up. ""I don't think there was any doubt that they knew it was a coordinated attack,"" Westmoreland said, pointing to the ""accuracy of the mortar fire that came."" More questions about a cover-up arose recently when members of Congress found out that Americans present that night were asked to sign an updated nondisclosure agreement. CNN investigative correspondent Drew Griffin reported last week that a source told him that ""there is not a person in Washington, D.C., who doesn't understand why the forms were put in front of these people."" Congressional source: Benghazi contractors seem to contradict CIA chief . Westmoreland said it's ""not that unusual"" to sign updated security agreements and that the forms specifically stated that signatories have the right to speak to House and Senate Intelligence committees. Westmoreland also said that reports of ""an ongoing gun battle"" throughout the night are ""just not true."" He said the CIA operatives told his subcommittee there was random fire throughout the night, which was commonplace in Benghazi. He said questions do remain, however, including if there was a lull in activity between the sparse gunfire. In addition, Westmoreland said that when the CIA arrived at the compound that night, regional security forces were unarmed and one officer didn't have his shoes on. ""I think they were totally unprepared for any type of attack,"" he said. Libyan lawmakers, top officials discuss Benghazi violence . Westmoreland said the committee is looking into why a directive was released on August 11 telling the personnel in Benghazi that ""you are on your own."" The compound itself is not set up for protection,"" Westmoreland said, adding that the CIA operatives said ""they couldn't believe those guys were over there as unprepared and unequipped as they were.""

CNN International might be able to secure exclusives with the likes of Iran's President or put a man on the moon (well it could if it put its mind to it). But dealing with this situation? It was unpredictable -- and very tricky. Because of what's easily described as a ""communications breakdown"" (the check-in clerk didn't listen and wrongly tagged our bags to our final destination, Heathrow) our camera gear and lights were now heading in the wrong direction. This left us to interview the chief executive of German manufacturing giant Henkel with little more than an iPhone's torch app for mood lighting. Fortunately the gravity of the situation shocked the check-in agent so badly (her face was priceless) that she kindly chased after said luggage in the bowels of Tegel airport with a screed of labels to correct the mistake. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Merkel's substance over style . As the bags arrived in Dusseldorf, the cameraman Darren and Isa, MPE's presenter, were relieved. A close shave, nothing worse. That is, until we opened our camera boxes and found our batteries had been confiscated and apparently destroyed by the authorities at Berlin's airport. We were told they were potentially dangerous. They weren't. Luckily, we had our camera batteries and a charger so it was just a second close shave for us. The batteries were returned to our German bureau a day later. Clearly, fate wasn't happy about that happy ending. After our interview we returned to the airport to find our flight was canceled due to fog in London, eating into our precious edit time. We were put on an afternoon flight. That was wrecked by a bomb scare, leaving us to find a hotel for the night while the authorities took five hours to deal with abandoned luggage which had a metal pipe inside. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Europe fractures as recession fades . I was ready to shake it at someone by now, as thousands of displaced passengers surged into the airport hotels and assaulted their power sockets with assorted laptop and phone chargers. We don't still know what happened to the pipe. Amid all the calamity, our cameraman was able to shoot some of the chaos and send it back to our newsdesk, thanks to the hotel's broadband. Had enough of this already? It's not over yet. When we returned the following day to join a rebooked flight, we found out that was canceled due to technical reasons. BA were very apologetic but by now my cameraman Darren said he was ready to start eating people. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Europe feels winds of change . There was a sense of utter helplessness and ridiculousness. Our updates back to CNN London were being treated with increasing incredulity. Eventually, happily, the Germans came to the rescue. We were rebooked on a Lufthansa flight which was due to leave in what felt like two minutes, but was actually 20 minutes. We needed to clear security, which had the longest queue in the world. This wasn't the Germany I know -- where was the predictable efficiency? We got back to London intact, and the edit took place. I hope we'll be reunited with our bags, all 14 of them, eventually. What have I learned from this experience? Expect the unexpected when it comes to air travel.","CNN's Marketplace Europe team was on the road in Germany when they got caught in chaos .

"(CNN) -- Last month at Zaatari, the second-largest refugee camp in the world, I met an accountant who carried his 6-day-old baby across the Jordanian border from Syria, and a mother who cannot find her 20-year-old son -- and knows all too well what has likely happened to him. I saw parents too frightened to let their children out of their sight, even to go to school. And while visiting Syrian refugees recovering in a hospital in Amman, Jordan from some of the violence that perhaps foreshadowed the August 21 chemical attacks on Syrian citizens, I spoke with a woman whose daughter died in her arms. These refugees' stories, interspersed with images of white-shrouded children lying dead -- poisoned in the Damascus suburbs -- have stayed fresh in my mind. The debates in the press over the past three weeks imply that whether or not the United States and its allies apply ""lethal force"" in Syria is the defining question of this crisis. Whether the United States intervenes militarily is a hugely important question -- politically, strategically, legally and morally. But it is not the only one. For the civilians bearing the staggering weight of this war, it is not even the most pressing one. The war has raised a huge range of unanswered questions and challenges for humanitarian actors that will persist long after any ""symbolic"" or even intensive military operation. These are imperative to Syrians' survival and the region's long-term stability and must not be crowded out as politicians and pundits wrangle over the use of force. First and foremost is the question of how to keep borders open for refugees. More than 2 million Syrian refugees have now fled their country. The hospitality of Syria's neighboring states towards these refugees has been breathtaking. For example, more than one in four people in Lebanon today are Syrian, representing a level of generosity toward refugees that has never been matched by any Western state. Yet -- particularly in Lebanon and Jordan -- the refugee crisis has resulted in higher rents, reduced wages, overstretched social services, and increased pressure on already limited water supplies. All this has ratcheted up local tensions, and increased pressure on governments to limit arrivals. While the Jordanian border remains officially open, over the summer UN officials reported ""artificially low"" arrivals, suggesting that would-be refugees may be encountering obstacles to their escape. Hurdles are also emerging for Syrians wishing to cross the Lebanese border. As the crisis escalates, redoubled international support is needed to ensure Syria's neighbors can accept new arrivals. This support must benefit not only the refugees but also the communities that are hosting them. A second, related question is how to get Syrian refugee children into school. Last month -- it really was a hellish month -- marked what the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees called a ""shameful milestone"": The number of Syrian refugee children reached 1 million. Many of these children are not in school (by some estimates, 75% of children in Zaatari are not in school) and have already missed months if not years of schooling inside Syria before fleeing abroad. Some kids are not attending school because they are working to support their families; other refugee children living in towns and cities lack the money to get to school, or are afraid of harassment. As bombs drop, getting kids in school may not seem that urgent, but the long-term impacts of a ""lost generation"" of Syrian children would be disastrous. Deprived of educational opportunities, these children are at risk of future unemployment, social marginalization and frustration, potentially prompting them to turn to extremist causes. More attention and assistance is needed inside and outside the camps to overcome the barriers that are keeping refugee children out of class. Equally important is the question of how to do more to assist the estimated 5.1 million Syrians who are displaced within their own country. Two million of these are minors, and many are at risk of physical violence and forced recruitment. The internally displaced are much more difficult for humanitarian groups to reach, and are out of the media spotlight, which is trained on refugee camps and settlements in neighboring states. But we need to be asking what new and creative ways can be found to improve protection and support for this population. Last, but certainly not least, is the question of how to strengthen Syria's democratic opposition. This is not just a matter of access to weapons and military training, but the development of civil society organizations. Many Syrian refugees have already banded together to support others inside and outside Syria, including through the provision of medical assistance. We need to be asking what more can be done to strengthen and scale up such laudable initiatives. Despite the devastation they are enduring, the Syrian refugees I met in Jordan are proud, industrious people. They have the capacity to recover and eventually rebuild their country -- but if Western countries are to effectively support them, we can't let the use of force become the only question on the agenda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Megan Bradley.","Megan Bradley met traumatized, fearful Syrian refugees at a camp and hospital in Jordan .

"(CNN) -- Over the past week, speculation emerged that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton might not be the only prominent Democrat running for the nomination for president in 2016. Her ""inevitable"" path to the nomination is once again being questioned. In The New Republic, Noam Scheiber launched the debate with an article titled, ""Hillary's Nightmare? A Democratic Party That Realizes Its Soul Lies With Elizabeth Warren."" Scheiber focuses on the possibility of the Massachusetts senator running on a campaign centering on the issues of economic inequality, restoring the middle class and regulating Wall Street. ""What we need is a system,"" Warren has said, ""that puts an end to the boom and bust cycle. A system that recognizes we don't grow this country from the financial sector; we grow this country from the middle class."" Comparing such a contest to the race between Barack Obama and Clinton in the 2008 primaries, the article suggests that Warren could re-energize liberal Democrats who feel disillusioned by the past five years. Watching this unfold, some commentators have predicted that a civil war might be brewing between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. David Frum, the insightful commentator and CNN contributor who has been a prominent critic of what tea party Republicans have done to his GOP, warned that ""where Democrats have scored successes since 2010, those successes have been owed less to Occupy-style militancy, and much more to the seeming unquenchable determination of Republicans to render themselves unelectable."" Competition within the party doesn't have to be a negative; Democrats could turn this to an advantage that helps candidates who enter the race to focus and refine their message about the economy in a way that would make for a powerful campaign theme. It would be a mistake for Democrats to think that the entry of Warren, or a candidate similar to Warren, into the race would somehow create problems or even a ""left-center"" divide. The notion that dealing with economic inequality represents the ""progressive"" wing of the party as opposed to the mainstream is an extremely flawed way for Democrats to think of their party. Painting Warren's concerns as being to the left ignores how tackling these kinds of economic challenges have been at the heart of the Democratic Party for almost a century. Mainstream Democrats have usually done best when they have kept their eye on these questions and put forth policies that address the problem of middle class security. During the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt made this the centerpiece of his New Deal. Most of his policies centered on providing economic support, such as creating old age pensions, protecting unions and providing unemployment compensation as well as creating public jobs to help Americans make it through the crisis of the Great Depression and to serve as a foundation for their future. The policies revolved around a vision of ""moral capitalism,"" according to the historian Lizabeth Cohen. His programs proved to have widespread appeal and provided the foundation for a durable coalition of industrial workers, farmers, progressive activists and African-Americans that would last for decades. During the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson continued along these lines by tackling the problem of economic inequality through programs that aimed to bolster the strength and size of the middle class. The war on poverty sought to help the poor become self-sufficient and enter the marketplace. Medicare guaranteed that middle-class families could count on health insurance when they retired and wouldn't be overwhelmed by medical costs of their parents. Federal education assistance offered affordable loans to Americans who wanted to attend college and money for local schools to ensure that all children received an adequate education. Food stamps provided food security for struggling families. Civil rights laws gave African-Americans access to public space, employment opportunities and voting rights that were central to full citizenship. While Republicans rebounded as controversy over Vietnam and the war on poverty grew, the programs in fact survived and remained quite popular. Republicans have either learned to live with them and, in some cases, have expanded them. Democrats in Congress were often able to succeed in the Age of Reagan by fighting back against Republicans who try to dismantle the welfare state. Starting in 1982, Democrats regained their footing in the House of Representatives during the midterm elections based on campaigns about economic fairness. When congressional Republicans conducted a full-scale assault on Medicare and other programs in 1995, President Bill Clinton stood his ground and rebounded to a landslide r-election victory the following year. Indeed, Clinton, usually tagged as a hard-core centrist, devoted considerable energy to the cause of middle-class America. In his 1992 campaign, he hammered away at President George H.W. Bush for his inability to deal with the recession and failure to sympathize with the economic concerns of average Americans. While Clinton couldn't persuade Congress to pass his health care reform that aimed to broaden access and lower costs in the insurance system, he did find support for smaller measures, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, that have proved to be popular. Despite the characterization of Hillary Clinton as a market-based centrist, she has frequently addressed these themes throughout her career, including while in the Senate, and in 2008 made it clear that she would be a president who fought for the middle class. While Clinton, as her critics have said, has ties to the financial community and is not in any way an opponent of big business or big finance, she has also been a strong defender of the social safety net and programs that help the middle class grow. In 1978, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy warned his party about veering too far to the center under President Jimmy Carter. In words that Democrats should heed, Kennedy said: ""We are heirs to a great tradition in American public life. Our party took up the cause of jobs for the unemployed in the Great Depression. Our party took up the cause of civil rights for black and brown Americans, and the cause of equal rights for women in America and the people of the District of Columbia."" Although Kennedy did not win the nomination in 1980 (for many reasons outside of his policies), his speech offers an important message for Democrats thinking about 2016. It would be a mistake for Democrats to break off into opposing camps, with some tackling these so-called ""leftward"" issues and others sticking to the ""center."" A better bet, based on the record, would be to put these questions front and center in the primaries and see which candidate offers the best and most aggressive response to the challenges that have faced middle-class Americans in recent decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Pundits speculate Sen. Elizabeth Warren could oppose Hillary Clinton for 2016 run .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepalis went to the polls Tuesday amid tight security to elect an assembly that will draw up a new constitution. The tiny Himalayan nation has been trying since 2008 to draft a constitution. When it failed to reach any kind of agreement last year, Nepal dissolved its parliament -- paving the way for Tuesday's vote. The 601-seat constituent assembly will double as the parliament. The army has been called in to help police provide security after an alliance of 33 parties vowed to disrupt polling. Despite fears, officials and reports say that voters turned up in large numbers in the 18,438 polling centers across the country to choose assembly members. About 12 million people are eligible to vote. ""Except in a few places, elections are being held peacefully,"" police spokesman Ganesh K. C. said. In the capital Kathmandu, an 8-year-old boy was injured Tuesday morning when an object he found on the street that he thought was a toy exploded, police said. Earlier reports said that three people had been injured. In Dang district, about 350 kilometres (217 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, three people were arrested with explosives-making materials, K.C. said. The anti-poll alliance called a country-wide transport strike in the runup to the elections. But people largely ignored the call and are voting ""enthusiastically,"" said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai. About two dozen people were injured in several incidents over the last week when petrol bombs were thrown at passenger buses. One person later died of injuries in hospital, police said. No party is expected to win a majority although the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Nepali Congress will vie to be the largest party. For most of its history, Nepal was a monarchy. The Maoists carried out a 10-year insurgency to abolish that system. The fighting claimed about 15,000 lives before the Maoists signed on to a peace accord in 2006. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time. But since then, lawmakers have not been able to come up with a constitution for the country's 27 million people. Preliminary results will be available Thursday. But final results will take at least a couple of weeks.","Nepal has been trying to draft a constitution for five years .

"(CNN) -- If you're not Canadian, chances are you have never been as acutely aware of the political happenings of that country as you are now. Rob Ford, the embattled and out-of-control mayor of Toronto, has made sure of that, with his erratic behavior blazing across our screens more boldly and brightly than the reddest maple leaf that nation has ever produced. Ford's booze-soaked stunts and possibly drug-driven debacles -- now feeding the tabloids and late night talk shows more meat than they could digest in a year -- are probably nothing you haven't read about, talked about, thought about, or, unfortunately, laughed about. But what you might not have thought about is this: You know this man. You know and respect this man. He works with you. He works for you. He lives next door to you. He's related to you. He might even be you. He is, in fact, everywhere. And there's nothing funny about it. Oftentimes functioning at levels you would never expect from someone with an addiction, the Rob Ford in your life is trying your case, prescribing your medication, running your company, investing your money, flying your plane and governing your city. And guess what? He or she is doing it from the grips of a progressive disease, making it look easy until, well, one day it suddenly looks horrible. I know -- I've been there. Was my own powerful reckoning with alcohol as excruciatingly documented and publicly consequential? Mercifully, no. Not even close. Could it have been, under different circumstances? Yes, perhaps. When you laugh at the mayor of Toronto, you are laughing at the struggles of countless people like him that you'll never know about. People who you otherwise admire and sometimes even vote for. You see, the biggest difference between Mayor Ford and millions of other alcoholics and addicts who have built a successful career isn't that his behaviors are so much more shocking, it's that his are alone in the center of a spotlight, on full display like the unsightly scar most of us are able to keep private. And he's the mayor of one of the largest cities in North America. But if you dim that light and pause those digital recorders, you'll see the mayor is not alone. He's surrounded. Surrounded by a vast sea of others shrouded in the same, strong, delusional fog of denial. A fog that's born from the marriage of disease and diploma, sickness and success. And, you're surrounded by them, too. Hiding in plain sight, addicted yet outwardly successful professionals are a carefully disguised contradiction. We don't have a problem with our drinking. Other people have a problem with their drinking. You know, the type of people who couldn't do half of what we've done. The people who couldn't even get our job, let alone do it. Those people. Even when startling evidence to the contrary begins piling up, as it so clearly has with Mayor Ford, we stick to our story and cling to our capabilities. To paraphrase the mayor, if we were alcoholics, we couldn't show up to work every day. Could we? Yes. And we do. Until the bitter end and long after the other relationships in our lives have tanked, we suit up and show up. We're professionals. And as long as we've got that, we're not alcoholics. We're not addicts. Or so our inner monologue goes. But, if you pierce through that devastatingly convincing argument we sell ourselves, and you, each of us is a walking bundle of profound denial, tightly bound up by an impressive tailored suit, spotless lab coat or an elegant black robe. Bolstered by a track record of academic or professional victories, we've got a deep stockpile of accomplishments to call upon in our war against reality. We have a formidable arsenal of achievements deftly deployed against you and your little idea that we need help. That's cute -- that you think we need help. But you don't get it. We're not the kind of people who need help. Do you even understand how talented and smart we are? Although denial is the hallmark characteristic of all alcoholics and addicts, unfortunately for us ours comes with a resume that pumps our ego and demands your respect. Until, that is, it eventually doesn't. Last year I was sitting in my office with a client -- a highly successful, highly regarded attorney with a highly advanced drinking problem -- who after years of fervently denying his problem finally found his truth. He looked me dead in the eye, breathed a slow sigh of calm relief and said plainly: ""The jig is up."" From that moment forward, his life changed. His denial had collapsed, thankfully before he did. So what was responsible for his long overdue recognition of the obvious and surrender to reality? It was the fact that those around him had stopped excusing his reluctance to seek help out of deference to his professional stature. No longer were people overlooking his sickness out of respect for his career. More important, neither was he. As our science moves toward a better understanding of addiction and our culture moves toward a greater acceptance of it, it's important to keep in mind that this disease walks upright through all corridors of our society, even those in the house of that accomplished professional next door. We might want to stop laughing now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick Krill.","Patrick Krill: We laugh about Toronto Mayor Ford's stunts, but addiction is serious .

"(CNN) -- About a year after losing his dad in a plane crash, Matt Snoddy climbed into the cockpit for an emotional flight. His kids Charlie, age 5 and Alice, 3, were tucked in the back of the tiny Cessna and his flight instructor was seated alongside. Snoddy pulled back on the stick and they were airborne. The Lexington, Kentucky, landscape spread out below them as the plane gained altitude. Snoddy couldn't help but gaze down at Blue Grass Airport, where Comair Flight 191 crashed during takeoff, killing his father, Tim Snoddy, and 48 others. A government investigation blamed the crash on Flight 191's pilots, who attempted takeoff from a wrong runway. The FAA administrator at the time said disasters like Flight 191 might be avoided under NextGen, the nation's sweeping air traffic overhaul set to roll out by 2025. Memories of the crash had kept Snoddy -- a longtime private pilot -- out of the cockpit until his wife offered the flight as a gift for Father's Day. ""She wanted me to take the kids up and to see if I wanted to keep flying."" Snoddy and his father shared a love for flying -- Matt Snoddy as a pilot and his dad as a passenger. Tim Snoddy enjoyed flying so much he'd been talking about getting his pilots' license, too. Tim Snoddy, a 51-year-old accountant and consultant for legal cases, was a frequent business traveler who left his Lexington home many times a year to spend a total of six months away at his offices in Asheville, North Carolina, and near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Matt Snoddy, an IT consultant, had set up shop with his dad in the same Lexington building, where their father-son relationship strengthened. Everything changed on the dreary Sunday morning of August 27, 2006. Matt Snoddy was home with his wife and kids when a friend called. ""She said, 'Matt your dad was on that airplane.' I said, 'What airplane?' and she goes, 'Turn on the news,' and sure enough there was the crash."" Matt's first thought was: ""There's no way he was on that plane. Why would he be flying out on a Sunday?"" But the friend who called knew his father had changed his departure date. ""So I immediately called my dad's cell and it went straight to voice mail and I left a message saying, 'Dad, just give me a call. I'm just checking on you.' "" Snoddy wasn't sure if he really wanted to get back in the cockpit so soon after the crash, but he found himself doing so -- creating a kind of emotional test to gauge his loss and how it had transformed him. It was likely he might choose never to fly again. And that feeling became stronger during the flight. He realized his love of flying, which he'd cherished since his teens, had suddenly disappeared. ""Something was different and I just didn't feel comfortable doing it anymore,"" Snoddy said. ""The flight was my way of saying, 'OK that's it, farewell. We've had some good times but now it's time to move on.' "" If planes are outfitted with cockpit displays pinpointing their locations on airport surface maps, crashes like Comair 191 might be prevented, then-FAA Administrator Marion Blakey told Louisville's Business First newspaper. A map display could have alerted crew members they were on the wrong runway, say experts. With NextGen technology, the lone controller on duty that morning also might have had access to a similar map display, which experts say also may have helped avert the crash. Experts throughout the industry agree the United States enjoys the world's safest air traffic system, with no deaths from commercial airline crashes last year. But NextGen aims to head off future safety concerns from gridlock expected as the skies and airports become more crowded. As many as 6,000 aircraft are in the skies during peak traffic times, according to the FAA. But get ready for that number to increase. The number of annual U.S. air passengers is projected to pass 1 billion by 2021. Radar -- the technology that currently tracks all flights -- dates back to the early 20th century. It's less accurate than GPS, its data is delayed by about 10 seconds and pilots can't use it to see their positions on a cockpit display. NextGen's GPS-based technology promises to increase safety by allowing pilots to see their locations and locations of surrounding aircraft via a cockpit display in real time. How NextGen affects travelers . This visual aide vastly improves what pilots call situation awareness, a mental picture of where their aircraft is in relation to its surroundings. Any kind of technology that provides pilots with more information is a good thing, said Snoddy, who believes better situation awareness in the cockpit might have saved his father's life. A GPS-based tracking technology called ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) is already used to some extent by UPS, Southwest Airlines, and soon, JetBlue. By 2020, the FAA will require all U.S. aircraft to broadcast their positions using ADS-B. More about ADS-B . In smaller general aviation aircraft, ADS-B has proved its value for Marisha Falk. The pilot instructor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, credits ADS-B with saving her life and the life of her co-pilot in 2007. During a cross-country air race over Kentucky, another plane was bearing down from behind and above Falk's aircraft -- a blind spot where eyesight alone would have left her unaware. The approaching plane triggered a warning from the ADS-B -- and Falk took action. ""If we wouldn't have sidestepped to the right, they would have just landed right on top of our airplane,"" she said. National security . Big questions remain unanswered surrounding NextGen and the security of the nation's airspace. On 9/11, terrorist hijackers shut off radar transponders aboard their hijacked airliners, making it hard to identify and track them en route to their targets. Without transponders, planes are visible on radar screens, but impossible to ID. Would hijackers be able to do the same thing with ADS-B? It's unclear how vulnerable the ADS-B system would be to hackers, terrorists and other attackers compared with the nation's current radar-based tracking. In a 9/11 scenario, if both a plane's ADS-B and its radar transponder are shut off, experts say the plane would be harder to track but still visible on radar, which would be available as an ADS-B backup. The FAA refused to discuss details about ADS-B and security issues, but a spokesman said protections are part of the program and are being developed. ""That's the reality of today's environment, that we have to take all these things into account, which we are,"" said FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto. For example, testing is under way in the Southwest on ways to prevent hackers from ""spoofing,"" which involves intentionally interfering with ADS-B signals to create false targets on ADS-B displays. The FAA plans to decommission some radar stations as it relies more on ADS-B. By 2020, will there still be enough radar stations to protect U.S. airspace? In February, the Department of Transportation inspector general warned about potential gaps in the system. Top U.S. security authorities, Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, haven't yet agreed with the FAA on how to jointly monitor so-called ""noncooperative"" aircraft, in other words aircraft possibly piloted by terrorists that aren't transmitting flight information. ""Without closer coordination and agreement about surveillance requirements, there is potential for duplicative efforts and gaps in airspace coverage,"" DOT Inspector General Calvin Scovel told a House panel. The situation is enough to prompt concern among members of the powerful Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee, which has a big say in NextGen funding. As the fifth anniversary of the Lexington crash approaches, Matt Snoddy doesn't miss being in the cockpit as much as he thought he would. He's still healing from the disaster's emotional scars, and he still prefers to drive -- if possible -- rather than fly commercial. ""It's difficult for some people to give up that control,"" Snoddy said, ""especially when they've been through something like I've been through -- and the rest of my family and the families of the 48 other people on the plane."" He'll mark the fifth anniversary of the crash in a ceremony at the University of Kentucky arboretum,  where he will help unveil a 25-foot memorial statue depicting 49 silver birds forever suspended in flight. Years ago Snoddy said farewell to piloting an aircraft ever again, but lately he doesn't rule it out -- someday. ""Maybe,"" he said. ""Not right now. It's just going to take time."" This is the final report of a three-part series surrounding the FAA's ""NextGen"" overhaul of the U.S. air traffic system. Previous parts discussed NextGen technology and how the program will affect consumers. CNN's Steve Kastenbaum, Sean O'Key and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","NextGen U.S. air traffic overhaul aims to improve safety with new technology .

"(CNN) -- Three Kenyans tortured during a colonial-era rebellion can sue the United Kingdom for compensation, a London high court ruled Friday, potentially opening floodgates of abuse claims dating to the British Empire. The plaintiffs said they endured torture at the hands of British forces, including castration, brutal beatings and detention. The abuse occurred during Kenya's struggle for independence about six decades ago. In the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, jubilant colonial-era fighters, balancing on walking sticks, gingerly danced after the ruling thousands of miles away. Others prayed and wept. ""It's a great day. I am as happy as the day I was released"" from the detention camp, said Wambugu Wa Nyingi, one of the three. ""We believe that they (the UK) will do the right thing, now that they have accepted that it's the truth."" The other plaintiffs are Paulo Muoka Nzili and Jane Muthoni Mara, who are in their 70s and 80s. All three are in Kenya and did not attend the hearing in London. A fourth one died before the ruling. Soon after the verdict, Nairobi lawyer Donald Rabala announced plans to file a lawsuit Monday on behalf of hundreds of colonial-era fighters. The abuse occurred from 1952 to 1961, when fighters from the Mau Mau movement battled British forces for land and freedom. Colonial forces killed thousands of fighters and detained others, including Kenyans who were not part of the rebel group. The African nation went on to gain independence from Britain in 1963. Britain does not deny its colonial forces tortured detainees but had argued that a fair trial is impossible because the events occurred decades ago. It plans to appeal the ruling. ""The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement. ""In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened."" The ruling will spark lawsuits from other nations colonized by Britain and will reverberate worldwide for years to come, said Martyn Day, a lawyer for the trio. ""The judgment means the government will now have to face potentially thousands of claims from Kenyans who suffered similar torture,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a statement. Last year, the London high court ruled that the UK government is the right entity to sue. Before that ruling, Britain had argued that it transferred the powers and liabilities of the colonial administration to Kenya after independence. In July, the British government conceded for the first time that Kenyans had been tortured during the fight for independence.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new U.S. counterterrorism strategy released Wednesday focuses on the ability of al Qaeda and its network to inspire people in the United States to attack the homeland, said John Brennan, White House counterterrorism adviser. Speaking at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Brennan said, ""Indeed, this is the first counterterrorism strategy that designates the homeland as a primary area of emphasis in our counterterrorism efforts."" He added, ""We are doing everything in our power to prevent another terrorist attack on our soil. ... It's not enough to simply be prepared for attacks, we have to be resilient and recover quickly should an attack occur."" Brennan said the ability to snap back quickly in the event of an attack would deny al Qaeda ""the economic damage and disruption it seeks."" He made it clear the administration wants to follow a strategy of drone strikes and targeted raids against terrorists and avoid prolonged wars. ""Al Qaeda seeks to bleed us financially by drawing us into long, costly wars that also inflame anti-American sentiment,"" he said. ""Our best offense won't always be deploying large armies abroad but delivering targeted, surgical pressure to the groups that threaten us."" The U.S. can't go after every terrorist group and must focus attention on those that seek to harm the U.S., Brennan said. He said al Qaeda and its affiliates still represent the greatest danger, even after the May raid by U.S. Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Brennan said the U.S. wants to work with allies to bring terrorists down, but he would not rule out future unilateral strikes even in the territory of allies. ""As the president has said repeatedly, if we have information about the whereabouts of al Qaeda, we will do what is required to protect the United States -- as we did with bin Laden."" According to Brennan, the cache of videos and writings seized at bin Laden's compound shows the al Qaeda leader worried ""al Qaeda is losing the larger battle for hearts and minds."" Bin Laden ""knew that he had failed to portray America as being at war with Islam"" and that had hampered efforts to recruit more Muslims to his cause. Brennan said bin Laden ""called for more large-scale attacks against America, but encountered resistance from his followers and he went for years without seeing any spectacular attacks."" The president's counterterrorism adviser questioned how well Ayman al Zawahiri will do as the new paramount leader of al Qaeda, saying he ""lacks bin Laden's charisma and perhaps the loyalty and respect of many in al Qaeda."" But Brennan acknowledged Zawahiri might try to launch new attacks to prove he and al Qaeda are still relevant. Brennan admitted there is a concern that Americans could become complacent since there hasn't been a large-scale attack here since 9/11 and since Osama bin Laden has been killed. But with the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 coming soon, Brennan said, ""We want to make sure that we're as vigilant and we're as poised to detect and thwart these attacks."" He added Congress is well aware of the need to stay focused on the threat of terrorism.","U.S. to warn against al Qaeda's ability to inspire Americans to attack .

"(CNN) -- An indictment unsealed in Manhattan criminal court on Thursday formally charged suspect Conrado Juarez with the 1991 slaying of 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, known for decades only as ""Baby Hope."" Juarez, 52, in an orange jumpsuit and a translator at his side, pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder in the second degree. Assistant District Attorney Melissa Mourges read portions of a statement, unsealed in court, taken when Juarez allegedly confessed after his October arrest. The document said that Juarez ""admitted that he had sex with the victim and killed her by smothering her with a pillow, then packed her into the cooler and brought the cooler uptown and left it as previously described."" Outside court, Juarez's attorney Michael Croce called the alleged confession ""completely suspect,"" saying his client was interrogated for more than 13 hours. Croce said he was told a police translator helped facilitate the confession. ""That's always problematic for me,"" he said, casting doubt on its ""veracity"" and ""accuracy."" Last month, police said that Juarez -- 30 at the time -- visited a Queens apartment shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway. In 1991, construction workers found the body of Anjelica -- who had not been reported missing -- bound and stuffed in a garbage bag. The bag was hidden under some soda cans inside a blue and white cooler. She had been smothered and sexually molested, police said. Her body was so decomposed that several sketches were made in attempts to capture what she looked like. The young victim became an emotional symbol for the NYPD and its unsolved cases. Two years after she was found, the girl was laid to rest in a donated plot. She was buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife, with a tombstone paid for by detectives to mark her grave. ""Because we care"" said an inscription at the bottom of the tombstone. Each year, on the anniversary of the July 23, 1991, discovery of her body, police canvassed nearby neighborhoods, handing out fliers and seeking leads in the case. An anonymous tip called in after the latest canvass in July helped crack the case, police said. It took detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult. The lead helped them identify the woman believed to be the girl's mother. Anjelica's name was recently added to her tombstone, more than 20 years after her body was discovered.

"(CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett, the blonde-maned actress whose best-selling poster and ""Charlie's Angels"" stardom made her one of the most famous faces in the world, died Thursday. She was 62. Farrah Fawcett rose to fame in the 1970s, thanks to a best-selling poster and the hit show ""Charlie Angels."" Fawcett's death was confirmed by Paul Bloch, one of her representatives at Rogers and Cowan, an entertainment public relations firm. Fawcett, who checked into a hospital in early April, had been battling anal cancer on and off for three years. Bloch told CNN that Ryan O'Neal, Fawcett's romantic partner since the mid-1980s, and her friend Alana Stewart were with Fawcett at Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, when she died.  Gallery: The life of Farrah Fawcett » . ""Although this is an extremely difficult time for her family and friends, we take comfort in the beautiful times that we shared with Farrah over the years and the knowledge that her life brought joy to so many people around the world,"" O'Neal said in a written statement. Read more tributes to Fawcett . O'Neal is the father of Fawcett's son, Redmond O'Neal, born in 1985. Redmond O'Neal is in an intense rehabilitation program conducted in the Los Angeles county jail, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told CNN on Thursday. Fawcett's son was informed on Wednesday night by a grief counselor and a chaplain that his mother's death was imminent, and a grief counselor and chaplain also told him when she died, Whitmore said. The young man, who is currently with a chaplain, has spoken with his father, Whitmore said. Ryan O'Neal had recently told People magazine that the sex symbol was declining. ""She stays in bed now. The doctors see that she is comfortable. Farrah is on IVs, but some of that is for nourishment. The treatment has pretty much ended,"" he said in a story posted May 7.  See images of Fawcett through the years » . Fawcett's cancer journey has been documented in a television special partly shot by the actress. Fawcett began shooting ""Farrah's Story,"" by taking a camera to a doctor's appointment. Eventually, the film expanded to include trips overseas in hopes of treating the cancer.  Watch a clip from ""Farrah's Story"" » . The documentary aired on NBC on May 15.  Watch Ryan O'Neal talk about why she did the documentary » . Fawcett's beauty -- her gleaming smile was printed on millions of posters -- initially made her famous. But she later established herself as a serious actress. She starred as a battered wife in the 1984 TV movie ""The Burning Bed."" She appeared on stage as a woman who extracts vengeance from a would-be rapist in William Mastrosimone's play ""Extremities.""  Watch Fawcett accept her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame » . She reprised the ""Extremities"" role on film in 1986. Other Fawcett films include ""Logan's Run"" (1976), ""Saturn 3"" (1980), ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981), ""The Apostle"" (1997) and the Robert Altman-directed ""Dr. T and the Women"" (2000). To many, Fawcett will always be best known for her red-swimsuited image on the pinup poster, which sold a reputed 12 million copies after its release in 1976. iReport: Share your memories of Farrah Fawcett . Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts, commercials and as ""Six Million Dollar Man"" actor Lee Majors' wife when she shot the poster in early 1976 at the behest of Pro Arts, a Cleveland, Ohio, company. Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away. Fawcett did her own hair -- a long, tousled cascade of blonde locks -- picked out the red bathing suit and chose the frame later used for the poster, according to a story in the Toronto Star. The poster, with Fawcett's million-dollar smile front and center, became a sensation. Soon after the photo shoot, Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show, ""Charlie's Angels,"" about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie, whose only appearance in the show was through his voice (supplied by John Forsythe).  Watch Fawcett talk about why she left ""Angels"" » . Fawcett, who played Jill Munroe, was the last to be cast. Co-star Kate Jackson was the known name at the time, but thanks to her poster, Fawcett became the breakout star. The highly rated TV series kicked off what came to be known as ""jiggle TV,"" series full of pretty actresses who appeared in bikinis at the drop of a hat. ""Denunciations of 'massage parlor television' and 'voyeurism' only brought more viewers to the screen, to see what the controversy was about,"" wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh about ""Charlie's Angels"" in their indispensable reference, ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows."" ABC's ""Three's Company"" and CBS's ""The American Girls"" were among the shows that immediately followed, and shows such as ""Baywatch"" owe ""Charlie's Angels"" a debt. But Fawcett didn't stay with ""Angels"" long. At the end of the first season, unhappy with her contract, she left the show and was replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Fawcett's career stagnated for a time after ""Charlie's Angels."" She appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors. But her career received a major boost with her starring role in ""The Burning Bed,"" a 1984 TV movie co-starring Paul Le Mat. Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband's bed as he lies sleeping. Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance. Fawcett also became romantically involved with O'Neal around this time. The pair had a son, Redmond, in 1985. In recent years, Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye. She posed nude for Playboy in 1995. In 1997, she appeared on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" an interview that became notorious for Fawcett's apparent incoherence. She later said she was just having fun with Letterman. She reunited with her ""Charlie's Angels"" co-stars, Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, for an awards show in 2006. Fawcett was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1947. She married Majors in 1973; they divorced nine years later. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2006.","Farrah Fawcett was known for iconic 1970s poster, role in ""Charlie's Angels""

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization said Saturday it is investigating a possible outbreak of polio in Syria, where an ongoing civil war has decimated the public health infrastructure. The organization said it received reports Thursday of ""a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases"" in the country. The cluster was detected early in the month in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, it said. ""Initial results from the national polio laboratory in Damascus indicate that two of the cases could be positive for polio -- final results are awaited from the regional reference laboratory of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO,"" it said. Wild poliovirus -- which is highly infectious -- was last reported in Syria in 1999. Syria's Ministry of Health ""confirms that it is treating this event as a cluster of 'hot' AFP cases, pending final laboratory confirmation,"" and is planning an urgent, nationwide response, it said. Neighboring countries were planning to increase their immunization activities, it added. A worldwide eradication effort has been credited with helping reduce the incidence of the disease, which primarily affects children younger than 5, by more than 99% in the past quarter century, from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 223 reported cases last year, according to the WHO. In 1988, the disease was endemic in more than 125 countries; this year, it is endemic in only three countries -- Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. One in 200 infections results in irreversible paralysis. Of those who become paralyzed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles are affected. There is no cure for polio, but the vaccine -- given multiple times -- can protect for life. Despite its precarious public health infrastructure, India succeeded in stopping polio in 2011.","The virus is highly infectious .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York police detective was among four bikers who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges in connection with the beating -- caught on video -- of an SUV driver in September. Wojceich Braszczok is charged with gang assault, criminal mischief, riot and more in the 14-count indictment related to the September 29 altercation with SUV driver Alexander Lien. Braszczok was off duty at the time. Footage of the incident recorded from another biker's helmet camera went viral after it was posted online. Authorities say Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed, he was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. He has not been charged. Prosecutors say Braszczok is on video allegedly using his fist to bash in the rear window of Lien's SUV and kick it. His attorney, John Arlia, declined to comment on the case Wednesday. Also entering not guilty pleas Wednesday: . --Clint Caldwell, charged with felony first-degree gang assault.

"(CNN) -- Landslides unleashed by tropical depression Parma across the Philippine province of Benguet have killed at least 122 people and left 31 missing, officials said Friday. A boatman transports three empty wooden coffins on the edge of Laguna Lake east of Manila on Thursday. Four people had been found alive in debris, and at least 22 had been injured by landslides that started Thursday afternoon and continued all night, affecting several municipalities, said Elmer Foria, police senior superintendent. Parma, which had been downgraded from a typhoon, poured more rain onto sodden and already weakened ground. Flooding had inundated 32 towns and two cities, Dagupan and Urdaneta, according to Rocky Baraan, provincial administrator of Pangasinan. Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council. The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported. People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed. Since the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters per hour at one dam, dam officials said. Water passing through the three dams -- the Ambuklao, the Binga and the San Roque -- is rushing into the Agno River, which has been swollen since Thursday and affects seven towns in eastern Pangasinan, dam officials said. Water released from the San Roque dam has contributed to the flooding in eastern Pangasinan, acknowledged Alex Palada, division manager for flood forecasting and warning of the National Power Corporation. Dam officials had no choice but to maintain safe water levels, he added, noting that he alerted Pangasinan Governor Amado Espino. The governor started to evacuate residents Thursday when the Agno River started to rise, Palada said. In the last several days, water has become the Philippines' biggest enemy, as Parma, locally known as ""Pepeng,"" dumped as much as 36 inches (91.4 centimeters) of rain in some parts of the nation of islands, compounding misery in areas already flooded by earlier storm Ketsana. Parma was forecast to have winds of no greater than 39 mph (63 kph) by Friday. The U.S. Navy was expected to join rescue operations in Pangasinan, according to the agency. Journalist Lilibeth Frondoso and CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","Three dams in Pangasinan area release vast amounts of water, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain Monday faulted Sen. Barack Obama for downplaying the threat from Iran and again called the Democratic front-runner's judgment ""reckless,"" the latest jabs in a foreign policy fight that could continue to the general election. Sen. John McCain called Sen. Barack Obama's foreign policy toward Iran ""reckless."" Obama's willingness to sit down with the Iranian president demonstrates Obama's lack of understanding of international relations, McCain said during a speech in Chicago, Illinois. ""Such a statement betrays the depth of Senator Obama's inexperience and reckless judgment,"" McCain said. ""Those are very serious deficiencies for an American president to possess."" Obama quickly responded during a speech in Billings, Montana, asking why the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was afraid to talk to Iran and that it was the ""Bush-McCain"" war policy in Iraq, not diplomacy, that would make Iran stronger. ""Make no mistake, Iran is the single biggest beneficiary of a war in Iraq that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged,"" the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination said.  Watch Obama decry the ""Bush-McCain"" policy » . ""Thanks to George Bush's policy, Iran is the greatest threat to the United States and Israel and the Middle East for a generation. John McCain wants to double down on that failed policy."" McCain said Obama did not have an appropriate grasp of the danger Iran poses to the U.S. ""Senator Obama claimed that the threat Iran poses to our security is 'tiny' compared to the threat once posed by the former Soviet Union,"" McCain said during a speech in Chicago. ""Obviously, Iran isn't a superpower and doesn't possess the military power the Soviet Union had, but that does not mean that the threat posed by Iran is insignificant. ""Should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, that danger would become very dire, indeed,"" McCain said. McCain was reacting to a statement Obama made in Pendleton, Oregon, Sunday night while he was defending his view that he would step up diplomatic engagements with Iran -- potentially up to the presidential level -- if he became president.  Watch McCain call Obama's judgment ""reckless"" » . ""Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union,"" Obama said. ""They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us, and yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we're going to wipe you off the planet. ""We should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. We might not compromise on any issue, but at least we should find out are there areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world,"" Obama said. Obama said he was aware of the ""grave"" threat Iran poses to the United States, but that it was ""common sense"" that Iran is less of a threat today to the U.S. than the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. Obama said just as Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan did during the Cold War, the U.S. should engage diplomatically with its enemies. ""Why shouldn't we have the same courage and confidence to talk to our enemies? That's what strong countries do. That's what strong presidents do,"" the senator from Illinois said. ""One of the things you have to ask yourself:  What are George Bush and John McCain afraid of [in] demanding a country meets all of your conditions before you meet with them?"" Obama said. McCain's attacks on Obama are a continuation of a bitter fight over foreign policy that erupted between the two candidates last week. In a previous exchange, McCain blasted Obama for what he described as the Democrat's willingness to engage in unconditional talks with Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group the U.S. has labeled as a terrorist organization. Obama denied McCain's claim, saying he would only talk to Hamas if the group renounced its call for Israel's destruction.","NEW: Obama says Iraq war has strengthened Iran .

"(CNN) -- From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was. Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said. Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed. The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping. Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound » . ""You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances,"" said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. ""There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged."" But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction. Kollar said the property had ""a hidden backyard within a backyard."" It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, ""where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."" It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. The ""secondary"" backyard was inside the first and was ""screened from view."" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping. Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside. She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there. ""None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor,"" Kollar said. ""They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,"" he said. ""They were born there."" The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11. ""They are all in good health,"" Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon may announce as soon as this weekend a plan to bring up to 400,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work, according to two Defense Department officials. CNN has learned the plan is in the final stages of being written and approved. If all are returned to work, it would represent about half the number of government civilian and contract employees at risk of furloughs during the government shutdown that began on Tuesday. The partisan congressional stalemate over spending for the current fiscal year shows no sign of ending anytime soon. Details of the Pentagon plan were being worked out on exactly which employees would be brought back and how they would be notified. The officials declined to be identified because the plan has not yet been announced. But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made his view clear while traveling in Japan. ""We were forced by law to furlough many, many of our civilian workers. But we're trying to find a solid legal interpretation here in the law that can bring back more people in support of our military,"" he said. It's expected the Defense Department will issue a broad statement from Hagel saying he is authorizing employees back to work followed by detailed memos about the recall would work. Obama administration lawyers have been working to interpret how much leeway they were given by Congress over personnel in a measure approved just before the shutdown took effect that ensured troops would continue to be paid during a government closure. Language in the law said civilian personnel and contractors will be paid if the secretary of defense ""determines"" they are providing ""support"" for the troops and several members of Congress have said that gives Hagel broad authority. But the two officials said lawyers were still working on what that means because the law does not specifically say all employees can come back. ""The question is who works here at the department who supports troops?"" one official said. There will have to be some legal finding as to what jobs and which personnel specifically support troops, both officials said. But Defense Department officials are well aware that Hagel is pressuring to bring everyone back to work next week. ""There's no job in our Department of Defense that doesn't support the military. So, I think theoretically -- I'm not a lawyer, but I do have some appreciation for common sense, and common sense tells you that if you're working for the Department of Defense, you're supporting the defense and the security of America, and you're supporting those who are on the front lines,"" Hagel said.","Pentagon may bring back up to 400,000 furloughed civilian employees .

"(CNN) -- An Iowa man shot and killed an escaped inmate on Tuesday after the convict held him and his wife hostage in their home, investigators said. Jerome Mauderly, 71, and his wife, Carolyn, 66, were asleep when escaped inmate Rodney Long, 38, broke into their rural Bedford home a little after 10 p.m. on Monday, said Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation spokesman Mitch Mortvedt. Long -- who had allegedly shot a deputy pursuing him on Sunday -- woke up the Mauderlys and disabled their landline phones except for a line in the couple's bedroom. He then took a shotgun that Jerome Mauderly, a retired prison guard and farmer, had loaded that night and placed next to the bed before going to sleep. ""(The Mauderlys) knew the situation. There was an escaped inmate, armed and dangerous. They were not the only people in the community that had loaded weapons that night,"" Mortvedt said. The Mauderlys' home is isolated, surrounded by cornfields with the nearest neighbor about a mile away. Long took the shotgun from the bedroom and moved it to the kitchen. He held the Mauderlys hostage at gunpoint for about four hours while he rummaged through their home for supplies and used their cell phone. Around 2 a.m. Tuesday, while Long was upstairs looking for supplies, Jerome Mauderly sneaked into the kitchen and recovered his shotgun, Mortvedt said. Carolyn Mauderly called 911 from their bedroom. When Long walked down the stairs, Jerome Mauderly shot him in the torso. Long was found lying face down in the kitchen, Mortvedt said. ""(Long) had a handgun but was described as non-confrontational,"" Mortvedt said. ""After about four hours, Long let the Mauderlys out of sight, then Jerome Mauderly recovered the shotgun and shot and killed Long. ""The Mauderlys feared for their life. They had a real fear that he was going to kill them,"" Mortvedt said. Long escaped on Friday from the Clarinda Correctional Facility, a minimum security facility located 18 miles southwest of Des Moines. He was convicted of third-degree burglary. On Sunday he was spotted walking along a highway. When a deputy arrived to confront him, Long allegedly shot him twice and took his patrol car. A second deputy pursued Long for 40 minutes. The pursuit ended when Long crashed the patrol car and ran away. The Mauderlys home is about three quarters of a mile from the crash site. Coincidentally, the trooper who responded to the 911 call was 200 yards away from their home, searching for Long. The deputy who was shot while pursuing Long is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery. The Mauderlys will not be charged because the killing was in self-defense. They were not injured during the home invasion.","An escaped inmate, Rodney Long, broke into a couple's home as they were sleeping .

"Tobruk, Libya (CNN) -- Aysha Ahmed and Attique Saleh lived in silence for more than four decades under the ironfisted rule of Moammar Gadhafi. But not anymore. Not after they watched their daughter manhandled and dragged away from a Tripoli hotel. Eman al-Obeidy's parents told CNN Tuesday they are no longer afraid to publicly condemn the Libyan strongman, an act that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago. If Gadhafi were to face Ahmed now, she would slap him, she told CNN Tuesday. Al-Obeidy burst into the hotel housing international journalists in Tripoli Saturday and told them she had been raped by 15 militia men. Cameras captured the drama as al-Obeidy, sobbing and screaming, wanted the world to know the brutality of Gadhafi's regime. The Libyan government said al-Obeidy has been freed and that a criminal case is underway. The men accused of raping al-Obeidy have filed counter-charges for slander, Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Tuesday. But Ahmed contradicted the government, saying the government was still detaining her daughter, in an interview in the eastern city of Tobruk. She said she wanted Gadhafi to air footage of al-Obeidy as proof of her safety. Ahmed said she cannot forgive the grave injustice her daughter has suffered. She said the family has even received phone calls offering bribes to reject their daughter's claims and to tell their daughter to change her story. But they stand by her. They believe that Gadhafi's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative Muslim societies believe -- therefore dishonored. An in-absentia engagement ceremony held at a mosque in Tobruk Monday night proves that al-Obeidy's family and tribe stand by her, Ahmed said. She described her daughter, 29, as a kind, caring woman who wanted to be a journalist. She chose to study law instead when she realized there was no freedom of the press in her homeland. The government first portrayed al-Obeidy as mentally ill and a prostitute. It has since changed its story, saying she is sane and therefore able to withstand legal proceedings. She also harbored a deep love of languages, particularly Italian and French, Ahmed said. As a young girl, she looked out over the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean and called on the oil tankers to carry her to France. A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family. Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by ""one or two, preferably female, reporters to verify that she's fine, she's healthy, she's free with her family."" He refused to take further questions on the issue, repeatedly stating that Libyan society is ""very conservative."" A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. The sister's mobile phone has apparently been turned off, a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN, and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel. Ahmed said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter. Al-Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning. Her face was bruised. So were her legs. She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh. Speaking in English, she said had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men. Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said, CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy's story. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me,"" she said. ""My honor was violated by them."" Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles. Government officials tried to stifle her, but she persisted. Security forces moved to subdue her, and even a member of the hotel's kitchen staff drew a knife. ""Traitor!"" he shouted. Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head. One government official, who was there to facilitate access for journalists, pulled a pistol from his belt. Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment. Some journalists were beaten and kicked. CNN's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair. As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned, ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it.""

"(CNN) -- Devastated, but grateful to be alive -- soccer player Fabrice Muamba announced his retirement on Wednesday, five months after suffering a cardiac arrest on the playing field. The 24-year-old, who played for English Premier League club Bolton Wanderers, collapsed during an FA Cup match at Tottenham Hotspur in March. Medics battled to resuscitate the midfielder in front of the White Hart Lane crowd and it was later revealed the Zaire-born player's heart had stopped beating for 78 minutes. Muamba spent one month in a London hospital and had hoped to make a playing return, telling CNN this month that he had been back on the pitch in an informal kickaround, but medical experts have advised him against attempting a comeback. ""As part of my ongoing recovery, last week I traveled to Belgium to seek further medical advice from a leading cardiologist,"" the former Arsenal trainee, who represented England at under-21 level, said in a statement released by Bolton. ""But the news I received was obviously not what I had hoped it would be and it means I am now announcing my retirement from professional football. Muamba makes emotional appearance at Bolton's match against Tottenham . ""Football has been my life since I was a teenage boy and it has given me so many opportunities. Above all else, I love the game and count myself very lucky to have been able to play at the highest level. ""While the news is devastating, I have much to be thankful for. I thank God that I am alive and I pay tribute once again to the members of the medical team who never gave up on me. ""I would also like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my career, and the Bolton fans who have been incredible. I am blessed to have the support of my family and friends at this time."" Following the incident, which was broadcast live around the world, Muamba received widespread support and goodwill -- including Real Madrid players wearing t-shirts with his name on. Bolton Wanderers' Muamba discharged from hospital . Bolton chairman Phil Gartside was saddened by the news, but insisted Muamba must now focus on his life outside of soccer. ""To have Fabrice here and with us is truly amazing and we are all very thankful for that,"" he said. ""We are all hugely disappointed that Fabrice will be unable to return to his playing career but we have to be guided by the medical recommendations and the best interests of Fabrice. ""The most important thing is that Fabrice and his family have the rest of their lives ahead of them."" Is Muamba collapse a wake-up call for football? Bolton manager Owen Coyle, who was at Muamba's bedside in the early part of his ordeal, echoed Gartside's sentiments. ""We have spoken with Fab and he knows we will always support him in whatever he wants to do and that we will always be here for him,"" said Coyle, whose team begin life in the second division on Saturday after being relegated last season. ""He is obviously massively disappointed that he won't be able to carry on his career, but everyone has seen what a fighter and strong person he is in mind and body. ""We know that he will go on to achieve great things and within all this disappointment, the most important thing is that he is here, alive, today.""","Fabrice Muamba announces his retirement from professional football .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged developed nations to ""lead by example"" Wednesday as a climate change conference bogged down over support for poor nations trying to adapt to a warming world. The two-week conference in Poland's capital, Warsaw, opened with a hunger strike by the top delegate from the typhoon-battered Philippines to demand concrete action toward a new global pact on climate change. But with two days of talks left, participants said countries remained split on the big issues. ""Next year will require a lot of heavy lifting if we are to remain on track for an agreement in 2015,"" Ban said Wednesday. He called on countries to put their money where their mouths were by devoting more funding to deal with climate change and the carbon emissions blamed for causing it. ""The developed countries have great capacity and should lead by example,"" Ban said. ""Science is telling us we need to do more. Economists are highlighting the huge cost of inaction. Businesspeople want the signals from government that will create the right incentives to build a low-carbon future,"" he added. The Warsaw conference brings together countries that have signed onto the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to review their progress in limiting global temperature increases. But this year's meeting has been discouraging for advocates of aggressive action to limit carbon emissions and rein in a projected increase in global average temperatures. Australia's new conservative government recently announced plans to repeal a carbon tax aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Japan announced last week it wouldn't meet its stated emissions targets, citing the replacement of nuclear power plants idled after the 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi with fossil fuel generation. Canada made a similar announcement in October. A study released Tuesday by researchers at Britain's East Anglia University found greenhouse gas emissions will top 39 billion tons in 2013. The rate of increase has slowed, but the improvement is a drop in the bucket by global standards. Polish Environment Minister Marcin Korolec, the Warsaw conference's president, lost his job in a Cabinet shuffle on Wednesday. But Korolec told delegates that Prime Minister Donald Tusk is keeping him on as president of the conference and as a government official responsible for climate policy. Delegates from developing countries staged a three-hour walkout early Wednesday to protest what Kamrul Haque, a member of Bangladesh's delegation, called a ""stalemate"" over how to compensate their nations for climate-related losses. Haque said negotiators had gone back into the talks Wednesday night, but added, ""Unless and until everything is agreed, then nothing is agreed."" But Todd Stern, the head of the U.S. delegation, said the talks ended ""with everybody leaving"" after ""businesslike and productive"" discussions. ""I don't see this negotiation blowing up over that,"" he said. ""I think we will find a resolution, but we're still some distance apart."" An October study in the scientific journal Nature noted that more than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050, and the countries that will first see its effects are the ones least capable of responding. U.N. members have committed to setting up a $100 billion-a-year fund to deal with climate change. But Steve Kretzmann of the U.S.-based environmental group Oil Change International said global subsidies for fossil fuel industries already top $500 billion and some estimates run as much as $2 trillion. ""There is plenty of money there,"" Kretzmann said. ""It's just going in the wrong direction for the moment.""","""Science is telling us we need to do more,"" Ban Ki-moon tells climate conference .

"(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday. But even though it took him eight hours, he had every reason to beam. By completing the 26.2 mile course, Singh -- nicknamed the Turbaned Tornado -- became the oldest undisputed runner to finish a marathon. He is 100. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. He's completed eight now. ""He says no one is forcing him to do it. It's his desire to do it,"" coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. ""He wanted to do one when he's 100 and today's the day."" Singh was a colorful sight as he started the race in his canary yellow turban and a matching T-shirt with the words "" Sikhs in the City"" printed across its front -- a nod to his faith. He finished more than six hours behind winner Kenneth Mungara of Kenya, who won the event for the fourth straight year. Then again, Mungara is only 38. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. But until now, the title of ""oldest"" was the cause of some debate. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93. But the Guinness Book of World Records listed someone else -- Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. He walks or runs up to 10 miles a day. ""I have said it before: that I will carry on running, as it is keeping me alive,"" Singh told the marathon website.","Singh is the oldest person to complete a marathon .

"(CNN) -- The father of a 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minnesota to Las Vegas last week tearfully told reporters Wednesday that he'd previously asked for help to address the boy's behavior problems, but no one responded. ""Somebody help me, please,"" the father, who did not reveal his name, told reporters between sobs at a news conference hosted by the MAD DADS fathers' organization in Minneapolis. The boy ""wasn't listening. (He does) what he wants to do."" A MAD DADS spokesman said Wednesday that Hennepin County officials are now offering to step in with services and programs. Authorities have been trying to figure out how the boy slipped past security and airline gate agents at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport last Thursday and boarded Delta Flight 1651 to Las Vegas without detection. The boy, who had left home the day before, went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for the airport, said that surveillance video shows the boy briefly talking to a Delta gate agent before the flight. A short while later, the video shows that the agent became ""distracted,"" and that's when the boy was able to sneak through and board the plane, he said. Hogan said the crew later ""became suspicious of the child's circumstances."" Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. Detained in Nevada, the boy will be returned to Minneapolis because that is ""where issues will be addressed,"" a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. It was unclear when he would return to Minnesota; the MAD DADS spokesman said he believes it could happen Friday. Drawing a sweatshirt's hood tightly to his face to obscure his identity, the father said Wednesday he tried to ask assistance from police and social service officials because of his son's previous indiscretions, including allegedly stealing a vehicle just days before the flight. He turned his back to television cameras. ""I've been asking for help. No one stepped up to help,"" the dad said, head bowed. Social workers reportedly are no strangers to the boy. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported this week that Janine Moore, area director of the Hennepin County Human Services and Public Health Department, wrote in an e-mail to agency officials that child protective workers investigated the boy's family life four times. ""The reports have been inconsistent and there have been no injuries to the child; however, there is a pattern of behavior,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying in the e-mail. The ""pattern of behavior"" included sneaking into an area water park and a recent arrest on suspicion of stealing a vehicle, she wrote, according to the newspaper. The agency did not immediately return a CNN telephone message seeking comment on the Star Tribune report. The newspaper reported there is an investigation into whether the boy's mother, who works at the Minneapolis airport, helped him fly to Las Vegas. The paper didn't report who was conducting that investigation. The father said Wednesday that his son left home October 2 after indicating he was going to take out the trash. From that North Minneapolis neighborhood, it appears he rode a train to the airport, said the MAD DADS spokesman, sitting next to the father during the news conference. ""I'm not perfect. We assumed he was at a friend's house,"" the father said of that night. The boy's mother, noticing he hadn't come home, took Thursday off to call around and report him missing. Authorities told the family later that day that the boy took the flight to Nevada, the father said. Police detained the boy on October 1 on suspicion of stealing and driving a truck, the father said. He said his son didn't fully understand what he'd done. ""He told the police officer he thought he was playing 'Grand Theft Auto,'"" the father said. The MAD DADS spokesman added that the family does not own the video game. The truck had keys in the ignition and was stolen out of a business parking lot, according to a police report. Officers received a tip that its driver appeared to be a child. When police drove the son home after the truck incident, the dad asked whether he could discipline the boy by ""whupping"" him. The officer replied that if he did, the father would be put in jail, the father said. ""If I whup my son, I get locked up. If I let my son keep on doing what he's doing, I get in trouble. Somebody please help me. Please,"" he said. The boy also was suspended from school in September because of a fight, according to the dad. The father -- who said he's tried ""working side by side"" with his son, including helping with homework and taking him to the father's workplace -- added that agencies told him previously there wasn't much they could do because the boy is a minor. MAD DADS -- Men Against Destruction, Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder -- said it would offer the dad support, including possibly mentoring the boy. CNN's Bill Kirkos and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Boy sneaked past a ""distracted"" gate agent .

"New York (CNN) -- A Manhattan grand jury has indicted Conrado Juarez, who was arrested earlier this month in connection with the 1991 murder of 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, known for decades only as ""Baby Hope."" Juarez, 52, did not appear in court for the procedural hearing on Tuesday at his attorney's request. ""He's holding up. He is resolute about seeing this through,"" Michael Croce said of his client. On October 12, New York police announced Juarez's arrest, saying he confessed to the slaying during interrogation. According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, Juarez, who was 30 at the time of the crime, said he went to an apartment in Queens shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway. Juarez told police he smothered her with a pillow while raping her. Outside the court on Tuesday, Juarez's attorney cast doubt on the confession, which he said took place after 12 to 14 hours of questioning. ""I don't trust any statements that were made by any individual after being in custody for such an extended period of time,"" Croce said. ""I would expect that we will find out that statement was not videotaped or recorded, and that is by design."" In 1991, construction workers found the body of Anjelica, who had not been reported missing, bound and in a garbage bag, hidden under some soda cans inside a blue and white cooler. She had been smothered and sexually molested, and her body was so decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like. The young victim became an emotional symbol for the NYPD. Two years after she was found, the girl was laid to rest in a donated plot, buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife, with a tombstone paid for by detectives. ""Because we care"" was the inscription at the bottom of the tombstone. Each year, on the anniversary of the July 23, 1991, discovery of her body, police would canvass nearby neighborhoods, handing out fliers and asking people for information. It was an anonymous tip called in after the latest canvass in July that helped crack the case, Kelly said. The tip led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother. Changes in forensic science also helped propel the investigation, Kelly said. The girl's body was exhumed in 2006, and a DNA profile was built in 2011. Earlier this month the office of the chief medical examiner made a DNA match between the girl and her mother. From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said. On Tuesday, Juarez's attorney said he had not seen any of the evidence against his client. ""I would be interested in seeing that physical evidence,"" Croce said. He also suggested that it was inappropriate for a New York Times journalist to have interviewed Juarez in prison at Rikers Island. In the interview published last week, Juarez reportedly denied killing Anjelica, saying he was forced by detectives to make a false confession. Jaurez is expected to appear in court on November 21.

"(CNN) -- Officials in West Texas said Monday they are investigating the ""suspicious"" death of a 3-year-old boy, adopted from Russia, and a Russian official blamed the death on ""inhuman abuse."" The boy was born on January 9, 2010, and died on January 21, 2013, according to Konstantin Dolgov, the Russian Foreign Ministry's special representative for human rights. ""I would like to draw your attention to another case of inhuman abuse of a Russian child by U.S. adoptive parents,"" he said in a statement. Dolgov claimed the child suffered injuries to his head and legs, as well as to his abdomen and internal organs. The wounds, he said, ""could only be caused by strong blows."" Kim Herrington, an investigator with the Ector County Medical Examiner's Office, said the case was referred to his office because of the ""suspicious"" nature of the child's death. Patrick Crimmins, of Texas Child Protective Services, said his office is investigating. The allegations include physical abuse and neglectful supervision, or neglect, he said. Sgt. Gary Duesler, spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said his office is also investigating. No arrests have been made, and officials are waiting for autopsy results, he said. A call seeking comment to a number listed for the boy's adoptive parents was not immediately returned. A voice message told reporters the parents would have no comment. The child's death comes amid tension between the United States and Russia over adoptions. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday that officials are aware of the case. ""The Department of State takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries,"" she said. ""We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas."" In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure that would ban the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families. It is scheduled to take effect in January. The action could affect hundreds of U.S. families seeking to adopt. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions. The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, Russia's semiofficial RIA Novosti news agency said. And it imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. The move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on December 14. That law, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The Magnitsky Act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center. Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing what they say are 19 deaths of adopted Russian children since the 1990s. The Russian public supported the bill, with 56% of respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) saying they backed the ban, RIA Novosti reported. In 2010, an American woman sparked outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety. CNN's Chandler Friedman and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","A 3-year-old boy adopted from Russia reportedly died on January 21 .

"(CNN) -- What happened in Tunisia in the last nine months is momentous, an ongoing event of real historical importance. When in January of this year Zine el Abidine Ben Ali left the country after he indulged in a 'Presidency' that lasted almost 24 years, Tunisians were hopeful, yet also slightly anxious about the future. Now they have voted in the first free and fair elections in the country's history. Voter turnout has reportedly been very high. International observers confirmed that the electoral process has been sound. Tunisians have rallied around these elections as a focal point for a new chapter in their history. The Islamically oriented Ennahda has won more seats than any other party. Previously banned, the party is heavily influenced by the ideas of Rachid Ghannouchi who returned to Tunisia from exile in London earlier this year. If at the beginning of his political career, Ghannouchi flirted with rather more radical forms of Islamism, including the revolutionary model in Iran, he made it clear upon his arrival in Tunis that he should not be compared to Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic revolution of 1979. The success of Ennahda is indicative of a wider ideational trend that has engulfed the Arab-Islamic world for quite some time now: the shift from ideological Islam to civic Islam (al-Islam al-madaniya) or what I have called a ""post-modernised Islam"" elsewhere. The democratic commitment of movements such as Ennahda, but also the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Justice and Development Party in Turkey and the reformists in Iran is the outcome of changed attitudes towards the functions of religion in the political sphere. What is slowly being engineered is an Islam that is geared to cultural emancipation, rather than ideological indoctrination. Post-modern Islam is politically secular and operates in a distinctly pragmatist mode. As such it is entirely promiscuous in its choice of strategies and allies. There are almost no taboos when it comes to this new breed of ""Islamists."" This is very different from the heydays of modern Islamism whose godfather, Sayyid Qutb, and Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna had very specific and rather doctrinal ideas about the function of Islam in politics. From the perspective of Qutb, Islam was a revolutionary ideology that required a vanguard of committed and pious activists in order to take over the state and to establish an ""authentically"" Muslim order. Political power had to be assumed, if necessary by force. Islam would function not only in the cultural sphere as a nodal point for Muslim-majority societies. Islam would constitute the sovereignty of the state and its organs. It would be a total Islam, intrusive and radical. Times have changed. Today, post-modern Islam is primarily geared to the cultural and socio-economic preferences of the burgeoning middle-classes in the region whose politics is certainly not revolutionary. Neither does the emergence of this post-modern Islam necessarily translate into virulent anti-Americanism. Nonetheless, parties like Ennahda are very likely to steer toward a rather more equidistant relationship to the United States. They are also likely to confront Israel more vigorously on the Palestinian issue, quite comparable to the current policies of Turkey which has suspended military and intelligence cooperation with Israel over the killing of Turkish aid workers on the flotilla that was bound for Gaza last year. As such, ""post-modern Islam"" retains the emphasis on independence demanded by the first generation of Islamists. So with the emergence of electoral politics out of the Arab revolts, we are witnessing the establishment of viable democratic structures that are carried forward by functioning civil societies. The time of one-man dictatorships that are subservient to outside demands because of a lack of domestic legitimacy is over. During this process of confrontation between state and society, Islamic politics have been transformed from revolutionary Islamism which peaked in Iran in 1979 to the emergence of a post-modern, secularised, democratic, civic Islam that is a part of the political mix in Muslim-majority societies today. Tunisians made the first step to that end in the Arab world and the elections must be considered a milestone in their struggle for freedom and democracy. The Tunisian government that will emerge in the next weeks and months will rule with the mandate of the people and the momentum of a mass revolt behind it. In light of the evidence on the ground, one has to remain hopeful that the new Tunisia will not squander the opportunity that history has given it.","Moderate Islamist party Ennahda wins plurality of votes in Tunisia election .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey voters head to the polls on Wednesday in a special U.S. Senate election that's become a proxy fight over the federal government shutdown and the bitter partisan battle in the nation's capital over the rollout of the national health care law. Wednesday's election between two-term Democratic Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Republican nominee Steve Lonegan will also result in a slight shift in the current balance of power in the Senate. Booker, the front runner throughout the short campaign to replace the late Frank Lautenberg, held double-digit leads over Lonegan, a former mayor, in three polls of likely voters released in the 48 hours prior to what's expected to be a lower voter turnout election. The contest is the first federal election since the start of the shutdown on October 1, and that fiscal fight and the battle over extending the nation's debt limit, along with back and forth over Obamacare, have become big issues on the Garden State campaign trail. Booker, who for weeks has characterized Lonegan as a far-right, tea party conservative, is framing the race partially as a national referendum. ""New Jerseyans have a rare opportunity. Nobody else in the nation has this,"" Booker told CNN's Jason Carroll on Monday. ""The nation will be watching because New Jersey will be the one election on a federal level to say whether we endorse the shutdown with the person who says he wants to continue it, my opponent, or whether we want to go a different way. Sending somebody down there who has built a career on building bridges and bringing people together."" Lonegan agrees that the race has partially become a national referendum. ""The whole nation is watching our state vote,"" Lonegan said Monday on the campaign trail. ""It's not just an election for U.S. senator."" In the second of their two debates, Lonegan, who's criticized Booker for what the Republican describes as his celebrity status, said that the nationally recognized Booker is a ""Hollywood stand-in"" for President Barack Obama. Lonegan also said delaying implementation of the president's health care law remains ""absolutely essential,"" adding that ""I am proud Republicans are finally standing up to this tyrant."" On the eve of the special election, Booker led Lonegan 54%-40% among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll. In two surveys released Monday, Booker held a 10 point, 52%-42%, advantage in a Monmouth University poll, and a 22-point, 58%-36%, lead in a Rutgers-Eagleton survey. ""It's a New Jersey habit electing Democrats to the Senate. The liberal mayor of Newark, Cory Booker, holds onto the double-digit lead over the conservative former mayor of Bogota, Steve Lonegan, that we measured when we first looked at likely voters,"" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Low turnout's expected for a contest that's being held on a Wednesday and that comes less than three weeks before the state holds a gubernatorial election. Less than two-thirds of registered voters know that the Senate election is happening, and only a third can name both candidates in the Senate election without prompting, according to Fairleigh Dickinson University data. ""The timing of the election, combined with everything going on in Washington right now, has really diverted attention from the Senate race,"" said Dan Cassino, a professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University. ""That tells us that we're not going to see huge crowds at the polls on Wednesday."" To help bring Democrats to the polls, Booker's campaign released a video message Monday from Obama, who urged New Jersey voters to turn out for the Democratic candidate. ""Cory Booker has spent his entire life bringing people with different perspectives together, regardless of party, to take on tough challenges,"" said the President, in the video. And Saturday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a favorite among grassroots conservatives, campaigned with Lonegan at a high profile event organized by a national tea party group. The winner of Wednesday's special election will serve out the final year of Lautenberg's term. The Democrat died in June. Soon after Lautenberg's death, GOP Gov. Chris Christie, who's up for re-election in November, named fellow Republican and state Attorney General Jeff Chiesa to temporarily fill the Senate seat. A victory in the October 16 contest would make Booker the first African-American elected to the Senate since Barack Obama in Illinois in 2004. That move reduced the Democratic Party's control of the Senate to 54-46. A likely Booker victory would increase the Democrats' majority to 55-45. While there are two major candidates in the race, it's Booker, considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, who is getting more attention. He made national headlines for rescuing a neighbor from a fire and for helping his city dig out from a major snowstorm. But his status has also opened him to attacks by his critics that he spends far too much time outside of Newark, and that he hasn't done enough to stem the city's rising murder rate. Booker can boast of having nearly 1.5 million Twitter followers. But a recent Twitter exchange with a stripper did briefly make headlines. And questions about Booker's sexuality arose after he told the Washington Post earlier this year that he didn't care if supporters thought he was gay. ""It's something that's almost fatiguing at this point,"" Booker told CNN's Carroll. ""At the end of the day, I just believe we should be electing people on the content of their character, on the quality of their ideals, their dedication to their cause, not on who they're dating."" CNN's Ashley Killough and Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Democrat Cory Booker front-runner in short campaign against GOP's Steve Lonegan .

"(CNN) -- Even as they trade barbs publicly -- and even as artillery shells and accusations continue to fly in Syria -- the United States and Russia could take solace Friday in at least one respect: They are still talking. Discussions between the two in Geneva -- centered around Moscow's proposal to have Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government hand over its chemical weapons stockpile -- were supposed to end Friday. They continued through the night and were extended into Saturday for a reason, U.S. officials said. ""If there was no opening, we wouldn't still be here,"" a senior State Department official said. An Obama administration official said separately that ""we are coming closer to agreement on the scope of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile."" And even before the Geneva talks' extension was announced, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signaled their intent to meet again: on September 24 in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. The prospect of yet another round of negotiations in the next few weeks pointed to a potentially bigger endgame for the United States and Russia in the hastily arranged meeting they began on Thursday in the Swiss city. That's not to say all of the many outstanding issues -- on Syria's chemical weapons and much more -- have been resolved. Senior U.S. administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified the main sticking point was what consequences al-Assad and his government should face. These officials have no expectations Russia would agree to any U.N. resolution that included authorization for possible military force against Syria. The United States, therefore, will not insist it be included. That runs counter to Obama's call for the international community to take action, including a potential military strike, for what the United States and allies call a chemical weapons attack by al-Assad's forces last month outside Syria's capital that they say killed more than 1,400 people. Obama has threatened to act alone, if necessary, and his administration credits that threat with Russia's surprise proposal last week to have Syria turn over its chemical weapons arsenal to international control. Outside of the United Nations, however, administration officials insisted they would not take the military threat off the table. A senior defense official said there has been ""no change"" in the military's planning or readiness levels and commanders have not been instructed to change their ""posture"" in any way. Chemical weapons report expected Monday . The United Nations -- and especially its Security Council, including permanent members the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- could play a key role in the international community's response to Syria. And a report by its inspectors looking into an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus could be pivotal in guiding where countries come down on the issue. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-mooon is expected to present the report to the Security Council at 11 a.m. Monday, three diplomatic sources said. Ban said Friday that he believes it ""will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used."" The big questions are by whom and, if that's settled, what the world should do about it. Al-Assad and other Syrian officials have vehemently denied their forces were responsible, despite assertions by Obama and others to the contrary. Russia has stood by its longtime ally Syria, challenging the validity of the U.S. claims. At the same time, and as the threat of U.S.-led strikes loomed, Moscow raised its proposal on Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and working through the U.N. -- this after, time and again, blocking U.N. action involving Syria. Al-Assad quickly agreed, leading to the talks between Kerry and Lavrov in Geneva that began Thursday. Syria also told the United Nations on Thursday that it has sent the paperwork for joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such armaments. The Syrian submission was being reviewed by U.N. lawyers. If deemed sufficient, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would register it and Syria would officially be a member state in the convention. U.N. envoy: U.S.-Russia talks 'extremely important' At first, the Geneva talks were about Russia's proposal Monday for Syria to give up control of its chemical weapons, which the United States had demanded in order for Obama to drop plans to launch military strikes. Syrian crisis: Keeping up with key developments . Now the stakes have gotten higher, with Kerry telling reporters that progress in the broader peace process will largely depend on whether the current Geneva negotiations on Syria's chemical weapons succeed. A communique from last year's Syrian peace talks attended by all parties called for a ceasefire and establishing a fully inclusive transitional government to write a new constitution. That went nowhere, however. In fact, the U.N. estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 2011, in addition to more than 2 million becoming refugees and over 4 million being displaced within Syria. Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy on Syria, expressed fresh hopes Friday that a peaceful, political solution to end the war could be reached. Kerry and Lavrov's talks were a big reason for his optimism, with Brahimi calling them ""extremely important"" -- not regarding chemical weapons, but for the peace process generally. 'A criminal act' To keep up pressure on al-Assad, Obama on Friday described last month's chemical weapons attack a ""criminal"" act. Ban weighed in as well, saying the Syrian leader ""has committed many crimes against humanity, and therefore I am sure there will be surely a process of accountability when everything is over."" U.S. officials say the mere existence of talks with Russia on the matter is progress, noting that such a prospect would not have been considered just a week ago due to Moscow's repeated efforts to block U.N. action against Syria. Syrian civil war: 5 things to pay attention to today . Speaking to reporters Friday after he and Lavrov met with Brahimi, Kerry called the talks about Syria's chemical weapons ""constructive."" ""We are working hard to find common ground to be able to make that happen. And we discussed some of the homework that we both need to do,"" Kerry said. Lavrov said Russia had promoted a peaceful solution to Syria's civil war, adding that the communique agreed to in last year's first round of peace talks involving all the parties had been ""basically abandoned."" On chemical weapons, Lavrov said international officials had to work together ""to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly, professionally, as soon as practical."" Opinion: Is diplomacy the harder solution in Syria? Getting chemical weapons fraught with challenges . Even if all parties agree, weapons experts say the already major challenge of putting Syria's chemical stockpile under international control would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, amid an active civil war. Syria this week acknowledged that it possesses chemical weapons and wants to join the global convention that bans them. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports that the convention would become legally binding on Syria 30 days after it formally joins, meaning al-Assad's government would have to permit inspections at that time. After another 30 days -- which would be 60 days from when it formally joined the convention -- Syria would have to declare its chemical weapons stockpiles. On Thursday, al-Assad noted that joining the convention would give Syria the standard 30 days from compliance to declare its stockpiles, but Kerry responded by expressing concern about that long a time period, saying ""we believe there is nothing standard about this process."" At the State Department on Friday, spokeswoman Marie Harf said that ""verifying, accounting for securing and destroying a large stockpile of chemical weapons takes time,"" adding that ""it's very difficult to do, particularly in an active war zone."" ""If we keep forward momentum, if we believe there's a credible and verifiable plan on the table to do just that, we'll keep moving forward with that process, because resolving this issue diplomatically is certainly preferable to resolving it or to dealing with it with military action,"" Harf said. In Turkey, U.S. soldiers guard against Syrian missile threat . Political hurdles . Obama had tried to put together a NATO coalition to attack Syria, but the British Parliament voted against taking part, denying him a normally reliable ally. Other allies said they wanted U.N. authorization in the form of a Security Council resolution before they would join a coalition. The president then asked Congress to authorize a military response in Syria but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the Russian proposal Monday provided a diplomatic opening. In a speech to the nation Tuesday night, Obama made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on Syria, challenging Congress and the American public to look at video footage of victims of the chemical attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded with an op-ed posted Wednesday night on the New York Times' website, saying ""there is every reason to believe"" Syrian troops weren't responsible, while challenging Washington and the idea of ""American exceptionalism."" His remarks provoked a strong reaction in the United States, with some U.S. politicians deeming them insulting and sickening. But rather than step back, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov fired back by claiming Washington was ""unaccustomed (to) competition"" in global matters and has ""grown too used to patting everyone on the back patronizingly."" Other questions loom in Washington. One has to do with the Syrian opposition, some of whom are already receiving U.S.-funded weapons and ammunition, according to a U.S. official. Yet there's some questions about the mix of moderates and Islamist extremists among the rebels, including some who are affiliated with al Qaeda. Then there's the issue of Syria's chemical weapons themselves, and whether it's possible to track all of them down. Some U.S. intelligence analysts believe it's known where most of Syria's stockpile is stored, according to two U.S. officials familiar with internal discussions. But others say the United States might not be able to verify the location of up to 50% of them. 7-year-old's story shows pain, worry of Syrian refugees .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate has taken up the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a measure that would protect gay, lesbian and transgender employees in the workplace. While the measure has many obstacles to overcome before it would become law, the Senate's action to take up debate is historic, coming after decades of failure. Here's a look at how it got here: . 1974: The notion of protecting gay and lesbian workers in the workplace first surfaced in 1974, fueled by the Stonewall Rebellion five years earlier. The resistance by LGBT patrons at the Stonewall Inn by New York City police in 1969 shed a light on widespread discrimination and harassment. New York Reps. Bella Abzug and Ed Koch introduced broad anti-discrimination legislation in the House of Representatives that covered discriminatory practices in housing, the workplace and public institutions. It went nowhere. 1994: Twenty years later, in 1994, the fight for workplace protections began in earnest. The first version of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act was introduced in the House and the Senate. While it made discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation illegal, it did not include protections for transgender workers. 1996: Just two years later, the Senate took up the legislation. It failed, barely. The vote was 49-50. Vice President Al Gore waited in the wings to cast a tie-breaking vote. But Arkansas Sen. David Pryor, the father of the current Sen. Mark Pryor, was unable to attend the vote. 2007: The next time ENDA would receive a vote was in 11 years later. This time, the House took it up and passed it. This version, just like the Senate bill in 1996, did not offer protections for transgender workers; it just covered sexual orientation. The measure was placed on the Senate calendar but never made it to a vote. 2008: Barack Obama was elected to the presidency after campaigning for workplace protections for the LGBT community. Advocates had high hopes. 2009: Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, passed the torch to newly elected Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon. It was an issue Kennedy had been working on, but, with his health failing, he asked Merkley to take up the initiative. Kennedy chose Merkley because he was speaker of the Oregon State House when the state version of ENDA passed. October 2009: Congress passed the first federal legislation to offer protections to transgender people. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act updated the federal hate crimes law to include crimes against ""actual or perceived"" gay and transgender people. December 2010: Just over a month after the midterm elections, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law a repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" a President Bill Clinton-era initiative that prohibited openly lesbian and gay people from serving in the military. 2011: Merkley continued to work on ENDA. He approached newly elected Sen. Ron Kirk, R-Illinois, to work on a bipartisan bill. Kirk supported the ENDA legislation as a congressman in 2007. 2011: The Obama administration announced it would stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA made it illegal for states to recognize same-sex marriages. Opponents of the President's decision challenged the administration, leading to the Supreme Court case United States v. Windsor. April 2012: With just more than six months until Election Day, Obama told LGBT advocates that he would not sign an executive order that would prohibit federal contracts from discriminating against gay and transgender workers. It was a major disappointment to the activists. Essentially it was ENDA for federal contractors. At the time, Tico Almeida, president of the group Freedom to Work, said this executive order was an easy initiative. It was ""the low-hanging fruit,"" he said. May 2012: Just a month later, Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage. While he is the first president to do so, he did indicate that he would not push for federal legislation and said it's a matter best left to the states. February 2013: Congress passed an updated version of the Violence Against Women Act that included protections for gay and transgender people. June 2013: The Supreme Court struck down DOMA, calling it unconstitutional. July 2013: The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee voted ENDA out of committee, with the support of three Republicans. Sens. Kirk, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Orrin Hatch of Utah all voted for it, improving the legislation's chances. October 2013: All 53 Democrats and both Democratic-leaning independents confirmed their support for the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that he would bring the measure up for a vote. November 4, 2013: House Speaker John Boehner has announced his opposition. ""The speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small-business jobs,"" spokesman Michael Steel said. November 4, 2013: The Senate passed a key procedural vote that enables the upper chamber to take up the legislation. It's the first time the Senate has taken it up since 1996 and the first time it has included protections for transgender people.

"(CNN) -- Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim Pernetti has resigned in the wake of a basketball player abuse scandal, saying that he regretted not fighting the school's decision to initially suspend, rather than fire, men's head coach Mike Rice last year. The resignation announced Friday by the university's president came the same day that former NBA player Eric Murdock filed a lawsuit against Rutgers, alleging he was fired as the team's director of player development for blowing the whistle on Rice. Rice was dismissed Wednesday after ESPN aired a video showing him shoving and berating player . ESPN got the video from Murdock. The school says he was let go for ""insubordinate conduct"" unrelated to the video, according to ESPN. Pernetti came under fire this week for not taking more serious disciplinary action against Rice. In his resignation letter, Pernetti wrote that his ""first instincts"" after seeing the video last year, months before ESPN aired it, ""was to fire him (Rice) immediately."" ""However, Rutgers decided to follow a process involving university lawyers, human resources professionals, and outside counsel,"" Pernetti wrote. ""Following review of the independent investigative report, the consensus was that university policy would not justify dismissal. ""I have admitted my role in, and regret for, that decision, and wish that I had the opportunity to go back and override it for the sake of everyone involved."" The video initially had earned Rice a three-game suspension, a $75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes. ""There's no explanation for what's on those videos because there's no excuse for it,"" Rice told CNN affiliate WABC after he was fired. Still, he will walk away with a $100,000 longevity bonus, according to the university. ESPN, which aired the video Tuesday, said it shows practice sessions shot between 2010 and 2012 in which the coach also threw basketballs at players. ""You f**king fairy ... you're a f**king fa**ot,"" Rice appears to say during one session. Rice had just ended his third year as the Scarlet Knights' coach with a record of 44-51, and was under contract through the 2014-2015 season. On Friday, Rutgers President Robert Barchi also announced the resignation of John Wolf, the school's interim senior vice president and general counsel. Barchi, who has come under fire for not taking swifter action against Rice, said he did not see the video when it was initially brought to the attention of the school's athletic department. The first time he saw it, he said, was when the video clip aired this week. ""I'm certain the situation would have had a very different outcome had I done so,"" Barchi told reporters. Assistant coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day the school fired Rice. According to the lawsuit, Murdock is suing the university for violating New Jersey's employment law, violating his contract and creating a hostile work environment after he accused the former head coach of violating the school's anti-bullying policies put in place after the suicide of Tyler Clementi two years ago. Clementi, a student at Rutgers, leaped from the George Washington Bridge in September 2010 after learning his roommate, Dharun Ravi, used a webcam to stream his sexual encounter with another man. Murdock alleges in the lawsuit he first notified the university about Rice's behavior last summer and in November supplied Rutgers officials with a copy of a video that culled together a number of allegedly abusive incidents involving the head coach. ""Despite having been in possession of such video footage, the university and its representatives inexplicably chose to ignore ... Rice's unlawful conduct,'' the lawsuit said. Murdock's attorney, Barry Kozyra, told reporters Friday that he and Murdock at the time told the university that Rice should step down. When asked about the lawsuit, Barchi declined to comment, citing ""an ongoing legal situation."" Earlier this week, Pernetti had said he made a mistake in favoring suspension for the head coach. ""I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice,"" Pernetti said in a written statement. ""Dismissal and corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong."" It was a surprising end to Pernetti's tenure at Rutgers, where he was heralded only last year for his role in moving the university into the powerhouse Big Ten Conference, which will begin in 2014. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Mark Norman and Jason Durand contributed to this report.","NEW: Ex-Rutgers team official files a whistleblower lawsuit .

"(CNN) -- More than 30,000 people have fled their homes ahead of an expected eruption of the Mayon volcano in the central Philippines, the Red Cross said Wednesday. Philippine authorities have said a large-scale eruption of the 2,464-meter (8,077-foot) peak is imminent, and have begun trying to evacuate about 50,000 people living around the nation's most active volcano. Gwendolyn Pang, the secretary-general of the Philippine Red Cross, said the ground around the mountain shook several times Wednesday. Emergency workers have so far evacuated 30,751 people, with 21 centers set up to take in the evacuees, she said. People in surrounding Albay province have flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon since the mountain began oozing fiery lava and belching clouds of ash this week. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised its alert level for the Mayon volcano Monday night, warning that a full-scale eruption could occur ""within weeks to days."" The volcano, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the Philippine capital Manila, has gone off 49 times since the first documented eruption in 1616. See an iReporter's video and photos of Mayon . The Philippines is in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns. It's last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has emitted ash and spewed lava but remained restless.","Large-scale eruption of Mayon Volcano imminent, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- Just one week ago Republicans were united, railing against the man-made evil known as Obamacare. They hated it so much, they said, they would tie the funding of the government to the defunding of the dread program. Sure, they had tried more than 40 times to get rid of the plan before, but they had never done this: Attach the plan to kill it to a must-pass piece of legislation. It was an idea born of necessity, some now tell me. Republicans in the House had been hit over the head in their districts by ads run by conservative political action committees (paging Sen. Ted Cruz, who appeared in some). The rap against them: They had not worked hard enough to slay the evil dragon. The charge, having been plastered all over TV, was leveled against them at town hall meetings over the summer. They came back to Washington very angry at Cruz and Company. And in survival mode. So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched. Never mind that House Speaker John Boehner was already on the record saying he didn't want to do that. He had no choice but to capitulate: If he didn't adopt the strategy, he would face a revolt. Who wants that when you're just back from summer vacation? So defunding Obamacare became the new war cry. It passed the House, went to the Senate, where Cruz then promptly told reporters it would die. At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign. He had left them out on a limb. ""He's a demagogue,"" one senior House Republican told me, then going on to detail how Cruz was shooting ""his own team from behind"" and other choice descriptions. So Cruz had no choice but to mount his own faux-filibuster, which went nowhere. The Senate passed a clean bill to fund the government, and the rest is history. But a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage: The president decided not to cave, and Republicans treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement. But something else happened, too. The health care exchanges -- the heart of Obamacare -- came online, and it was a mess. The White House that had been lauded for its technical acumen suddenly looked like a bunch of Luddites. The system crashed, bobbed and frustrated. The White House refused to release reliable numbers so the public's level of participation could be gauged. It landed with one big thud, which would have been a big problem for the administration, except for this: Nobody was talking about it, because the country was preoccupied with the shutdown. So Republicans had accomplished the seemingly impossible: They trampled their own message on Obamacare. They finally had a great hook. But what were they doing instead? Scrambling to find ways to re-fund parts of the government to curb public outrage. Great strategy. Oh, and by the way, we could wind up paying all of those furloughed workers. Sure, this isn't their fault. But look at it this way: A government drowning in red ink is paying people not to work. Another great moment. All of which brings us up to date in this dysfunctional story. So Obamacare had a crashing start, the government is shut down, and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away. And the debt ceiling, as you know by now, is the bigger problem: no Social Security checks, no Medicare, high interest rates, and on and on. Everyone -- save for some debt ceiling deniers -- believes it can't happen. So what to do? If you look closely here, you will see that something very profound has changed: Republicans seem to have pressed the delete key on talk of defunding Obamacare. They can't get it done. Their poll numbers are tanking. They're panicking. And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)? So Boehner, no fool, carefully turned the page on all of this, moving to the terra firma he always wanted to be on in the first place: deficit reduction. Tie a package of spending cuts to raising the debt ceiling, he says. That's what has always been done. We are being reasonable about this. No, says the president. You're not being reasonable. You tried to kill my health reform bill, so no negotiation until you fund the government and raise the debt ceiling without anything attached. In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes. But the House GOP scheme, abetted by Cruz and outside conservatives, will become a case for the civics classes. A study of the newly perverse politics of our time, and how a government was brought to its knees over a fight only a few wanted to wage -- that everyone secretly knew could never be won. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: Republicans have quietly abandoned strategy to defund Obamacare .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps money can't buy happiness. A recent Gallup report shows that Singapore's wealthy population is the unhappiest -- less happy than the populations of Iraq, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Syria. Singaporeans were least likely to report having positive emotions-- despite the fact that they enjoy one of the highest per capita GDP values in the world. The international pollster measured ""positive emotions."" Carried out last year in 148 countries, the survey asked around 1,000 persons in each country five questions about what positive experiences people had had the day before: if they had been well-rested, treated with respect, if they smiled or laughed a lot, and whether they'd done or learnt something interesting. In Singapore, only 46% of the interviewed answered ""yes"" to these questions, compared with 55% reported from people in Haiti and Afghanistan. Even in Syria, where the uprisings that later developed into a civil war took place in 2011, 60% of the people asked answered yes to the survey's questions. Economists in the United States have found that domestically, income only affects daily happiness when earning up to $75,000 annually. A higher income than that doesn't make much of a difference for American citizens' well-being, Gallup wrote. The population that reported the most positive emotions was Panama, a country with a per capita GDP ranking 90th in the world. In fact, eight out of the 10 happiest countries in the survey are located in Latin America. As for Singapore, this is not the first time it has come in last in a Gallup poll.

"(CNN) -- A new era is beginning in the Philippines -- or you could call it the continuation of a political dynasty. Benigno Aquino III has been sworn in as president, the country's 15th, after winning election in May by a landslide. He secured more than 15 million votes, about 5.7 million more than his closest competitor, one-time president Joseph Estrada, in a vote viewed as a litmus test for the country's democracy. There were nine candidates in all. You can associate Aquino with a familiar color -- yellow. He is the son of two revered figures in Philippine life, former president Corazon Aquino and her husband, Benigno. The elder Benigno, an opposition leader, was shot dead upon return from exile in the United States in 1983, as he attempted to lead a movement to push longtime dictator Ferdinand Marcos out of power. Upon his death, the push for reform fell to his initially reluctant wife, who won support for her ""People Power"" movement while wearing her signature yellow clothing. Amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a military mutiny, the U.S. withdrew its support for Marcos, and he sought exile in Hawaii. Corazon Aquino served from 1986 to 1992, fighting against poverty and the country's massive debt, while contending with a Marxist insurgency and seven coup attempts. She managed to reform the country's constitution, imposing a single six-year term for presidents. Corazon Aquino died last year. Enter the younger Aquino, who like her, sports signature yellow clothing and talks of restoring power to the people. He takes office after three other presidents who followed his mother, Fidel Ramos, Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. At 50, he's a relatively youthful president. Critics say he's had a lackluster records as a congressman and senator. But supporters note there's been no question about his integrity, in a country where corruption is rife. Like his mother, he had to be coaxed by friends and supporters into running. But now, many Filipinos are noisily celebrating. A public holiday has been declared for the inauguration, which took place at an oceanside park in Manila, filled by a sea of people. Many wore yellow and carried banners and Philippine flags, while others constantly fanned themselves in the heat. The inauguration also attracted dignitaries from throughout the region. Aquino vows to fight corruption, and supporters say he'll provide a contrast to the unpopular Arroyo, who was often accused of turning a blind eye to it. He'll only be able to serve for six years, under the reform introduced by his mother. But Benigno Aquino already has made some waves, naming a retired Supreme Court chief justice to lead a truth commission that will look for graft and possibly prosecute Arroyo. He also promises to scrutinize the budget to make sure no funds are being lost to corruption. And he's said he wants peace talks to end decades-long communist and Islamist insurgencies. Despite big ambitions, Aquino, a bachelor, has a reputation for quiet modesty. ""Don't let me start out having an inflated sense of my own worth or my ego, not having my feet planted firmly on the ground,"" he said in April, ""because I might succumb to the same temptations that those who are criticizing me have done.""","NEW: Benigno Aquino III sworn in as the Philippines' 15th president .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Former NFL defensive back Paul Oliver, who committed suicide last week in his Georgia home, shot himself in the head in front of his wife and two young sons, the police report on the incident said. The report, obtained by CNN, said Oliver, 29, was depressed about the end of his career and marital issues. He hadn't played pro football since the 2011 season. ""Paul has been somewhat depressed over being released, and ending his professional football career,"" his wife, Chelsea Oliver, told police in the report. She also said the couple had been having problems. Her husband was unhappy with their relationship, she said, and had started talking about a divorce. Chelsea Oliver told Cobb County Police that her husband, who played six seasons in the NFL with the San Diego Chargers, had made statements in the past about wanting to end his life. But, the report says, ""He was never specific and the police have never been called regarding any suicide threats or attempts."" On September 24, Chelsea Oliver said her husband had been drinking alcohol and the two argued. ""They had an argument and Paul shoved Chelsea while they were in their garage. Chelsea was not injured. She did not call police about their argument or about her being shoved,"" the report said. A tale of two former NFL players -- and their brains . At that point, Chelsea Oliver took their two sons, ages 2 and 1, and went for a walk in the neighborhood. When they returned, the couple started arguing again. She told police that the family was standing in the foyer of their home, when Paul Oliver jumped over the baby gate and ran up the staircase. He went into the bedroom and came back holding a handgun. According to the report, Paul Oliver told his wife that he was going to do it ""in front of her."" NFL and ex-players reach deal in concussion lawsuit . He pointed the gun toward the ceiling and fired one round, startling the family, the report said. Then he began walking down the stairs, put the handgun to the side of his head and fired one round. He fell the rest of the way down the stairs into the baby gate. Police recovered a .40 caliber Glock Model 22 handgun at the scene. There was nothing there to indicate foul play, the investigating officer wrote in the report. Patrick Oliver, Paul Oliver's brother, was supposed to meet the former football player for dinner. He was nearly at Paul Oliver's neighborhood when Paul called, telling him to ""go home."" He could tell that Paul was upset, but he didn't think he was going to harm himself, Patrick Oliver told police. Former NFL player wants brain studied . No one from Paul Oliver's family has responded to CNN's phone calls about the incident. Oliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2011, recording 144 tackles in 57 games. He also had a stellar college career at the University of Georgia. His death marks the latest in a string of suicides among former professional football players. In some cases, the players were found to have suffered previously from brain injuries, but it's not known if that had anything to do with Oliver's case. Star NFL linebacker Junior Seau was 43 when he took his own life in May 2012. The National Institutes of Health later found he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head. Former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, 62, committed suicide in April 2012. An autopsy found signs of CTE. A study published in December in the journal Brain looked at brain tissue of 34 professional football players after they died. All but one showed evidence of disease.

"(CNN) -- They were sons and daughters, with their whole lives ahead of them. Until -- for reasons no one has yet explained -- their lives came to a horrific, bloody halt on a rural road on Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau. Dominic Davis, 17 . Davis was new to Tennessee, having recently moved from Colorado with his family ""to make life better,"" Cumberland County's school district explained in information distributed to the media. But in his short time here, school superintendent Donald Andrews told CNN, ""They had endeared themselves to the community."" A sophomore at Cumberland County High School, where he was well-liked and respected, Davis loved art, music and sports, especially basketball. Academically, his goal was modest -- to pass all his classes with at least a C. But in life, as he wrote in a class assignment, it was deeper and loftier: ""I want to be remembered not as the best man alive, but the most respected."" Suspect detained in Tennessee . Steven Presley, 17 . Presley used to miss class often. But his attendance was perfect after transferring to The Phoenix School, where he stood out -- and was singled out -- as an example that students could change and improve their lives. And Presley made others' lives better in the process. The school district described him as ""always happy, smiling, funny, kindhearted, sweet and polite,"" the type pf person ""who would do anything for anyone (and) was loved by all who knew him."" He graduated from The Phoenix School in May. By then, Presley had already made a big impression with people from all walks of life who were lucky enough to cross his path. ""He reached out to those that no one else would,"" according to staff cited by the school district, ""and treated everyone as a friend."" John Lajeunesse, 16 . Lajeunesse had attended Cumberland County and Stone Memorial High School before settling in more recently as a home-schooled student. Outside of academics, his interests weren't atypical for a teen growing up in rural Tennessee. He liked to go four-wheeling, loved to skateboard and wanted to spend more time hunting than he could, said Michael Rick, who lives with his family. Rick described Lajeunesse as very loving toward his family, dedicating himself to his mother, sister and baby niece. If he'd lived one month more, Lajeunesse would have turned 17. But for reasons those close to him are grappling to fathom, his loved ones are now mourning instead of celebrating. Said Rick: ""He was only 16. He was just getting out to live life."" Lajeunesse's younger sister, Katie, said she would miss the usual brother-sister stuff, like arguing with him. ""He never stayed in one place. He was always on the go,"" Katie, 15, said. ""He was sweet, he made it fun."" Rikki Jacobsen, 22 . The Cumberland County school district offered the least information on Jacobsen, beyond that she was the mother of a student attending an elementary school in the system. That child, a son, was Jacobsen's life, according to a friend. ""She loved her little boy more than life itself,"" said the friend, who asked not be named because they had not been friends for too long. ""She talked about her child a lot. That's what saddens me the most."" In fact, Jacobsen was chatty. ""She was very nice, she was innocent, and she couldn't stop talking,"" her friend said. ""She had something to say about every topic.""","Four people -- three teenagers and a young mother -- are found shot dead in Tennessee .

"(CNN) -- It was a dark secret. The kind that destroys lives, devastates families and decimates faith. Nobody shared it with Valerie Spruill while her husband was alive. For years after his death, she heard bits of the story. It was something about an absentee father, something about her husband. None of it made sense, she said. That's not until her uncle finally told her what no one else had: She had unknowingly married the father she never knew. ""It is devastating. It can destroy you,"" Spruill told CNN late Thursday by telephone. ""It almost did."" Spruill, 60, of Doylestown, Ohio, went public with her story this month, first published in the Akron Beacon Journal, with the hopes that it would help others facing what seem like insurmountable problems. It's a story that has gone viral, attracting attention as faraway as Australia and India where the questions are always the same, she says: How could that happen? WCPO: How a woman unwittingly married her father . It's a question that Spruill said she has been grappling with since she first learned the truth in 2004, six years after her husband Percy Spruill died. ""I don't know if he ever knew or not. That conversation didn't come up,"" she said. ""I think if he did know, there is no way he could have told me."" She confirmed that her husband was indeed her father through a DNA test, hair taken from one of his brushes. The aftermath of the secret was devastating emotionally -- and physically, Spruill suffered two strokes and was diagnosed with diabetes. All of it, she believes was brought on by learning the family secret. ""Pain and stress will kill, and I had to release my stress,"" Spruill said. ""I'm just telling the story to release my pain."" Stress may harm brain - but it recovers . She has a deep, abiding faith in God, who she believes has guided her through the experience -- and others that have shaped her life. ""You have to have faith,"" she said. ""If God brought me this far, he's not going to leave me now."" Spruill met and married her husband-father in Akron and settled in Doylestown, a working class suburb of about 2,300. It was her second marriage. Spruill was a nice man, a good provider. He was kind to her three children from her previous marriage. ""We had a good life,"" she said. She initially struggled with anger, with hating Spruill for what happened. But therapy taught her what happened wasn't her fault. Her faith taught her to forgive. Initial response to her story has been mixed: ""More positive than negative,"" she says. In recent days, she has been in contact with a couple who found out after they were married that they were brother and sister. They told her, she said, that her story is helping them deal with their own experience. ""They are trying to be friends now,"" Spruill said. Others, though, have been less kind. ""They've said things like 'Some secrets should stay secrets,'"" she said. ""I can't do anything about what they think. I just know what I think. God is always mighty, and he teaches you to tell the truth no matter what."" My Faith: Suffering my way to a new tomorrow . Spruill knows not everybody tells the truth. It's a lesson she learned as a child the hard way. By all accounts, Spruill's mother got pregnant as a teenager while dating her then 15-year-old father. She was 3-months-old when she was sent to live with her grandmother and grandfather, who she initially believed as she grew up was her father. Spruill said at about age 8 or 9, she discovered that the woman who often visited the house was not a family friend but her mother. But nobody, she said, talked about her father. There's nobody left to give her the answers about her husband-father. Her mother, Christine, died in 1984. Her grandparents have long since passed. So, too, have a number of Percy Spruill's relatives. Spruill knows her mother worked as a prostitute and even got caught up in the 1980 high-profile corruption scandal surrounding James Barbuto, a probate judge who was convicted of intimidating investigators and gross sexual imposition for attacking a courthouse clerk in his chambers. ""My mother showed me lots of love. All said and done, I have no regrets in my life at all,"" she said. She believes she has siblings or half-siblings from Spruill's previous relationships, including the one with her mother. She said she wants to find them and let them know they are not alone. Siblings heal family rifts through therapy . Spruill, herself, has three children and eight grandchildren. She struggled with telling her children that the man they believed was their step-father was their grandfather. A therapist ""advised me to tell my kids,"" she said. ""I told them about two years ago. They are remarkable. They are handling it better than I am."" In recent days, shortly before the news broke, she also told her grandchildren. ""They have been so supportive. They are telling me they love me, telling me they will do whatever I need,"" she said. In her spare time, since retiring from the accounting department where she worked for 34 years at Goodyear, she has been writing down her story with the hopes of publishing it. ""I thank God that he gave me a chance to live through all of this,"" she said. ""It is nothing short of a miracle that I'm still here. I want people to know that they can survive something like this.""","Valerie Spruill, 60, found out her husband was her father in 2004 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 19 people have been stung to death by hornets -- which may include the world's largest hornet species Vespa mandarinia -- in China's central Shaanxi province in the last three months, according to the city government of Ankang, the apparent epicenter of a recent spate of fatalities and injuries. A total of 583 people in the area have been stung by hornets since July 1, say city officials. Seventy victims are still recovering in hospitals. Chen Changlin was hospitalized after being attacked by hornets, while harvesting rice last week. ""I ran and shouted for help, but the hornets chased me about 200 meters, and stung me for more than 3 minutes,"" he recounted to the state-run China Youth Daily. Chen said hornets had first swarmed a woman and child working nearby, who then ran towards him. Both later died from the hornets' toxins. ""The more you run, the more they want to chase you,"" said another victim, whose kidneys were ravaged by the venom. When he was admitted to the hospital, his urine was the color of soy sauce, according to local reports. Earlier this month, 30 people -- including 23 primary school children aged between six and eight years -- were injured in a hornet attack in Guangxi province, south of Shaanxi. Their teacher, Li Zhiqiang, told his students to hide under tables as he tried to drive away the insects before he lost consciousness. The school's headmaster told local media that most of the injured suffered stings to their heads, necks, hands and feet. Nearly 60 students and teachers were injured in a separate incident in the province at the start of the month, according to state media. Experts say a number of reasons may have contributed to the apparent increase in hornet activity, including the region's recent hot, dry weather, land development and hornet sensitivity to the smell of people. The Asian killer hornet, which is suspected in these incidents, are formidable, carnivorous killers, according to the non-profit Honeybee Conservancy. The species feed their young with the larvae of other insects and use their talons and mandibles to sever the limbs and heads of their prey. The hornet's venom sting is a neurotoxin so powerful that it dissolves human tissue, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. This week's latest incidents spurred the Ankang city government to hold an emergency video call addressing local concerns. Vice Mayor Lu Qi said he would increase investment in regional hornet control. Mayor Xu Qifang added the city would establish a 24-hour emergency hornet response team. Journalist Ramy Inocencio wrote in Hong Kong and Ke Feng contributed to this article from Beijing.","At least 19 people have been stung to death by hornets in southern China .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Dozens have died in Iraq in explosions primarily targeting amusement parks where families and children typically go to celebrate the Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha, according to police. At least 34 people died and 122 were wounded Monday in the series of car-bomb and roadside explosions across Baghdad, police officials said. At least 10 car bombs and three roadside bombs exploded in several Baghdad neighborhoods . In the northern town of Muwafakiya, a car bomb killed 17 people and wounded at least 66 in a refugee compound, police said. The explosion caused buildings to collapse, trapping victims under rubble. The town is 20 miles east of Mosul. Seven children were among the dead, police said. The compound was home to displaced members of an ethnic Shiite minority and is near a Shiite mosque. Sunni extremist groups such al Qaeda have been targeting the minority in Nineveh province in recent months, police said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The air traffic controller suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has told investigators that he had fallen asleep, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The controller, a 20-year veteran, ""indicated that he had fallen asleep for a period of time while on duty,"" according to a statement released Thursday by the safety board. ""He had been working his fourth consecutive overnight shift (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.)."" ""Human fatigue issues are one of the areas being investigated,"" the statement read. Federal Aviation Administration chief Randy Babbitt said earlier Thursday that the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident and that the air traffic controller has been suspended from all operational duties. An FAA official speaking on background said the controller was given a drug test after the incident. The official said the drug test was ""standard procedure"" and did not know the results. The situation began at 12:10 a.m. Wednesday, when an American Airlines plane attempted to call the tower to get clearance to land and got no answer, said Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the safety board. The plane had been in contact with a regional air traffic control facility, and a controller at that facility advised the pilot that he, too, had been unable to contact anyone at the tower, according to a recording of air control traffic at the website liveatc.net. ""1012,"" the controller said, using the airline's flight number, ""called a couple of times on landline and tried to call on the commercial line, and there's no answer. ""The tower is apparently unmanned."" Apparently asked why by a pilot, the controller later responded, ""Well, I'm going to take a guess and say that the controller got locked out. I've heard of this happening before. Fortunately, it's not very often,"" he said. Knudson said the plane landed without incident in a situation termed an ""uncontrolled airport."" About 15 minutes later, a United Airlines flight also failed to reach the tower but landed without any problems, he said. After that, the controller in the tower was back in communication. Knudson said one controller was staffing the tower at the time this occurred. The controller's admission that he was asleep during the landing emergency underscores concerns about the effect of fatigue on underslept controllers at work. In 2007, then-NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker wrote in a letter to the FAA that four plane incidents ""provide clear and compelling evidence"" that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods. ""That fatigue has contributed to controller errors,"" Rosenker wrote. The incidents cited by the NTSB were: . -- A March 23, 2006, incident in which a Chicago air traffic controller cleared a plane to take off from a runway on which, 15 seconds earlier, he had cleared another aircraft to cross. The pilot of the departing plane stopped when he saw the other craft in the taxiway intersection. The controller told investigators he had slept only four hours during a nine-hour break between shifts. -- An August 19, 2004, incident in which a Los Angeles controller cleared one passenger jet to take off and another to land on a runway at the same time. The pilot in the landing aircraft noticed the other on the runway and pulled his plane up 12 seconds before they would have collided. The controller said he had slept five or 6 hours before coming to work. -- A September 25, 2001, incident in which a Denver air traffic controller approved a request from a cargo plane pilot to take off from a runway that had been closed for construction. The aircraft came within 32 feet of hitting lights that had been installed in the construction zone. The controller said he'd slept only two hours between work days. -- A July 8, 2001, incident in which a Denver controller cleared one passenger plane to cross a runway where another was about to land. The landing pilot hit the brakes, stopping 810 feet from the other plane. The controller said he had worked three shifts in two days. Of the most recent incident, Babbitt said, ""In my 25 years as a professional airline pilot, I've never seen anything happen like this. ""I am outraged by it,"" Babbitt said. ""We're going to make sure something like this never happens again."" Babbitt stressed that, because of a backup system, neither plane was out of ""positive radar contact, nor were they out of communication with the FAA, thus allowing both to land safely. ""That said ... this should not have happened,"" Babbitt said. ""We should not have had this gap in communication. We had to rely on a backup system, which shouldn't have happened."" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood ordered the FAA on Wednesday to schedule two controllers on the overnight shift. ""It is not acceptable to have just one controller in the tower managing air traffic in this critical air space. I have also asked ... Babbitt to study staffing levels at other airports around the country,"" he said. Knudson said it's not uncommon for planes to land at uncontrolled airports. He said control towers at some fields across the country shut down for the night, and planes still land. However, he could not comment on whether that practice was ever used at Reagan National. The American Airlines flight, which was coming from Miami, had 91 passengers and six crew members aboard, airline spokesman Ed Martelle said. The United Airlines flight was arriving from Chicago with 63 passengers and five crew members, spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said. American Airlines had no comment on the situation, saying it was leaving it to the FAA to handle. United Airlines noted that the National Transportation Safety Board is reviewing the incident, and McCarthy said the airline is conducting its own review. CNN's Carol Cratty and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Air traffic controller is given a ""standard"" drug test .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lamar Odom's lawyer on Wednesday entered a ""not guilty"" plea for the basketball star on a driving under the influence charge, a court spokeswoman said. Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, was not in court for the arraignment at the Van Nuys branch of Los Angeles County Superior Court. The basketball star was arrested in the early morning hours of August 30 by a California Highway Patrol officer who reported seeing Odom, 33, driving his white Mercedes SUV in a ""serpentine manner at 50 mph."" Odom ""showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests,"" a CHP news release said. The judge set a pretrial hearing for 8:30 a.m. November 8. Odom's lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice. ""I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one,"" Odom told reporters then. Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations when rumors surfaced days before his arrest that her husband was addicted to pain medications. ""Really hard to sit here and listen to people talk (expletive) about my family! (Expletive) you and shame on you! I'm too protective for this (expletive)!"" the reality figure tweeted on August 25.

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court has excused Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta from his ""continuing presence"" at his upcoming trial on charges of crimes against humanity. The excuse ""is strictly for purposes of accommodating the discharge of his duties as the President of Kenya."" the court said Friday. The ICC is based at The Hague in the Netherlands. Kenyatta must be ""physically present"" in court during opening and closing statements, ""when victims present their views and concerns in person,"" ""the delivery of judgment in the case,"" and, ""if applicable,"" sentencing hearings, the court ruled. The trial is scheduled to begin on November 12. The charges stem from violence that plagued a disputed presidential election six years ago. More than 1,000 people died after and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates in the December 2007 election torched homes and hacked rivals to death. The ICC has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks. A third suspect, radio personality Joshua arap Sang, is being tried alongside Ruto on similar charges.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. House Speaker Tom Foley died at his home in Washington, D.C., his wife Heather confirmed Friday. Foley, 84, was a Democrat who represented Washington state in the House for 30 years and served as speaker from 1989 to January 1995. After his tenure on Capitol Hill, he was appointed U.S. ambassador to Japan by President Bill Clinton. He served from 1997 to 2001. Foley became the 57th speaker in 1989 after then-Speaker James Wright resigned from office amid an ethics scandal. Before taking that post, Foley served as House majority leader, majority whip and Agriculture Committee chairman, and was an influential member of the Select House Committee on Iran Contra. He was first elected to the House in 1964, beating incumbent Republican Walt Horan, a 27-year veteran of the House. Foley's career in Congress ended when he was defeated in 1994, the year Republicans retook the House in what is sometimes known as the ""Republican Revolution."" He was succeeded as speaker by then-Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Current House Speaker John Boehner on Friday said Foley's rise to speaker was a ""natural sequence for a natural leader."" ""Forthright and warmhearted, Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle,"" Boehner said in a written statement. ""That had a lot to do with his solid sense of fairness, which remains a model for any Speaker or representative."" President Barack Obama said in a statement that Foley had a ""straightforward approach"" and represented his constituents with ""skill, dedication, and a deep commitment to improving the lives of those he was elected to serve."" Former President George H.W. Bush said that Foley ""represented the very best in public service -- and our political system"" and ""never got personal or burned bridges."" Foley had a largely liberal record in Congress, supporting Great Society programs and opposing the Vietnam War. He was pro-abortion rights, backed the Equal Rights Amendment and opposed capital punishment, as well as a constitutional amendment allowing school prayer. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Foley had an ""unrivaled ability"" to build consensus and find common ground in the House. ""Our country mourns the loss of a leader whose authenticity, dedication, and diplomacy will forever serve as an example to all of us who strive to make a difference through public service,"" Pelosi said in a written statement. Foley graduated from the University of Washington in 1951 and from Washington Law School in 1957. In his legal career, he served as assistant attorney general for Washington state and deputy prosecutor in Spokane County. Before running for Congress, Foley worked as a special counsel to the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee from 1961 to 1964.

Nintendo's DS-Lite: Breaking into markets beyond traditional gamers . ""Brain Training,"" or ""Brain Age"" as it's known in North America, is a collection of quick-fire maths quizzes, anagrams, music recitals and memory tests developed by Nintendo with Japanese neuroscientist Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. The game is part of Nintendo's attempt to widen the appeal of its game consoles, especially the cute little DS-Lite, beyond typical gamers -- in this case, to an older audience concerned with its health. ""Exercise is the key to good health both for body and mind,"" says the company's U.S. Web site. ""Playing regularly for just a few minutes a day has been found to stimulate parts of the brain related to thinking, creativity and concentration,"" claims the Nintendo Europe Web site. And the tactic is working: with over 10 million copies of ""Brain Training"" and ""More Brain Training"" sold worldwide, and with celebrity endorsements from Nicole Kidman and Patrick Stewart, Dr. Kawashima and his brain exercises have become a global phenomenon. But does Nintendo's ""Brain Training"" actually make you smarter? The expert's opinion . I spoke to Dr. Lauren Stewart, a cognitive neuroscientist at Goldsmiths, University of London, to find out what improvements I could expect to see in my brain. She reveals that it is hard to measure the impact that brain training could have on my day-to-day life. ""It is a complex thing to determine whether learning on one thing transfers to another thing,"" she explains. But can training on certain tasks make you smarter? ""It depends what we think being smart is all about,"" she says, adding that if the tasks were similar to IQ tests, I might see a small increase in my IQ. Dr. Stewart does point to research that suggests exercising one's brain does work -- and might even help to prevent those dreaded ""senior moments."" ""Learning of any kind does forge new neuronal connections,"" she reveals. ""Evidence seems to support the 'use it or lose it' mantra with respect to staving off neuronal degeneration in old age."" And Dr. Stewart is keen to dispel the myth that once we're adults, we're too old to learn. ""There are numerous examples of learning in adulthood and structural brain changes accompanying this,"" she says. So now it's down to me. Attracted by the prospect of a lean, mean, mind machine, I decided to put it to a three-week test. Watch out Kidman, here I come... Day 1 The DS-Lite arrives in the afternoon. Mmm, shiny! I test my brain age: it's 41, considerably older than my actual age, and far from a ""perfect"" age of 20. I sigh. Will I ever be as smart as Patrick Stewart? I work through the exercises. They're surprisingly fun, pandering as they do to my inner dork tendencies. Day 2 I play the brain training games on the subway and equal or improve my scores. ""What an improvement! I could almost cry!"" says Dr. Kawashima. I'm not quite so excited. I become so engrossed in ""Brain Training"" that I nearly miss my stop, leap off the train, stylus and console in hand, and stand at the bottom of the escalators trying to complete a game. My fellow commuters -- quite rightly -- throw me pitying looks. I'm so flustered I leave the tube station by the wrong exit and end up wandering dazedly around central London, trying to find my office. Worse still, my brain age is still a less-than-sprightly 40. Brain training? Brain draining! Day 3 Following yesterday's mishaps, I rule out brain age checks on the subway. My brain age drops to 30. Result! Day 5 After a stressful weekend moving house, I kick back and relax with a glass of wine and Dr. Kawashima. Big mistake! My tiredness and the alcohol leave me fumbling and just one drink raises my brain age to a wobbly 37. I cast blameful glances at the Merlot, and resolve to stay sober for testing. Day 6 I fluff the exercises, the new one's a nightmare and Dr. Kawashima is tormenting me with a 5x5 square of random numbers that I'm supposed to remember. Woe! Time to check my brain age. I expect to see it increase to 50+ on stress alone, but am amazed when, for the first time, I break through the 30 barrier! Brain age of 27: read it and weep, Kidman. Day 7 It's a week in; I zip through the exercises and tackle the test. My brain age drops again to 24. Woo hoo! Day 10 I skip a day. Day 11 Dr. Kawashima complains at me for not coming by yesterday. I'm not in the mood, but do the exercises anyway, stumbling on lots of the anagrams. My score plummets; elsewhere, I'm flatlining. I resist the urge to stab his irritating, bouncing face with my stylus and take the brain test. It seems grouchiness doesn't impact your score -- I'm back down to 27. ""Hmm, a little tired, are we?"" he says. Die, Dr. Kawashima, die. Day 14 Dr. Kawashima introduces me to a new, Tetris-style game that will, apparently, relax my brain. This is important too, I'm told. While the music is soothing, the game has me hooked. But ideal before bedtime? I'm up playing it 'til 4 a.m. Day 15 Exhausted from last night's small-hours game playing, I skip a day. Day 16 I've whittled my brain age down to 23, but by accident, I leave my DS-Lite on my desk -- no brain training in the evening, nor in the morning! I start to panic. Help! I'm addicted! Day 17 I time how long it takes me to do all the exercises and the brain age test. It's now taking half an hour a day -- a considerable chunk of my leisure time -- and I'm starting to resent that. Dr. Kawashima keeps asking me to get my friends to play with me. ""Please be sure to introduce friends and family to the quick play demo,"" he says. ""Share it with family and friends who want to try it out with no hassles!"" Sorry Doc, I don't pimp goods to my pals. Day 18 His patronizing comments are starting to get to me. ""Don't lose heart! Just try again tomorrow!"" he says, when my score drops. I want to punch him. Day 20 And then it all goes wrong. I stumble with the stylus and mess up the memory test. My brain age plummets to 37. I can't end like that! Day 21 The final day of my three week experiment. Can I redeem myself? I'm revved up for the tests and my brain age tumbles to 22 -- just two away from a perfect 20! But Dr. Kawashima seems less impressed. ""Your brain seems fairly young,"" he says. ""But with regular training, you can sharpen that brain even more!"" Is he never satisfied? I lost 15 years in a day! Perhaps I shouldn't have taken brain training quite so seriously -- after all, it's only a game... And the results? ""Brain Training"" was more fun than you'd expect, and left me feeling more confident performing certain tasks, like quick-fire maths, away from the console. My scores quickly improved as I became used to the software and the console, then leveled out. The game was surprisingly addictive and monopolized my attention. My usually yawn-filled commute zipped by; when I skipped a day's training I missed it; and, for a brief spell, my husband became a Nintendo widower. I was most taken aback by my strong emotional response to the game: when my scores improved, I felt jubilant; when they dipped, I felt distraught and stupid. But did ""Brain Training"" make me smarter? Call me a cynic, but I'm not convinced it's anything more than a cunning ploy to get non-gamers like me hooked on Nintendo's latest little console. And that certainly worked. ................................ Do you train your brain? How do you give your gray cells a workout? Share your thoughts and read others' views in the Just Imagine forum.

"(CNN) -- The next time the Avengers assemble, it'll be to face off with James Spader. The actor has been cast as the formidable foe Ultron in the next ""Avengers"" movie, Marvel announced Thursday. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" will show a more humanized -- but just as fearsome -- villain, Whedon told Entertainment Weekly. In the Marvel universe, Ultron is a sentient robot that has an incredibly wide range of abilities, coming equipped with super-speed, super-strength, flight, mind control and a coma ray, to name a few. Whedon's Ultron won't be quite as versatile, and the filmmaker is imagining a less robotic bad guy. ""I knew right away what I wanted to do with him,"" Whedon, as an admitted fan of Ultron's, has said. ""He's always trying to destroy the Avengers ... he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff. So we'll take away some of those powers because at some point everybody becomes magic, and I already have someone (a new character, Scarlet Witch) who's a witch."" We trust Whedon knows what he's doing -- this is the same guy who wrote and directed the third highest-grossing film of all time, 2012's ""The Avengers."" ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" will debut on May 1, 2015. In the meantime, Spader will be on the small-screen as well: The three-time Emmy winner stars in NBC's ""The Blacklist,"" which premieres September 23.","James Spader has been cast as the villain in the upcoming ""Avengers"" movie .

"(CNN) -- Instead of rah, rah, rah, some Florida schools are saying no, no, no -- to cheerleader skirts they say are too revealing for the classroom. The decision to ban cheerleader skirts during classroom hours is being ridiculed as short in spirit by some Pinellas County high school cheerleaders and parents. School leaders say the uniforms just aren't appropriate for classrooms and don't fit into student dress codes. Sophomore Jeana Fraser has been cheering since middle school, and she scored a spot on the Countryside High School Varsity cheerleading team this year. She told CNN affiliate WFLA that her ""shorter than mid-thigh"" skirt is a part of tradition: The football players and cheerleaders wear their uniforms each Friday during school on game day. Jeana said dressing up for game day is a way for students to get excited for the football game. Jeana's father, David Fraser, told CNN that some kids ""just don't wear as many clothes as they should,"" primarily because of the Florida heat. He said he understands administrators are in a tough spot, but that cheerleading is part of Americana. Her mother, Norma Fraser, agreed, telling WFLA the ban is ""almost un-American."" According to Pinellas County Schools spokeswoman Melanie Marquez Parra, all 16 schools in the district have a dress code, and have for some time, but Countryside is an example of a school that is increasing enforcement. Marquez Parra told CNN the emphasis should be on academics, and notes squads express their spirit during school hours at several schools in different ways. At one, cheerleaders wear their uniform tops, with sleeves, and matching bows in their hair. Countryside High School deferred all of CNN's questions to the school district. Parra said the school is still working with the cheerleading team on what will be allowed during school for this Friday's game day: One proposal is to put a Velcro attachment on the skirts to lengthen them, another is to buy the cheerleaders matching warmup pants.","Pinellas County, Florida, district bans cheerleader skirts during classroom hours .
