"By . Damien Gayle . Neanderthals had sharper eyesight and bigger bodies than our early ancestors, but these traits only contributed to their eventual downfall, new research suggests. The brains of our now-extinct evolutionary cousins had too much to do managing their vision and the physical demands of their bodies to spare a thought for building communities. That meant that the more socially adept early modern humans were better able to cope with environmental change and out-compete their Neanderthal rivals for shelter and food. Replicas of the La Ferrassie 1 Neanderthal (left) and . Predmosti 3 early modern skulls: New research claims that Neanderthals' sharp eyes and big bodies left them without enough mental capacity for . social networking . Outmatched by Homo sapiens, they eventually followed in the footsteps of the dinosaurs and became extinct. Neanderthals had already long occupied Eurasia when early modern humans began migrating out of Africa about 70,000 years ago. For a time, the two breeds of human lived side-by-side, and many experts believe they even interbred. But by around 30,000 years ago the Neanderthals had vanished. Although early modern humans and Neanderthals were similar in many ways they also had distinct differences. Neanderthals were physically bigger and stronger, their foreheads and chins sloped at more of an angle, and their noses were more pronounced. Significantly, they also had larger eyes, which may have evolved to cope with lower light levels in northern latitudes compared to the sunny plains of Africa from where our ancestors emerged. Like modern humans, they used tools and weapons, and they may also have worn ornaments and painted cave walls. However, they were culturally far less sophisticated. Not clever enough for Facebook: Like modern . humans, they used tools and weapons, and they may also have worn . ornaments and painted cave walls. However, they were culturally far less . sophisticated . The new research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, shows that Neanderthals' brains were similar in size to those of modern humans, but structured differently. Analysis of fossil data suggests that larger areas of the Neanderthal brain were devoted to vision and movement, leaving less room for the higher level thinking needed to form large social groups. 'Since Neanderthals evolved at higher latitudes and also have bigger bodies than modern humans, more of the Neanderthal brain would have been dedicated to vision and body control, leaving less brain to deal with other functions like social networking,' said lead researcher Dr Eiluned Pearce, from Oxford's Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology. 'Smaller social groups might have made Neanderthals less able to cope with the difficulties of their harsh Eurasian environments because they would have had fewer friends to help them out in times of need. 'Overall, differences in brain organisation and social cognition may go a long way towards explaining why Neanderthals went extinct whereas modern humans survived.' Social animals: Our ancestors emerged from the sunny plains of Africa, meaning they didn't need such large eyes and bodies, which gave them more mental capacity left for developing social groups . The scientists studied an array of fossils dating back 27,000 to 75,000 years, comparing the skulls of 32 anatomically modern humans with those of 13 Neanderthals. They found that Neanderthal skulls had significantly larger eye sockets than modern humans, which would once have housed larger eyes. The Oxford team analysed brain structure by looking at the shape of the skull interiors. The researchers calculated the standard size of fossil brains for body mass and visual processing requirements. They did this by using the ratio of living human body mass to fossil body mass to rescale the brains of the Neanderthals and fossil early modern humans to the body mass of an average living human. They also used the known relationship between the height of the eye socket and the size of visual brain areas in living primates to estimate how much of the brain was dedicated to visual processing in Neanderthals and modern humans. The difference between the two was then subtracted from the Neanderthal brains. This created a set of brains the size they would be if all the fossils had the same body mass as a living human and had the same sized visual brain areas. Once the differences in body and visual system size are taken into account, the researchers were able to compare how much of the brain was left over for other cognitive functions. After taking account of body mass and visual processing requirements, they were able to calculate how much of the brain was available for other mental functions. Co-author Professor Chris Stringer, head of human origins at London's Natural History Museum, said: 'The large brains of Neanderthals have been a source of debate from the time of the first fossil discoveries of this group, but getting any real idea of the ""quality"" of their brains has been very problematic. 'Hence discussion has centred on their material culture and supposed way of life as indirect signs of the level of complexity of their brains in comparison with ours. 'Our study provides a more direct approach by estimating how much of their brain was allocated to cognitive functions, including the regulation of social group size; a smaller size for the latter would have had implications for their level of social complexity and their ability to create, conserve and build on innovations.' Professor Robin Dunbar, another member of the Oxford team, said: 'Having less brain available to manage the social world has profound implications for the Neanderthals' ability to maintain extended trading networks, and are likely also to have resulted in less well developed material culture - which, between them, may have left them more exposed than modern humans when facing the ecological challenges of the Ice Ages.'","Neanderthals' brains had so much to do managing vision and their big bodies they had little capacity left for developing social groups .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 1971 Alan Shepard played golf on the moon. In 2007 Clay Anderson played American Football on the International Space Station. And now, in 2014, a cricket ball has joined the the exclusive club of sporting objects that have been sent to space - or at least to the edge of it. Scroll down for video . On the up: A cricket ball has been sent to a height of 110,000 feet (33,000 metres) on a helium balloon in what promoters say is the first time a cricket ball has been sent to the 'edge of space'. The stunt was part of an event to launch a new cricket season called the NatWest T20 Blast . The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) sent the cricket ball to the edge of space for what they claim is the first time. It was a stunt for the start of a competition that starts today called the NatWest T20 Blast competition. This sees 18 counties from England Wales compete in an 11-week season of cricket. To perform the feat the ECB worked with a team of aeronautical engineers to launch the official match ball from Edgbaston Stadium, Birmingham . The ball reached a peak altitude of 110,000 feet (33,000 metres), about three times the height at which a commercial airplane cruises. It was attached to a helium balloon in order to ascend and endured temperatures of -54°C (-130°F). The official boundary from Earth to space is said to be the Kármán Line. This is a line named after Hungarian physicist Theodore von Kármán, who first postulated its existence, that is 62 miles (100 kilometres), or 330,000 feet, above sea level. At this altitude, Earth's atmosphere is said to be too thin to support aeronautical flight and anything here can be said to be in the vacuum of space. However, to truly escape from any influence of Earth one must travel further. For example Earth's exosphere, a volume of molecules that are bound to our planet but with an extremely low density, extends out to 10,000 kilometres (6,200 miles). Only 24 humans, those of the Apollo missions, have ever travelled beyond the edge of Earth's exosphere. The cricket ball was launched from Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham (pictured). It survived temperatures of -54°C (-130°F) before plummeting back to Earth and landing in Newbury, Berkshire by parachute . At peak height the balloon popped, sending the ball plummeting to Earth at up to 500 miles (800 kilometres) per hour before a parachute deployed to bring it safely back to the planet in Newbury, Berkshire in near-perfect condition. ‘Ahead of the launch of the NatWest T20 Blast season, we wanted to do something that would reflect the competition’s exciting brand of cricket and vibrant in-ground atmosphere,’ said David Collier, ECB Chief Executive, in a statement. ‘By sending a cricket ball to the edge of space, we’ve come up with an innovative idea which vividly illustrates our own plans to make this summer’s NatWest T20 Blast competition a truly memorable experience for cricket fans everywhere.'","The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has sent a ball to 'space'

"By . Jonathan Petre . and Jo Knowsley . Warning: Michael Gove has been warned that 'dumbed-down' exams featuring celebrities could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards . Education Secretary Michael Gove has been warned that ‘dumbed-down’ exams featuring pop stars and comedians could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards. Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years, and last week’s disclosure that one of the country’s biggest exam boards is introducing questions on Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal in its new English A-level was another example. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that exam chiefs had been competing to make themselves popular with students since the mid-1980s. But they are ‘short-changing’ pupils because popular culture was ‘shallow and transitory’. A Mail on Sunday survey shows that questions based on popular culture have appeared in exam papers for a number of years, and experts have criticised the Government for failing to take action. Government adviser Chris McGovern said Mr Gove promised to introduce A-levels with more rigour and depth, but ‘a clear direction of travel’ had been revealed in the new English A-level syllabus by the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR) board. He said: ‘Everything that this Government has fought for in terms of raising educational standards will stand or fall  on the quality of public examinations. ‘The new syllabus for A-level English is one small indicator that, for all the talk  of reform in education, not a great deal is likely to change in the classroom.’ Sheila Lawlor, director of think tank . Politeia, said using ‘celebrity speak’ because boards felt it encouraged . children to engage was a ‘regrettable trend’. Exams: Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years . Under the . OCR proposals, teenagers will study the delivery style, purpose and . features of ‘celebrity language’ alongside Shakespeare and William . Blake. The . English exam, to be introduced next year, will feature extracts from . Brand’s appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee when he gave . evidence on drug addiction. Other texts will include Twitter feeds, speeches by the artist Grayson Perry and newspaper columns.

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 03:53 EST, 11 January 2012 . A pre-pubescent girl appointed as a 'living goddess' by Hindus and Buddhists has made a rare public appearance in Nepal during a religious festival. The Kumari, a young girl dressed in a red and golden costume who is worshipped by thousands, is appointed as an incarnation of the goddess Kali and only appears 13 times a year. As part of her sheltered existence, she spends the rest of the year in a temple away from the public, and only appears among others for special occasions. Life of a goddess: Kumari Matina Shakya is carried through Kathmandu during a rare public appearance in her role as the incarnation of a goddess . Child-like: Matina, the latest Kumari goddess, was just three years old when she was bestowed with the title of Royal Kumari . The latest Kumari, Matina Shakya, was three-years-old when she took her seat as Royal Kumari in August 2010 in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu. The Kumari is known in Nepal as the protector from evil and the bestower of good luck and prosperity. The Kumari, literally meaning 'virgin', is a young girl chosen from the Buddhist community to represent a Hindu goddess after she passes 32 tests of 'perfection'. These are said to include 'having a body like a banyan tree and golden, tender skin which has never been scratched or shed a drop of blood.' 'Living Goddess Kumari' Matina was today carried through a crowd of onlookers as she attended the Changu Narayan festival in Kathmandu. The Kumaris are a major tourist attraction and are revered until they menstruate, after which they return to the family and a new one is chosen. One of Matina's predecessors, Sajani Shakya, made international headlines in 2007 after she visited the United States to promote a film by a British company about the Kumari system. Centre of attention: The Kumari is a major tourist attraction in Nepal, and each one is revered in the community until they reach puberty, at which point a new child is selected . Write caption here . Under the system, the head priest of Nepal's former monarchy appointed 'Kumaris' - considered to be incarnations of the goddess Kali - in several towns in the Kathmandu valley. The monarchy was abolished in May when Nepal became a republic. Some religious authorities criticised Sajani's trip saying it was against tradition, and Sajani retired at the request of her family. According to Kumari tradition, girls selected from Buddhist Newar families through a rigorous cultural process become the 'living goddesses'. In 2008 Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to safeguard the Kumari's human rights after complaints that the practice went against the child living a normal life.","'Living Goddesses' are chosen as infants and adored by thousands until they reach puberty .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . As the wife of Britain's Foreign Secretary she is used to meeting high profile politicians and even monarchs. But Ffion Hague today appeared happy to share the limelight with Hollywood's most glamorous couple, at the final day of her husband's four-day conference with Angelina Jolie came to a close. Mrs Hague joined  William, Miss Jolie and Brad Pitt in London for the closing speeches of the star-studded summit to end sexual violence against women in war. Scroll down for video . Ffion Hague (left) appeared relaxed and happy in the company of Angelina Jolie (centre), who was joined by her partner Brad Pitt . Ffion Hague joined her husband William for the final day of the sexual violence in war summit co-hosted with Miss Jolie . Mrs Hague usually shuns publicity but has joined Mr Hague at a number of high profile events in recent weeks. She appeared alongside Mr Hague, the Tory Cabinet Minister,  with the Queen and the Duke of Edinbrough during the D-Day commemoration ceremony in Normandy earlier this month. Today, at London's Excel centre, she seemed at ease, laughing and joking with Miss Jolie as the summit drew to a close with speeches by her husband and the US Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr Hague and Miss Jolie have struck up an extraordinary friendship over the last few years. The 39-year-old actress, who has six children with her film star husband, launched a campaign with Mr Hague in 2012 to fight sexual violence in war. It came after she wrote and directed a film, called In the Land of Blood and Honey, in 2011 set during the Bosnian war. Up to 50,000 women were raped during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. In 2012, the UN High Commissioner Antonio Guterres appointed Miss Jolie as his Special Envoy. Today, after two years of campaigning, Miss Jolie and Mr Hague launched a new international protocol which they hope will 'shatter the culture of impunity' around sexual violence in war. So far, 155 countries have endorsed the declaration of commitment to end sexual violence in conflict. Miss Jolie appeared happy with the achievements of the four-day conference in London, which puts pressure on countries to crack down on soldiers using sexual violence as a weapon of war . Mr Hague has struck up a close working relationship with Miss Jolie since 2011, when he responded to her film about the Bosnian war, Land of Blood and Honey . Miss Jolie and Mr Hague have campaigned around the world to end rape in war since 2012 when she was made an official UN envoy . The Foreign Secretary and Miss Jolie brought the conference to a close today, joined by the US Secretary of State John Kerry . Mr Hague said the event, which attracted delegations from 123 countries, would pave the way for more support for survivors of rape of warzones, and a commitment to bring perpetrators to justice as well as ‘raising awareness dramatically’ of the crimes across the world. The Foreign Secretary said: ‘This has been an unprecedented event and a turning point in our campaign.’ He added that the summit was relevant to the crisis where there has been sexual violence on a ‘huge scale’. Angelia Jolie said: ‘It sends an extremely powerful message to the world that the foreign ministers of the united kingdom and the united states are taking such a strong stand on this issue. At times she has appeared emotional when listening to survivors of sexual violence in war . ‘One of the most heartening aspects of this summit has been to see so many male leaders prepared to confront the taboo surrounding sexual violence in conflict. Indeed I believe one of the outcomes of this summit is that this subject is now firmly on the top table of international diplomacy and we will work to ensure that it stays there…it goes to the heart of international peace and security.’ Miss Jolie, closing the conference said the film was what brought her and Mr Hague together, leading them to co-chair the ESVC summit at the east London venue. She said she was 'very moved' that the 2011 film, which is set in Bosnia during the conflict, was responded to by Mr Hague. In her speech, the Oscar winner added: 'For me, and I suspect for many of you, this summit has been an emotional experience. 'We have all come together based on a common desire to end war zone sexual violence, and we have mapped out every area of action we need to take.' The actress said there is 'no doubt' that after these four days it is now known what has to be done. Miss Jolie said she will work with Mr Hague and others for 'as long as it takes' to prevail in the struggle of sexual violence in conflict. She said the work begun at the summit is 'very, very much linked' with violence against women in other contexts, such as the kidnap of the schoolgirls in Nigeria or the recent rape cases in India and Pakistan. Mr Hague described the last three days as 'remarkable', and said the summit has 'opened the eyes of the world to this issue'. On the fourth day in a row Mr Hague has spent with Miss Jolie, he hailed the conference they had orgainsed and the impact it would have. He said: 'I hope it is a moment we will look back on and say this was where we started to tip the tipping point, this was where we started to turn the tide, this was where we demonstrated to millions of people that it is possible to succeed in defeating and ending sexual violence in conflict.' US Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the efforts of the Tomb Raider star and the Conservative politician. He described Jolie, who is special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as a 'fierce and fearless advocate'. 'We've all watched her play many remarkable roles, but perhaps her most lasting legacy actually comes from a role she plays in real life - and that is the role of fierce and fearless advocate,' he said. Speaking about Mr Hague, who he pointed out has travelled extensively and met those affected by sexual violence, Mr Kerry said: 'He has not just seen these unspeakable horrors, but he refuses to stay silent. That, my friends, is leadership.'","Foreign Secretary William Hague attends final day of summit with wife Ffion .

"By . Robert Verkaik . The last Briton: Guantanamo prisoner Shaker Aamer with two of his children, son Michael and daughter Johninh - he has yet to meet his youngest son who was born after his arrests in 2001 . Scotland Yard is investigating claims that MI6 and MI5 officers who interrogated a British man held at Guantanamo Bay were fully aware he was being brutally tortured by his American jailers. Shaker Aamer, 46, whose wife and four children live in South London, alleges that during his ten years of captivity at the US naval base, British agents visited him three times. Mr Aamer’s British lawyers have handed detectives 56 pages of hand-written notes and typed depositions in which he lays out his allegations. The Mail on Sunday has been told that Scotland Yard has formally asked the US government to allow them to question Mr Aamer in Guantanamo. Last night the Metropolitan Police would confirm only that their investigations into Mr Aamer’s case were ongoing. Mr Aamer, the last British detainee still held at Guantanamo, came to the UK from Saudi Arabia in 1996. In 2001, he took his family to Afghanistan to work with Islamic charities. But the CIA alleges that he was a member of Al Qaeda who was known to Osama Bin Laden. When the American-led forces invaded Afghanistan later that year, Mr Aamer was picked up by a local militia and handed over to US troops. He was detained for three months at the US-run Bagram airbase and an American prison in Kandahar before being flown to Guantanamo. Scotland Yard is already investigating claims that he was tortured in Afghanistan, and British interrogators working for MI6 or MI5 were present. Specifically he alleges one British officer watched while US soldiers banged his head against a wall. Now Mr Aamer’s written statements, declassified by the US authorities last month, reveal that he continues to suffer appalling abuse at the infamous detention facility. He says that as recently as April he was beaten up by camp guards for refusing to return to his cell where he is held for 22 hours a day. And he further alleges that the Americans are trying to kill him through ‘medical neglect’. Mr Aamer faces no charges of terrorism and was cleared for release from Guantanamo in 2007 by the then President, George  W. Bush. Foreign Secretary William Hague says . the British Government is negotiating with the US for his return to live . in the UK. His lawyers believe that the reason he has not been freed is . that both countries have much to lose by letting him make public his . damaging allegations of torture. The . declassified documents appear to show that despite his innocent status, . the abuses have continued since the first day he was detained  in . Afghanistan. Imprisoned: A US Army MP holds down the head of a detainee at Guantanamo so he is not identified . In his graphic accounts of his torture at Bagram, he details how he was subjected to the medieval abuse known as the ‘strappado’, devised by the Spanish Inquisition. ‘The US soldiers,’ says Mr Aamer, ‘would tie my wrists together and then hang me with either my feet just touching the ground or even just off the ground. This would gradually result in the dislocation of the shoulders in a way that was excruciating. ‘This would be done particularly when one of the soldiers thought that one of the prisoners had been talking in the cages.’ Significantly, Mr Aamer alleges that British intelligence continued to interrogate him after he was taken from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, when UK spy chiefs were fully aware of the tortures being carried out there. He alleges he was interrogated by . British officers in late 2002 or early 2003, including a man who was 5ft . 10in with reddish hair who spoke some Arabic. He claims the officer . apologised to him for the treatment he had suffered at the hands of the . Americans. Mr Aamer said: ‘He said, “I’m sorry about what [the . Americans] have done to you.” It was clear he knew what I have been . through, and was still going through.’ He was interrogated by the British again in 2003 but gives no more details, according to the documents. Then . in late 2003, he was visited for a third time, this time by a woman and . a man. He described the woman as around 25, brunette, 5ft 4ins tall and . ‘slender’. He said the man was ‘stocky’ and ‘squinted when he spoke’. Prison life: Detainees at Camp Delta exercising. Shaker Aamer claims he has been abused by US soldiers during his detention at Guantanamo bay . He says they refused to stop the torture and ‘told me they could not help’. He remembers that the male MI6 or MI5 officer interrogated him about Babar Ahmed, the British citizen who, with radical preacher Abu Hamza, on Friday lost his legal battle against extradition to America. A few months after Mr Aamer was questioned in Guantanamo about Ahmed, he was arrested in London on the instructions of the Americans  in relation to charges of providing material support to terrorism. The declassified papers raise serious concerns about Mr Aamer’s continuing torture and the effect this is having on his health. His lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of the human rights charity Reprieve, visited his client  in Guantanamo as recently as last month and says his injuries and ill-health are consistent with beatings and inhumane treatment. In July last year, Mr Aamer, known among the guards as ‘the professor’ because of his knowledge of the Guantanamo rules, began one of his many hunger strikes. On July 20, he reports: ‘The authorities told us, “You’ll have a beautiful Ramadan.” It was in Camp 5, and they said there would be no showers, and no recreation. ‘They tortured another guy using the nose tube, until he cried. They kept him on a stretcher, with a slow drip on the feed. I banged on the door when this was happening, then fainted from my own lack of eating. I was taken to hospital.’ He says that between December 3, 2011, and January 27 this year, he was beaten up every day by guards dressed in black body armour and masks who charged into his cell and dragged him into the corridor. He said: ‘Earlier this year I was thrown on my head by the guards, and one then jumped and landed with his knee on my rib. Both injuries caused me a great deal of pain. I was told that the X-ray showed nothing, but the doctor assured me that I would have a CT scan. That was not done.’ Visits by his lawyers are usually . followed by beatings. He says: ‘Last time Cori Crider [a Reprieve . lawyer] came to see me I got beaten up when she left. The same happened . with recent visits from both David Remes and Ramzi Kassem [his US . lawyers].’ Inquiry: Shaker Aamer's claims of abuse and torture by U.S. soldiers has led to Scotland Yard asking for permission to question him in Guantanamo . Mr Aamer says the Americans have shown him a letter written by a Foreign Office official which shows how Britain is conspiring to send him to Saudi Arabia where he will be imprisoned and separated from his family. He adds: ‘This proves one of two possible things: first, that the UK has been discussing me with the Saudis, which would be intolerable, since Saudi Arabia is the country that has denied me the right to have a family life, and has told me that I will be jailed if I return there. ‘Alternatively, the letter proves that the UK and the US have been discussing my future based on their own discussions with Saudi Arabia – again reflecting negotiations with the Saudis, and meaning that the numbers of conspirators rises from two to three.’ According to Mr Aamer’s evidence, Saudi officials visited him as recently as February 8. He recalls: ‘They said, “When you are brought back to Saudi Arabia, you’ll be interrogated, be tried, and you’ll be jailed. Then you’ll be put in the rehabilitation programme.” They wanted me to sign a commitment that I should go to jail when I went back to Saudi Arabia. They then wanted me, once they let me out of jail at some uncertain date, to agree to go through their “rehabilitation” programme. ‘I have never been charged with any crime anywhere –  my only encounter with the British police was when I had my mobile phone stolen.’ Scotland Yard is investigating Mr Aamer’s allegations of torture which he believes will prove that MI5 and MI6 officers were sent to Afghanistan and Guantanamo to interrogate inmates with the knowledge of British Ministers. In the documents, he says: ‘I am very happy to speak with the Metropolitan Police and help them in any way I can in their honest investigation of my torture and the torture  of others. ‘My own claims of torture  are urgent, since my abuse continues. I ask that the Met come to interview me as soon as possible. I try to speak out about my abuse here to the authorities, and consequently I get abused further.’ He adds: ‘I have been denied the right to stage a peaceful protest (a sit-in) against what has happened to me; indeed, almost every day for a year I refused to come back off the rec yard unless I was allowed to conduct my peaceful protest, and each time I refused I was ERF’d (when the Emergency Reaction Force comes and straps me to a stretcher and carries me bodily back to the cell). ‘Sometimes I have been beaten during this process; always I have been forced.’ Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son who  was born after his capture in Afghanistan, says his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London. In one desperate note to the British Government, he writes: ‘Detainee 239 need to go back to wife and kids in Britain and the British Government has no objection to take. So you need to work fast and get me out of here before it is too late.’ The Foreign Office declined to comment on the claims.","Shaker Aamer claims he was systematically abused by U.S. soldiers .

"By . Luke Garratt . A great-grandmother who has been named the oldest bar maid in the world is celebrating her 100th birthday, but despite having pulled pints since 1940 she has no plans to retire. Dolly Saville still works three days a week at The Red Lion Hotel in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, and has been working for 74 years. She started pulling pints when she was 26, just before World War II, and she estimates that she has poured around two million pints since she began. Then and now: (Left) Dolly at work in the beer garden in The Red Lion in 1949, and today, (left) still working three days a week at the hotel in Wendover (right) Over the last seven decades she has served many famous faces, including James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, former Prime Minister Ted Heath, footballer Stanley Matthews, singer Vera Lynn, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn and actress Elizabeth Taylor. Until six years ago when she was 94 she was still working at least six hours a day, six days a week and has only ever had two weeks sick leave her entire life. Dolly Saville with James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan at the Red Lion . Now she has had to reduce her shifts to three hours a week, but still spends the time working on her feet clearing tables, serving customers and polishing glasses. The pensioner, who has three grandchildren, three great-grandchildren . and one great-great granddaughter, has even had the bar she works at . named 'Dolly’s' in her honour. Mrs Saville, whose two children are both retired, said: 'I love my work and I love the people, it keeps me going and it’s better . than sitting around. 'I . never thought I would be here this long, but I’ve loved every minute of . it. My family keeps asking if I want to stop, but I have no plans to . retire. 'My boss is lovely and if he asked me to work an extra shift I would say yes as he has been so kind to me.' Mrs Saville was born in Eton, Berkshire, and moved to Wendover at the age of three. At 14, she left school and went into service as a house maid. She married in her late teens and her daughter Anne was born soon after, followed by her son Roland. When war broke out several years later, her husband joined the RAF and Dolly had to get a job to support the family. She . had never done bar work before but was offered a job in the hotel by . the landlord who spotted her walking past one day with her children. Even now she works a large amount of hours, especially for a 99 year old, and has no plans to stop working . Despite the fact that both her children are both retired, she says she will work at the bar until the day she dies . She said: 'The . landlord asked if I would like to work there, but I said no as I hadn’t . worked in a bar before and I never thought anymore about it. 'Then . he saw me up the High Street and asked if I’d thought anymore about it. I said I hadn’t but he said ""why don’t you give it a try"" so I said I . would. 'I started just washing up glasses in the saloon bar. Then, . after I’d been there about five or six weeks he said I think you could . serve. 'I said ‘Oh I don’t think so, I’d give them the wrong change!’ But I did, and I got on very well.' Dolly Saville, aged 3, in 1917, with her mother (right) and her brother Fred . When Mrs Saville first started the 16th Century hotel had three bars, a public bar, a saloon bar and a cocktail bar, and she would work in all three. Her children, who were three and five at the time, would be left to play in the staff room or the beautiful hotel gardens. She said: 'I worked in all three bars and over the years I’ve also cooked in the kitchen, done the bedrooms, the reception and the teas. I’ve done the lot. 'It has always been great fun and sometimes after a long shift I would be tired but we would go out dancing.' Dolly Saville with footballer Sir Stanley Matthews in 1982, one of the many celebrities she met during her time as a barmaid at The Red Lion . 'Even after the hotel, which has historical links with Oliver Cromwell and Robert Louis Stevenson, was closed five years ago for six months refurbishment Dolly refused to give up work. Instead she went to the nearby King and Queen pub in Wendover, and continued working at the bars. She said: 'I was so sad when they closed for six months. 'But I went to the King and Queen instead, they asked me if I would go there and I quite enjoyed that I must say! 'I get very bored if I’m sitting too long. I must be doing something and working keeps my brain active. 'I think that comes from when I left school at 14 and I went into private service. You had to work then, there was no nonsense, and if you didn’t do it properly you did it again.' (Left) Dolly Saville in 1979, the year that the smallpox virus was eradicated, and Dolly Saville aged 27 in 1941 (right) Mrs Saville was famous for being such a long-serving bar maid before her 100th birthday, and is missed by the regulars if she is not around. In addition, over the years she has also served many celebrities. She said: 'I served Pierce Brosnan when he had lunch at the hotel while he was filming one of the Bond films. 'I also made tea and toast for Ted Heath when he came in on a chilly afternoon. 'Vera Lynn has also popped into the hotel several times for lunch. I think everyone in the village knows me now.' Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on and it keeps her going' Mrs Saville now works three lunch times a week. She added: 'The hotel has changed over the years, Dolly’s bar used to be the dining room and we used to serve teas in the afternoon and I would clean all the brass. 'I was busy all the time and never minded what I did, I loved it.' Mrs Saville’s daughter Anne Edwards, 79, from Wendover, said until she was 94 her mum would work a morning shift, come home for lunch, then go back again in the evening. The pensioner had just started working at the bar and was just 26. King George VI was on the throne, Winston . Churchill was Prime Minister and Britain was in the grip of World War . Two. The battle of France began, and the Dutch official surrendered to the German forces. Paris was eventually bombed and invaded, while the French Resistance began their preliminary planning for guerrilla counter-attacks. Later, the 'Battle of Britain' began, with the Nazi Luftwaffe consistently bombing London, and several parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at strategic points, such as docks and aeronautical manufacturing plants. This led to a period called the Blitz (a result of the British 'blackout') a pattern of strategic bombings by Nazi planes over populated areas. The draft of around 16 million men began in the U.S, prior to their involvement in the war. Also, Bugs Bunny made his debut in the Oscar-nominated cartoon short, A Wild Hare. 'She is remarkable and still works three shifts a week,” she said. 'We suggested she should stop but she is determined to carry on and I think a lot of the customers would be up in arms if she left. 'When she started the job it was out of necessity, but I think it gradually became her life.' Mrs Saville’s granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on and it keeps her going. Her colleagues, who are holding a big party for her on her birthday, are also full of praise for her. Martin Howard, manager of the hotel, said: 'Dolly is an amazing person and the life and soul of the staff parties. She is still young at heart and the staff love her.' Robert Hynes, deputy manager, said: 'She is amazing and the customers absolutely love her. She has told me she doesn’t want to leave until the day she dies. 'The younger members of staff aspire to be like her and think she’d brilliant. I think the job keeps her going and gives her something to look forward to. 'We get regulars who come in especially to see Dolly and in the run up to her birthday they’ve been travelling from further afield to see her.'

"By . Jill Reilly . North Korean dictator Kim Jong has been given a guided tour of an indoor vegetable farm. The dictator was photographed visiting the Jangchon Vegetable Co-op Farm in Sadong District, Pyongyang, North Korea. Kim said that the farm turned into a vegetable production base for the citizens of the capital city under the guidance of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The smile was back on for a visit to a vegetable farm in Pyongyang on Tuesday, however, with Kim keen to praise growers for their vital work . A photograph was also released today of Kim Jong-un visiting the Hydro-meteorological Service in Pyongyang. He said there are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation has not been put on a modern and scientific basis. He was of course pictured sitting a desk with an ashtray near him -if the North Korean leader isn’t smoking in photographs, an ashtray is often in close proximity. Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success . Meanwhile . today Singapore filed criminal charges against a shipping company . implicated in a shipment of weapons to North Korea that was seized by . Panamanian authorities last year. Locally . registered Chinpo Shipping Company Ltd. was charged with transferring . $72,000 to a Panama shipping agent knowing that the funds could be used . to contribute to the 'nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or . other weapons of mass destruction-related programs or activities' of . North Korea. A . Chinpo executive, 50-year-old Singapore citizen Tan Hui Tin, who is the . daughter of Chinpo's chairman, was charged for withholding potential . electronic evidence. The charges follow Panama's seizure in June last year of a North Korean ship headed from Cuba to North Korea. Panamanian authorities suspected it was transporting drugs but found two Cuban fighter jets in perfect condition, missiles and live munitions beneath the Chong Chon Gang's cargo of sugar. Panama says the weapons violated U.N. sanctions that restrict arms trading with North Korea because of its nuclear weapons program. In March, the United Nations Security Council's sanctions committee named Chinpo as one of two companies involved in trying to ship arms to North Korea. The other was Ocean Maritime Management, a Pyongyang-based company. View of the building in which is located the tribunal that held a preliminary hearing for three North Korean members of the crew of a ship detained in 2013 in Panama with a Cuban non-declared weapons shipment, in city of Colon, 80 kilometres from Panama . Singapore's foreign ministry said authorities received information about Chinpo in January this year. A panel of experts advising the Security Council said in its annual report on North Korea that the country's embassies, including in Singapore and Cuba, were suspected of helping to organize arms shipments to Pyongyang via complex financial methods that were 'pioneered by drug-trafficking organizations.' The report said Chinpo Shipping Company was 'co-located' with the North Korean Embassy in Singapore and that the shipping firm acted as the agent for Ocean Maritime Management, which operated the Chong Chon Gang. A woman who answered the phone at Chinpo declined to comment.","Dictator was photographed visiting the Jangchon Vegetable Co-op Farm .

"By . Richard Spillett . Mick Jagger enjoyed a Father's Day meet-up with his ex-wife, his daughter and a son just hours after fresh details emerged of his tryst with a ballerina 43 years his junior. The singer was seen smiling with former-partner Jerry Hall, 57, daughter Georgia May, 22, and son Gabriel, 16, as they left a hotel in Vienna, Austria, today ahead of a concert the Rolling Stones are due to give in the city tomorrow night. Their lunch came on the same day the woman Jagger was recently spotted embracing on a Zurich balcony was named as dancer Melanie Hamrick. Mick Jagger was all smiles as he emerged from a Vienna hotel with ex-wife Jerry Hall on Sunday. The couple's son, Gabriel, is pictured behind them . The former couple were also joined by daughter Georgia May Jagger (right) ahead of a concert the Rolling Stones are due to give at the city's Ernst Happel Stadion . Jagger's nine-year marriage to Hall ended 15 years ago but the couple, who have four children together, are still close. The veteran singer, sporting trainers, a purple shirt and a green blazer, appeared relaxed and signed autographs for the army of fans waiting outside for photos. The Stones are due to play at Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadion tomorrow night as they continue their 14 On Fire world tour. It was the rocker's first public appearance since it emerged he met leading ballerina Melanie Hamrick two weeks before his girlfriend L’Wren Scott’s suicide. American dancer Ms Hamrick, 27, was pictured embracing the 70-year-old singer ten days ago in Zurich, where the Rolling Stones were . performing. At . the time, sources close to Jagger said the tryst followed a chance . encounter in a nightclub. But The Mail on Sunday disclosed today that . Jagger first met the New York-based dancer three months earlier – and . 6,800 miles away – in Japan. A relaxed-looking Jagger signed autographs and chatted to the scores of fans waiting outside his hotel . On March 6 . this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American . Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out . concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of . the band. Melanie, . who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no . mention of the Stones concert. A . spokesman for Jagger last night confirmed that the pair met when . Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source . close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not . take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact . details in Tokyo. The . week before the concert, on February 25, Jagger had attended a special . reception for the ballet troupe in Tokyo, hosted by US Ambassador . Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a long-standing friend of the rock . star, but Melanie did not attend. There was no sign of Ms Scott on the trip, though she had previously travelled with Mick whenever he was on the road. Ms Hamrick was photographed embracing Jagger on a hotel balcony in Zurich ten days ago, where sources close to the couple say the first 'liaison' took place . At . the time of the ambassador’s party, Melanie was said to be engaged to . another older man, 46-year-old José Manuel Carreño, a fellow dancer. She . lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the . home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared.  It was there that . Ms Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49. Mick . and Melanie were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at . the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking . as though they had just got out of bed. Mick, . who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue . V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved . top with slashed sleeves. During the . afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on . the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt . and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water. The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the £2,250-a-night suite. Melanie Hamrick, 27, met Mick Jagger two weeks before L'Wren Scott's tragic suicide however the exchanged contact details three months earlier when they met in Japan after the Rolling Stones played a sell out gig . Friends of . Melanie, who has a penchant for older men, did not know why she was in . Zurich, believing she flew to Switzerland alone. One said: ‘Ever since . the photos emerged Mel has kept her head down hardly stepping out from . her apartment. 'Talk has been rife about their fling  with many believing . it wasn’t just a coincidence the two were in Zurich together following . the ambassador’s reception in Japan.' After . being approached by The Mail on Sunday in New York, Melanie told a friend: ‘They’ve . found me, they’ve found me!’ But she refused to comment directly. She . has been romantically involved with Carreño for six years, and engaged . since May 2011. They met in 2004, when she joined the American Ballet . Theatre at the age of 17. He was then the Broadway-based company’s . premier danseur. A father . of two, who was  previously married to fellow Cuban dancer Ana Lourdes . Novoa, Carreño has been the principal dancer with the English National . Ballet and the Royal Ballet, and has appeared on Dancing With The Stars, . America’s version of Strictly Come Dancing. But . earlier this year he moved to California – 2,500 miles from Melanie – . after taking a job as artistic director of Ballet San Jose. In an . interview in February, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: ‘Carreno talks . like a person who has come to the South Bay for the long run, which . meant leaving behind his fiancee, American Ballet Theatre dancer Melanie . Hamrick.’ Melanie’s friends have also noted that she has recently stopped wearing the engagement ring she once sported. The Stones have 17 dates left on their current tour, which will take them around Europe and Scandinavia before they head to Australia and New Zealand.","Jagger spotted with ex-wife Jerry Hall and daughter Georgia May in Vienna .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The ‘comet of the century’, Comet ISON, is now visible to the naked eye- but catch it while you can, as some experts believe it won't be there for long. There have been reported sighting of 'wings' coming from the comet, which may suggest that its centre has already broken up. However, Karl Battams, blogging on Nasa's Comet ISON Observing Campaign, believes there are other possibilities. Scroll down for video and animation... A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths . He claims the wings could be due to dust emissions or tail structures caused by ISON running into high solar winds. 'If the comet has fragmented, we should see some dramatic changes in the next few days,' he added. 'Typically we expect a large increase in brightness followed then by a dramatic decrease in the comet's brightness in these situations.' On Saturday, the comet was declared as being in 'full outburst mode' after having increased in brightness by a magnitude of two in just 24 hours. This image was taken in the early hours of this morning just before sunrise above the skies of in northern England. The ball of ice and dust is thought to originate from the Oort cloud and is the first sungrazing comet in 200 years . ISON was spotted in the early hours of this morning two hours before sunrise above the skies of in northern England, and a faint tail can can seen against the clear sky near Barnard Castle, County Durham . A flood of images have come in from . amateur astronomers, many of whom took images in their back garden with . just binoculars or small telescopes. Scientists are now predicting it will get even brighter over the next few weeks, and are encouraging people to get a glimpse of Ison themselves. The best place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside. While it can be seen with the naked eye, binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface. The comet is currently close enough to the sun which means tomorrow, it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon. ISON, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century', was visible to the naked eye in November . By the end of the November, it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky. On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where it came. The comet is already creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail. The comet was discovered in September last year by two amateur astronomers using Russia's International Scientific Optical Network, ISON, who marvelled at how bright it was even beyond Jupiter's orbit. At the end of this month, it will be more than 100 times closer to the sun than the Hale-Bopp comet, one of the brightest of the last century which was visible with the naked eye for a record 18 months, passed at its peak in 1997. ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1 .

On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where it came. As it blasts towards the sun, the intense gravitational pull will make it speed up to 234 miles per second. The sun's rays will also heat the ball of ice, metal and rock to 2,760 degrees Celsius, making it much brighter than most comets - with some scientists claiming it could outshine the moon. Some have warned that the intense pressure on the comet could simply blast it apart, as the heat melts not just the ice but also rock and metal. A flood of images from both professional and amateur astronomers have been coming in. It is expected to be visible to the naked eye in early mornings throughout December and during the night in January. It is currently passing through the constellation Virgo in the east of the morning sky. Comets are believed to be frozen remains left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago. ISON, which has never visited our inner solar system before, has emerged from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. These balls of ice are occasionally 'bumped' by the sun's gravity out of the cloud and into a flight path that brings them into the inner solar system. The vast majority of comets are invisible to the naked eye, but the most famous is Halley's Comet. An image of ISON's full extent, with an imprint showing the area of the above Hubble image. Some scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to weather the sun's heat . That is because it is the only comet which visits often enough and shines brightly enough to be seen by most people in their lifetime. It comes to our inner solar system between every 75 and 76 years and last visited in 1986. Among other things, it inspired the name of 1950s rock and roll outfit Bill Haley and His Comets. There is still a chance the comet will not survive its journey close to the sun, but if it does, Astronomers could learn a lot about the comet's composition by observing which gases boil off it as it nears the sun .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . The death of a woman working at an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania is being investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency said in a Friday press release, as it cited five companies for 'serious' violations after an investigation into a worker's death last year at a New Jersey facility. Jody Rhoads, 52, died on June 1 from wounds she suffered when the pallet jack she 'was operating [...] crashed into shelving and pinned her,' the Associated Press reported. Rhoads, a widow who earlier survived a battle with breast cancer, left behind two sons and four grandchildren, her obituary said. Killed: Jody Rhoads, pictured, died earlier this month from wounds she suffered while working at an Amazon warehouse . The citations came after an investigation into the December 2013 death of temporary Amazon worker Ronald Smith at an Avenel, New Jersey facility, OSHA said in the release. Smith 'was caught in between a conveyor system and crushed while performing sorting operations' and later died, the agency said. The 57-year-old man left behind four children and seven grandchildren, NJ.com reported. Victim: Ronald Smith, pictured, was killed in December 2013 after he was crushed by equipment at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey . Four staffing agencies, along with logistics company Genco, were cited for 'serious' violations, which '[occur] when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known,' OSHA said. The staffing agencies were cited 'for failure to perform a hazard assessment of the facility before assigning employees to determine if hazards existed.' Genco was cited 'for not certifying that a hazard assessment of the facility had been conducted before assigning employees to work.' Four staffing agencies, along with logistics company Genco, were cited for 'serious' violations by OSHA stemming from an investigation into Smith's death . 'Temporary staffing agencies and host employers are jointly responsible for the safety and health of temporary employees,' Patricia Jones, the director of the OSHA Avenel Area Office, said in the release. 'These employers must assess the work site to ensure that workers are adequately protected from potential hazards. It is essential that employers protect all workers from job hazards - both temporary and permanent workers.' All five companies face a $6,000 fine.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Daily Mail Reporter . After fleeing a city tower block in search of the good life, Matthew Lepley and Jules Smith spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land in a bid to build Britain’s greenest home. Armed with an axe and hand tools, they pieced together scrap metal, tyres and wooden crates until a one-bedroom cabin – complete with compost toilet – rose out of the muddy field they had bought. Now the couple have been served with an enforcement notice to tear it all down – because it was against their eco-friendly beliefs to apply for planning permission. Eco-palace: Matthew Lepley and Jules Smith's home, called Silent Haven, took five years to build . Country retreat: Ms Smith, left, and Mr Lepley, right, left London five years ago to embark on their project . Planning row: Officials from Torridge District Council have now said that the home must be torn down . (In)convenience: The couple have an outdoor compost toilet . They argue that the process would have wasted too much paper and energy. Mr Lepley, 34, said: ‘We wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature. ‘The . process was a lot slower but it was extremely satisfying. We wanted to . reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. We took the decision to . build without planning permission because the council’s procedure is not . environmentally  friendly enough and it goes against our personal . principles.’ Five years . ago, Mr Lepley and 54-year-old partner Miss Smith left jobs as carers . and moved out of the tower block in Wood Green, north London, where they . were living. They bought a . 20-acre field in Beaworthy, Devon, put aside £20,000 for construction . costs, and set about scouring farmland and scrap yards for unwanted . materials which they could use to build their home. Inside: The couple prepare a meal in their eco-home's kitchen . Heating: Mr Lepley stokes with wood-burning stove to keep the house warm . Attic room: The two pose in the bedroom of their painstakingly-contructed home, made in part from scrap . Happy scrubbing: The couple's bathroom gets heated water from a wood-fired tank . At one with nature: The couple keeps ducks, which provide eggs, and also have sheep for wool and a vegetable plot . They . built foundations out of tractor tyres filled with gravel and used . haulage pallets and railway sleepers to construct the walls and roof. Today the house is made up of just one bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom. Water is drawn out of the ground via a bore hole and they use an outdoor compost toilet. And . just like Barbara and Tom from BBC sitcom The Good Life they grown . their own fruit and veg and rear animals – ducks for their eggs and . sheep for their wool. Because . they have no electricity, they keep their food cool in an underground . ‘fridge’ – a compartment dug two and a half feet deep. The couple say their neighbours were initially supportive of their ambition to live self-sufficiently. They . were relying on locals not alerting the council to their project so . they would be given automatic planning permission after four years. But . two years into the build, the couple say locals changed their tune when . they revealed plans to run an eco-friendly retreat and host green . workshops in their field. Under construction: The couple built the house, pictured during the process, without using any power tools . Order: Torridge District Council in Devon have told the couple they must tear the house down . Handiwork: Mr Lepley and Ms Smith decided against using power tools for the whole of the five-year construction period . Resourceful: The wood to make the house was partly sourced from old lorry crates . A neighbour gathered ten signatures and submitted the petition to Torridge District Council. Mr . Lepley and Miss Smith appealed against the first enforcement notice . three years ago and are now in the process of appealing against the . second one. Mr Lepley, who earns a living selling homemade produce and . doing part-time care work, said: ‘What we’ve done isn’t illegal. ‘We’ve . had a lot of drama with the neighbours. Some have been really . supportive while others have gone against us and started a petition. ‘The . idea of the conservation project was to provide retreat accommodation . and run courses and workshops on sustainable living.  The house and . surrounding land enables us to be totally self-sufficient. This life is . not for everyone but we love it. We would be devastated if we had to . knock down.’ A council . spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Torridge District Council has served an . enforcement notice that they remove the structure. ‘However, as it has now gone to appeal, we have to wait for the inspector’s decision before we can take any further action.’","Matthew Lepley, 34, and Jules Smith, 54, left London five years ago to build their dream house in the countryside .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has branded Falkland Islanders ‘squatters’ after they voted overwhelmingly to remain British. She stepped up her attacks after all but three of the 1,517 islanders who took part in the referendum said they wanted to remain an ‘overseas territory of the United Kingdom’. David Cameron welcomed the result and urged Argentina to respect the historic vote. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner dismissed the referendum result in the Falkland Islands as 'a parody' But his call was snubbed by Mrs . Kirchner in her first comments about the referendum. She spoke out after . attending the funeral of Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. The president used a conference . speech, in which she was meant to present a plan for the country’s . science and technology programmes, to criticise the referendum. She . claimed: ‘It’s like a consortium of squatters voting on whether they’re . going to continue illegally occupying a building or not. The result was a . foregone conclusion.’ Mrs Kirchner went on to dismiss the poll as a ‘parody’. And Alicia Castro, the Argentine . ambassador to London, claimed the referendum was a ‘ploy’ with no legal . value. She said: ‘Negotiations are in the islanders’ best interests. Jubilant: Falkland islanders cheer after hearing the results of the referendum to remain part of Britain . An overwhelming yes: 98.8 per cent of eligible voters in the Falkland Islands voted to remain a part of Britain . ‘We respect their identity and their . way of life and that they want to continue to be British. But the . territory they occupy is not British.’ Argentina insists that the islands it calls Las Malvinas were forcibly  taken from Argentina by the British in 1833. Britain says the argument is . unfounded, because no Argentine civilian population was ever expelled. Tensions between the two nations have escalated over the possibility of . lucrative oil reserves in the region, which lie around 8,000 miles from . the UK in the South Atlantic. Last month, Argentine foreign . minister Hector Timerman pulled out of a meeting with William Hague when . it was revealed that members of the Falklands government would be . present. He has now told every Argentine ambassador to denounce the ballot as ‘illegitimate’. Rule Britannia: Falkland islanders sing and celebrate as their referendum result sends a message to Argentina that they want to remain part of Britain . Waiting up: Residents waited outside Port Stanley's town hall to hear the results as they were announced shortly before 2am . Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, has backed the Argentine stance over the referendum. He said: ‘It’s ridiculous, las . Malvinas are Argentine and it’s a disgrace that there is a colony on the . coast of the Americas in the 21st century. We must all rebel against . this.’ But Mr Hague has called on Argentina to accept the result. He said: ‘We have always been clear we believe in the rights of the Falklands people to determine their own futures. ‘It is only right that, in the 21st century, these rights are respected.’ And Nigel Haywood, governor of the . Falkland Islands, said the vote was a ‘massive demonstration of the way . the Falkland Islanders feel and of the way they see their future’.","President Cristina Kirchner dismisses the islanders as 'squatters'

The polo player also placed a hand on the Queen's shoulder before the pair posed for photographs . The Argentine, who was born into a family of polo players, is ranked number two in the world in his sport and became the youngest player ever to hold a 10-goal handicap at just 19. It is not believed to have been the first time the sportsman has met the Queen. Last year, after again receiving the ‘most valuable player’ award at the same event, he would’ve come face-to-face with England’s monarch. Dressed in royal blue Angela Kelly, the Queen seemed in good spirits at today’s event - which she attended with the Duke of Edinburgh just a day after celebrating her official birthday. Her Majesty smiled to spectators and staff as she toured the ground before watching play get underway at the annual prestigious event, which attracts leading polo players from around the world.

"By . Sam Webb . A Dutch photographer was stunned to discover a mysterious flying vessel in the photos she took of a castle near Amsterdam. Keen photographer Corinne Federer and her mother visited medieval Muiderslot castle last month and the 43-year-old decided to take some photos of the picturesque landmark. She was using High Dynamic Range, or HDR, images, where three or more pictures are taken at the same time and then overlapped for a rich image with the full spectrum of light. I want to believe: The high speed winged object snapped by Corinne Federer over Muiderslot Castle in Holland . As she checked the pictures, she was amazed to find that one of the images, comprised of five overlapped images, featured a 'tubular-shaped object that had an S-shaped fin on it.' She told the Huffington Post: 'We heard nothing, it was completely quiet out. The more I flipped through the frames, it was kind of creepy.' 'I've been shooting for quite some time and I've seen other stuff in the news, but I've never seen anything [like this] with my own eye.' She added that the object was blurred at 1/250th of a second and was not in the frame before or after, so it had to be going incredibly fast. This is the same image, but after adjustments were made to the contrast to provide a clearer sense of the shape of the 'UFO' Through further tweaking of the photos she found that in the image following the appearance of the UFO on the right side, there was a portion of another object but on the left side of the exposure, giving the appearance that the 'craft' had turned around at breathtaking speed. Ben Hansen, a former FBI special agent who has used his investigative skills to analyse thousands of videos and photographs of alleged UFO sightings said the images do not appear to have been manipulated. He said: 'The object's appearance is internally consistent with the rest of the photo. For instance, look at the darker area of the underside of the object compared with the clouds. 'Having the sun in the frame is helpful because it indicates where shadows should appear. This further supports that the object was photographed 'in-camera' and not added later.' However, he does not agree that the object appears to have doubled back on itself and speculates that it's probably a insect as the 'fins' could easily be wing protrusions. But while Federer isn't sure what she photographed over the Muiderslot Castle that day, she still looks up at the night sky and thinks there must be someone - or thing - out there.","Corinne Federer was taking pictures of the landmark last month .

"By . Sarah Womack . Most people arriving at a long-running anti-fracking protest are there to 'disrupt and intimidate' locals and antagonise police, a police chief said today. More than 80 people have been arrested at a drilling site in Barton Moss on the outskirts of Salford, Greater Manchester. Of the 82 people held, 62 are from outside the Greater Manchester area and many are from the south of England, according to Greater Manchester Police. Most people arriving at an anti-fracking protest near Salford are there to disrupt and intimidate people, and don't even live locally, said Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts . A number of those detained have been arrested before at Barton Moss or other protest sites, the force said. Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts said: 'At the start of this protest the majority of protesters were peaceful and law-abiding, but over the past couple of weeks local residents and officers have seen a distinct change to this. 'It now seems that the majority of people who are arriving at the site are not there to protest against fracking, but are there to disrupt and intimidate the local community and to antagonise police.' The people arriving at Barton Moss are there to 'antagonise police', says police chief Mark Roberts . A protestor at the anti-fracking protest. More than 80 people have been arrested at a drilling site in Barton Moss. Police and ambulance crew at Barton Moss. Mr Roberts said the force had recorded offences of assault, damage, harassment of residents and workers, a flare fired at the police helicopter and threats to kill. 'I attended a residents’ meeting last week and people there were close to tears and have had enough of this daily disruption to their lives,' he continued. 'Locals, who initially supported the protesters, out walking their dogs and driving down Barton Moss Road have been approached by protesters in balaclavas and have been questioned by them, which has been extremely intimidating. 'Officers are verbally abused on a daily basis, one has even been spat at and another officer required stitches to his hand after trying to get a protester down from a fence.' Since November around 60 tents and caravans have sprung up along the farm track leading to the site, between Barton Aerodrome and the M62. Environmentalists claim there is indisputable evidence that fracking causes air and water pollution and leads to earth tremors. The Government and industry say it is safe, and will create jobs. Meanwhile no fracking will take place at a site in West Sussex which was at the centre of large-scale protests last year, energy company Cuadrilla told residents. Hundreds of anti-fracking activists set up camp last summer after Cuadrilla started exploratory drilling on the outskirts of Balcombe. In a letter to Balcombe residents from Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan, he said the rock underneath the drill site, at Lower Stumble, was already naturally fractured, and the company had no intention of fracking there. However, although Mr Egan ruled out fracking at the site, Cuadrilla’s association with Balcombe is by no means at an end. In his letter, published by Balcombe Parish Council, Mr Egan said Cuadrilla had submitted a new planning application to West Sussex County Council to complete flow testing of oil from the exploration well. Over the summer, the firm drilled horizontally for some 1,700ft through Micrite formation, a type of limestone, at a depth of around 2,350ft below ground level. Mr Egan wrote: 'We were expecting to - and did indeed find - oil in the Micrite. However, without testing we cannot be sure at what rate the oil may flow to the surface.' This week it was revealed that the cost to taxpayers of policing the lengthy anti-fracking protests at Balcombe was nearly £4 million.","More than 80 people arrested at drilling site in Barton Moss near Salford .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . For thousands of years, nature has been blamed for the deadly floods of China's Yellow River, long known in China as the ‘River of Sorrow’ and ‘Scourge of the Sons of Han.’ But according to a recent study, it was human activity rather than Mother Nature that began changing the river’s natural flow 3,000 years ago, leading to the death of millions. The report provides the earliest known archaeological evidence of man-made, large-scale levees and other flood-control systems in the eastern region. This maps shows historically identified courses of the Yellow River and its mega-deltas. According to a recent study by Washington University, it was human activity rather than Mother Nature that began changing the river’s natural flow 3,000 years ago, leading to the death of millions through flooding . It suggests the Chinese government’s long-running efforts to tame the Yellow River with levees, dikes and drainage ditches actually made flooding much worse. This, they claim, set the stage for a catastrophic flood between 14-17 AD, which may have triggered the collapse of the Western Han Dynasty. ‘Human intervention in the Chinese environment is relatively massive, remarkably early and nowhere more keenly witnessed than in attempts to harness the Yellow River,’ said Dr Tristram Kidder from Washington University. For thousands of years, the destructive force of nature has been blamed for the deadly floods of China's Yellow River, long known in China as the ‘River of Sorrow’ and ‘Scourge of the Sons of Han’ The southwest corner of the brick quarry dig site at Anshang shows remnants of the bank/levee in the sedimentary record. It shows a vicious cycle of primitive levees built larger and larger as erosion increased and periodic floods grew more widespread and destructive . The Western Han was regarded as the first unified and powerful empire in Chinese history . While there are many theories behind the fall of the Western Han Dynasty, Dr Kidder’s research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise. A census taken by China in 2 AD suggests the area struck by the massive 14-17 AD flood was very heavily populated, with an average of 122 people per square kilometre, or approximately 9.5 million people living directly in the flood’s path. Historical accounts indicate that communities hit by the flood were soon in complete disarray, with reports of people resorting to banditry to obtain food and stay alive. By AD 20-21, the devastated region had become the centre of a rebellion that would end the Western Han Dynasty’s five-century reign of power. ‘In some ways, these findings offer a new benchmark for the beginning of the Anthropocene, the epoch in which humans became the most dominant global force in nature.’ ‘By 2,000 years ago, people were controlling the Yellow River, or at least thought they were controlling it, and that’s the problem.’ Dr Kidder’s research is based on a study of sedimentary soils deposited along the Yellow River over thousands of years. It included data from the Sanyangzhuang site, known today as ‘China’s Pompeii,’ which was slowly buried beneath five metres of sediment during a massive flood in 14 to 17 AD. It also looked at the Anshang site, discovered in 2012, includes the remains of a human-constructed levee and three irrigation/drainage ditches dating to the Zhou Dynasty from 1046–256 BC. Researchers examined about 50 vertical feet of exposed soil layers at the Anshang site, cleaning sections of a quarry wall to reveal patterns of sedimentary deposits dating back about 10,000 years. Boxed section of Image A shows the first stage of a bank/levee exposed in the excavation at Anshang. Image B offers a closer view of the boxed section showing mixed and loaded sediments near the base of the bank/levee . Nearly a third of this 10,000-year cross-section has been deposited in the last 2,000 years, indicating that the rate of deposit has steadily increased at a pace that mirrors the expansion of human activity in the region. ‘Our analysis clearly shows that these levees are not naturally formed berms, but are indeed artificially created through the work of humans,’ said Dr Kidder. His research suggests the Chinese began building drainage canals and bank systems along the lower reaches of the Yellow River between 2,900 and 2,700 years ago. The sedimentary record shows a vicious cycle of primitive levees built larger and larger as erosion increased, and periodic floods grew more widespread and destructive.

The Loess Plateau is indicated by shading . While there are many theories behind the fall of the Western Han Dynasty, Dr Kidder’s research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise. Pictured are Han dynasty laborers dressing clay statues of imperial army soldiers . ‘It’s easy to see the trap they fell into,’ Dr Kidder said. ‘Building levees causes sediments to accumulate in the river bed, raising the river higher, and making it more vulnerable to flooding, which requires you to build the levee higher, which causes the sediments to accumulate, and the process repeats itself.’ While there are many theories behind the fall of the Western Han Dynasty, Dr Kidder’s research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise. A census taken by China in 2 AD suggests the area struck by the massive 14 to 17 AD flood was very heavily populated, with an average of 122 people per square kilometre, or approximately 9.5 million people living directly in the flood’s path. Historical accounts indicate that communities hit by the flood were soon in complete disarray, with reports of people resorting to banditry to obtain food and stay alive. By 20 to 21 AD, the devastated region had become the centre of a rebellion that would end the Western Han Dynasty’s five-century reign of power. ‘The big issue here is that human beings clearly changed the environment, and that these changes had real consequences for human history,’ Dr Kidder said. ‘It happened in the past and can happen again.’","Chinese built canals and banks along Yellow River around 2,900 years ago .

"By . Ruby Warrington . Bulge battle: Cruciferous vegetables in addition to exercise can help you slim . I am a fit 65-year-old female. I am 5ft 6in and weigh around 7.5st. I play golf at least twice a week in the winter and in the summer I can play up to five times a week. I walk six miles with a friend once a week and average 3.8 miles per hour. My problem is that as I have got older my stomach/waist has definitely increased and I would love to slim down. Obviously I have no need to diet but as I have problems with my neck, shoulder and elbows I need to take care when it comes to doing exercise. Is there anything you can recommend that I can do at home? The thought of going to a gym just does  not appeal. It sounds like your active lifestyle is keeping you in great shape, although based on your height and weight your BMI of 17.5 shows you’re actually slightly underweight (anything between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal). If you’ve always been naturally slim, how frustrating it must be that you’ve now gained weight around your middle for no apparent reason. But the dreaded middle-aged spread is a problem for many women post-menopause.It has been attributed to changes in hormone levels as we age. Progesterone levels in women decrease far faster than oestrogen levels during the menopausal years, leading to what some doctors claim is ‘oestrogen dominance’ in the body, which can then be compounded by high oestrogen levels in our food and water. As oestrogen acts like a ‘fat magnet’, high levels of the hormone are associated with weight gain around the middle – so one key to combating this is diet. You have no need to diet for weight loss, but what you eat is as important as portion size and those who believe in this theory recommend avoiding ‘oestrogenstimulating foods’ and upping the intake of foods that shift excess oestrogen out of your system. This means eating more ‘cruciferous’ vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and kale (you can find a list online) and citrus fruits, as well as insoluble fibre. No crucifixion: Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, types of cabbage and kale . This is found in whole grains, carrots, flax and other seeds. It binds itself to excess oestrogen in the digestive tract and carries it out. Muscle mass also decreases as we age, which can slow the rate at which we burn calories (meaning you’ll gain weight even if you eat the same amount). To combat this, try adding some musclestrengthening exercises to your daily routine – which can easily be done at home using some Pilates bands, a set of hand weights or even a TRX machine – a suspension system. Pilates is a brilliant exercise for strengthening and slimming the core. A few private sessions at home will be more effective in targeting your specific problems. I have developed a medical condition as a result of which I suffer from very tender and painful hands and wrists. Can you recommend general exercises that do not involve me having to lean on my hands? I do not swim and already walk as an exercise. There are many ways to stay fit without using your hands. You’re already a walker but have you thought about running? It’s one of the easiest ways to work out, as the only equipment you need is a good pair of running shoes. I’m also a big fan of high intensity interval training (HIIT), where you perform one exercise for 20-30 seconds and rest for 10, for a cycle of eight rounds.

"By . Sophie Borland . Patients are dying on the operating table while undergoing a common type of hip replacement, the former chief medical officer has warned. A study carried out by Professor Liam Donaldson found at least 41 deaths in seven years have been directly linked to the use of chemical ‘cement’ in the procedure. The substance is a form of transparent glue used in more than half of partial hip replacements, where patients have fractured the top of the femur. Procedure: The risk of death from a hip transplant is 1 in 3,000 - but the frequency seems to be increasing . Although the risk of death or harm is low - 1 in every 3,000 operations – the frequency appears to be increasing. Only one death was reported in 2005, rising to seven in 2007 and to 16 by 2012. While this may partly be down to better recording, Professor Donaldson and his team are concerned that as the population ages, more patients will be at risk. Around 22,000 patients undergo the procedure every year, and surgeons often use cement to ensure the new joint is properly attached to the patient’s bone. But Professor Donaldson and his colleagues at Imperial College London believe that in some instances, chemicals from the cement enter the blood stream and disturb the heart rhythm. In others, surgeons may be pushing the cement into the joint too forcibly, dislodging a ball of fat which enters the blood stream and blocks one of the main arteries. Operation: 22,000 people have hip replacements every year, and cement is used in many of the operations . In a study published in the British Medical Journal, they analysed safety incidents reported by hospitals in England and Wales from 2005 to 2012. They established that 41 deaths from heart attacks had occurred as a result of hip replacements over that time. In nearly all cases the attack  happened on the operating table. They also found a further 21 cases where patients had suffered severe heart attacks but survived. Professor Donaldson, who was the chief medical officer for England from 1998 to 2010, said: ‘Cement tends to be the main method for inserting hips in the UK. In other countries such as Canada it isn’t used at all.’ He added: ‘[Patient death] is caused by one of two things. Some chemical enters the blood and disturbs the heart rhythm. 'The other is that when the cement is pushed into the marrow of the bone it causes a fat embolism, a ball of fat enters the blood stream and that gets lodged in one of the main arteries. The death often comes almost immediately.’ He urged surgeons to monitor safety guidelines which instruct them to check patients’ hearts before they have the operation. Additionally, he said they needed to have a ‘serious look’ at whether patients really needed to have cement – especially if they were at high risk of having a heart attack. Doctor Paul Rutter, another of the researchers, said: ‘The risk is not enormous but it’s significant enough that we should try to understand and take account of it. ‘Bone cement implantation syndrome happens and it’s killing people in the UK. ‘It’s rare but it’s not extremely rare. There are measures that anaesthetists and surgeons can take to prevent this happening. Our study clearly shows an ongoing issue that has not yet been wholly addressed by research.’ The alert comes on the back of a study from the US which showed that the total number of hip replacements doubled between 1993 and 2009. The rise is believed to be a result of an increasingly overweight population.","Study by former chief medical officer found deaths linked to chemical glue .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . A British retailer believes it may have cracked the recipe to the croissant-doughnut hybrid delicacy that took New York by storm. Greggs say its take on the cronut - dubbed the Greggsnut - is the most exciting launch at the store since the birth of the sausage roll. The Greggsnut has been two months in development and goes on sale tomorrow at £1 for a limited time. Greggs, more famous for its sausage rolls, pasties and iced buns, is certainly taking on the bakery big guns by throwing its hat in the hybrid ring. Taste . sensation? Greggs say the Greggsnut - their version of the cronut - is . the most exciting innovation since the advent of the sausage roll . The bona fide cronut, conceived by and sold exclusively at Dominique Ansel bakery in New York, managed to do what no other baked good has done before. Not even the Krispy Kreme in its heyday could command the sort of hysteria and headlines that the cronut has garnered. Customers slept outside the small bakery to be first in line outside the shop. Tussles broke out when customers who had been queuing since as early as 4am vyed to get their hands on the dwindling supplies. Supermodel Heidi Klum gave a box its . own seat on a private jet so that her family could try them. The bakery was forced to limit purchases to one box per customer to meet demand, but scalpers . capitalised by selling them on for $100 each cronut - or $3,000 for ten. Perfect pastry? The $5 (£3.20) cronut was . unveiled by New York's Dominique Ansel bakery on May 10 - and almost immediately gained almost mythical status as pastry-lovers fought to get their hands on one . The original cronut is said to be made lovingly using featherlight layers of pastry that are deep-fried, rolled in rose sugar and filled with Tahitian cream. The Greggsnut, which comes in two flavours, berry or caramel-pecan, is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape, fried, iced, and filled with either berry cream or caramel. It took Greggs' bakers two months to . perfect the recipe - which they say (of course they do) is a 'taste . sensation'. 'We saw how successful the Cronut was in New York and . challenged ourselves to make a British version,' a spokesman said. 'We believe the Greggsnut could be the most exciting product launch at Greggs since the birth of the sausage roll and are hoping the combination of a Greggs own layered pastry shaped into a doughnut captures the taste buds of London.' 'Hopefully Heidi Klum will order some to be flown over to her from one of our shops!' THE CRONUT ACCORDING TO DOMINIQUE ANSEL . The cronut, which has already received . interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Los . Angeles, is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep . fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian . vanilla cream. Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, . which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, . crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish. 'A cronut is not . as simple as frying up some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We . actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded . different than a croissant'. Ansel has expressed concern that scalpers are said that his cronuts . Man behind the invention: 'I'm a big fan of . quality over quantity... It takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries . are up to par with standards as well,' said Mr Ansel . AND ACCORDING TO GREGGS: . 'It took master bakers at the UK’s leading bakery retailer two months to perfect the recipe which Paul Birchall, Head of Product Research and Development, says is a taste sensation. The Greggsnut, which will be available for £1 in selected shops in London from tomorrow (6 September) until 1 October, is a combination of Greggs' own layered pastry formed into the shape of a doughnut and is available in two flavours, summer berry & crème and caramel and pecan.

The arrival of U.S. forces was announced as combatants with the ISIS took control of all border crossings with Syria and Jordan. ISIS insurgents have gained control throughout most of northern Iraq, but Iraqi military spokesman Major General Qassim Atta says all towns on the road between Samarra and Baghdad are still under its control. However, ISIS militants are fighting in towns as close as Fallujah, less than an hour away to the west. Scroll down for video . Getting closer: ISIS has taken control of the towns Al Waleed, Trbeil and Qaim, erasing Iraq's border with Syria and Jordan.

Kingmaker: Kurdish President Massoud Barzani, right, shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the presidential palace in Irbil yesterday. Kerry insists the deployment of U.S. forces is 'not intervention' Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged leaders of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region to stand with Baghdad and played down the deployment of American military forces, saying it does not equate to 'intervention'. Speaking to U.S. journalist Andrea Mitchell, Kerry called the deployment an 'advisory' mission, which includes 'planning, advising, some training and assisting'. 'We are not here in a combat role. We are not here to fight. And the president has no intention – none whatsoever – of returning American combat troops in Iraq to go back to where we were,' he said. On Capitol Hill, senators who left a . closed briefing with senior Obama administration officials expressed . hope Iraq could soon form a new government, perhaps in the next week, . facilitating greater U.S. military action against ISIS. Senator Lindsey Graham, . R-S.C., who attended that meeting, backed what he described as an . advancing American strategy. Nowhere to go: Men and women stand in a temporary displacement camp for Iraqis caught-up in the fighting in and around the city of Mosul yesterday. Tens of thousands of people have now fled Iraq's second largest city . Displaced: Children walk with bottles of water in a field beside the temporary refugee camp outside Mosul. Their families fled the city after it was overrun by ISIS militants earlier this month . At . the Pentagon, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters the troops in . Baghdad included two teams of special forces and about 90 advisers, . intelligence analysts, commandos and some other support personnel needed . to set up a joint operations center in the Iraqi capital. Another four . teams of special forces would arrive in the next few days, Kirby said. Those . troops, added to the approximately 360 other U.S. forces that are in . and around the embassy in Baghdad to perform security, would bring the . total U.S military presence in Iraq to about 560. Kirby also said the U.S. was conducting up to 35 surveillance missions over Iraq daily to provide intelligence on the situation on the ground as Iraqi troops battle the aggressive and fast-moving insurgency. President Barack Obama last week announced he would send as many as 300 advisers into Iraq to assess and advise Iraqi security forces. Part of that plan involved setting up two joint operating centers — one in Baghdad and the other in northern Iraq, where a lot of the fighting has taken place. Support: Nearly half the U.S. military advisers pledged by President Obama to aid Iraq are now in Baghdad setting up operations to help combat the ISIS insurgency. Pictured above are Iraqi volunteers in Karbala . The teams, largely made up of Army . Green Berets, will evaluate the readiness of the Iraqi troops and their . senior headquarters commanders in an effort to determine how best the . U.S. can bolster the security force and where other additional advisers . might be needed. Kirby said . the initial assessments from the teams could be completed in the next . two weeks to three weeks, but he said there was no timeline for how long . the troops would be in Iraq. 'I don't have a fixed date for you as a deadline or an end date, but it's very clear this will be a limited, short-term mission,' he said. He said the insurgency was well organized and aided by foreign fighters and Sunni sympathizers in the country. The briefing for all senators Tuesday . evening was led by Anne Patterson, the top U.S. diplomat for the . Mideast, and included military and intelligence officials. 'There is some hope that a new government can be formed fairly soon,' Graham told reporters afterward. ISIS militants have gotten as close to Baghdad as the town of Fallujah, just 44 miles away. Above, ISIS militants are pictured patrolling the town on Saturday . He . said U.S. airstrikes probably would be necessary at some point, but . accepted the Obama administration's rationale that first a more . inclusive Iraqi government must be formed that peels off moderate . Sunnis. Graham said the U.S. could start hitting the Sunni extremists at their bases in Syria, however. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., similarly urged U.S. action against the rebels' commanders and supply lines. 'This is not about saving Iraq or saving the government of Iraq or about building a country in Iraq,' Rubio said. 'That's a long-term goal for the Iraqi people. This is an urgent counterterrorism situation that our country faces. It grows more dire by the moment. Our options become more limited by the moment.' Both senators stressed the need for the U.S. to help defend Jordan. Graham said the threat of extremists extending their efforts from Syria and Iraq into Jordan was made very clear by the administration.

Chen partnered the event with the New York City Rescue Mission, the oldest shelter in the nation. However, the New York Post reported that an extra 100 homeless people showed up to the Boathouse, who were not let into the charity event. The excess homeless who were left out, booed and yelled 'Liar', 'Conman' and swore at the millionaire.

"By . Mia De Graaf . The BBC today apologised after a weather bulletin warned festival-goers heading to Glastonbury to 'prepare for rape'. The blunder appeared in a subtitle on a forecast broadcast live on BBC One after the 10pm news. Stunned viewers were warned to 'prepare for rape' rather than to 'prepare for rain' as experts predicted stormy weather would hit the UK this week. Blunder: Viewers were quick to photograph the subtitle blunder after BBC News At Ten when they were told to expect 'rape' at Glastonbury festival, which kicks off this weekend, rather than 'rain' as predicted . After spotting they had typed the word 'rape' instead of 'rain' subtitle writers quickly corrected the message. They wrote: 'As we head into Thursday, people going to Glastonbury will want to prepare for rape because this rain is heading - prepare for rain because this rain is heading right for you.' But spectators were quick to take photographs of the blunder and post it on social media website Instagram. One viewer said: 'I was shocked when . the word ‘rape’ popped up on my screen during the weather forecast as . I’d just turned the sound down. 'I wondered what on earth was going on until they started typing about rain. It was a very unfortunate mistake to make.' The gates at Glastonbury Festival open today with music starting on Friday. Anxious: Thousands of Glastonbury ticket-holders were tuning in to catch the forecast ahead of the festival . Embarrassing: The BBC marks the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores' during a bulletin in January. The channel later insisted the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to 'horse' Error: A reporter's comment that 'pigs nibble anything, even wellies' takes on a different meaning when the last word is substituted for 'willies'.

More recently, a reporter's comment that pig nibble on 'wellies' was translated to 'willies' - to the amusement of hundreds of Twitter users and comedians. And on Match Of The Day, the subtitle writers had a hard time getting to grips with the spelling of Adnan Junazaj, opting instead for 'Janet jazz jazz jam'. Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night before heavy metal band Metallica play on the same stage on Saturday. British rock band Kasabian will close the festival on Sunday night.

A . BBC spokeswoman said: 'We try to ensure our subtitling is as accurate . as possible but there are occasions when mistakes inevitably occur. 'On this occasion the result was this unfortunate typo which was corrected as soon as possible.' Hilarious subtitle blunders have aired on the BBC over the years - leaving both staff and viewers lost for words. They are among many mistakes to have prompted a crackdown on the quality of subtitles, with a report set to be published by Ofcom this spring. One gaffe sees the broadcaster mark the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores'.

People around the globe celebrate.’ However, the channel later insisted that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the 'year of the horse’. Lost in translation: Last Sunday, the BBC struggled to get to grips with the name of footballer Adnan Junazaj - misspelling his name as 'Janet jazz, jazz jam'. However, it correctly spelled the names of other players . Shocking: A man sees his son Fraser's name changed to 'phrase whore' in one particularly toe-curling blunder .

The broadcaster correctly spelled the names of other United players Javier Hernandez, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata - before stumbling over the youngster's name. Its hilarious attempts at janet, jazz, jazz and jam left those watching the programme with subtitles scratching their heads as they tried to work out what was actually being said. And it isn't the first time the BBC has misspelled a name to amusing effect. The broadcaster has previously referred to Italian prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as 'Mr Beryl Beryl' - while Labour leader Ed Miliband became 'Ed Miller Band'.","Weather forecast of rain was translated as 'rape' after BBC News At Ten .

Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on November 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day . He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case. Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy. 'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.' In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut.","The U.S. women's soccer team goalkeeper has been accused of hitting her sister and 17-year-old nephew .

"By . Tara Brady . Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ¿high risk¿ . A super fit Naval worker who died on an adventure trip through a notorious ‘Valley of Death’ in the Himalayas was so sick she was unable to tie her own shoelaces, an inquest heard today. Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ‘high risk’ by the UK based The Adventure Company. She flew into Kathmandu with two friends on 15 April, 2011 and began to travel on foot to base camp Mount Everest, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told. Miss Burke began to show signs of possible altitude sickness and was struggling to keep up with the group as they trekked through the Gokoyo Valley, which has been nicknamed the ‘Valley of Death’. Her hand-eye co-ordination had failed and she was left unable to tie her shoelaces. She was breathless and coughing and her lips were tinged with purple. On the sixth day of the hike she was taken on foot partway back down the mountain and died the following day, April 23, in Dole, Kathmandu. Kelly Morgan, a friend who joined Miss Burke on the hike, said that after days of trekking in the sun, the trip became dramatically tougher. ‘We were exhausted arriving at Dole,’ she said. The following day, on April 21, Miss Burke began to lag behind the group, struggling to reach the next check point at Machermo 90 minutes behind with ‘a tinge of purple’ to her lips. ‘We did notice that her lips looked a little purple and I asked her how she was going. Tragic: Photograph shows Rachel Burke pictured on her trekking holiday before she died in 2011 . ‘With Rachel’s good spirits she replied ""I’m fine"". ‘We were all a little breathless.’ At this point the group had reached an altitude of 4,470 metres and the nights had grown ‘very cold’. ‘She said she wasn’t feeling very well and that is when we decided that we needed to tell Ashok (the guide) and we thought that she shouldn’t continue,’ Ms Morgan said. ‘None of us had slept very well last night so she was tired and lethargic with a tinge of purple, she still had the cough and generally felt unwell. ‘I had a cough, I felt tired but Rachel was worse than us. ‘She had lost her spirit which was unusual for Rachel,’ she said. Rachel Burke was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday . ‘Every other morning she had been able to tie up her shoelaces and pack, we didn’t notice initially. ‘It wasn’t until we went back to have something to eat that we noticed that her shoelaces were undone.’ Miss Burke agreed to descend the mountain and was last seen ‘walking into the distance’. That evening Ms Morgan and friend Becky Everest used a satellite phone to tell ‘a man in Kathmandu’ their friend’s insurance details and she was later pronounced dead. ‘There was no way that you couldn’t notice her symptoms,’ said Ms Everest who confirmed that she had seen Miss Burke being given Diamox for her symptoms. Practices at The Adventure Company were put under the magnifying glass at the hearing as it transpired that she may have been left with an assistant not trained in altitude sickness after falling ill. Zoe Rebbeck-McAndrew was working as a health and safety executive at the company when they revised the risk assessment for the trip. ‘I know that the tour leaders had all the five-day wildnerness training and all the assistant guides had AMS (acute mountain sickness) training as well,’ she said. ‘You don’t look at the assistants?’ said Coroner Doctor Andrew Harris. ‘I don’t, no,’ she replied. ‘Is there a reason for drawing a line between the assistants and the guides?’ ‘If someone was suffering from AMS, I would assume that the guide would go with them or they would be evacuated off the mountain.’ But Dr Harris said there was ‘some evidence that an assistant took Rachel’ after she became unwell. And Ms Rebbeck-McAndrew told the inquest that the tour brochure underestimated the height of the mountain at 3,780m prior to completing her assessment. Map showing the 'Valley of Death' in the Himalayas where Rachel Burke fell ill . The trip, which included a 640-metre ascent in one day when the recommended distance is 300 metres ‘escaped my notice’, she said. ‘There was no incidents that I had looked at, the trip was very well established when I picked it up so there was no changes to that (risk assessment),’ she explained. Paul Medley, national director, said that the company was not aware that there was a rescue post in the area Miss Burke died and said she was not taken for medical attention before she died. Miss Burke, of Orpington, Kent, had just completed a half marathon and played squash at least once a week.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A teenager who pinned a 'lovable' father of two to the floor then punched him repeatedly has been spared jailed for his brutal attack - even though his victim had a fatal heart attack ten minutes later. Shane Lethbridge, 19, had a grudge against Colin Palmer, 57, and beat him on the street in Biscovey, Cornwall. He was found guilty of assault at Bodmin Magistrates' Court in Cornwall - but the trial heard that he was not to blame for the death as Mr Palmer already had heart disease. Attack: Shane Lethbridge, left, pinned Colin Palmer, right, to the floor in Biscovey, Cornwall, and beat him repeatedly. Ten minutes later Mr Palmer died of a heart attack . However, experts said the 'sustained' and 'violent' attack couldn't be 'discounted' as a potential factor which contributed to the death. The court heard how, after the attack, Mr Palmer got to his feet and staggered to a stranger’s door 'red-faced and breathless', begging for help. He collapsed on the pavement moments later and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead having suffered a heart attack. Bodmin Magistrates Court heard Lethbridge’s “sustained, violent and totally unjust” attack had likely “played a role” in Mr Palmer’s death. But the court was told that his victim was suffering from heart disease and diabetes and could have suffered a heart attack at any moment. Lethbridge, an engineering contractor, denied assault by beating but was found guilty by District Judge Nicholas Sanders after a two-day summary trial. He sentenced him to six months in a Young Offenders’ Institution, suspended for 18 months. Judge Sanders told him: 'My sympathy goes out to Mr Palmer’s friends and family - but this is not a trial for murder but for a common assault which was carried out about ten minutes before. 'It is clear to me that Mr Lethbridge did have a grudge against Mr Palmer but I can’t exclude the possibility that Mr Palmer played some role in how the incident started. This was a sustained, violent and totally unjust attack in Mr Palmer. 'He was vulnerable because of his age and illness and evidence suggests your actions played a role in his death from heart problems. 'It is clear you used considerable force and intended more harm on him than you caused at the time.' The trial heard Lethbridge had 'a long-standing grudge' against Mr Palmer, a loading vehicle driver. who had been a family friend until the teen’s parents divorced. Attack: The 'violent, sustained' beating of Mr Palmer by Lethbridge took place in Biscovery, Cornwall, pictured . Prosecutor Anthony Eskander said Lethbridge punched Mr Palmer several times to the head and body before throwing him to the ground when they bumped into one another in the street on August 18 last year. Lethbridge’s friend, Ashley Curtis, said he helped Mr Palmer to his feet and he walked off. Mr Curtis told the court: 'It wasn’t a fight - it was a girly scrap. Shane was on top and the old boy was kicking Shane.” However, another teenage witness told the court: 'Shane was on top and started shouting at Mr Palmer. He was speaking to him as if he had done something wrong. 'He had aggression in his voice. A lot of punches were thrown, you could hear the thumps when he hit him. I only saw Mr Palmer trying to defend himself.' Ten minutes after the attack in Biscovey, Cornwall, Jonathen L’Anson answered his door to Mr Palmer, who collapsed shortly afterwards and was later pronounced dead. Lethbridge was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but he told police he only hit the older man once in self-defence after he was kicked. A custody suite nurse found just a red mark on his upper body and a graze to his elbow, while Mr Palmer had abrasions, bruises and a fractured skull. However Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said the wounds could have been caused by him collapsing to the floor or by vigorous attempts to resuscitate him. He concluded that Mr Palmer was killed by a heart attack and could have died at any time, but said the stress of being assault 'couldn’t be discounted as a possible contributory factor'. Judge Sanders said he took into account Lethbridge’s previous good character and age in deciding to suspend his prison term. Lethbridge, from St Blazey Gate, Cornwall, was also ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid community work, handed a six-month curfew and was ordered told to pay £620 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Mr Palmer’s family issued a statement afterwards, saying: 'Colin was a cuddly, loveable guy who everybody said had a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face. 'He managed to go out every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend, for 20 years and never got into a fight, which shows the sort of character he was. 'We are pleased that the truth is finally out there; that Colin was a kind and loveable man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' 'We have been robbed of a father, a son, a brother and a friend, and he will never ever be forgotten.'","Shane Lethbridge, 19, beat Colin Palmer, 57, in 'violent, sustained' attack .

Tara Moore managed to produce one of those eternally frustrating  British performances that promise much and yet inevitably seem to result in  crushing defeat. It’s the hope that gets you, every time, whatever sport it happens to be. The 21-year-old’s blistering forehand helped her fight back to level the match at one set all against 2010 Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva overnight and she gained an early break of serve in the third when play resumed on Court No 2 yesterday. But, serving for a place in the second round at 5-4, an all-too familiar case of nerves overtook the British No 5. She slipped to 0-40, had a let-off when Zvonareva missed a forehand and then saved another break point, only to double fault and gift the game to her Russian opponent. Deflated: Britain's Tara Moore lost in the first round of Wimbledon, despite serving for the match at one stage . Experience: Russia's Vera Zvonareva was just too much to handle for her opponent in the end . Moore insisted Zvonareva, a former . world No 2 who has slipped to 566 in the rankings after two years dogged . by injury, did not ‘give her anything’ but, although the British player . managed to hold two further service games before losing 9-7 in the . third set, the collective chorus of groans around Court No 2 told the . real story. After fighting . so hard for two hours and 45 minutes over two days, the Briton had . choked when it mattered most against an  opponent whose pedigree . certainly outshone her performance. Both players had needed wildcards to make the main draw, but only one seized her opportunity with both hands. Moore, . however, had only praise for Zvonareva, who will meet Donna Vekic of . Croatia in the second round. ‘She played good on the big points,’ said . Moore. ‘She didn’t give me . anything. She made me work for everything. I think I did the same for . her. She had to try very hard to beat me. She was No 2 in the world and I . pushed her to her limits. ‘I was nervous out there obviously playing on a really big court and I am just very grateful to play on such a good court. ‘I hope that I’ve really showed them that I wanted to be there and I tried my hardest.’ Fist pump: Moore did manage to raise money for charity by producing this celebration on Wednesday . Perhaps . it was little wonder Moore was so upbeat after a day in which she . earned £31,500 for losing in the first round of the singles and then in . the ladies’ doubles with partner Johanna Konta.

That is how long it took Sania Mirza and Cara Black to sweep away the Swiss legend and her doubles partner Vera Zvonareva. Hingis, who lost in the third round of the singles in 2007, was once box office gold at the All England Club.

It is easy to forget that at 33, Hingis is three months younger than Venus Williams, who is still alive in the singles and doubles at SW19. Hingis is still enthusiastic about tennis, offering her services as a TV pundit and was courtside as Zvonareva beat Briton Tara Moore in the singles.

DOUBLES DELIGHT . The mixed . doubles at Wimbledon is the most prestigious of all the Grand Slams, . featuring a 48-pair draw compared to 32 at the other three majors. Former . Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis was undoubtedly the showpiece name in . the draw which was made yesterday as the 33-year-old teams up with . Brazilian Bruno Soares, while the all-British pairing of Ross Hutchins . and Heather Watson will prove popular with spectators.

Sights set: Jamie Murray claims he is more interested in the men's doubles event this year . MURRAY TARGET . Former mixed doubles champion Jamie Murray may have entered the event with Australia’s Casey Dellacqua this year but his focus is very much on adding the men’s doubles title to his collection. Murray, after teaming up with Aussie John Peers to beat Dan Evans and James Ward on Wednesday, said:  ‘I’d rather do well in the men’s doubles. I would much rather we got a run going in that.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Ever wondered the secret to making perfect ice cream? Well wonder no more, because the science of the sweet has been revealed in a video that explains the methods to get different results. From hard and ‘crunchy’ to a softer treat, YouTube channel Reactions takes a look at how the consistency of ice cream depends on the rate at which it is cooled. Scroll down for video . What's the science behind getting creamy or hard ice cream (stock image shown)? In a new video YouTube channel Reactions explains how the faster ice cream is cooled, the smoother it will be. This is because a rapid freezing process makes smaller crystals, leading to a creamier treat . In the video, it is explained how the crystals in ice cream determine the consistency. A gene linked to obesity, which makes ice cream and sugary foods tastier for girls, was discovered by scientists last year. Researchers . claim the discovery of the gene means it might not be our fault if we . make poor food choices - and could partly help explain obesity. Contrary . to 'blaming' obese people for making poor food choices, the Canadian . researchers say that obesity is caused by genetic predisposition, . environmental stress and emotional wellbeing. They discovered a gene variant - or allele - which regulates the production of the pleasure hormone, dopamine. The . findings, published in the journal Appetite, could be an important step . towards prevention and treatment of the condition, they claim. Professor . Michael Meaney of McGill University, Montreal, said: 'In broad terms, . we are finding that obesity is a product of genetics, early development . and circumstance.' ‘What you’re doing when you make creamy ice cream is you control the size of ice crystals in your ice cream,’ says Dr Matthew Hartings from the American University in the video. He explains that ice crystals start off as a ‘hexagonal shape’. When more ice is added the crystals grow, and the bigger they get, the crunchier the final ice cream becomes. For a creamier treat, the crystals need to be small. There are two ways to do that, the first being to use an emulsifier. This keeps the water molecules and fats mixed together, preventing the water freezing in clumps and allowing for smaller ice crystals. The second way is to change the rate at which the water freezes; the faster it cools, the smaller the crystals and the smoother the ice cream. In the video Dr Matthew Hartings from the American University in Washington DC shows how three different methods can produce ice cream with different textures. The smoothest ice cream is created when liquid nitrogen (pictured) is used to rapidly cool the treat, while the crunchiest stems from using salt and ice in a bag . To test this, Dr Hartings makes ice cream in three ways: using an ice cream maker, then salt and ice in a bag and finally using liquid nitrogen. The salt and ice method produces the ‘crunchiest’ ice cream as it takes the longest to cool. Next up is the ice cream maker, which takes about 30 minutes, while the much faster liquid nitrogen produces the smoothest results. Dr Hartings also explains that mixing the ice cream ensures air spreads through it, helping with flavour and stability. And it’s also noted how the cold temperature numbs the taste buds on the tongue, meaning lots of sugar and fat is needed in ice cream, which is why melted ice cream tastes sweeter. But, the video concludes, 'we’re not saying you have to buy liquid nitrogen and start blasting your ice cream with it, but at least you now know why your ice cream treat is so silky smooth.’","Dr Matthew Hartings from Washington DC explains how to make ice cream .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . It’s not often little Albion Rovers send tremors across the world football - but that’s exactly what they did in March when the part-timers from Scottish football’s lowest tier were just 12 minutes from eliminating Rangers in a Scottish Cup quarter-final at Ibrox. There was a similar, if not so well publicised, aftershock earlier this month when the Coatbridge club announced they had sacked the manager responsible for their best run in the tournament since 1936. Not only was James Ward brutally binned despite steering the club to its biggest-ever payday – earning £400,000 before losing to Rangers in a replay – his bulleting came just weeks after he had penned a new one-year contract and signed 15 new players for the new season.

Gone: Ward got within 12 minutes of masterminding a win over Rangers in the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In his place have come rookie boss Darren Young, the former Aberdeen and Dunfermline midfielder, and experienced sidekick Sandy Clark. On the back of Ward’s achievements, Rovers had garnered bucket-loads of positive publicity on their way to the last-eight, especially after donating £10,000 of their cup cash to a children’s charity. His abrupt departure shone a less favourable spotlight on the uncharacteristic ruthlessness of Rovers, as Ward bemoaned his ‘shock’ and ‘surprise’ at being shown the door after a run that also saw Motherwell eliminated. On Tuesday, however, as new boss Young was officially paraded, the impressively plain-speaking Rovers chairman John Devlin set the record straight in pretty damning fashion. For all the plaudits that accompanied their best cup run in 78 years, last season’s seventh place finish in League Two was deemed ‘unacceptable’. The team’s end-of-season performances, after Ward had signed his new deal, were deemed as particularly unappetising.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Content: Sue Bramley insists she's happy at her home, despite it being the scene of a murder . A mother . whose back garden once contained the bodies of a murdered couple has . spoken of her profound shock at the discovery of their remains, saying . that she 'went to pieces'. Sue . Bramley and her 15-year-old daughter live at a property in Mansfield . where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia . Wycherley – Susan’s parents – in 1998 and buried the bodies under the . lawn. They remained a macabre secret until 2013, with Ms Bramley a resident since 2006. Ms Bramley described how she was horrified when Nottinghamshire detectives phoned her at work in October last year and told her about their grim discovery - of remains buried three feet beneath her lawn. She said: ‘It was terrible. I went to pieces. I came home and all these people arrived in white suits. I've lost track of what happened, I was so emotional.’ But although the unearthing of the remains proved a huge shock to Ms Bramley, she insists she’ll be perfectly happy to stay at the house. She told the BBC: ‘A lot of people have said, “How can you possibly still live there?”’ ‘But I love our home. We have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times here. ‘I have lived here all this time and the Wycherleys have not done me any harm. They are not going to do my any harm now. I am going to stay.’ Ms Bramley said she ‘never really thought anything’ of the area in her garden where grass would not grow, where it would later emerge the Wycherleys had been buried. ‘We used to have birthday parties in the garden, which my young nieces and nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area. My nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and I just think, “how close, how close”.’ Ms Bramley spoke out as the Edwards, who successfully hid their crime for 16 years, were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of William, 85 and 63-year-old Patricia. For years, Susan, 56, and Christopher, 57, kept claiming the Wycherleys' benefits, stealing £245,000 from them, and conning friends and relatives that they were still alive. The Edwards, who were found guilty of murder last week, have to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars, a judge at Nottingham Crown Court ruled. Sentencing the pair, Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said the Edwards had created ‘an elaborate charade’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the Wycherleys. Scroll down for video . Grisly: Sue Bramley and her daughter live at a property in Mansfield where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia Wycherley – Susan’s parents – in 1998 . Shocking: Ms Bramley said that she went to pieces when the bodies of William and Patricia Wycherley were dug up at the house she rents in 2013 . She said the facts of the case were ‘so serious and your culpability so high’ that she had no choice but impose minimum terms of 25 years each, for each of the two murders, to run concurrently. The court heard that the debt-ridden couple shot their victims at their home in Mansfield on the May bank holiday, with the couple then buried in a metre-deep hole in their own back garden. For the next 15 years, the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that Mr Wycherley, 85, and his 63-year-old wife were alive. The debt-ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘reclusive’ Wycherleys were still alive and had simply moved away, faking their signatures on official documents, and sending Christmas cards and letters apparently from them to family members. As a result, they were able to rake in almost £250,000 in pensions, credit, and the sale of the Wycherley’s home - much of which celebrity-obsessed Susan, who also felt her parents had ‘swindled’ her out of a £10,000 inheritance in the 1970s, spent on correspondence signed by her favourite stars. The 56-year-old was fixated with powerful older men - including Hollywood actors Gerard Depardieu and Gary Cooper, legendary football manager Bill Shankly, entertainer Frank Sinatra, and political giants Winston Churchill and General Charles De Gaulle. Behind bars: Susan and Christopher Edwards have been sentenced to life in prison . Evidence: Police believe this Second World War Commando Colt .38 calibre revolver was used in the murders in Nottinghamshire in 1998 . Their elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until 2012 when the Centenarian Department of the Department of Work and Pensions wrote to Mr Wycherley, who would have been approaching his 100th birthday, and asked for a face-to-face meeting. The Edwards panicked and fled their council home in Dagenham, East London, to Lille in northern France, renting a flat which they paid for in cash. Christopher Edwards, who could speak fluent French, attempted to find work but was unsuccessful. Revelations: The judge accepted accusations from Mrs Edwards that her father, William Wycherley (pictured) had abused her . By October last year, they were fast running out of cash. In desperation, Christopher, 57, called his stepmother, Elizabeth Edwards, back in the UK to ask for money – then told her the stunning revelation that the Wycherleys were buried in their garden. He also gave her the version of events that Elizabeth Edwards should stick to during their police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the conversation finished. Stunned detectives then made the grim discovery of the Wycherley’s remains and contacted Christopher Edwards using phone numbers and an email address he had given his stepmother. He eventually replied and arranged to return to the UK, and the couple were arrested at St Pancras International railway station a month after the Wycherleys were unearthed. The only possessions the Edwards, who had just one Euro left to their name, brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia. Included were five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star Gary Cooper, which Susan had splashed out more than £14,000 on during 2009 and 2011. It was a sign of Susan’s obsession with celebrities, a fascination which the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself posing as the French actor Gerard Depardieu. The fake 14-year correspondence, between 1992 and 2006, even deceived her own husband, with Susan acquiring a machine to make it seem as though the letters had a French postmark. Despite stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the Wycherleys, including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for £66,000 in 2005, the Edwards remain deep in debt, owing around £160,000 to creditors. Sentencing the couple on Monday, Mrs Justice Thirlwall described the killings as ‘shocking crimes’. She told the ‘self-contained couple’ that so far as they were concerned ‘only the two of you mattered’. The judge told Susan Edwards, who sat staring intently from the dock wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses, that she was ‘an accomplished liar and a fantasist’. Mrs Justice Thirlwall accepted ‘on balance’ that she had told the truth about being sexually abused by Mr Wycherley as a child and that had formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father. ‘That background may explain why you hated him, which you did, and why you have no remorse about killing him,’ she said. The judge said she did not believe Mrs Wycherley had ever known of that abuse, as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her.","Sue Bramley lives at a house that was the scene of a double murder .

Those of the DNA diet lost 33 per cent more weight than those on standard plans (library image) A DNA diet, in which you eat certain foods based on your genes, could help you to lose a third more weight than calorie counting, experts claim. They put dieters on one of five eating plans based on the results of a mouth swab test. Obese patients using these plans lost 33 per cent more weight than those on standard diets, they said. Scientists behind the method claim our individual genetic make-up means that our bodies process fats and carbohydrates differently, so some of us put on more weight than others even when we eat the same foods. But other experts are sceptical and say more research is needed. The DNA diet, which is available commercially, involves taking a swab test using a DIY kit and sending the results for analysis. Dieters are assigned one of five plans, such as low carbohydrate, low fat and Mediterranean. In a study of 191 obese people, those using this diet lost 33 per cent more weight than those counting calories, the European Human Genetics Conference in Milan was told. Dr Nicola Pirastu and her team, from the University of Trieste in Italy, monitored 87 obese patients on the DNA diet for two years, as well as 104 who were on standard diets, in which they simply ate 600 fewer calories a day. Their Body Mass Index, or BMI, was also recorded. BMI is a way of measuring weight that takes height into account. A healthy BMI is between 18 and 25. Those on DNA diets saw their BMI go down by an average of 1.8 points, while the other group saw it decrease by 1.3 points. Patients on a DNA diet also gained more muscle, at an average of 6.1 per cent compared to 5.3 per cent. Dr Pirastu said: ‘Although there were no significant differences in age, sex and BMI between the two groups at the beginning of the trial, we found people who followed the gene-based diet lost 33 per cent more weight than the controls over two years.’ Dr Keith Grimaldi of DNAFit, which makes the test, said: ‘The key is in what genes do. The idea that everyone could lose the same amount of weight on the same calorie-counting diet is wrong.’ Those behind the plan put dieters on one of five eating plans - such as low carbohydrate, low fat and Mediterranean - based on the results of a mouth swab test (library image) A quarter of adults are obese and the condition and related health problems are estimated to cost the NHS £5.1billion a year. The test, which dieters can take at home, costs £99 on the DNAFit website – but other experts say more evidence is needed before the diet can be called a success. Mariette Abrahams, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘It seems very interesting but it’s not going to change clinical practice. ‘We need to see more evidence and we need to know the exact breakdown of the foods these individuals were eating.’","DNA diet sees those who want to lose weight eat food based on genes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Middle-aged people who don’t get enough exposure to sunshine are twice as likely to die earlier, research warns. Around half of all adults in the UK are thought to have some degree of vitamin D deficiency. But scientists from the University of California’s San Diego School of Medicine found that people with an average age of 55 who had lower blood levels of vitamin D were twice as likely to die prematurely as those with higher levels. People with over 55 who had who had lower blood levels of vitamin D were twice as likely to die prematurely, research from the University of California suggests (library image) Vitamin D is made by the body under the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. A deficiency can cause problems when there is not enough of the vitamin to properly absorb the required levels of calcium and phosphate. Mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone pain and weakening of the bones – osteoporosis – which increases the risk of fractures. More severe levels of deficiency can lead to the development of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. And a 2010 British Medical Journal clinical review found that vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of developing heart disease, bowel and breast cancer, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Professor Cedric Garland said: 'Three years ago, the Institute of Medicine concluded that having a too-low blood level of vitamin D was hazardous. 'This study supports that conclusion, but goes one step further. 'The 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) blood level cutoff assumed from the IOM report was based solely on the association of low vitamin D with risk of bone disease. 'This new finding is based on the association of low vitamin D with risk of premature death from all causes, not just bone diseases.” Prof Garland said the blood level amount of vitamin D associated with about half of the death rate was 30 ng/ml. Sun-lovers: Half of UK adults have a vitamin D deficiency - which is created by the body under the skin when it is expose to sunlight (library image) Two-thirds of the U.S. population has an estimated blood vitamin D level below 30 ng/ml. Prof Heather Hofflich added: 'This study should give the medical community and public substantial reassurance that vitamin D is safe when used in appropriate doses up to 4,000 International Units (IU) per day. 'However, it’s always wise to consult your physician when changing your intake of vitamin D and to have your blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D checked annually. 'Daily intakes above 4,000 IU per day may be appropriate for some patients under medical supervision.' The study published in the American Journal of Public Health reported the average age when the blood was drawn was 55 years with the average length of follow-up was nine years. It involved 566,583 people from 14 countries.","Half of UK adults have some degree of vitamin D deficiency, data shows .

Heather Watson knows victory against world No 7 Angelique Kerber today would be the biggest win of her career, but the British No1 refuses to even contemplate the possibility of defeat. Watson was so nervous before her first-round win against Ajla Tomljanovic on Tuesday that she suffered a sleepless night, and then her jaw locked when she tried to eat a banana. But she insisted her worries had eased after clearing ‘the first hurdle’ in SW19. Prepared: Heather Watson says she is ready for the biggest match of her career against Angelique Kerber . Defeated: Watson played with Eugenie Bouchard in the doubles on Wednesday, but the pair lost out . The 22-year-old had only seven hours’ sleep and woke at 6.30am before losing with partner Eugenie Bouchard in the doubles yesterday 6-4, 7-6 to Australian pair Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacque, but insisted she feels in ‘great shape’ and is ready to cause an upset today. Watson added: ‘I enjoy every match but I enjoy winning them more than anything. It’s one of my favourite feelings in life. ‘I don’t think about the expectation at all. I’m not even worried what anyone else thinks. ‘I just love the game and everything that comes with it. I think being more aggressive is the only way forward. ‘I think you should go out and try to win the point instead of just hoping.’ Tough ask: Kerber will be the big favourite for the third round match . Asked if victory over Kerber would represent the biggest of her career, she replied: ‘It would be, on paper. To be in the third round again would be awesome. ‘I don’t even want to think about losing. That won’t be a thought that will go through my mind. ‘She (Kerber) might be better on paper but, especially in the women’s game, it’s very open. ‘The seeds get knocked out early on sometimes.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Three men, aged between 45 and 50, were arrested after police found them with nearly 1,100 illegally captured and mutilated frogs in Cantal, central France . A poaching gang are facing up to a year in jail and a £12,500 fine after they were allegedly caught slicing limbs off wild frogs and selling them to chefs. Three French men, aged between 45 and 50, were arrested after police found them with nearly 1,100 illegally captured and mutilated frogs. The men, who are all from Landeyrat, Cantal, France, had been equipped with professional traps and cages filled with the endangered species which they had been catching in wetland areas. They had planned to supply the frogs’ legs – a local delicacy in France – to chefs in the country's Auvergne region. Chefs are said to pay about £7 for a dozen pairs of home-grown frogs’ legs – which they usually serve with garlic and parsley. Police said the illegal frogs seized from the poaching gang would have been worth around £400 on the black market. Frogs’ legs, known as Cuisses de Grenouille, are so popular as a food in France that conservative estimates say up to 100 million pairs of frogs’ legs are eaten every year. The amphibians have been a protected species in France for more than 20 years, after the government ordered a ban on the hunting of them in the wild, and 99 per cent of the frogs’ legs consumed annually are imported. However, huge demand for the delicacy has led to several illegal poaching operations – although police said the most recent gang to be arrested were the ‘most prolific’ and ‘best organised’. Detectives arrested the trio following a long operation in which they used surveillance to catch the alleged poachers red-handed. Frogs’ legs, known as Cuisses de Grenouille, is a popular dish in France and it is estimated up to 100 million are eaten every single year. However, 99 per cent of the frogs’ legs consumed annually are imported . Officers found up to 1,100 captured frogs and wooden blocks and cleavers – used to chop them up – in disused farm buildings in Cantal, central France. Local police officer, Major Patrick Soubrier, told France’s Le Parisien newspaper: ‘It’s a first on this scale in Cantal, with this type of equipment and people who are clearly regulars at this. ‘We found protected species and non-protected ones. They were harvesting whatever they could.’","Three arrested after police find them with 1,100 illegally captured frogs .

The white marble mausoleum will receive the unusual treatment to help eliminate discolouration caused by pollution. The cleaning treatment is similar to a traditional mud pack used by Indian women on their faces to attain a natural glow. Marble masterpiece: The Taj Mahal is set to undergo a mud pack treatment to counter discolouration caused by pollution . Based in the city of Agra and not far from an oil refinery, the white marble of the UNESCO World Heritage Site yellows over time due to pollution. The lime-rich clay will be applied all over the building, left to dry then cleaned off using distilled water. It is the fourth time the Taj Mahal has undergone the treatment, which has previously been carried out in 1994, 2001 and 2008. The high levels of pollution in the area are why it has been carried out more frequently in recent years. The Taj Mahal is famed as the finest example of Mughal art in India and attracts millions of visitors every year. All white: The mud has been used three times before, the last time in 2008, as pollution from Agra and a nearby oil refinery cause discolouration of the white marble . Reassurance: The treatment will take place over six months so tourism won't be affected . It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan for his third wife Mumtaz Mahal, who was his favourite and died in childbirth, and was completed in 1653. During the beauty treatment the monument will remain open to tourists. B M Bhatnagar from the Archeological Survey of India told the Press Trust of India: 'In the last treatment, which cost around Rs.10.4 lakh ($24,000), a team of two dozen experts had carried out the work in small sections over a period of six months to ensure that the tourist inflow does not suffer.' The special mud pack is already being made and a 2mm-thick layer will be added to sections of the building soon.","The lime-rich clay mask is traditionally used by Indian women on their faces .

"By . David Mccormack . A simple Facebook thread lamenting the loss of a New York bagel store turned into an amazing and unusual heartfelt apology from one 50-something man to another after he recognized the name of someone he had stolen from more than 30 years ago. Michael Goodman was reading a thread about the closure of H&H Bagels on New York's Upper East Side when he recognized a name that brought memories flooding back from years before and an incident that he had never fully been able to forget. That name was Claude Soffel, who Goodman recalled accosting on the steps of The Museum of Natural History sometime in the late 1970s and mugging for his bus pass. Michael Goodman, right, was reading a Facebook thread about the closure of a New York bagel store when he recognized Claude Soffel's name, left, as the person he had robbed of his bus pass back in the late 1970s . ‘For some reason there were undercover Police right there & I was arrested on the spot. My Father had to leave work & come & get me (I was minor at the time) & was not to (sic) happy with me to say the least!,’ wrote Goodman. As well as confessing to his distant misdemeanor, Goodman also admitted that his brush with criminal activity had had a lasting impact on his life. ‘I have never forgotten the incident or your name (it has sort of haunted me a bit throughout my life) & then here I am on fb. reading about my favorite bagel store in the world closing down…. my brain was blown!,’ he wrote. ‘Finally I can say ~ I""M VERY SORRY that you had to go through that crap that day long ago, I wish it had never happened but it did. The apology came about after both men were reading a Facebook thread about the closure of H&H Bagels on New York's Upper East Side . 'Like I said I was trying to look tough to impress some guy who didn't believe I was in a gang, pretty frickin' stupid huh ? So once again I'm truly sorry for taking your bus pass back then - forgive me & thanks for reading this ""strange"" & very long message! Peace & love to you my brother...!!!’ While the post enabled Goodman to get his guilt off his chest, it was not a foregone conclusion that Soffel would react or even remember the incident. Goodman had to sweat it out for almost ten hours before Soffel replied to confirm that he too remembered their meeting so many years before. ‘Michael A. Goodman, clearly your a ""bigger man"" today. wow. Memory is a funny thing, I recognize your name now, as well. So, apology accepted,’ he wrote. Soffel was not only willing to accept Goodman’s apology, but he went on to describe the man who had bullied him as a hero for being man enough to say he was sorry so publicly so many years later. Goodman had to sweat it out for almost ten hours before Soffel replied to confirm that he too remembered their meeting so many years before . Way back when: Soffel, left, told Goodman, right, that he has forgiven him for stealing his bus pass and that he was a 'hero' for admitting what he had done so publicly so many years later . ‘Interestingly, I have dedicated a large portion of my life to helping other men be the man they have always wanted to be, and moments like this one continue to fuel my faith that the battle may be uphill but so rewarding,’ wrote Soffel. ‘Any man who draws aline for himself, ""Today I step forward for myself, my family, and humanity"" is a hero to me. So let us now, jointly, put this in its proper place, behind us. With respect, Claude Soffel.’ Suddenly a Facebook thread about a closed bagel store had been transformed into a special moment which seemed to have finally brought closure for Goodman on an event which he had admitted had had a lasting impact on his life. Other posters, touched by what they were reading, couldn’t resist and also had to comment on what they were reading. ‘Wow. I've been waiting for messages like that, but they never come. Good for both of you!,’ wrote Elyse HF Maxwell. While Sharon D'Lugoff commented ‘Michael A. Goodman, this thread made my day.’ Scene of the crime: Goodman has admitted and apologized to stealing Soffel's bus pass on the steps of The Museum of Natural History sometime in the late 1970s . A clearly emotional Goodman, who now lives in Hilo, Hawaii, couldn’t leave it there and once again addressed Soffel with an open message to thank him for his graciousness. ‘Claude Soffel, thank you for your words & forgiveness... I'm also glad that this thread brought some joy to those who read it, I know I finally feel peace on this subject & dare I say even JOY!' The original bagel-related thread was started last week by Kwame Alta. Soffel was one of the first to comment, recalling how he used to enjoy salt bagels from the store after he had been out drinking. '2AM, 2 salt bagels and a night cap at the Dublin House,' he recalled. In Goodman’s original message to Soffel he too admitted that he ‘used to go to (the bagel store) ALL the time, & get 1 onion & 1 salt bagel & eat it at the Dublin back in the day.’ Who knows perhaps Goodman and Soffel may have unwittingly passed each other in the bagel store or at the Dublin House over the years, but it took until a Facebook thread in 2013 for them to come to peace over the incident from some many years ago. ‘I know I finally feel peace on this subject & dare I say even JOY!’: The full transcript of Michael very public apology to Claude .","In the late 70s Michael Goodman got in trouble with the police after he accosted Claude Soffel on the steps of The Museum of Natural History .

Unlucky: Cameron Robertson had to quit his job as chef because he's allergic to knives and forks . Hours spent training in the Stirling House Hotel kitchen would leave him itching for days. But a trip to the doctor after a year of constant scratching revealed it was in fact metal in cutlery and his surroundings that was causing his ill-health, forcing him to quit. Mr Robertson said: 'I trained as a chef for two years before getting a full-time job and it was then that my hands and arms started to itch. 'Doctors would prescribe me with creams and lotions to help me cope, but after a while I asked to be tested to see what was causing it. That's when I found out that I was allergic to metal.' After two years of suffering, doctors discovered Mr Robertson is allergic to metal . With his confidence at rock bottom, Mr . Robertson considered applying for a trade, but when he offered his . church a hand renovating an old shop into a community cafe, he . discovered he was also allergic to concrete. The culinary enthusiast, who also suffers from eczema, discovered his allergy is triggered by elements present in most metals. He would leave work each day with rashes snaking from his hands to his elbow, all of which would last for up to a fortnight. After a torrid spell where he was unable to work at all, Mr Robertson, was left with no choice but to give up his dream job. He said: 'I love cooking so was really upset, but everything in the kitchen was metal, so it was a real problem. 'I can use cutlery to eat a meal during the day, but if I was to be using it all day - like I did when I was training as a chef - that would cause an allergic reaction. 'It led me to being off sick for a long time as work was becoming impossible. 'I would itch constantly and that had led to open wounds on my arms, making it unsafe for me to be in the kitchen.' The 21-year-old is now working as a care assistant. Mr Robertson - who lives at home with mum Marie, 54, and dog Cheeko - added: 'My allergies could have a considerable effect on my day-to-day living, but I've learned to live in a way that suits me.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . We have just had our wettest winter on record. Now forecasters are warning of a drought. Parts of southern Britain could face little or no rainfall for up to ten days, says the Met Office. The Environment Agency last night warned people to ‘use water wisely’ to ease demand. According to the Environment Agency we have just had the wettest ever winter since records began . The UK is expected to bask in warm temperatures and dry conditions due to an area of  high pressure that is likely to last into next week. An absolute drought is defined in the UK as a period of at least 15 consecutive days where there is no more than 0.2 mm of rainfall. A Met Office spokesman said: ‘We’ve certainly got, at least this week in the very far south, a  likelihood of very little rain. ‘The South West is looking unlikely to see any rain, certainly up until Sunday, and then as we go into next week there is a strong signal that we’re going to be sticking with some drier weather. ‘It’s not necessarily a heatwave because there is quite a lot of cloud around, but there is very little rain around, effectively. ‘Until Sunday, it will be relatively dry with some showers, and next week, a very similar picture.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Janelly Martinez-Amador was four months old, she couldn't bear to be held by her parents. Confused that their daughter seemed to be in pain from their touch, Salvador Martinez and Janet Amador took her to the doctors - and were stunned to learn her body was unable to make bones. Now more than six years on, in a show of medical and the extraordinary bravery of Janelly and her parents, the young girl is growing - and has even learned how to dance. Janelly, from Antioch, Tennessee, was born with the most severe form of hypophosphatasia, an extremely rare bone disorder which leads to loss of all bone mineralization during childhood. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Janelly Martinez-Amador was unable to develop bones when she was born but now, after taking part in a clinical drug trial for a new treatment, she has stunned doctors with her progress . 'We started noticing she wasn’t growing . as she should at that point and she wasn't gaining the weight as she . should at her age,' her father told The Tennessean. 'She didn't used to like to be . held in my arms,' her mother added. 'The only thing . she liked was to be put up on a pillow. That would make her . comfortable.' She was unable to move any of her body, and her bones didn't even show up on X-rays. By the time she turned two, she was still relying on ventilators and tracheotomies as she did not have ribs to support her breathing - and her parents were uncertain how much longer she would survive. Joy: Janelly, who is nearly seven and improving every day, loves to bop to music in her stroller . Progress: The little girl's bones were so small they could not be seen on X-rays after she was born, but 18 months after taking a new drug doctors saw she was developing a rib cage . Janelly has a rare condition called hypophosphatasia, a genetic disorder that affects the development of bone and teeth. It can cause a loss of all bone mineralization. The condition occurs due to an enzyme deficiency, which causes the bones to become soft as they can't absorb important minerals such as calcium and phosphorus, increasing the risks for pain and bone deterioration. The condition affects about one in 100,000 babies born in the U.S. The earlier the diagnosis is made the more severe the skeletal manifestations. More than half of those born with the disease don't survive beyond their first birthday. A milder form, which can be diagnosed in adulthood, occurs more frequently. Depending on the severity, people with the condition might see deformities of the limbs and chest and regular fractures. Losing teeth earlier than usual could also be a sign. But when she turned two years and eight months old, her parents put her forward for a clinical trial involving an experimental medicine at Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt. The clinical study treated nine toddlers from across the world with a biologic enzyme called asfotase alfa, which encouraged bones to grow. A special port was inserted into her abdomen so she could receive the drug. Janelly was the smallest child in the study, and while the other children started noticing bone growth as soon as three weeks after taking the drug, it did not appear to be working for Janelly. 'We were fearful that her bone disease was so terribly severe that it might not work,' Dr. Michael P. Whyte, a metabolic bone disease specialist with . Washington University School of Medicine, said. 'We were very concerned when the therapy . started that there was no mineral in her bones to target with enzymes,' he told The Tennessean. 'So would the enzyme find its way to bone and hook onto . something to help her? But apparently - although you couldn't see the . mineral on an X-ray - there was still enough there that the first . molecule or enzyme to land did something.' But her parents started noticing she was gaining muscle control and, after a year of treatment, she was finally able to move all of her limbs. After 18 months, her ribs started to form. Now, four years since the start of her treatment, she no longer uses a ventilator and loves dancing and bops along to music in her stroller. Thankful: She is pictured with her mother Janet Amador and father Salvador Martinez (right) when they met the leader of the clinical trial, Dr. Michael P. Whyte (left), for the first time this month . Care: Doctors at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt have celebrated her progress . She uses a wheelchair and she is still the size of a child half her age, but her bones are growing and doctors are hopeful. They hope to be able to remove her tracheotomy tube this spring, which has prevented her from speaking. Her cognitive abilities will be tested in July - but she appears to be improving each day. 'This is why we get into medicine in the first place: to truly make a difference in the life of a child,' her physician, Jill Simmons, M.D., a pediatric endocrinologist at Vanderbilt, told Newswise. 'My goodness, to go from no bones to bones. That's the most impressive thing I have seen as a physician. It's incredible.'

"By . Liz Hull . A former boyfriend of one of the ‘Peru Two’ claimed yesterday that both women knew they were being used as drug mules and were warned not to go through with it. Shane Knowles, a heavily tattooed convicted fraudster, said Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were ‘money hungry’ and claimed it was their ‘own choice’ to carry the cocaine. The 37-year-old, who dated Miss Reid over the summer in Ibiza, spoke out as it emerged that his former girlfriend’s own father remained unconvinced by her story and wanted her to plead guilty. Scroll down for video . Shane Knowles, a heavily tattooed convicted fraudster, said Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were 'money hungry' and claimed it was their 'own choice' to carry the cocaine . Miss Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, and Miss McCollum Connolly, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were caught in Lima, the Peruvian capital, trying to board a flight to Spain with £1.5million worth of the Class A drug stashed in food parcels in their luggage. The pair, both 20, claim  they were kidnapped and forced to carry the drugs by a gang of armed Colombian drug dealers who threatened to harm their families if they refused. But Mr Knowles cast doubt on the girls’ account, claiming they knew exactly what they were doing and had plenty of chances to ‘walk away.’ ‘I told them not to get involved,’ he said. ‘They were girls who hung around people with money in villas. ‘And then somebody made them a good offer and they went and did it. ‘Everyone is out there with no money, trying to make money and they obviously got an incentive to do it.’ Miss McCollum Connolly’s lawyer, Peter Madden, has repeatedly stressed that the women were not offered money at any stage. However, Mr Knowles, who did not know Miss McCollum Connolly personally, but was aware of her circle of friends,  added: ‘They made a choice. There were plenty of chances they had to stop and walk away. 'They are going to have a hard time, aren’t they? Tough on them. All of these girls are just money hungry. Melissa Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, and Miss McCollum Connolly, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were caught in Lima, the Peruvian capital, trying to board a flight to Spain with £1.5million of cocaine . ‘[Melissa knew] another girl who did something naughty. The girl went and brought stuff back from Marbella.  It gave Melissa the confidence to do this.’ Bodybuilder Mr Knowles,  of Runcorn, Cheshire, lost his left eye in 1999 when he was nearly beaten to death in a gangland feud. He started dating Miss Reid – who friends say took the horse tranquilliser drug ketamine during the month she was in Ibiza, but was not involved in dealing drugs during her stay on the island – after they met in San Antonio. Mr Knowles, who claims he has left his criminal past behind, told the Irish Independent newspaper: ‘I had no connection whatsoever with this happening to the girls, only that I told them not to do it. I have not got one ounce of sympathy for them.’ The women, who were arrested almost three weeks ago, are currently being held in Lima’s tough Virgen de Fatima prison and it could be three years before they go on trial. Miss Reid’s father said his daughter should change her plea to guilty in order to get a shorter sentence. The two Britons could be sentenced to 15 years if convicted following a trial, whereas if they admit the charges they may get off with six years and eight months. Melissa Reid's father, William Reid told The Mail on Sunday that he's . not totally convinced by the Peru Two's version of events and he wants . his daughter to plead guilty to receive a lesser sentence . Mr Reid was reunited with his daughter Melissa at Dirandro police station in Lima last week . William Reid, 53, who works for the National Grid, said: ‘They should plead guilty. God forbid, if it goes to trial, you have the prospect of receiving that 15-year sentence. ‘It’s indefensible to say that they didn’t have drugs or know they had drugs. They did carry the drugs. ‘They were found to have drugs on them. They collected packages which transpired to be drugs. They are going to be guilty of that. ‘If that’s the Peruvian law, regardless of the mitigating circumstances, then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you’re trying to appeal and reduce. ‘These girls are young. They may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they’re going to go free.’ Mr Reid confessed that he was still not ‘100 per cent about their story’. ‘But two girls, who prior to Ibiza did not know each other, are telling a very similar story,’ he said. ‘They have been pretty consistent all along. Only those two girls know the truth.’","Melissa and Michaella McCollum Connolly have insisted they are innocent .

"By . Emily Crane . A hardline Muslim group has defended jihadists in the Middle East against what they claim is a 'fear mongering campaign' from the Federal Government after two Australian militants appeared in a recruitment video last week. Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia says the insurgent group ISIS is being unfairly portrayed as evil in 'fantastical Hollywood style', after Prime Minister Tony Abbott condemned the chilling video that called for Australians to join the fight in Syria and Iraq. Uthman Badar, spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was set to speak at the Sydney Opera House in August about whether honour killings could be morally justified before it was canceled late on Tuesday due to public outrage. Scroll down for video . Uthman Badar defended a cancelled speech he was due to give on the topic of honour killings at the Opera House in August, saying the organisers insisted he talk about them . 'ISIS is being portrayed, in fantastical Hollywood style, as evil incarnate on Earth, having seemingly taken over from al-Qaeda who previously fulfilled this bogeyman role,' the group said in a statement on its website on Tuesday. 'Muslims in the west who make the sacrifice of going abroad to fight tyranny and assist the oppressed are characteristed as 'extremists' and 'terrorists'.' More than 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with Middle East extremist groups like ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), prompting Mr Abbott to warn the Government will crackdown on home-grown terrorists. The comments come after a chilling video was released by insurgent group, Islamic state of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), issuing a plea for Australians to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq . 'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said. Mr Abbott said that while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in that country's north, Australia would redouble its efforts to protect its national security. But the Prime Minister was named by Hizb ut-Tahrir as the person 'leading the way in demonising Islam and Muslims'. 'Yesterday he was attacking and threatening Muslims who go to fight abroad whilst at the same time congratulating the secular dictatorial regime of al-Sisi,' they said. 'We remind the Prime Minister… that Australia has no business interfering in the Muslim world. 'We remind him that Australia made the mistake of going into Iraq aforetime, and that if he does so again, his Government and those who support such a move alone will be responsible for the repercussions that ensue.' The 13-minute ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort' But Mr Abbott told a Coalition joint party room meeting in Canberra on Tuesday that it was not an issue of religion but rather about extremism, illegality and violence. 'We should never do anything to sully our reputation as a beacon of hope and freedom for people from across the world,' Mr Abbott said. 'We will not let our country down in rising to this latest national security challenge.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Tuesday vowed to continue canceling the passports of Australians suspected of being a threat to national security, including those thinking of going abroad to fight. Ms Bishop said the Middle East conflict was attracting a 'disturbingly large' number of foreign fighters, and the risk posed by those returning to Australia could not be understated. 'The Syrian-Iraq conflict is now a growing threat to global security and is one of the most serious challenges to Australia's domestic security for some time,' she told Parliament. More than 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, prompting Prime Minister Tony Abbott to warn the government will crackdown on home-grown terrorists . Ms Bishop said the government was keeping a close on eye on extremists and those it suspected of fundraising or recruiting for these groups. The 13-minute ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including two Australians, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'. Fighting for terrorist groups outlawed by Australian law such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant carries jail penalties of up to 25 years. Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Tuesday vowed to continue cancelling the passports of Australians suspected of being a threat to national security, including those thinking of going abroad to fight . Its inclusion in the line-up sparked a barrage of criticism on social media and condemnation from the NSW government, with Minister for Women Pru Goward branding it 'abhorrent'. Late on Tuesday, the Opera House announced on its Facebook page that the lecture would not go ahead. 'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation,' the statement said. 'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss.' Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30 . 'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.' Mr Badar took to Twitter to make a statement of his own. 'Hysteria wins out. Opera house cancels my session at #FODI. Welcome to the free world, where freedom of expression is a cherished value,' he wrote. 'Time for name change: Festival of relatively dangerous ideas.' Mr Badar had indicated he did not intend to defend honour killings.","Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia says insurgent group ISIS is being unfairly portrayed as 'evil' by Prime Minister Tony Abbott .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, who severed her spinal cord in an accident last week, has praised a CrossFit athlete who came to her aid. Swimmer Dyken Rouen, who won six gold medals for the U.S., was injured while riding an all-terrain vehicle in Arizona on June 6. In a lucky coincidence,  DJ Brimhall, who had been competing at the same event as her earlier in the day, was able to rush to her aid. Hero: Amy Van Dyken-Rouen is reunited with her life-saver DJ Brimhall . The athlete and Arizona firefighter was able to apply his medical training to care for 41-year-old Dyken-Rouen while they waited for an ambulance. One week after the accident, the pair were reunited at Dyken-Rouen's hospital bedside in Scottsdale. After posting their picture on Instagram, Dyken-Rouen wrote: 'I did Crossfit with this man the day of my accident. Later that night HE saved my life as my first responder. #myangel.' It is still not clear if the former swimmer, who made history in 1996 when she became the first American woman to win four gold medals at one Games, will be permanently paralyzed. She had been riding an ATV across a parking lot in Torreon Golf Club when it hit a curb and propelled her over the front of the vehicle and down an embankment. Brimhall, who trains others for CrossFit - an intense fitness program often used by police and military specialists - had been at the same sporting event as Dyken-Rouen earlier in the day. Quick thinking: CrossFit athlete DJ Brimhall was the first person to reach Amy when she was thrown from an ATV . Aid: Brimhall, who serves as a firefighter, was able to help the Olympic gold medalist while they waited for an ambulance . The 29-year-old, who also serves as a firefighter, stayed with her until she could be airlifted to hospital. He has been praised widely by the swimmer and her fans, after she posted their picture online. After a friend of Brimhall's named him, Dyken-Rouen added: 'I wasn't going to give his name for privacy sake, but DJ Brimhall is not only an angel, he it one of the top Crossfitters in the country.' Her husband, former Denver Broncos punter Tom Rouen thinks the ATV rolled over his wife after going down an embankment. 'She wasn't breathing. I raised up the back of her neck with my hand; she started gasping for air,' he told the Denver Post. Despite her devastating injuries, Dyken-Rouen is applying the same fighting spirit that earned her numerous Olympic wins to her recovery. Champion: Amy made history as the first woman to win four gold medals at one Games when she competed in Atlanta, above, in 1996 . Fighter: Amy's husband and family say the Olympic swimmer is determined to overcome her spinal injury . She has posted several updates about her progress on social media sites and, according to her husband, is in good spirits. A statement from her family, issued shortly after the accident, said: 'Amy awoke within hours of surgery acting like her typical spunky, boisterous, ebullient self and has spent the last 24 hours entertaining her family and her medical staff in the ICU.' Dyken-Rouen is due to be moved to a hospital that specialized in spinal cord injuries and is closer to her Colorado home.","Gold-medal swimmer Amy Van Dyken-Rouen broke her back last week .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Some people may think that the spread of herpes is a modern problem. But scientists have found that Herpes Simplex Virus-1, which manifests itself as cold sores, infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees, six million years ago. While genital herpes, or HSV-2, jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - Homo erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago, they claim. Scientists studied the cross-species transmission, from chimps (stock image pictured) to human ancestors using advanced models of molecular evolution. They found the HSV-1, which manifests itself as cold sores, infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago . Scientists have found that Herpes Simplex Virus-1, which manifests itself as cold sores, infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago. Genital herpes, or HSV-2, jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - Homo erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago. The . researchers compared the HSV-1 and HSV-2 gene sequences to the family . tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species. Using . advanced models of molecular evolution, they were able to estimate . ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before. This . allowed the experts to determine when HSV-1 and HSV-2 were introduced . into humans with far more precision than previous models, which do not . account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution. This jump occurred long before the rise of early modern humans about 200,000 years ago. This jump occurred long before the rise of early modern humans about 200,000 years ago. ’Before we were human, there was still cross-species transmission into our evolutionary lineage,’ said Joel Wertheim, assistant research scientist at the University of California San Diego. Modern versions viruses are spread by intimate contact and HSV-1 can also be spread by sharing drinks. ‘The results help us to better understand how these viruses evolved and found their way into humans,’ Dr Wertheim explained. ‘Animal disease reservoirs are extremely important for global public health. 'Understanding where our viruses come from will help guide us in preventing future viruses from making the jump into humans.’ It is . thought that two thirds of the human population is infected with at . least one form of the virus, which shows itself as cold sores on the . mouth or blisters on the genitals. Dr Wertheim said: ‘Humans are the only primates we know of that have two herpes simplex viruses. We wanted to determine why.’ Genital herpes or HSV-2 (pictured) jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - Homo erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago, experts claim . Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) both infect humans. HSV-1 produces cold sores, while HSV-2 produces genital herpes. Both are contagious and can be shared from direct contact as well as contact with saliva. Symptoms of the viruses include watery blisters on the skin, which can be painful. HSV-1 and HSV-2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system. After initial infection, some people experience sporadic outbreaks. The researchers compared the HSV-1 and HSV-2 gene sequences to the family tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species. Using advanced models of molecular evolution, they were able to estimate ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before. This allowed the experts to determine when HSV-1 and HSV-2 were introduced into humans with far more precision than previous models, which do not account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution. The genetics of human and primate herpes viruses were examined to assess their similarity. Scientists . found that HSV-1 has been present in humans far longer than HSV-2, . prompting the researchers to further investigate the origins of HSV-2 in . humans. The viral family tree showed that HSV-2 was far more genetically similar to the herpes virus found in chimpanzees. This . level of divergence indicates that humans must have acquired HSV-2 from . an ancestor of modern chimpanzees about 1.6 million years ago, prior to . the rise of modern humans roughly 200,000 years ago. ‘Comparing . virus gene sequences gives us insight into viral pathogens that have . been infecting us since before we were humans,’ Dr Wertheim said.

Harvesting the power of light: In the sweltering heat of the Arabian sun, Shams 1 generates electricity to power 20,000 homes in the UAE . The $600million (£398million) project dubbed Shams 1 took three years to build. Incorporating the latest in parabolic trough technology, the plant features more than 258,000 mirrors mounted on 768 tracking parabolic trough collectors, covering an area of 2.5 sq/km, or 285 football fields. By concentrating heat from direct sunlight onto oil-filled pipes, Shams 1 produces steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity. In addition, the solar project uses a booster to heat steam as it enters the turbine to dramatically increase the cycle's efficiency.

"By . Patrick Johnston . Martin Demichelis fully deserves his recall to the Argentina squad while Carlos Tevez was never going to make it after failing to patch up his differences with coach Alejandro Sabella, forward Sergio Aguero said. Despite some sparkling form for Italian champions Juventus, Tevez has never been part of Sabella's plans and was again overlooked when the coach named his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Brazil on Tuesday. Manchester City striker Aguero, who is expected to line up alongside Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain in a formidable front line for Argentina, believed a recall was never going to happen. Capture the moment: Martin Demichelis is fully deserving of his call-up to the Argentina World Cup squad . Happy to help: The Manchester City defender was given the words of support from Sergio Aguero . 'This has been discussed for three years now since the manager was hired for the team and since then we know there was no relationship between them both,' the 25-year-old Aguero said in Singapore on Friday. 'He didn't call him before so it wasn't such a surprise that he wasn't called this time as well. It would be a very good question for the manager himself to comment,' he added, trying to avoid the talking point. Instead, the pony-tailed Demichelis, so frequently mocked by rival English Premier League supporters following some early mistakes upon his arrival at Manchester City at the start of the season, was the surprise inclusion. The former River Plate and Bayern Munich defender last played for Argentina in a 1-1 home draw against Bolivia in a qualifier in November 2011 but has shown strong form in recent weeks as City went on to win the Premier League title on Sunday. Proving people wrong: Demichelis has had major doubters since his move to City last season . While Aguero is a certain starter for the Group F matches against Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria, the 33-year-old Demichelis will be hoping just to make the slimmed down 23-man travelling party, although he had support for his cause. 'It was no surprise that he was called for playing in this World Cup, I think he has earned his position,' Aguero said. 'He had been criticised, in particular because of the play against Lionel Messi in the (Champions League) match against Barcelona but it is understandable, he wasn't so confident then after starting to play in the English league. 'In the last three or four months, he has been playing very well and adapted and I think that is why he was called up and earned his place in the team.'","Demichelis in Argentina's 30-man squad for World Cup .

A Tennessee couple has revealed the heartbreaking pleas of their adoptive daughter begging to be returned to their care after she was forcibly removed to live with her ex-con father in Nebraska. Sonya, aged nine, had been in the care of Kim and David Hodgin, from Dickson, Tennessee since before she was two years old, but has recently been ‘returned’ to her biological father in Omaha, Nebraska. In the last phone call to her adoptive parents, Sonya can be heard pleading with them to come and take her from her biological father more than 700 miles away. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: David and Kim Hodgin had been caring for Sonya, now nine, since before she was two years old, but were forced to see her forcibly returned to her biological father in January . Sonya, pictured with her adoptive father David Hodgin, has been returned to her biological father who served time in prison for transporting arms . Despite having adopted Sonya in 2008, the Hodgins were forced to watch their daughter be taken to her father, a convicted felon who served time for transporting firearms. A Tennessee appeals court overturned the adoption of Sonya, who had lived with Mr and Mrs Hodgin since before she was two years old, after her father Josh McCaul was released from prison. In a recording of a phone call made on January 30 this year, a day after Sonya was moved from Dickson County to Omaha, she can be heard asking for her adoptive parents to take her back. Begging: Sonya can be heard pleading with her adoptive parents to come and get her . 'What did you say, baby doll?' Mrs Hodgin can be heard asking in a recording of the phone call obtained by CNN. 'I want to you to come and get me', the young girl responds. During the phone call, the last time the Hodgins spoke to her, Sonya also describes her biological father's home as 'dirty, with mold and cigarettes everywhere,' and although the man is 'nice' to her, the home lacks clean water. The Hodgins say they were given just three hours' notice before the young girl was taken from them. 'Sonya's crying her eyes out. Screaming bloody murder, ""Please don't let them do this, Daddy, please, Mama, don't let 'em take me,"",' Mr Hodgin told CNN. 'They took her bags, and that's the last that I've seen her,' Mrs Hodgin adds. McCaul had been awarded custody of his infant daughter in 2004 after Sonya's mother gave up her rights. However, she has been living with the Hodgins since 2006 and they were able to adopt Sonya after McCaul pleaded guilty to transporting firearms and was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. This automatically terminated his parental rights as Tennessee state law does not allow anyone incarcerated for more than ten years to have rights to a child under the age of eight. However, his sentence was shortened to just eight years and he was able to retain it upon his release from prison after claiming  his parental rights were illegally terminated. Tragedy: Mrs Hodgin and her husband were just given three hours notice before their adoptive daughter was taken from their home in Dickson County, Tennessee and moved to Omaha, Nebraska . Convicted felon: Sonya has no memory of her father Josh McCaul, left, but a court still ruled she should live with him . Family: Sonya, front right with her adopted brother, was adopted by Dickson County couple Kim and David Hodgin, pictured back row, in 2006, when she was just 3 years old . In . 2009, McCaul won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his . rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption . proceedings. For the next five years, Sonya continued to live with the Hodgins on their Tennessee farm as the two sides fought for custody. In . January this year, a judge ruled that the nine-year-old should return . to her biological father, and a few hours later, she had been taken from . the Hodgins. The couple are now petitioning to have her returned based on Sonya's best interest and a hearing is scheduled for Friday.

"By . Tom Kelly . Prince Charles asked Jimmy Savile for advice over the appointment of a senior aide for him and Princess Diana, it was claimed yesterday. Charles and the former DJ are said to have met with former major-general Sir Christopher Airy before he was offered the post of the royal couple’s private secretary and treasurer in 1990. It was also claimed that they were so close that Charles treated Savile like the ‘fool in Shakespeare’s King Lear’, allowing him to tell him things that others courtiers could not say to his face. Advisor: Prince Charles with Jimmy Saville and deputy Lord lieutenant, Ian Thornber, share a joke after the prince arrived in Glencoe for a visit . The pair became friends after meeting in the late 1970s while working with wheelchair sports charities and Charles later came to rely on him in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Former royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter: He says Savile had an informal role with the Prince . Former palace aides said he would drop in to see Charles when it suited him. Dickie Arbiter, the former press secretary to the Queen, described how Savile would kiss female staff at the palace on the hand before rubbing his lips all the way up their arms if they were wearing short-sleeved shirts. He told the Sunday Times: ‘Savile was brought in by an aide as a sort of ‘Jim’ll fix it’ to fix the state of the marriage, but of course it didn’t work. ‘His role was informal, ad hoc. He would just roll in and roll out again. I thought he was a pretty ghastly man.’ Another source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Savile was in and out of the palace at that time pretty frequently. ‘His bling and his tracksuits made him rather unconventional and I think that was appealing to Prince Charles. ‘Like the fool in King Lear, he was allowed to say things to Prince Charles that other courtiers weren’t.’ In 1999 Charles accepted an invitation to dinner at Savile’s home in Glencoe. When Savile died last year, Charles led the tributes to him, saying his death had left him ‘incredibly saddened’. Savile is now believed to have been a predatory paedophile who abused as many as 300 child victims. Asked about Savile’s role in his appointment, Sir Christopher told the Sunday Times: ‘I don’t think it is my place to comment.’ St James’s Palace said there was ‘no record’ of Savile being present at any of Sir Christopher’s interviews.","'I thought Savile was 'pretty ghastly man', says former press secretary .

"By . James Chapman . Secrecy: European Parliament President Martin Schulz suggested a vote on the budget should be conducted in secret . Euro MPs prompted uproar last night by plotting to try to block the budget deal using a secret ballot so voters cannot hold them to account. It emerged that they are planning to use a little-understood procedure to allow them to vote in private and defy  the 27 EU leaders. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament and former leader of its socialist group, suggested a vote on the budget should be conducted in secret to allow MEPs to break away from prime ministers and party leaders and maximise the chances of it being rejected. A vote behind closed doors would also spare Euro MPs’ blushes ahead of European elections in 2014, when voters seeing austerity imposed at home might punish their profligacy. If a fifth of MEPs – 150 – declare that they want the budget vote to be a secret ballot, that is how it will be conducted under the European Parliament’s rules. A senior British official described the idea as a ‘shocking subversion of democracy’. But Mr Schulz declared: ‘As president of the Parliament . . . I cannot, will not and indeed may not accept what amount to deficit budgets.’ He claimed cutting spending breached EU treaties which state that financial means will be made available ‘to allow the Union to fulfil its legal obligations in respect of third parties’. He added: ‘More and more tasks and less and less money . . . the European Parliament will not go along with this.’ Hannes Swoboda, the current leader of the European socialists and democrats, said: ‘The agreement of the European Parliament for the figures discussed is not imaginable.’ Guarantee: The threat of a secret vote will pile pressure on Ed Miliband to guarantee that Labour MEPs, who belong to the group, will not attempt to block the budget . Their stance will pile pressure on Ed Miliband to guarantee that Labour MEPs, who belong to the group, will not attempt to block the budget. Richard Ashworth, leader of the Tories in Brussels, said: ‘This is a ridiculous ruse and a disgrace to the institution president Schulz is supposed to run.’ Martin Callanan, leader of the European conservatives and reformists group, said: ‘If MEPs want to reject an agreement made by their own prime ministers then they should have the courage of their convictions and not try to cower behind a procedural technicality.’ A budget vote is expected to take place in the European Parliament in March.","Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, suggested private vote .

"By . Richard Spillett . Watford player Alexander Merkel had to fight off a four-strong gang of robbers at his home . A top footballer was attacked by a gang of robbers on mopeds who battered their way into his home and stole a bag from him. German international Alexander Merkel, 22, has been renting a house in Hampstead while on loan to Championship side Watford. A four-strong gang - who are believed to be behind a spate of similar attacks - were all dressed in black as they tried to smash down his front door with their mopeds. The Kazakhstan-born footballer opened the door at 10.30pm on May 2 and was immediately attacked by two of the men. After a struggle in which they failed to force him to part with his wristwatch, they grabbed a bag of his and fled. The two main attackers got away on mopeds which were driven by their two accomplices. Mr Merkel, who has previously played for Milan and Genoa in Italy, has been renting the house while on loan to Watford from Italian club Udinese. A neighbour, who heard the men trying to break their way in, called the police. He said : 'I heard a commotion outside and went to have a look. Two mopeds with four people on the back were outside a neighbour's front door. 'One of the guys tried to kick it in but bounced off in a rather comical fashion. They then tried to ram it with their scooters. 'It looked like they knew which house they wanted to get into - it's quite concerning.' Another . resident, who heard shouting and the revving of engines said: 'It really was . quite scary. We spoke to the victim afterwards and he looked quite . shocked.' Merkel, 22, pictured playing for Genoa in Italy, is currently on loan at Watford from Udinese . The raid, at Mr Merkel's home not far from Hampstead High Street, follows similar moped raids in nearby Hampstead Garden Suburb . The gang is believed to have struck in another street nearby an hour earlier. Merkel, who drives a Maserati, joined Watford on loan in January and played with them until the season ended. He scored his only goal of the season in a 3-0 win against Barnsley. A friend said today that the player was currently on holiday. He added: 'Luckily they did not manage to take very much and he is fine.' Detective Constable Andy Palmer, from Camden Police, said: 'I am sure this gang is known to certain members of the community so I would urge them to contact police before someone is seriously hurt.' He said the two main suspects were aged between 18 and 25. One was 6ft tall, of slim build and with an Irish accent. The other was 6ft 2in and of medium build.","Raiders targeted the north London home of Watford star Alexander Merkel .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Jesus Christ remains the world's most influential figure over 2,000 years after he walked the earth, according to new research. Academics at U.S. university MIT used data gathered from online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rank famous figures through history in terms of their global reach. While the likes of pop icons, sports stars and 50 Shades of Grey author E.L. James dominated Time Magazine's annual list of the world's most influential people this year, religious figures, Greek philosophers and scientists prevailed in the Wikipedia-based top 20. Wikipedia reach: Jesus Christ, left, was at number one on the list of history's most influential people, followed by Chinese philosopher Confucius, right, at number two . The Macro Connections group, from the MIT-based Media Lab, described its list as a 'socio-cultural mirror'. The researchers focused on influential people born before 1950, and used data from all language editions of Wikipedia. 'Proxies for culture': Researchers said entries such as physicists Sir Isaac Newton, left, and Albert Einstein, right, offered an insight into global knowledge of the cultures of their respective countries' cultures . Chinese philosopher Confucius, whose teachings focused on personal and governmental morality, justice and sincerity, was at number two, followed by English physicist Sir Isaac Newton at number three. 1. Jesus Christ: Prophet and central figure of Christianity . 2. Confucius: Chinese philosopher . 3. Sir Isaac Newton: British physicist . 4. Gandhi: Indian politician and activist . 5. Albert Einstein: German physicist . 6. Aristotle: Greek philosopher . 7. Vasco da Gama: Portuguese explorer . 8. Leonardo da Vinci: Italian artist . 9. Plato: Greek philosopher . 10. Archimedes: Greek philosopher . 11. Mao Zedong: Chinese communist revolutionary . 12. William Shakespeare: English playwright . 13. Socrates: Greek philosopher . 14. Karl Marx: German philosopher and socialist . 15. Michaelangelo: Italian sculptor . 16. Gautama Buddha: Nepalese spiritual teacher . 17. Nelson Mandela: South African politician . 18. Galileo Galilei: Italian physicist . 19. Julius Caesar: Roman emperor . 20. Joseph Stalin: Soviet leader . Communist leaders Chairman Mao and . Joseph Stalin both made it on to the list of influential figures, at . numbers 11 and 20 respectively. South Africa's Nelson Mandela, who is at number 17, is the only living entry on the list. The group took into account factors . like the number of language editions in which an individual has a page, . and the number of people known to speak those languages, when compiling . the rankings. But Macro Connections is more interested in what the list reveals about global knowledge of an individual country's culture than a specific historical figure. 'It shows you how the world perceives . your own national culture,' Cesar Hidalgo, head of the Macro Connections . group, told Wired Magazine. For example, playwright William Shakespeare's position at number 12 on the list can be viewed as an indication of worldwide knowledge of a central figure in England's national culture. 'We use historical characters as proxies for culture,' Mr Hidalgo said. 'It is easier to track knowledge about Shakespeare than about each of the characters he created in his writing.' The list is part of the group's ongoing research into how culture 'assembles itself'. Mr Hidalgo and his colleagues are using this quantitative approach to test hypotheses such as whether cultural development is structured or random. The group will be considering questions such as whether it would be possible to have a figure such as Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs in a country that has not generated enough science and technology.","List of the most influential people born before 1950 compiled using data from all language editions of Wikipedia .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Frank Lampard has expressed his dismay at what he perceives to be a 'fixation' and 'agenda' towards England team-mate Wayne Rooney. The Manchester United striker has come under some scrutiny since England’s 2-1 defeat against Italy in their World Cup opener last Saturday. Despite providing the assist for Daniel Sturridge to score with an inch-perfect cross and being played out of position on the left wing, Rooney was criticised after a largely indifferent display. VIDEO: Scroll down to see England prepare for Uruguay at their Rio training base . Fixation: Wayne Rooney is suffering from the pressure of an 'agenda' from English media and fans according to Frank Lampard . Team-mates: Rooney and Lampard have been England team-mates for over a decade . Gaffer: Roy Hodgson leads his England team in a training session in Rio . All smiles: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is back in full training and hoping to be fit to play a part against Uruguay . Bouncebackability: England will be hoping to recover from their opening defeat to Italy . Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson defended Rooney immediately after the game, but the 28-year-old has continued to be a hot topic of conversation among fans and the media. Veteran Lampard, an unused substitute in Manaus, admitted his frustration at much of the focus centring on just one player. He said: 'Unfortunately we do have a fixation with one player during every World Cup, ones that I’ve been involved in. 'It’s a bit frustrating when you’re in a team group and that happens because we’re there trying to play together - people are not selfish in this squad - trying to get results and a fixation with one player can become, rather than a debate, a bit of an agenda. 'So I do think we need to drop the agenda and look at the team, whoever plays, because the manager will pick the best team that he sees fit and whoever plays we want to win the game.' Lampard believes Hodgson’s men can take heart from their performance against the Azzurri, but knows that it will count for nothing unless they win against Uruguay on Thursday and then Costa Rica next week. 'I thought we started very bright, some good attacking football, there were a lot of positives out of the game, the one negative was that we didn’t win it,' he said. 'Importantly now (we must) look forward, take those good points, try and keep them going and improve on them. We need to win games.' Assisted: Rooney celebrating with goalscorer Daniel Sturridge after providing him with the cross for England's equaliser against Italy . Partners: Many believe that Rooney should be played centrally alongside Sturridge, rather than on the left . Several youngsters came to the fore over the weekend and Lampard hailed the likes of Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Ross Barkley as a breath of fresh air. '(The younger players have had) a big impact. From the minute the manager picked the squad I think we were all quite excited by the youth,' he added. 'With England we’ve been crying out for some youthful exuberance and attacking play, and the lads have brought that. Not just in the game against Italy, but in training. 'It’s great to watch and great to see. I think they’re all very ready now to make their impression.' Young gun: Raheem Sterling was one of England's impressive youngsters on the night . Trademark: As was Sturridge, who was preferred to Rooney in a central role . Sterling, in particular, earned rave reviews on just his fifth appearance for the senior team and the 19-year-old revealed he was keen to showcase his talents to the world. 'I was a bit nervous at the time but I just thought to myself it was a great opportunity to show the footballing world what I can do, and hopefully I showed some glimpses and helped my team to try and do the best that we could,' he said. 'It was unlucky that we didn’t get the win but I thought we played some good stuff at times. On Thursday we’ll be going at it again.'","Lampard expresses dismay over 'fixation' and 'agenda' towards Rooney .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Michigan man is praying for a miracle as he is trying to raise money for a life-changing surgery to remove a 75lbs growth from his scrotum. Dan Maurer, from Battle Creek, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which has caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weighing 100lbs. The 39-year-old husband said his condition has affected his relationship with his wife of 20 years, Mindy. Scroll down for video . Massive problem: Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which has caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weighing 100lbs . The couple reportedly have not been intimate in seven years due to Dan's illness. Dan Maurer, originally from Kalamazoo, first noticed that something was wrong with his anatomy when he was in his 20s. Maurer's scrotum started getting bigger, but when he sought medical help, doctors informed him that he has to lose weight. ‘I was doing two miles a day in the pool, so I lost 50lbs like that,’ said Dan. But even as he was shedding the extra pounds, his scrotum continued expanding, eventually ballooning to the size of a large cantaloupe. ‘The bigger it gets it seems to me like the faster it grows. When he stands it almost hangs to his ankles,’ his mother, Connie Maurer, told My Fox Detroit. Dan Maurer again consulted with physicians but got the same response as before: he must lose more weight. 'Misdiagnosed': Maurer first noticed that something was amiss with his body in his 20s, but doctors told him he just needed to lose weight . Setback: Maurer was able to shed 50lbs through daily exercise, but his scrotum continued growing . ‘As far as they were concerned, I had to have lap-band surgery to lose weight,’ Dan told the station KSDK. Maurer eventually fell ill and had to be hospitalized with what turned out to be a broken cyst inside his oversize scrotum. Then one day, Dan Maurer came across the TLC reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about the plight of Wesley Warren Jr. At that moment, Maurer knew what was wrong with him. Scrotal lymphedema is a disease that is caused by blockage of the lymphatic vessels in which tissue builds up outside of the testicles, resulting in swelling. Maurer's only hope is Dr Joel Gelman, a California-based urologist who operated on Wesley Warren in April 2013 to remove his outsized growth. The truth comes out: Maurer discovered was was wrong with him when he watched TLC's reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about Wesley Warren Jr . Last hope: Dr Joel Gelman (left), who also treated Wesley Warren, has agreed to operate on Dan Maurer (right), but the $20,000 surgery is not covered by his insurance . Warren passed away in March of this year at age 49. It is believed that he died from complications with diabetes. Gelman has agreed to perform the dangerous operation to remove Maurer's massive growth, but the urologist is not in the patient's medical network and the procedure is not covered by his insurance. In the case of Wesley Warren, Dr Gelman agreed to treat him free of charge. Dan Maurer has launched a campaign on the site GoFundMe.com to raise $20,000 toward the surgery. As of Tuesday afternoon, people have donated over $4,200. Maurer’s first appointment with Dr Gelman is scheduled for July 25, which will cost him $4,000 in consultation fees. The 39-year-old man says he is prepared to go through with the risky and costly operation for the sake of his wife, whom he has described as 'amazing.'","Dan Maurer, 39, from Michigan, suffers from rare condition called scrotal lymphedema .

"By . Mark Duell . Happy to go: Benoit Paire, 25, said he 'hates' Wimbledon because the atmosphere 'displeases him greatly' and said he preferred playing on clay . After months of preparation, there will no doubt be sore losers aplenty at Wimbledon. And one French player is surely already in the running to be named the sorest of them all – although he would deny it. Benoit Paire yesterday insisted he was happy after crashing out in the first round of the men’s singles because he ‘hates’ Wimbledon. The world number 71 told French sports newspaper L'Equipe: ‘I’m not at all sad to leave this place where the atmosphere displeases me greatly. ‘Simply, I hate Wimbledon and I’m happy to leave as soon as possible.’ The 25-year-old sportsman added that he felt discomfort in his knee while playing on grass - and that clay is a better surface for him. Paire has previously done well at the competition, reaching the third round on his last two visits. He also reached the third round of the French Open last year, when he was ranked number 24, and the final of the Serbian Open in 2012. Both tournaments are played on his favourite surface, clay.

"By . Becky Barrow . Ministers will today backtrack on controversial plans that would have wiped up to £70,000 off the gold-plated pensions of private-sector staff. There was outrage last November when the Government suggested ways for bosses to cut the cost of paying defined-benefit pensions to their workers. One of the damaging effects would have been to stop the pensions rising with inflation. Ministers will today backtrack on controversial plans that would have wiped up to £70,000 off the gold-plated pensions of private-sector staff . The proposed changes could also have made staff wait longer for their pensions and stopped schemes paying out to their spouses when they died. But the Pensions Bill, which is being published today, shows the Government has made a U-turn and scrapped the plans. The decision will be a relief for millions of private-sector workers who are still lucky enough to be building up a defined-benefit pension in their job. Public-sector staff, who have been called the ‘pensions aristocracy’, would not have been affected by the changes. Defined-benefits schemes, such as final-salary pensions that guarantee to pay a percentage of a worker’s salary on retirement, were once popular but are rapidly disappearing. The number of private-sector workers actively contributing to them has plunged from more than five million in 1995 to 1.7million today. When the Government revealed its proposals last year to encourage bosses to include more employees in the schemes, Pensions Minister Steve Webb said he hoped they would trigger ‘a renaissance’ in final-salary pensions. But the Pensions Bill, which is being published today, shows the Government has made a U-turn and scrapped the plans. The decision will be a relief for millions of private-sector workers who are still lucky enough to be building up a defined-benefit pension in their job . The most explosive change would have been the rule that allowed firms to freeze workers’ pensions after they retired. Annual pension increases are vital if retirees are to protect their payouts from being eroded by the rising cost of  living. At present, a boss must increase payouts by at least  2.5 per cent a year. If this had been axed, the impact would have been devastating. For example, a retired worker receiving a pension of £10,000 a year would receive £320,000 over 25 years once the increases were included. But without the annual rises, the retiree would get only £250,000 – a loss of £70,000. Laith Khalaf, of financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that the plan would ‘pull the rug’ from under workers at the last minute. Last night, a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said a consultation had revealed there was no appetite for the changes. He added: ‘We have concluded that introducing legislation to make it easier to sponsor defined-benefit schemes will not be our priority at the present time.’","Ministers will backtrack on .

"By . Mark Duell . Sexual assault: William Coleman, 53, had been charged with failing to register as a sex offender . A father who went on a seven-year hunger strike in the US to protest his rape conviction has been deported to Britain against his will. Former football coach William Coleman, 53, originally from Bootle, Liverpool, had been charged in 2012 with failing to register as a sex offender after finishing an eight-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting his wife. But the charge of failing to register has now been dropped. His lawyer Erin O'Neil-Baker said he had not eaten solid food since 2007, claiming prison officials had force-fed him through a nose tube under court orders since 2008. Federal immigration authorities took custody of Coleman late on Monday and put him on a plane to England the next day, Ms O'Neil-Baker said. This action was taken under a 2011 federal judge's deportation order issued because of the felony sexual assault conviction. Coleman arrived at London Gatwick Airport early yesterday and was expected to be freed. But he may have to register as a sex offender in England - and it was not immediately clear if he would agree to that, because he continues to maintain his innocence. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) released a statement yesterday saying Coleman was sent to England after he lost a lengthy appeals process involving the deportation order. Legal case: Coleman is pictured in court, flanked by his lawyers, in Hartford, Connecticut, in January 2009 . Immigration officials did not release information on the timing of the deportation or respond to questions raised by Ms O'Neil-Baker. ‘The arrest and removal of aliens who pose a threat to public safety remains one of Ice’s top priorities,’ the statement said. ‘Ice works closely with prosecutors at all levels, including in this case, to ensure that immigration enforcement actions do not interfere with the adjudication of criminal charges.’ Ms O'Neil-Baker said she and other lawyers for Coleman were upset and stunned that immigration officials did not notify them of the deportation. Return: Coleman arrived at London Gatwick Airport (file picture) early yesterday and was expected to be freed . She filed a motion for a stay of the deportation on Tuesday afternoon, but by then it was too late, she said. 'He was willing to die for that principal [of trying to clear his name]. He had that ripped away from him in the middle of the night' Erin O'Neil-Baker, lawyer . She said the way the deportation was carried out was unusual, appeared to violate protocol and may have violated Coleman's rights. Although Coleman lost appeals of his conviction and deportation order, he still wanted to stay to try to clear his name, Ms O'Neil-Baker said. ‘He was willing to die for that principal,’ she said, adding that Coleman's two children live in Connecticut with his ex-wife. ‘He had that ripped away from him in the middle of the night.’","William Coleman charged in 2012 with failing to register as sex offender .

"By . Christian Gysin And Harriet Arkell . A young father-of-three drowned in the fishing lake of a caravan park after being pepper sprayed by police following an alcohol-fuelled late night confrontation with officers. Leon Stent was a visitor at the Coghurst Hall Holiday Park in Hastings, East Sussex, when he argued first with staff and then with police after they were called when he allegedly became 'aggressive'. Today one eye-witness told how the 30-year-old scaffolder got into difficulties in the water moments after entering the lake to escape from chasing police officers. And another said he was running around as if trying to get the spray out of his eyes before entering the lake. Leon Stent, 30, drowned in a lake at Coghurst Hall Holiday Park near Hastings after an altercation with police . Lake: Scaffolder Mr Stent, 30, drowned in the lake at the holiday park outside Hastings at the weekend . One man, who did not want to be named but owns a holiday chalet overlooking the spot where Mr Stent died, said: 'One minute he was swimming on top of the lily pads and swearing at the . police on the bank and then his body suddenly went stiff and he just . dropped deep into the water. 'The . spot where he died is full of weeds and he may have got tangled up with . the lily pads which have eight foot stems which reach down to the . bottom of the lake. I haven’t slept properly for three days after seeing . him go under and die like that.' Leon Stent was a visitor at the Coghurst Hall Holiday Park in Hastings . When he entered the water, Mr Stent was wearing a dark coloured vest top and jeans which would have made swimming difficult. Karen . Baldwin, who lives at the park, said: ‘'After the police pepper sprayed . him, he was running around, probably trying to get it out of his eyes. He ran into the water but they didn't follow him. 'One woman - I don't . know if she knew him or not - tried to go in after him but they stopped . her. She was trying to save him but they wouldn't let her go in.' This afternoon, . residents and visitors to the caravan park claimed that Mr Stent had . spent much of the afternoon drinking before trying . to buy more alcohol in the Clubhouse later in the evening. 'He . tried to buy more booze over the bar and staff just refused to serve . him,’ said one resident. 'He became louder and louder and more . argumentative and in the end the police had to be called.' Location: Mr Stent, from Hastings, was with friends at Coghurst Hall Holiday Park near the seaside town . Shortly after 11pm on Saturday night officers approached Mr Stent in a bid to pacify him. However, it was claimed by police that he then struck out at one of the officers before they decided to 'incapacitate' him by using pepper spray. Mr Stent then ran away from officers towards the nearby lake which has clear signs advising that swimming is not allowed. Having . jumped into the water shortly after 11.20pm he tried to swim some 70 . metres to reach a small wooden jetty on the other side of the lake. 'Police . and his friends were all shouting at him to come back to the shore but . he was swearing at them,' said the eye-witness whose home is near the . jetty. 'I . was alerted that something was going on because I had three night . fishing rods out on the lake and I heard the bite detector alarms going . off. He must have touched the fishing lines as he swam. 'I . was on my chalet balcony and saw him clearly on the lily pads for about . thirty seconds and then he went limp and he was gone.' According . to residents police and firefighters searched for Mr Stent using lights . and at least three boats until around 4am. Park entrance: Mr Stent is believed to have been visiting friends at Coghurst Hall Holiday Park near Hastings . When the search was resumed on Sunday morning, a police dog on a small boat finally located his body at around 3pm. One resident who witnessed the incident said: 'Everyone was out by the water watching what was going on. 'I sat on the bank with his father and brother on Sunday while they waited for the police to pull his body out. 'It was heartbreaking.' 'I sat on the bank with his father and brother on Sunday while they waited for the police to pull his body out.  It was heartbreaking.' - Coghurst Hall holiday park resident . Residents said the lake, which is full of large carp and is up to 20ft deep in places, was never used for swimming and was full of reeds. Sussex . police Chief Inspector Warren Franklin said: 'Officers and friends of . the man encouraged him to come out of the water, but before he could do . so he got into difficulties. 'Officers . used boats to get onto the lake but could not find any trace of him. A . large-scale search of the lake was launched by officers with other . members of the emergency services as well as the surrounding area.' Yesterday, members of Mr Stent’s family visited the park and lake where they threw flowers into the water in his memory. Mr Stent’s mother, Pam, was said by a family member to be ‘too . distraught’ to talk about her son at her home in Hastings today. Drinkers at the Paddy McGinty’s pub he frequented in the town spoke of a 'nice family man who was not one to take risks.'

"By . Sean Poulter . Staff at key industrial plants are having to sit in the cold doing nothing as firms shut off power to avoid crippling energy bills. Heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face a complex price-setting regime which means, for example, that boiling a kettle during periods of peak demand can cost up to £27. Some are now trying to protect themselves by shutting down during high-demand winter periods. Heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face a complex price-setting regime which means, for example, that boiling a kettle during periods of peak demand can cost up to £27 . Industry leaders say this ‘Third World’ scenario is damaging the economy. The details emerged amid growing concern of an energy gap caused by the switch from coal-fired power stations to green energy, in particular wind farms, which means Britain could face an electricity shortage by the winter of 2015-16. Tony Pedder, chairman of heavy steel engineering firm Sheffield Forgemasters, said he expects the plant to shut down around 30 times over the winter. ‘It costs us £27 to boil the kettle,’ he said. ‘We end up telling our workers to sit in the mess room to keep warm because we can’t afford to keep going. It is a crazy system and it is getting worse.’ The unusual measures are the result of a ‘triad’ price-setting regime unique to UK energy supply. A portion of the charge paid by industry for its electricity goes to the National Grid to maintain and improve cable networks. Tony Pedder, chairman of heavy steel engineering firm Sheffield Forgemasters, said: 'It costs us £27 to boil the kettle' The figure is based on how much electricity the 100,000 heaviest users consume during three undisclosed half-hour periods of peak demand between November and February, called triads. Consequently firms try to avoid these periods, when the price of electricity spikes upwards by as much as 300 times. Celsa Steel (UK) in Cardiff has shut down daily this winter for up to three hours at peak times. And Tata Steel said a specialist division in Yorkshire shut down between 4pm and 6pm every day last week. The firm was hit with a  £1million bill after operating during a half-hour peak period. High UK energy bills, partly driven up by tariffs imposed to fund a shift to green energy, are a handicap to the economy. The chemical arm of Tata, which is Indian-owned, closed a soda ash plant in Cheshire last year in favour of importing from the US, while BASF of Germany is shutting a pigment plant in Paisley next year. In December energy industry regulator Ofgem announced measures to head off the threat of blackouts in 2015. Firms will be paid to cease production on winter evenings. Director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, Jeremy Nicholson, said: ‘How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?’ This photograph shows Corus steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales . National Grid said all charges and the triad system were agreed with customers. A spokesman said: ‘Large business users are incentivised to reduce their usage at times of peak demand. ‘This has the effect of reducing overall peak demand, so less investment is needed to upgrade transmission networks to deal with peaks in demand. It also smoothes out the peaks in demand so that power stations can be operated more efficiently.’ He also challenged the suggestion it would cost £27 to boil the kettle during a triad, saying the figure was an average of £1.46.","Heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face complex price-setting regime meaning boiling a kettle during peak periods can cost up to £27 .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The Asiana Airlines flight that crashed in San Francisco in July killing three people was going dangerously slowly, a new document reveals. Asiana Airlines said in a report to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that the flight crew failed to maintain a minimum air speed during its final approach. The South Korean airline also blamed what it called 'inadequate warning systems' for alerting the crew that the auto-throttle had stopped maintaining the set air speed. The Asiana Airlines flight that crashed at San Francisco International Airport, was probably caused by the pilots flying dangerously slowly . Asiana Airlines has blamed the design of the auto-throttle for the crash, an issue that had been raised previously . It suggested the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Co, modify the low speed alert system on its planes. Immediately after the July 6, 2013 crash at San Francisco International Airport, Asiana Airlines said there appeared to be no mechanical problem with the aircraft. But in its latest document the airline blamed the design of the auto-throttle, an issue that had been raised previously. However, in its submission to the NTSB, Boeing said 'there were numerous cues' that the aircraft's speed was slowing dangerously and it placed the blame for the crash squarely on the pilots. Three people were killed in the crash, with one of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, apparently surviving being ejected onto the tarmac, only to be run over by a fire truck . The aircraft manufacturer said: 'This accident occurred due to the flight crew's failure to monitor and control air speed, thrust level and glide path on short final approach. 'This accident would have been avoided had the flight crew followed procedures and initiated a timely go-around as the approach became increasingly unstable.' The crash killed three people and injured more than 180 and was the first fatal commercial plane crash in the United States since February 2009. One of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, apparently survived being ejected onto the tarmac, only to be run over by a fire truck. But aircraft manufacturer Boeing said 'there were numerous cues' that the aircraft's speed was slowing dangerously . The co-pilot, who was training the pilot flying the plane, thought the auto-throttle on the Boeing 777 jet might not have been operating, the documents showed. The pilot flying the plane said he wasn't sure whether the auto-throttle was maintaining speed, according to the documents. The low, slow landing caused the plane's tail to hit a seawall short of the runway. The plane spun 330 degrees as it broke apart and caught fire, strewing wreckage along the runway. The NTSB opened an investigative hearing into the causes of the crash in December and has been examining concerns about the auto-throttle.","Airline says 'inadequate' warning system failed to alert pilots to slow speed .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A pensioner who jumped in a canal, a woman who believed she was 'queen of heaven' and a boy who responded to the name 'broken window' - these are just some of the patients detailed in medical records from a Victorian insane asylum. The records detail hundreds of former patients at the Stanley Royd Hospital, part of the West Riding Pauper Asylum, between 1814 and 1991. They are currently being held by West Yorkshire Archive Service (WYAS), in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Today, the records have been added to the UK National Register of Documentary Heritage - run by the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. A collection of records (pictured) detailing the medical history of former patients at the Stanley Royd Hospital - part of West Rising Pauper Asylym - has been added to the National Register of Documentary Heritage . The records feature photographs of those admitted to the institution between 1814 and 1991 (pictured) One patient in the collection is Ann Humphries (left) -  a carpet weaver who was admitted on 9 May 1871, aged 53, having thrown herself into the canal at Walton, Yorkshire. Another is schoolboy Alfred Todd (right) of Wakefield - who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy' and thought his name was 'broken window' The programme is an online catalogue created to help promote the UK’s . documentary heritage across the UK and the world. One . of the first such institutions in the UK, the West Riding Pauper Asylum . opened its first hospital - The Stanley Royd - in 1818. The three others are South Yorkshire Asylum, High Royds Hospital, and Storthes Hall. Archivist . David Morris, from WYAS, said: 'The records on West Riding Pauper . Asylum, Stanley Royd, are studied by professionals coming from all over . the UK and abroad. 'The . data on these records goes back nearly 200 years and provides a . reflection of how mental illness and treatments have developed over . time. The former asylum (pictured) is now a residential development in Wakefield. It was one of the first asylums to be opened in the UK in 1818 and has been hailed as a pioneering institution in the field of mental health . An early drawing of the Asylum shows the grounds and main hospital buildings. An archivist said today the collection 'provides a reflection of how mental illness and treatments have developed over time' 'They were seen as pioneers of such methods as electrical stimulation therapy and physical restraint.' The . collection, which is hailed as one of the most important in the . country, has been recognised as being of unique significance and an . irreplaceable source for the medical and social heritage. At . the heart of the collection are the patients’ records, recording, in . intimate and extensive detail, the admission, family and social . background, illnesses, treatment, and ultimate fate of the thousands of . men, women and children who passed through the doors of Stanley Royd . over the course of 173 years. Archivist David Morris looks through one of the record books. He said today: 'The data on these records goes back nearly 200 years and provides a reflection of how mental illness and treatments have developed over time' Another patient's case notes, including a photograph. The collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late 1860s onwards - putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers . The . collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late . 1860s onwards, putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers. One of which was Mary Manning, a Bradford domestic servant, who was admitted in 1880. She claimed to be the 'Queen of heaven, possessed of great wealth and had been crowned'. One of the patients was Ann Humphreys, pictured, from Dewsbury, who was a carpet weaver. She was admitted on 9 May 1871, aged 53, having thrown herself into the canal at Walton. She nearly died but was resuscitated. During her imprisonment at the Court House she tried to strangle herself twice. Both her mother and sister had been classed as insane and were in Durham County Asylum. Ann has suffered from epileptic fits for 26 years. She worked in the Potato Kitchen, and was still in the Asylum in 1890 when she died. Another was Mary Manning, a Bradford domestic servant, admitted in 1880. She claimed to be the 'Queen of heaven, possessed of great wealth and had been crowned' Sarah Drabble of Wortley aged 37 with 18 children was admitted in 1832 for 'feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement'. Mary Ellen Yates, a Leeds housewife, was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband. Children were also taken in to the asylum - including Alfred Todd of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy'. The remarks made on his treatment include . an answer to questions regarding name and age, which he replied 'broken . window' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies . 'Alfey'. Others . case files show patients were suffering from general health problems . such as symptoms which would be recognised today as post-natal . depression. Sarah Drabble of Wortley was admitted in 1832, aged 37 with 18 children. She was not surprisingly 'feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement'. Other women were suffering from social problems, including Mary Ellen Yates, a Leeds housewife, who was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband. Children were admitted into the hospital from as early as 1820 and until the opening of the separate Stanley Hall facility in 1901. Examples from the Stanley Hall era include Alfred Todd of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who was diagnosed of 'imbecility with epilepsy'. The remarks made on his treatment include an answer to questions regarding name and age, which he replied 'broken window' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies 'Alfey'. Another mother of an 11-year-old Leeds boy in 1911, said: 'I cannot manage him. He is destructive, breaks and tears everything he can get to lay his hands on. 'I am obliged to keep knives out of his way and all windows closed. Children in the neighbourhood are afraid of him.' Mr Morris said: 'What was so unique about this asylum was the fact it was a pauper asylum. 'This meant they would take in anyone, which means both short and long-term patients were based there. 'The records also highlight how the treatment and attitude to mental health has changed throughout the years. 'One of the most notable changes is looking at the language staff would use towards patients, which we would not use now. 'For example, words like ‘Imbecile’ are used to describe some patients.' The . award for ‘Best of UK Heritage’ recognises the outstanding but . lesser-known heritage of the UK. Only nine UK collections have been . successful this year. This . is the second collection held by WYAS to receive a UNESCO award, with . the diaries of Anne Lister 1806-1840, held at WYAS, Calderdale gaining . the accolade in 2011. A collection of 130 ancient ‘curse stones’ featuring gruesome messages of revenge from Roman times have been added to a world heritage register. The stones - known as ‘curse tablets’ - had messages scrawled into them by people who had been wronged before being tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset. The authors would pour bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways. A collection of 130 ancient 'curse stones' (pictured) featuring gruesome message of revenge written by people wishing revenge on their enemies has also been added to the UNESCO heritage register . One calls for an adversary’s intestines to be 'quite eaten away', while another seeks revenge for the theft of a bronze vessel and asks it be filled with the blood of the thief. Another is written in British Celtic - the only text known to survive in that language - while one tablet contains the earliest known use of the word Christian in Britain. The curses, which date back between the second and fourth century AD, are written in Latin to the goddess Sulis Minerva and inscribed on small sheets of lead or pewter. They were then case into the hot springs at Bath, where a they were left for the goddess. One person writes on their curse stone that a thief who stole their gloves should 'lose their eyes and minds' Now 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed to precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Memory of the World register of outstanding documentary heritage. They are the only objects from Roman Britain to have been inscribed on the Unesco Memory of the World UK register. Many of the curses have been translated from their original Latin and reveal that not only were Bath’s Romans creative in their requests for revenge, but were also very specific. One person asked that a thief who had stolen their gloves should go mad and blind, saying: 'Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds and eyes in the goddess’ temple.' While another person wrote: 'May he who carried off Vilbia from me become liquid as the water. May she who so obscenely devoured her become dumb' There was also a tendency for particularly gory punishments for the guilty, including a curse about a stolen ring. The aggrieved victim said: '..so long as someone, whether slave or free, keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft).' Councillor Ben Stevens, Bath and North East Somerset Council’s cabinet member for sustainable development, accepted the certificate of inscription on behalf of the local authority. He said: 'The decision by Unesco to inscribe the Roman curse tablets from Bath on the Memory of the World register reflects the very special nature of this collection, and is another reason for local people to take pride in the exceptional quality of our local heritage here in B&NES.' The messages were then thrown in to the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset pictured.

"By . Rob Preece . Crime rates are higher in countries where more people believe in heaven than in hell, researchers have found. The finding emerged from a study into 26 years of data involving more than 140,000 people from almost 70 nations. The results suggest that people are more likely to feel they can get away with criminal behaviour if they don't believe they could be punished in the afterlife. Punishment: A US police officer makes an arrest. Research suggests that crime rates are higher in societies where more people believe in heaven than hell. (File photograph) Academics discovered that offences such as murders, robberies and rapes were more common in societies where punishment forms an important part of people's religious beliefs. This means a country where more people think there is a heaven than a hell, for example, is likely to see more offences than a nation where beliefs are more equally shared. The study, which appears in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE, is the work of two US-based professors - Azim Shariff, from the University of Oregon, and Mijke Rhemtulla, of the University of Kansas. They looked for references to hell, heaven and God in surveys that were conducted between 1981 and 2007 with 143,197 participants based in 67 countries. The pair then compared the data to average crime rates in those countries based on homicides, robberies, rapes, kidnappings, assaults, thefts, car crime, drug offences, burglaries and human trafficking. Academic: Professor Azim Shariff, from the University of Oregon, took part in the study, which examined 26 years of data . 'Rates of belief in heaven and hell had significant, unique, and opposing effects on crime rates,' they found in the study. 'Belief in hell predicted lower crime rates...whereas belief in heaven predicted higher crime rates.' Prof Shariff, professor of psychology and director of the University of Oregon's Culture and Morality Lab, said: 'The key finding is that, controlling for each other, a nation's rate of belief in hell predicts lower crime rates, but the nation's rate of belief in heaven predicts higher crime rates,and these are strong effects. 'I think it's an important clue about the differential effects of supernatural punishment and supernatural benevolence. 'The finding is consistent with controlled research we've done in the lab, but here shows a powerful ""real world"" effect on something that really affects people - crime.' Last year, in the International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, Prof Shariff reported that undergraduate students were more likely to cheat when they believe in a forgiving God than a punishing God. Religious belief generally has been viewed as 'a monolithic construct', he added. Faith: The study's findings suggest that people who don't believe they could be punished in the afterlife feel they can get away with behaving unethically . 'Once you split religion into different constructs, you begin to see different relationships. 'In this study, we found two differences that go in opposite directions. 'If you look at overall religious belief, these separate directions are washed out and you don't see anything. There's no hint of a relationship.' The professor added: 'Supernatural punishment across nations seems to predict lower crime rates. 'At this stage, we can only speculate about mechanisms, but it's possible that people who don't believe in the possibility of punishment in the afterlife feel like they can get away with unethical behavior. 'There is less of a divine deterrent.' In 2003, researchers at Harvard University found that economic performance was better in developed countries where people believed in hell more than they did in heaven.","Research in the US finds higher crime rates in nations where most people believe in punishment in the afterlife .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A fascinating set of maps show the the relentless spread of slavery in the early United States as the need for crops drove farmers, and the enslaved humans who toiled for them, ever westward starting at the dawn of the 19th century. The federal government created a massive data map measuring 2-feet by 3-feet as the Civil War began to appear inevitable. It was an early version of the data maps so popular on the internet today and showed the exact percentage of enslaved people in each American county. Abraham Lincoln himself used it as he and his generals hashed out their strategies of war. Fast forward to now and modern day historian Lincoln Mullen has used the impressive example of early data maps as inspiration for his own cultural cartography. On their backs: A George Mason University history Ph.D. candidate has created a series of maps that reveal the expansion of slavery in early America as men in bondage helped carry the nation west . Loads of data: Historian Lincoln Mullen used data from the very first U.S. census in 1790 through the 1860 census just before the Civil War . Zooming in: The maps give a county-by-county look at the enslaved population of rapidly growing America and reveal that the regions where slavery was most prevalent remained constant through the antebellum years . Westward expansion: Mullen finds that instead of through intensification in the regions with the most agricultural activity, slavery grew by leaps and bounds up until the Civil War through westward expansion . Mullen's maps begin with the first U.S. census in 1790 and continue until the days leading up to the Civil War. They reveal how shockingly pervasive and seemingly unstoppable the spread of slavery truly was. They also show the areas where slaves made up the greatest proportion of population: notably in the famously agricultural regions of the South along the mighty Mississippi, the seemingly more northern Chesapeake Bay, and all along the southern Atlantic coast. Here, though, Mullen's data strikes a surprising note as it shows that--while enslaved men and women were common here--the density of slaves remained largely constant throughout the antebellum years. Mullen finds that it was through expansion, and not intensification, that the numbers of enslaved reached nearly 4 million in these years. 'In other words, slavery was not the paternalist institution that its apologists made it out to be,' Mullen writes on Smithsonianmag.com. 'It was an relentlessly exploitative system where the fundamental relation of owner to enslaved was defined by the markets.' The face of American growth: Agriculture was the driving force behind the westward movement of slaves and behind much of the massive early growth of America. Mullen's work shows all too well exactly what made these human economic engines commodities rather than people . The U.S. federal government created this 2-foot by 3-foot map, one of the earlier examples of data maps, in 1861. The map shows the exact percentage of the population in each county that was enslaved at the time. Abraham Lincoln himself used the map as he and his generals planned the Civil War tactics . Inspiration: A zoomed-in portion of the 1861 map shows the counties along the Mississippi along with their shockingly high proportion of enslaved inhabitants. This map was par tof what inspired Mullen to create his series of maps .","Fascinating maps based on pre-Civil War census data clearly show the spread of enslaved workers as agriculture pushed ever west .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The chief of staff to Congressman Steve Stivers, a Republican from Ohio, was forced to resign after an adult film star tweeted a photo of the aide's genitals to his boss. Adam Kuhn on Tuesday submitted a letter of resignation to Stivers, and the congressman accepted it, according to his spokesperson. Kuhn, who is single, released a statement to Politico apologizing for his actions. Career-ending tweet: Ex-porn star Jennifer Roubenes Allbaugh (left) tweeted a lewd photo to Rep Steve Stivers (right) depicting his chief of staff, Adam Kuhn, who was later forced to step down . Hell hath no fury: Allbaugh, who goes by the stage name Ruby, fired off this angry tweet the day she shared her former lover's intimate photos online . ‘Over the weekend, I was the victim of an attack on Twitter from a woman I had a relationship with in my personal life,’ Kuhn told Politico. ‘I realize and apologize I had used poor judgement in my personal life regarding this relationship. The woman who posted this has reached out to me to apologize.’ The woman at the center of the scandal has been named as Jennifer Roubenes Allbaugh, a former porn actress who is married with two children. Allbaugh, who goes by the stage name 'Ruby,' reportedly sent at least one image depicting Adam Kuhn's privates to Congressman Stiver's Twitter page last week as payback for a bad breakup. According to the veteran adult film star, Kuhn had dumped her and she was out for 'revenge.' On Saturday, Allbaugh tweeted: 'I hate you, AJK, you selfish pompous a**hole. Now we're even.' The woman was later forced to take down the X-rated photo of Kuhn's genitals after he obtained a cease-and-desist order against her. Her Twitter account has since been deleted. Jilted lover: Allbaugh, who is married, revealed that she was seeking revenge on Adam Kuhn after he broke up with her . Allbaugh told Politico that she was a disgruntled former girlfriend who was trying to make Kuhn hate her after their spit, even though she was in love with him and her husband at the same time. On her Facebook page, the woman wrote that she was a Hall of Fame adult star with 500 films under her belt and the proud recipient of the Golden G String Award in 2007. Several years ago, Allbaugh retired from the porn industry after 11 years to raise her children; she has described herself as 'a full time MILF.' Adam Kuhn has been a part of Steve Stivers' team since at least 2010. He was promoted to chief of staff last year, earning an annual salary of $130,000. While Kuhn's future in politics is uncertain, his ex-girlfriend has lofty aspirations ranging from becoming a madame to running for a public office. Lofty aspirations: Allbaugh retired from pornography to raise her children after starring in some 500 films and being inducted into the adult industry's Hall of Fame, but now she may be eying a career in politics . In an excerpt from Marc Copage's documentary Adult Star Chronicles, the adult performer revealed that she loves politics. 'I will run for office someday,' she declared before adding, 'when I'm old and non-threatening.' Earlier in the interview recorded last year, Allbaugh spoke out in favor of legalizing prostitution in California. 'I will own the first legal brothel in California, you can mark my words,' she vowed.","Rep Steve Stivers, a Republican from Ohio, accepted Adam Kuhn's resignation Tuesday .

"By . Amanda Williams . A care home nurse was allegedly so drunk at work that she confused a teddy bear with a baby, a hearing was told today. Violet Ruto attended the Ashton Grange Nursing Home in Horsham, West Sussex while intoxicated on repeated occasions and was so unsteady on her feet she had to be removed from the building, it was said. She was also found sleeping in one of the rooms during her shift on New Year’s Eve, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Care home nurse Violet Ruto attended the Ashton Grange Nursing Home in Horsham, West Sussex while intoxicated on repeated occasions and was so unsteady on her feet she had to be removed from the building, it has been said . It is alleged that she asked a resident if they were holding a baby when it was actually a teddy bear on one occasion. The nurse is facing a string of charges relating to claims she was unfit for work on at least four occasions. Care home manager Carmel Rigby said she received a phone call at home at 10.15pm on December 1, 2010, to say that Ruto had turned up drunk for her night shift. She said: ‘My instant reaction was shock, I couldn’t believe a nurse would come into work under the influence of alcohol. ‘When I arrived at the home I found Violet with her coat on and her bag packed - she was very meek. ‘I asked what was going on and she said ""I’m fine"". Hearing: Laura Kane will appear at the Nursing and Midwifery Council tomorrow. She denies the nurse denies taking compassionate leave and lying about her qualifications . ‘Her speech was slurred, her mouth was screwed up and she was speaking in an unusual tone. ‘Her eyes were bloodshot and she smelled of alcohol. ‘I had noted that she often wore a lot of body spray or perfume to work which I thought could have been to mask the smell of alcohol. ‘She could barely stand by herself. ‘Violet required staff to remove her from the premises as she was so unsteady on her feet.’ Ruto claimed she had not been drinking at all but was suffering from a migraine during an interview about her conduct. The alleged incidents are all said to have taken place in December 2010. If she is found guilty of misconduct Ruto could be suspended or struck off. She has not attended the tribunal and is not represented. The hearing continues.

Hackers Rex Mundi claim to have stolen the passwords of 650,000 Domino's Pizza customers in France and Belgium, and are threatening to publish them if a ¿30,000 (£23,892) ransom is not paid (pictured) It claims to have downloaded more than 592,000 customer . records, including passwords from French customers, and over 58,000 . records from Belgian ones. Other stolen details include customers' full names, . addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords and delivery . instructions. The group even admitted to stealing details of the customer's favourite pizza topping. Rex Mundi also took to Twitter to publicise the alleged hack and advised customers to speak to their lawyers. In a message, Rex Mundi said: 'Earlier this week, we hacked our way into the servers of Domino's Pizza France and Belgium, who happen to share the same vulnerable database. 'And boy, did we find some juicy stuff in . there! We downloaded over 592,000 customer records (including . passwords) from French customers and over 58,000 records from Belgian . ones.' Domino's France issued a statement on . Twitter saying that although its data is encrypted, it has fallen victim . to 'professionals' who were able to 'decode the cryptographic system . for the passwords'. Domino's . Pizza executive Andre ten Wolde then told a Dutch newspaper that the . ransom demand would not be paid, and stressed financial data, had not . been compromised. Customers of the pizza company are being . advised to change their passwords 'as a security measure'. The breach . has also been reported to French police. Rex Mundi has given a deadline of 8pm CEST tonight (7pm BST) for Dominos to pay up, or the group 'will post the entirety of the data in [its] possession on the internet'. Customers have been advised by Domino's to change their passwords 'as a security measure'. Domino's pizza and snacks are pictured . A spokesman for Domino’s Pizza Group said: 'The data hacking is isolated to the Domino’s franchise in France and Belgium, and no customer credit card or financial information was compromised. 'Domino’s customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland are not affected by this incident. 'The security of customer information is very important to us. We regularly test our UK website for penetration as part of the ongoing rigorous checks and continual routine maintenance of our online operations.' Jason Hart, VP Cloud Solutions at SafeNet, said:'The latest breach continues to raise public awareness of the need for encryption – not just of financial data, but also wider customer information...breaches will happen and you can't stop them. The issue is – are you able to protect your sensitive data when a breach happens?' 'The fact that financial information was not compromised minimises the severity of the breach. But given the increasing number of data breaches we’re seeing, it’s clear that companies need to start thinking about encrypting more than just financial data. If not they run the risk of losing customers to those competitors that do.' Despite the lack of financial details, the company has said that the Dominos's break is still 'severe'. David Emm senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab , said: The fact that credit card details and other financial data weren’t stolen in this case is good, but the theft of personal information is bad news for customers too. 'This is especially true of passwords since, sadly, many people use the same passwords for many of (or all) their online accounts.'","Criminals claim to have stolen details from users in France and Belgium .

"By . Tom Gardner . It was a fleeting moment of friendship across the battlelines which now stands as testament to the unwavering spirit of human kinship that not even savage warfare could extinguish. But newly discovered letters sent from the trenches of the Western Front have cast new light on the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914, when the guns of First World War fell silent and sworn enemies put hostilities aside to play a game of football. The previously unpublished letters sent by Major John Hawksley, of the Royal Field Artillery, to his sister Muriel at her home in Coatham Mundeville, near Darlington, show that not everyone on the frontline agreed with the unofficial ceasefire. The impromptu battlefield football matches were recreated in this picture at Dale Barracks between German soldiers and Royal Welsh Fusiliers . The Christmas Day truce of 1914, showing German and British soldiers socialising . Major Hawksley's letters will be auctioned by Bonhams in London on June 19, where they are expected to sell for £4,000. The . Christmas Day truce saw more than 100,000 British and German soldiers . lower their guns and leave the trenches to exchange gifts and play . football in the mud of No Man's Land. But, according to Major Hawksley, then 37, at least one regiment refused to take part. Writing . from the frontline, the soldier told his sister: 'The Seaforths...would . have none of it and when the Germans in front of them tried to . fraternise and leave their trenches, the Seaforths warned them that they . would shoot.' Truce and reconciliation: Newly discovered letters sent by Major John Hawksley, of the Royal . Field Artillery, to his sister Muriel at her home in Coatham Mundeville, near .

Group of German soldiers fraternise with two English soldiers, one in great coat and one in rear wearing balaclava, on Christmas Day 1914 . He also spoke of his own discomfort . about the truce and added: 'This is an extraordinary state of things and . I don't altogether approve of it', although he admitted: 'Still it . gives me and my observation post a quiet time.' The first letter sent to Muriel, written on December 27, details the festive camaraderie between the opposing forces. He . wrote: 'Christmas day in our immediate front was quite extraordinary. After dark our men and the Germans whose trenches were only one to two . hundred yards apart sang in English Home Sweet Home together. Soldiers on the Western Front were seen eating a meal to celebrate Christmas Day in a shell hole partly occupied by the grave of a comrade . 'Then God Save the King was sung by both. I don't know what words the Germans sang to this tune. 'Then late on a German shouted to the Warwicks - 'We won't fire tomorrow if you don't'. Our men shouted back ""All right"". 'When it was light on Xmas day, each side showed itself above the trenches. 'First . head and shoulders then seeing they were not shot at - showed a little . more - until a German got out of his trench and then an Englishman did. Temporary peace: British and German troops on the Western Front pour out of the trenches to fraternise on Christmas Day 1914 . 'Finally about 100 Germans and 60 Englishmen including officers on both sides stepped out and fraternised with each other!' He wrote that a football match was also arranged for Boxing Day but he discovered that 'our big guns' were due to fire. 'The . OC [officer commanding] Warwicks warned the German officer that they . were going to be shelled and that he hoped they would not be hit and all . went back to their trenches. 'When the shelling began and they saw that they themselves were not to be the targets, they got out again. Hellish: The Christmas Day truce gave soldiers a momentary break from the horrific reality and conditions of life in the trenches, pictured here, a scene on the British Western front-fixing ladders to the sides of a trench in preparation for a raid . 'Then a German officer said to one of ours: ""Look here we don't want to shoot you and you don't want to shoot us"". 'So . the arrangement between us...is that neither of them shoot and that if . they have to begin they will fire three volleys over their heads as a . warning.' In the second . letter, written two days later on December 29, he noted that the . proposed football match in their quadrant was stopped by ""our . authorities"", adding: 'I don't think an official armistice has been . carried out quite so long as in front of me. (Gunfire continues all the . same). Rest: Exhausted troops try to recover and catch some sleep in the trenches during a break in the battle in World War I . 'Yesterday the Hampshires received [from the Germans] the following message: ""Gentlemen. Our automatic pistol has been ordered from the Colonel to begin to fire again at midnight, we take it an honour to award you of this fact"". Funny isn't it?' Hawksley, whose parents lived in Pembrokeshire, was a veteran of Ladysmith and Khartoum and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for services on the retreat from Mons. He was killed by a sniper in France in 1916 and is buried at Becourt Military Cemetery. Last year, previously-unseen letter was discovered which described the legendary football match of the Christmas Day truce during the First World War. The letter was sent by staff sergeant Clement Barker four days after Christmas 1914, when the British and German troops famously emerged from their trenches in peace. Sgt Barker, from Ipswich, Suffolk, describes how the truce began after a German messenger walked across no man's land on Christmas Eve to broker the temporary ceasefire. Recount: The previously-unseen letter sent by Sgt Barker which describes the famous football game of the Christmas Day truce . Game: The letter, left, sent by Sgt Barker, . right, recounts how the match began when a ball was kicked out from the . British lines . British soldiers then went out and recovered 69 dead comrades and buried them. Sgt Barker said the impromptu football match soon broke out between the two sides when a ball was kicked out from the British lines into no man's land. His nephew Rodney Barker, 66, found the letter when he was going through some old documents following his mother's death.Sgt Barker wrote to his brother Montague: '...a messenger come over from the German lines and said that if they did not fire Xmas day, they (the Germans) wouldn't so in the morning (Xmas day). 'A German looked over the trench - no shots - our men did the same, and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in (69) and buried them and the next thing happened a football kicked out of our Trenches and Germans and English played football.

Boxing day the same, and has remained so up to now...'We have conversed with the Germans and they all seem to be very much fed up and heaps of them are deserting. 'Some have given themselves up as prisoners, so things are looking quite rosy.' His optimistic outlook proved quite wrong, as the truce was the last act of chivalry between the two sides and the war went on for four more years, with the loss of ten million lives.","More than 100,000 British and German soldiers lowered their guns that day .

"Anne Frank's diary has been brought to life in a multimillion pound theatrical production. Simply titled 'Anne', the show transports viewers back to the Amsterdam apartment where Anne and her family hid from the Nazis during the Second World War. Set in a specially-built theatre on the outskirts of the town, viewers are able to watch the moment the Frank family are arrested and dragged away by German security police - as well as the moments leading up to that fateful moment. Anne Frank's diary is being brought to life in a multimillion pound theatrical production in Amsterdam. Pictured are two actors portraying Anne and her mother Edith in the innovative show . Simply titled Anne, the show uses film projected on to a giant panoramic screen to help tell the tale of the Frank family who hid in an Amsterdam apartment from the Nazis . It is hoped a series of interactive sets used in the show - including one of the Frank's apartment that revolves across a panoramic screen - will help bring the young diarist's story to a new generation. The show marks the first time a theatrical production has been forged directly from Frank's actual writings since an award-winning 1950s play that escalated her tale, which was little known at the time, to the world's attention. Producer Robin de Levita said in an interview prior to its opening last month: 'A lot of people think they know the story, but once you see this you will get to know a lot of details you don't realize. 'We show historical footage to create a relationship between what happened in real time and what happened while they were in hiding. 'We follow her whole life and look over her shoulder, see what she experienced.' With the blessings of the charity that owns the diary's copyright, Anne uses Frank's own words, including some passages excluded from the original published diary. Some of the sets revolve around a large panoramic screen, pictured here showing a film of the German dictator. Extracts from Anne's diary will be used in the show - with actors speaking in Dutch . Anne lies in bed. Producer Robin de Levita said in an interview: 'A lot of people think they know the story, but once you see this you will get to know a lot of details you don't realize' The play is being staged in a specially-built 1,100-seat theater in Amsterdam's west port area. The 15-meter-high (50-foot) stage includes a revolving replica of the secret canal-side apartment where Frank and her family hid for 18 months from the Nazi forces occupying the Netherlands in World War II. They were betrayed in 1944 and deported. 'You can see the relationship between the rooms, between the people, what actually happened while they were in hiding.' De Levita said. Anne died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp weeks before it was liberated in 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, survived Auschwitz and later published Anne's diary, which had been saved by Miep Gies, one of the Dutch 'helpers' that brought the family food and other supplies. A set of the Frank's flat indicated the scale of the stage - which is an imposing 50 ft tall . In another scene, the family walk out of the revolving flat set and down a flight of stairs . Anne's cousin Buddy Elias, her nearest surviving relative, will attend the opening, along with the Netherlands' King Willem Alexander. Although the actors speak Dutch, starting in July there will be headphone translations into several major languages, along with a synopsis for computer tablets or smartphones. The Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland, which owns rights to the diary and oversees the Frank family legacy, said it sought out theater-makers and scriptwriters in the Netherlands, hoping a new theatrical production could promote its mission. Two actresses speed across the stage on bicycles during the show - tickets from which will start from 20 euros . A man sweeps the floor through drapes of fabric. The Frank family were betrayed in 1944 and deported - with Anne dying in a concentration camp the following year . 'It's important to have an educational program which will bring in today's times the story of Anne Frank to a young kind of audience,' said Fonds spokesman Yves Kugelmann. The Dutch script was written by one of the Netherlands' best-known literary couples, Leon de Winter and Jessica Durlacher. Tickets range from 20-70 euros (£16-£55) but the Fond's licensing fees go to UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.","'Anne' will transport viewers back to apartment where diarist and family hid from the Nazis during the Second World War .

"By . Ted Thornhill . China and America's defense chiefs faced off over a territorial dispute about islands in the East China Sea, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wagging his finger at the Chinese and telling them that they don't have the right to unilaterally establish an air defense zone over the islands. And he said on Tuesday that the U.S will protect Japan in a dispute with China, as laid out in U.S. treaty obligations. Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan said his country will not take the initiative to stir up troubles with Japan, but Beijing is ready to use its military if needed to safeguard its territory. And he warned that the U.S. must ‘stay vigilant’ against Japan's actions and ‘not be permissive and supportive’ of Tokyo. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (left) and his Chinese counterpart Chang Wanquan (right) meet at the Chinese Defense Ministry headquarters in Beijing on Tuesday.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, left, is welcomed by Rear Admiral Guan Youfei, Director of Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese Defense Ministry and U.S. Ambassador to China, Max Baucus, upon his arrival at Qingdao International Airport on Monday . The U.S. has criticized Beijing's . recent declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the East . China Sea, including disputed islands controlled by Japan. In . their remarks, the two men aired their countries' well-known positions . about the territorial disputes, although doing it for the first time in . China, shoulder to shoulder after nearly two hours of meetings here. ‘Every . nation has a right to establish an air defense zone, but not a right to . do it unilaterally with no collaboration, no consultation. That adds to . tensions, misunderstandings, and could eventually add to, and . eventually get to dangerous conflict,’ said Hagel, poking his figure . toward the television cameras and photographers at the back of the room, . as shutters clicked.

For . his part, Chang said China stands ready to resolve the disputes . diplomatically. But he made it clear that China is always ready to . respond to threats. On the . issue of territorial sovereignty, Chang said, ‘we will make no . compromise, no concession, no trading, not even a tiny ... violation is . allowed.’ On a broader . scale, the meeting focused on how the U.S. and China can build stronger . ties, in the wake of years of frosty relations over Beijing's military . buildup, persistent cyberattacks against U.S. government agencies and . private industry, and aggressive Chinese territorial claims in the East .

Confrontation: A Japan Coast Guard vessel (right) sprays water against Taiwanese fishing boats, while a Taiwanese coast guard ship (left) also sprays water in the East China Sea near the disputed islands . There are eight disputed islands altogether lying around 120 miles northeast of Taiwan, 200 miles east of China and 450 miles from mainland Japan, though they are only 200 miles from the Japanese island of Okinawa. In Chinese they are known as the Diaoyu and Japan calls them the Senkaku islands. They are significant because they lie near undersea oil and gas reserves, rich fishing waters and punctuate strategically important shipping lanes. China says they have been part of its territory since 1534, but they were officially assimilated into Japan in 1895 after it surveyed them and established that they were uninhabited. In 1951, under the terms of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan relinquished several territories, including Taiwan - but the Senkaku islands moved to U.S control. It was only a temporary arrangement, though, with Japan taking ownership once more in 1971. China, however, says that the Treaty of San Francisco should have returned the islands to its territory. Japan hit back, saying that China didn't make any complaints at the time and that protests only began - from Taiwan, too - once oil reserves were discovered nearby in the early 1970s. It also disputes that the islands were ever part of China's official territory. The biggest island measures just 1.66 square miles - and the smallest is really just a big rock. Beijing's recent . declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the East China . Sea, including disputed islands controlled by Japan has raised . complaints from the U.S., deepening concerns that it could spark a . confrontation. Washington . has refused to recognize the zone or follow China's demands that its . aircraft file flight plans with Beijing's Defense Ministry and heed . Chinese instructions. China has warned of unspecified retaliatory . measures against aircraft that do not comply, but has so far taken no . action. He also said the . U.S. and China must be more open with each other about their cyber . capabilities, saying that greater openness ‘reduces the risk that . misunderstanding and misperception could lead to miscalculation.’ Hagel . pointed to the ongoing threat from North Korea, which recently . threatened additional missile and nuclear tests. And he said the U.S. and China have a shared interest ‘in achieving a verifiable, . irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’ In . recent weeks the North has conducted a series of rocket and ballistic . missile launches that are considered acts of protest against annual . ongoing springtime military exercises by Seoul and Washington. North . Korea says the exercises are rehearsals for invasion. ‘Our . vision is a future where our militaries can work closely together on a . range of challenges, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief . missions. However, to reach this objective, we must be candid about . issues where we disagree,’ Hagel said. Hagel also said the two countries have agreed to conduct a joint military medical exercise, although not date was set. The islands lie closer to China than Japan, but both countries have claimed them . And . he said they will set up new formal procedures that will allow their . armies to better communicate and also set up an Asia-Pacific Security . Dialogue between the assistant defense secretary for the Asia Pacific . and China's director of the Ministry of National Defense Foreign Affairs . Office so they also can more easily exchange views. The . United States' campaign to encourage China to be more open about its . military growth and intentions got a symbolic boost Monday as Hagel got a . rare tour of the country's first aircraft carrier, but efforts to get . the Asian giant to be more transparent about cyberattacks and other . defense operations has been less successful. In . a speech planned for later Tuesday, Hagel will point to cybersecurity . as an area where the U.S. wants the Chinese to be more transparent, said . a senior U.S. official, who was not authorized to talk publicly by name . about the speech so spoke on condition of anonymity. Hagel . arrived in Beijing after a stop in Japan, where he told reporters that . China must be more open about its military buildup and better respect . its neighbors - a pointed allusion to the territorial disputes. During . unusually forceful remarks during his stop in Japan, Hagel drew a . direct line between Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and . the ongoing territorial disputes between China, Japan and others over . remote islands in the East China Sea. Calling . China a great power, he added that ‘with this power comes new and wider . responsibilities as to how you use that power, how you employ that . military power.’","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wagged his finger at the Chinese .

"By . James  Nye . The men known as the Central Park Five - who were wrongly convicted of the vicious rape of a jogger in 1989 - have agreed on a $40 million settlement with the city of New York. The resolution will mark the end of a 12-year legal battle the five men have fought after they spent years in prison as a result of the attack which shocked the nation and led in part to the implementation of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's clean up of New York City. The men initially filed a $250 million civil-rights lawsuit after the overturn of their false convictions in 2002 for acting as a 'wolf pack' of 'wilding' youths who attacked 28-year-old jogger Trisha Meili in 1989. Scroll down for video . Settlement: (left to right) Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Yusef Salaam in 2012 in New York City. The men have settled for $40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28-year-old woman in Central Park in 1989. Donald Trump has called the payout 'a disgrace' The five men - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise - were tried and found guilty of the rape of the investment banker and all served prison time. She was in a coma for 12 days and was left with permanent damage and no memory of the attack. All the men were aged 14-16 at the time of their arrest and alleged police brutality forced confessions from them. They also argued at the time that key DNA evidence was ignored during their trial which would have triggered a not guilty verdict. The five black and Hispanic men had their convictions overturned in December 2002, when an investigation discovered DNA proof they had not raped her, but that she was attacked by one lone man. This man, Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist already in prison, confessed to acting alone in the assault and the men were freed. The agreed deal, which must be approved by the city comptroller, averages out at roughly $1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men. That means that Kharey Wise, who spent 13-years in prison, will be the largest single payout New York City has made in a wrongful conviction case. The other four men all served around seven years in prison. The men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was said to be keen to have the case settled. This was in direct contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who argued the original $250 million suit was too high because authorities acted in good faith. Arrest: In this April 22, 1989 file photo, Yusef Salaam, 15, second from left, and Raymond Santana, 14, right, are led from the 24th Precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in Central Park . Indeed, according to the New York Times, the city's Law Department backed this opinion at the time. 'The case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted,' a department spokeswoman said. 'It’s about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct.' The attack on 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili occurred on April 19, 1989. It was one of the most notorious crimes in New York City history and it mesmerized the nation, serving as a lurid symbol of the city's racial and class divide and its rampant crime. It gave rise to the term 'wilding' for urban mayhem by teenagers. 'Drugs. Guns. Gangs. New York City was just crime central at that time,' said former New York Detective Kirk Burkhalter, recalling an era so blood-soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990, compared with 414 in 2012. 'You were scared to ride the trains after dark. It was such a different place.' Trisha Meili was out jogging in Central Park on April 19, 1989, when she was bound, gagged, raped and beaten nearly to death, a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by New York City police. From the start, the rape of a 28-year-old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term 'wilding' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby. The five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions, delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight. Twelve years later, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before Meili's assault, confessed to the crime, and DNA testing tied him to the rape. In a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated, prosecutor Nancy Ryan concluded that the boys' confessions contained 'troubling discrepancies' and that Reyes' description of the attack matched the crime scene. A judge vacated the convictions. By then, however, the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years. In 2002, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a panel to produce its own report, which concluded that the boys likely attacked Meili before Reyes did. Former prosecutor Michael Armstrong, who co-authored the report, said Ryan erred in dismissing the boys' confessions entirely. 'It seems impossible to say that they weren't there at all, because they knew too much,' he said in an interview. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed. 'They protect each other,' said Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, a lawyer for the five. 'It's always like this.' However, in prison, three of the men, Richardson, Salaam and Santan said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape. Mr. Santana indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people. 'I took part in with the beatings of that man,' he said. 'If I could go back in time and not do it again, you know, it would have been a whole different story.' The men’s lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night. When Meili was found in the brush, more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed. She was in a coma for 12 days, left with permanent damage, and remembers nothing about the attack. Meili later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book. Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, both 14 at the time, Antron McCray and Salaam, 15, and Korey Wise, 16, were rounded up and arrested. After hours of interrogation, four of them recorded confessions on video, in some cases with the boys' parents in the room. Bravery: Trisha Meili, The Central Park Jogger published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced . At the trials, their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced. At the time, DNA testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case. In 2002, a re-examination of the case found that DNA on the victim's sock pointed to Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger. Then-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau stopped short of declaring the Central Park Five innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial. (The statute of limitations for charging Reyes had run out; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes.) Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers for the five, said the DNA was the key. 'There was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case,' he said. 'In 1989, everybody might not have been forensic savvy, but now, after 'Law and Order,' everybody knows if there's no DNA, they didn't do it.' But an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police. Legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake. The two-hour documentary, 'The Central Park Five,' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted. The film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families, and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case. The defendants' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy. Wise was recently re-arrested. McCray moved away. Santana sold drugs and was sent back to prison, but now, along with Richardson and Salaam, has become the public face of the case, speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling. 'We are over being angry. Now it's about helping others, raising our own families right,' said Santana, now 39 last year.","Central Park 5 - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise - to settle 25-years after the crime .

"By . Richard Spillett . Jerry Monerville, convicted of a violent robbery, went on the run from Hollesley Bay open prison near Ipswich, Suffolk this week . A police force have come under fire for delays in telling the public that a violent criminal was on the run following the third escape in the area in three years. Elected police chief Tim Passmore hit out after Suffolk Police took nearly 20 hours to tell locals that Jerry Monerville had absconded from Hollesley Bay open prison near Ipswich. Monerville, 49, originally of Islington, north London, was serving an eight-year jail sentence for twice slashing the face of a 15-year-old Asian boy in Bethnal Green, east London, in November 2010. He failed to return to the notoriously insecure open prison - which has been dubbed Holiday Bay by inmates - by 3.30pm on Tuesday after being given leave to go to London last Friday. Police were informed the prisoner was missing from the jail at about 5.30pm on Tuesday but only told the public and media at 12.55pm on Wednesday. Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Mr Passmore said he would be challenging Suffolk Chief Constable Douglas Paxton about the embarrassing blunder. He said: 'I was given an assurance by the Deputy Chief Constable last July that communications to the public in these situations would be reviewed. 'Clearly this is not working and that is completely unsatisfactory. 'I will now take this up with the Chief Constable again and seek a cast-iron guarantee that such public information is released without delay. 'My understanding is that the information was not released for 19 hours and this does not help maintain public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system.' Monerville twice slashed a teenager's face before . launching a racist tirade, his 2011 sentencing hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, east . London, heard. Monerville . and his accomplice Shane Doyle, 26, ambushed the teenager from behind . on November 21, 2010 and punched him in the face and kicked him before the boy's mobile phone was taken. Monerville knocked the boy to the ground and pinned him down before slicing open his cheek in the terrifying late-night attack. It is the second escape from Hollesley Bay open prison - which has been dubbed Holiday Bay by inmates - in two years . The pair tried to flee but were arrested just yards away after a passer-by heard the boy's screams. They . admitted robbery and causing grievous bodily harm, but claimed they . were drunk at the time. Doyle, from east London, was jailed for seven . years. Commenting on Monerville's escape, a Suffolk . Police spokesman said yesterday: 'Suffolk Police were contacted by HMP . Hollesley Bay just after 5.30pm yesterday (Tue) reporting that Jerry . Monerville had failed to return to the prison. 'Overnight we carried out initial enquiries including liaising with other forces to check known addresses. Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore has slammed the county's police over 20-hour delays to warning the public Monerville was on the loose . 'We . were not able to locate Monerville and therefore a media appeal was . requested this morning. The safety of the public is our priority at all . times and is our first consideration.' The spokesman said Monerville should not be approached and appealed for anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact them. The latest escape in Suffolk comes after it took the county's police nearly 20 hours to warn residents that kidnapper Daniel Best was at large after he disappeared from Hollesley Bay last July. Best, 25, had been described by a judge as a 'danger to society' after abducting his ex-girlfriend in Ipswich in 2007. He failed to attend a roll call at Hollesley Bay on July 5. Police were notified at 8pm, but only put out an appeal to find Best just after 3.30pm the following day. Best was later recaptured . After a meeting with the chief and deputy constables, Mr Passmore said at the time: 'The Constabulary accepts that the information could have been released at an earlier stage - and, as a result, we will be reviewing our processes.' Deputy Chief Constable Paul Marshall said then: 'In this particular case, an assessment carried out after liaising with the prison service concluded that the risk to the public from Daniel Best is low. 'At the same time, there were a number of sensitive inquiries which needed to be carried out as a priority.' In October 2011, the police force delayed warning the public that three violent criminals had escaped from a secure hospital in Suffolk. It took officers 11 hours to put out a warning that Luke Sparks, 21, Ross Beeby, 22, and Jason Williams, 21,had escaped from St John's House in Palgrave, near Diss. The trio were all recaptured after a huge search.","Violent Jerry Monerville failed to return to Hollesley Bay open prison .

"By . Nathan Klein . The parents of a three-year-old girl, whose YouTube video attracted more than nine million views online, are grieving after the toddler died suddenly from two strands of the common cold. Maddie Tippett, from Newcastle, Australia, became an instant Internet sensation after going toe-to-toe with her father, who was trying to trick her into saying she loves him more than her mother. During the two-minute video, called ‘Who’s Your Favourite?’, her father Mick attempts every trick in the book to get his three-year-old daughter to say she loves him more than Mum – but the cheeky and clever wit from the youngster leaves her father sighing at his repeated failed attempts. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Angel: YouTube star Maddie Tippett died suddenly on Tuesday night after contracting a common cold. Doctors said the virus was attacking her heart . Legacy of laughter: Maddie Tippett's parents believe their late daughter, who died of a common cold on Tuesday, brought so much joy to the world through her hugely popular video . After continually replying ‘Mum’ to her father’s question, Maddie does succumb towards the end – but then cheekily retracts it by saying she is ‘kidding’. The hugely popular video has been watched by 9.5 million people since Mr Tippett posted it in January 2012, with it gaining a cult following after featuring on a number of morning television shows around the world. Tragically, Maddie died suddenly on Tuesday night after displaying ‘cold-like symptoms’. Her parents took her to the GP on Monday, who told them it was nothing more than a virus. But when Maddie’s condition worsened that night, her parents quickly rushed her to John Hunter Hospital – where doctors discovered two strands of the common cold had taken hold and one of them was attacking her heart. Mr Tippett said the virus was ‘too much’ for his little girl and she ‘conked out’ a short time later. Maddie’s mother Kerryn said despite their unspeakable grief, they would take heart knowing their little girl brought so much joy to the world through her YouTube video. ‘Part of me feels that Maddie was meant to change the world and I feel sad that she didn’t get the chance,’ she told The Daily Telegraph through tears yesterday. ‘But then I think in 10 years’ time someone will be having a bad day at the office and sit down and click on that video and it will cheer them up. That will be her legacy.’ Gone too soon: Maddie Tippett died on Tuesday from a common cold. The youngster became a YouTube sensation after a hilarious video her father posted of her in January 2012 was viewed by 9.5 million people . The Tippett family have been inundated with messages of support and online tributes since the tragedy – not only from family and friends but from strangers overseas who were touched after hearing about their story. One friend, John Palmer, posted on Facebook: ‘In your three short years you touched the souls of thousands of people with your infectious smile and wonderful, adorable personality.’ Others posted online: ‘Best wishes to the family at this time in their life xx Thank you for sharing your little angels beauty and joy with the world…I know she brightened my world and am sure her beautiful soul has also enhanced the lives of many more X <3 X’","Three-year-old YouTube sensation dies from a common cold .

Realistic signing: Arsenal chiefs believe Balotelli is a realistic target with AC Milan lowering their wage bill . Target: Cleverley . Target: Balotelli . Target: Smalling . Arsenal want to find out what the cost of the deal would be before fully pursuing a swoop for Balotelli. AC Milan are keen to offload the striker as they look to ease their wage bill this summer. Arsenal have been made aware of Balotelli's availability and are ready to strike if the deal makes financial sense. Winner: Balotelli scored the decisive goal against England in Manaus on Thursday night . Meanwhile, the Gunners will explore the option of a taking a player from Manchester United as the Old Trafford club step up their interest in Thomas Vermaelen.

Unshakeable: Mertesacker and Koscielny's form has seen captain Vermaelen frustrated on the sidelines . Vermaelen grew increasingly frustrated at his role at Arsenal last season as he played second fiddle to first choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up. Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position. Talisman: Balotelli could be the new striker that Arsenal fans have been praying for this summer . Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid. The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign. Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is being considered by Wenger, while Manchester City right-back Micah Richards, who can also play centre-back, could also be an option.

"By . Richard Spillett . A British woman in her 20s was arrested after losing her temper with cabin crew who caught her locked in an aeroplane toilet with a man she had just met. The apparently drunk tourist is said to have been handcuffed to a chair by flight attendants – to the horror of her parents, who were travelling with her. She was on an 11-hour Virgin Atlantic flight from Gatwick to Las Vegas last week when she reportedly struck up a friendship with the man sitting in  the next seat. They disappeared to the aircraft toilet and other travellers soon complained of hearing noises from inside. Cabin crew were forced to intervene after a drunken British woman had sex with another passenger on board a Virgin Atlantic flight . Another passenger told The Sun: 'She started getting heated with the guy next to her. 'They went into the bathroom and people could hear loud noises. The cabin crew forced to door open, then she really kicked off.' The paper reported the incident happened on a flight from London Gatwick to Las Vegas in the US last week. The woman was questioned by police but released with a warning before continuing her holiday in the notorious Nevada resort. It comes . just week after an Australian was arrested for apparently mistaking the . cockpit door of a Virgin . Australia flight from Brisbane to Bali for the toilet, triggering a hijack scare. The woman was flying from Gatwick to Las Vegas when the incident happened . Matt Lockley told Bali police that he banged on what he thought was the toilet door of Boeing 737-800 aircraft, sparking the terrorism fears. Mr Lockley, 28, was later released without charge. Last year, Virgin America launched a new service that allows passengers to send drinks, a meal or treats to fellow passengers in a move which many said encouraged mid-air flirting. Virgin Atlantic said last night they do no accept bad behaviour by any passengers on board their planes.","Witness says woman 'got heated' with man while sitting next to parents .

A fourth sibling, a woman in her 20s, was attending classes at Houston Community College at the time of the killings, according to the Stafford Police Department. Scroll down for video . Siblings slain: Rebecca Mughal, 15 (left), her 18-year-old brother, Fahad (right) and 23-year-old brother Faheem were found shot dead from close range in an apparent murder-suicide Tuesday . Neighborhood in shock: The murders took place in board daylight inside a red-brick home on the tree-lined Venice Circle in Stafford, Texas . Multiple weapons, including pistols and rifles, have been removed from the crime scene in the 13300 block of Venice Circle. Ballistics experts will have to perform tests to determine which guns were used in the killings, the Houston Chronicle reported. Police say they received a frantic 911 call at around 2pm from a woman screaming that 'her baby was dead.' Responding officers discovered three of the mother's four children slain in separate rooms inside the family home. One of the brothers was armed. On Wednesday afternoon, officials revealed that it was 18-year-old Fahad who used an AR-15 assault rifle to murder his brother and sister at close range before shooting himself in the head. Neighbors described the Mughals as a quiet family of Pakistani descent who have lived in the red-brick home on Venice Circle for at least two years. Faheem Mughal, who was known to his friends as Jacob, worked as a mechanic, buying used cars, repairing them in an auto shop located on his parents' property and then reselling them for profit. His younger brother, Fahad, sometimes helped the 23-year-old fix up vehicles.

"A woman in Fort Lauderdale, Florida got stuck on a railroad bridge today, and had to be rescued by local firefighters. The 55-year-old Dania Beach woman was crossing the New River using a railroad bridge, when the bridge unexpectedly started to lift up. As the bridge started to rise, the woman held on to the sides of the two tracks to remain aloft. Scroll down for video . Between two tracks: 55-year-old Wanda mcGowan got stuck on a railroad bridge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this morning when it started to rise . Safe now: When firefighters arrived, they . deployed a 24-foot ladder to rescue the woman who was about 22 feet in . the air. A city official says she was uninjured . Several witnesses were at the scene and called for emergency help. The bystanders also whipped out their phones to take a picture of the rare sight. The woman was wearing all pink and later told police that she had participated in a breast cancer walk earlier that morning at nearby Huizenga Plaza. 'She was just in this Jesus Chris position,' witness Phillip Glazebrook told the Sun-Sentinel. 'The woman was frozen and terrified. I'm sure she must have been in absolute shock to be stuck in that position.' Mr Glazebrook wasn't surprised that the crowd took out their phones to document the incident. 'It was like watching an accident on 1-95, rubbernecking,' he said. 'She's stuck up there and they're just taking photos and videos.' A Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crew responded at 10:44am and they were able to safely rescue her. Firefighters used a 24-foot ladder to rescue the woman, who was approximately 22 feet in the air. Witnesses said it took about 20 minutes for crews to get her safely down. 'To tell you the truth, honestly I thought it was probably like a stunt or something, it was just that unbelievable,' witness Ashanicka Powell told NBC Miami. 'I really didn't think she honestly was trapped up there at first.' 'They harnessed the ladder up against the actual tracks and a firefighter went and got her and we were all clapping, we were just amazed' Ms Powell said.

It is still unknown why the woman was . crossing the railroad bridge, instead of using the nearby Andrews . Avenue pedestrian crossing. Mr Glazebrook hypothesizes that she might have walked out onto the bridge to take a picture. While the woman was frightened, a city official says she was uninjured. Others have not been so lucky on the bridge. In December 2010 two Lynn University soccer players were crossing the bridge on their way to a party when it started to lift. 21-year-old Kyle Conrad fell into the water and was later pronounced dead. His teammate Joe Cundall, also 21, clung to the bridge's trestle but his ankles and back were injured.","A 55-year-old Dania Beach woman got stuck on a railroad bridge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this morning when it started to lift up .

"By . Associated Press . Wildlife officials in Maine have come under attack for failing to intervene to save the life of a baby bald eagle they were filming on a webcam. Viewers across the United States called and emailed the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as they watched the eaglet struggle for survival. They asked officials to step in when it seemed that the parents had abandoned the pair of baby bald eagles in a coastal Maine nest. One of the eaglets died over the weekend. But state raptor specialist Erynn Call has defending their decision not to intervene before an eaglet featured on the webcam died. She said it's common for eagles to die before reaching maturity. If one of the two eagles survives, then that would be considered a success. Eagle TV: This still image from streaming online video provided by Biodiversity Research Institute shows an adult bald eagle, center, feeding a young eaglet Wednesday along coastal Maine. Webcast viewers saw another eaglet in the nest die over the weekend . It's also the state's policy not to intervene, she said. On its website, the Biodiversity Research Institute, which operates the webcam, wrote that it did not intend to remove the remaining eagle chick from the nest. 'We have been in contact with many individuals and agencies to determine the best path forward after one chick perished over the weekend,' a statement posted Monday reads. 'The remaining eaglet is being fed by adults and it is ALWAYS best for young eagles to develop bonds and learn life skills from parent eagles. Though there is always uncertainty in the natural world, all signs point toward this chick being successful.' The statement went on: 'We understand that our decision not to intervene may be difficult for some viewers, but we continue to maintain that the Maine Eagle webcams are an opportunity for citizens and students to observe the natural world in it's purest form and to understand the many pressures that wildlife face. On Wednesday, the webcam showed the survivor getting a meal of a bird that was shredded to pieces by an adult eagle. The eaglet squawked loudly as it snapped up the meal. Biodiversity Research Institute outreach director Patrick Keenan added: 'The general view is not to intervene. These are wildlife. They're not pets. They're generally better off in their natural surroundings.'","Viewers across the US called and emailed the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as they watched the eagle struggle for survival .

"By . Associated Press . A natural reaction upon winning the Mega Millions is shock and disbelief - so much so, one lucky lottery winner decided to wait seven weeks before collecting their winnings. Maryland Lottery officials say the second winner of a $414 million Mega Millions jackpot from March has now come forward. Officials announced Tuesday that the Maryland resident, who chose to remain anonymous, claimed the prize, quietly, late last week. Late winner: Nearly two months later, the unidentified second winner of the March 18 $414-million Mega Millions lottery jackpot has finally claimed the winnings . A Florida couple came forward to claim their half of the jackpot last week too.  Lottery officials say the winner said, 'You have to play your lucky numbers.' Lottery officials say the Maryland winner chose the cash option and will receive $76.4 million after taxes. The state will receive more than $10.1 million in tax revenue and Lady's Liquors in La Plata, the store where the winning ticket was sold, will receive a $100,000 agent bonus. In Florida, the winning ticket was sold at a Sunoco convenience store on Merritt Island. The drawing also had eight $1 million winners. Lucky store: This Florida Sunoco sold one of the winning tickets to a winner . The Maryland winner bought the ticket at Lady's Liquor in La Plata, a town of nearly 9,000 about 30 miles from the nation's capital. The winner picked the numbers manually, rather than through a machine's random selection, Maryland Lottery Director Stephen Martino said. The tickets with all five matching numbers, plus the multiplier, are entitled to the jackpot which they can redeem in two ways. The first is through an annuity program with one immediate payment, following by annual payments for the next 29 years that increase 5 per cent with each payment. The increased payments were designed to cover the annual increase in cost of living so that winners 'lifestyle and purchasing power' would remain the same through their lifetime. Windfall: The $400million jackpot was the sixth-largest in U.S. lottery history . The other option is to take a one-time lump sum payment. If the ticket holders in Maryland and Florida chose that option, they are entitled to $223 million. Even if you don't match all six numbers, you can be eligible for prizes up to $1million. Mega Millions changed its rules in October to help increase jackpots by lowering the odds of winning the top prize . Mega Millions is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.","The $414m prize was the sixth largest prize in lottery history .

"By . Anthony Bond . Absent: Reverend Sara Cliff, pictured, has been labelled the 'invisible woman' after claiming £23,000 for attending just 19 council meetings in three years . A Tory councillor has been labelled the 'invisible woman' after claiming £23,000 for attending just 19 council meetings in three years. Reverend Sara Cliff, who represents Lincoln East, is estimated to have pocketed just under £500 an hour, despite living 119 miles away in the Cambridgeshire market town of Soham. Now furious residents are calling for the Lincolnshire County Councillor - whose ward is one of the most deprived areas in the country - to quit. Between June 2009 and the start of this year, Ms Cliff, 46, attended just 19 from a possible 52 meetings of the county council. Council colleagues say that each of the meetings she has attended would have lasted around two and a half hours. This means she attended less than 50 hours of meetings in three years being paid around £484 an hour for her council duties. Fellow politicians say her attendance is unacceptable. Even her own party leader admitted it was 'not good at all'. Lincolnshire County Council Labour leader Cllr Rob Parker said 'She should do the decent thing and stand down now. 'The people of Lincoln East are not getting the service they should expect from an elected member. 'She is letting the people down. She lives over 100 miles away and makes little attempt to represent them. 'She’s the invisible woman. She was missing at this year’s budget meeting when huge cuts were brought in which will affect the people she represents. 'Her ward is one of the most deprived in the country but she wasn’t there to speak up for her constituents.' Community activist Eve Wind, who chairs the Tower Action Group which represents people living on a local council estate within Cllr Cliff’s ward, said the Conservative had failed to distribute her £2,000 community budget in either 2011 or the current year. 'We have invited her to a number of meetings. She hasn’t even replied. We’re paying her to do a job, so where is she? She should quit and do it now. 'This part of Lincoln is one of the most deprived areas of the country. We are all struggling to survive and keep morale high with activities for the local community, and there she is sitting on £2,000. It is disgraceful. 'We’re screaming out for a bit of money. I am so annoyed by it all. I feel like she has slapped every volunteer in the face thanks to her lack of action.' Angry: Furious residents are now calling for the Lincolnshire county councillor to quit. The council headquarters is pictured . Local resident Sarah Whitworth added 'Nobody I know has seen her in this area. It’s an absolute joke. It’s scandalous to be honest.' Cllr Marianne Overton, leader of the council’s Independent group, also criticised the Tory. She said 'She is ruining the reputation of county councillors and should step down immediately. I believe it is this kind of example that undermines democracy. 'Perhaps Sara Cliff should donate the substantial sum of allowances she has claimed in the last three years to the community of Lincoln East. It certainly needs the money.' After being elected in May 2009, Ms Cliff moved to Soham - 119 miles from County Hall where meetings are held - to become a Methodist minister. Since then, her attendance has plummeted year on year. Council records show Ms Cliff sat in on six from a possible eight committee meetings in 2009. She went on to attend four from a possible 17 in 2010, and sat in on just one meeting in 2011. This year she has relinquished any committee responsibilities. In addition to her committee meetings Ms Cliff attended eight from a possible 13 full county council meetings. Local government rules state councillors must attend at least one meeting every six months. Ms Cliff attended full council on December 9, 2011. Records show the next meeting she attended was full council on May 18, 2012. A Lincolnshire County Council spokesman confirmed her poor attendance had been flagged up to the Conservative party by authority clerks. She is the only county councillor to have this happen in the three years of this council. Martin Hill, the Conservative leader of Lincolnshire County Council, admitted he had spoken to Ms Cliff about her attendance levels six months ago. 'There is no doubt her attendance of late has not been good at all,' he said. Each year county councillors are allocated £2,000 to spend on small schemes in their patch. Ms Cliff did not spend a penny of her community budget in 2011. In a statement Ms Cliff said: 'I thoroughly enjoy representing the residents of the Lincoln East ward and make myself available as much as possible to local people who come to me for support. 'My role outside of the council as a reverend has seen me appointed to a parish outside of the county in Soham which means it is more difficult to attend council meetings during the day but I try to attend as many as I can.' Ms Cliff added that she attends fortnightly meetings of an adoption panel but council attendance records do not include these.","Lincolnshire county councillor Reverend Sara Cliff is now facing calls for her resignation .

"By . Rob Cooper . A town clerk used a council credit card to pay to watch gay porn online and then altered the records to say he had been buying 'festive lighting', a court heard. Roy Hunt, 70, also bought petrol and two laptops at the taxpayers' expense before his scam was uncovered. Hunt was sacked by Dronfield Town Council in Derbyshire, but escaped with a suspended jail sentence. Scam: Roy Hunt, 70, paid for gay porn as well as two laptops and petrol using a council credit card. He escaped jail after being found guilty of theft and fraud . He had denied 11 charges of theft and fraud but was convicted following a trial at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court. Mike Treharne, prosecuting, said Hunt had falsified accounts by disguising purchases in the council records. Mr Treharne said: 'He entered festive lighting in the records while paying to go online to a gay porn site. 'He did downloads from the PlayStation . website and purchased two laptops, entering them on records as fine . mesh metals and an item from Screwfix Direct. 'These were false entries in the . account book in his own handwriting. He suggested it happened because of . incompetence but he was found guilty on the basis of dishonesty.' Deputy District Judge Lawrence gave him a one-year prison sentence suspended for two years. He said he would have imposed an immediate term of imprisonment but for Hunt’s health problems, which included lung disease. The offences were committed between March 2009 and August 2010, the court was told. Hunt’s actions came to light after . items on a credit card statement found among planning documents aroused . the suspicions of colleagues. He was on holiday at the time. Hunt, from Swallownest, Sheffield, was ordered to pay £750 compensation to Dronfield Town Council, along with £960 trial costs. He also received a 7pm to 7am curfew for six months.The trial was told he had already repaid the council £616. Hunt claimed the laptops, together . costing £750, were purchased for work use and denied accessing porn . websites, claiming the credit card must have been cloned.","Roy Hunt, 70, also bought laptops and petrol on the council card .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean is responsible for the slowdown in the pace of global warming so far this century, according to a new study. Scientists believe a series of naturally . occurring La Nina weather events in the Pacific in recent years, which . bring cooler waters to the surface, have masked the heat-trapping . effect caused by greenhouse gases. The slowdown has raised hopes among some governments that it will be easier and cheaper to achieve long-term goals for limiting temperature rises to avert more heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Strong currents in the Pacific Ocean have brought cooler water to the surface, slowing the pace of global warming, scientists believe . 'Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La Nina-like decadal cooling,' according to the study by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie at the University of California, San Diego. 'Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase,' they wrote in the journal Nature. Past studies have linked the slowdown in the pace of warming this century to factors such as a build-up of sun-dimming air pollution in the atmosphere or a decline in the sun's output. Others suggest that the deep oceans may be absorbing more heat. Nine of the 10 warmest years since records began in the mid-19th century have been since 2000, with 1998 the exception, according to U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Even so, the pace of warming has slowed from the 1980s and 1990s even though greenhouse gas emissions have hit record highs. There have been four years with La Nina cooling events in the Pacific since 1998 and only two with the opposite, El Nino, when the Pacific waters warm, according to WMO data. The predominance of La Ninas is unusual. The Nature study said its computer . models, based on a reconstruction of Pacific temperatures, also . successfully accounted for droughts in the southern United States and . winter coolings in northwestern North America this century. Scientists warn that the effect is only temporary and that the trend of warming is likely to continue . A U.N. panel of scientists, the main authority on global warming, will issue a report on Sept. 26 in Stockholm. Drafts show it is likely to raise the probability that human activities are the main cause of climate change to 'extremely likely', or a 95 per cent chance. That is up from 90 per cent in the last report in 2007. Its main scenarios also show that temperatures could rise by up to about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. The drafts devote little space to explaining the hiatus in rising temperatures. Almost 200 governments have agreed to limit a rise in temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius above levels before the Industrial Revolution - meaning average world surface temperatures should not rise above about 15.6 Celsius. Temperatures have so far gained by about 0.8 C and many scientists say that warming is already causing more extreme weather, ranging from heatwaves to downpours. Alex Sen Gupta, of the University of New South Wales in Australia, said the new study of the Pacific was 'compelling evidence' that warming was being masked by the oceans and that the slowdown was tied to natural cycles. Other experts noted the study did not fully explain the hiatus, especially where extra the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, led by carbon dioxide, was building up in the system.","'La Nina' weather events are .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The British Embassy in Colombia made an embarrassing gaffe when it referred to the Falklands Islands using the Argentinian name 'Malvinas'. The embassy's Twitter account, @UKinColombia, repeatedly issued tweets containing the name advertising a debate on the future of the fought-over islands. The use of the term 'Malvinas' is an embarrassment because it goes against the Government's policy of always calling them the Falkland Islands. The official Twitter page for the British Embassy in Colombia still shows the tweets calling the Falklands the 'Malvinas' The embassy tweeted about the 'Foro Referendo Malvinas Falkland' (debate called the Malvinas Falklands Forum') on April, the 31st anniversary of the Falklands conflict, in which the British fought the Argentinians to retain the islands in the South Atlantic. It was a humiliating error for Lindsay Croisdale-Appleby, who was apppointed the new British Ambassador to Bogotá in November. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was simply repeating the name of the debate, that had been set up by the Universidad Externado in Bogotá. A spokeswoman told The Times: “Staff should be reminded it should be referred to as the Falkland Islands. “Possibly putting it in inverted commas next time would be sensible.' But several Argentinians on Twitter picked up on the slip, and were delighted by it. The Embassy in Bogota tweeted several times on April 2, the 31st anniversary of the Falklands Conflict . Cristina Kirchner, President of Argentina, has refused to recognise the referendum in which Falkland Islanders backed the status quo . Argentina invaded the Falklands on April 2 1982, and the ensuing war over the islands lasted for 74 days and claimed the lives of 255 British military personnel, 649 Argentinians, and three Falkland Islanders. A referendum on the issue of whether the Islands should remain a British territory was held last month and resulted in only three of 1,517 valid ballots voting 'No', with the others voting in favour of the status quo.

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence - SETI - project looks for alien life in a one, main specific way - scanning for radio signals deliberately beamed towards earth from distant stars. But two astronomers suggest that we may be missing evidence much closer to home. Two scientists at Arizona State University have suggested that alien life may have 'left traces on the moon in the form of an artifact or surface modification of lunar features' - and that alien 'footprints' on the moon would last far longer than radio signals. The detailed moon maps created by Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter may be the best place to look for alien life, say scientists - evidence such as trails or debris would remain there for millions of years, and be easier to 'catch' than radio signals . 'Evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence could come from any signatures of non-human technology,' say the scientists in a paper published in Acta Astronautica. The scientists say that any alien mission to our solar system is liable to have occurred long ago - but that the surface of the moon could preserve the signs for millions of years. The photographs already captured by Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter - currently mapping the moon's surface to 0.5m resolution - provides an easy, cheap way to look for these signs. 'Although there is only a tiny . probability that alien technology would have left traces on the moon in . the form of an artifact or surface modification of lunar features, it has the virtue of being close, and of preserving traces for an . immense duration.'

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Props from what is believed to be from the new set of the Star Wars film have been spotted in the Abu Dhabi desert. The pictures show a giant gray disc, which looks similar to the escape pod used by C3PO and R2D2 in the original 1977 film, being rolled around a desert encampment. Filming for the seventh episode, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, in the beloved franchise had been scheduled to begin in spring. Rumors: The sight of a large gray disc in the Abu Dhabi desert has excited Star Wars fans . On location: A flurry of activity in the desert has led many to believe filming has started on the seventh Star Wars . The dune location had led to speculation that the film set near Qasr Al Sarab resort is Tatooine, the setting for the 1977 Star Wars: A New Hope film, and home to Luke Skywalker. Sources told the National that crew members have been hired for the secretive part of filming taking place in Abu Dhabi. Little is known about what will be the seventh installment in the franchise, other than it will take place 35 years after Return of the Jedi and will include the offspring of the original cast. It is strongly anticipated that Abrams, who is working with a $200 million budget, will bring back Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill to resume their original roles. A replica of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon is also believed to have already been built at Pinewood Studios in London. Bringing back the stars of the original trilogy could be a way to win favor with diehard fans. And, while it will be the first of the films not written or directed by George Lucas, JJ Abrams has been given exclusive access to his notes for a planned sequel. Roots: The dune location looks similar to that of Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine . Rebel alliance: Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are believed to be returning to their roles as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker . Paul Ens, who worked for Lucasfilm for several years, told the Guardian that the director and scriptwriters had been allowed to see Lucas's notes for episodes VII, VIII and IX. 'George had notes hidden in a safe . somewhere for 20 years about his plans for the nine films, none of which . anyone was privy to,' Mr Ens said. 'The thing that excites me most is that . JJ Abrams and his team had access to those full notes and had the . opportunity to do some question and answer sessions with George about . them, while also not being beholden to them. 'As a Star Wars fan, the . thought that the world may never have seen those pages would have been . very sad,' he added. If the props and desert camp spotted in Abu Dhabi are part of the movie, it would be the first time scenes set on the fictional planet Tatooine have been filmed outside of Tunisia. The film is due to be released on December 18, 2015.","Pictures emerge of props similar to those seen in George Lucas's series .

"By . Freya Noble . An elderly woman who set out on an overseas holiday to visit family in Sri Lanka ended up with a broken leg before she even made it to her home country. On April 4 Vineetha Warnakulasuriya, 72, was travelling with her son, daughter-in-law, and her two grandchildren on a Malaysia Airlines flight from Melbourne Airport when she had a fall on the travelator about an hour before departure. Paramedics assisted her and Ms Warnakulasuriya was cleared to continue her flight, after she made an agreement with the airline to have wheelchair assistance for the entire journey to Colombo. The 72-year-old fractured her tibia and tore ligaments in her right leg and is now seeking $250,000 compensation . Vineetha Warnakulasuriya was refused a wheelchair while leaving a Malaysia Airlines flight which resulted in her breaking her leg . However, according to Shine Lawyers solicitor Joseph Wheeler his client was not given the support she needed for the entirety of her trip. After being wheeled off the plane and onto the next one during a stopover in Kuala Lumpur, Ms Warnakulasuriya was then asked to disembark the plane at her final destination on her own. The statement of claim says that 'when the Plaintiff was on board the aircraft... she stood up un-assisted following the refusal of a flight attendant to provide a wheelchair or manual assistance.' 'When she got to the other end she waited for all the passengers to clear the plane,' Mr Wheeler told the MailOnline. 'She was told something to the effect of ""there isn't a wheelchair you'll have to get that at the exit"".' But the elderly woman was not able to walk on her own and when she stood up to leave the plane her right leg, which she had injured earlier, collapsed beneath her. 'As soon as she stood up she fell back to the ground, her right knee and leg collapsed, she fractured her tibia, and there was ligament damage,' Mr Wheeler said. Ms Warnakulasuriya was forced to extend her stay in Sri Lanka while she underwent daily rehabilitation . This week, court documents were filed over the incident requesting compensation from Malaysia Airlines to the sum of $250,000. Mr Wheeler said his client is seeking to cover the costs of her ongoing medical treatment, and although Malaysia Airlines extended her return ticket so she could recover before returning to Australia, they have denied liability for the accident. Malaysia Airlines told the MailOnline the company 'is aware of the incident and as litigations are underway will not be commenting further'. When Ms Warnakulasuriya arrived in Sri Lanka it was originally thought she may need to undergo surgery for her injuries, but instead had intensive physiotherapy each day trying to get her to be able to walk. She was forced to extend her trip beyond her initial two weeks, only returning to Australia on July 14 so she wouldn't lose her visa privileges. When asked about the $250,000 compensation claim, Mr Wheeler described the figure as the 'best estimate given how early on she is in her recovery'. In order to successfully receive compensation for his client, Mr Wheeler must 'prove that the airline's act of not providing a wheelchair was responsible for the accident'.","Vineetha Warnakulasuriya was on her way to visit family in Sri Lanka .

"By . Jaya Narain . and Daniel Martin . The Director of Public Prosecutions yesterday defended the decision to charge Michael Le Vell with child abuse. Keir Starmer QC told MPs that ‘the decision to proceed was the right decision’. Appearing in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee, he said: ‘This was a properly brought prosecution according to the proper test. Scroll down for video . Bleary eyed: Michael Le Vell outside his house yesterday morning after celebrating his acquittal . 'It would have been wrong not to have taken a case when there was a case to answer.’ Mr Le Vell, who has played Kevin Webster on Coronation Street for 30 years, was this week acquitted of abusing and raping a child over a period of nine years. He said his life had been destroyed by ‘an absolute pack of lies’, and was reportedly so devastated that he considered suicide. His relatives and colleagues condemned the Crown Prosecution Service, claiming the case should never have gone to court. They accused CPS lawyers of leading a vindictive ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Defence: Director of public prosecutions Keir Starmar (left) told MPs there was a case to answer. Le Vell (right) contemplated suicide . Michael Le Vell looks relieved while he holds a pint after being found not guilty on Tuesday afternoon . However, Mr Starmer said yesterday: . ‘There is a safeguard within our system, and that is at the end of the . prosecution case in court, it is not only open to the judge, it is the . duty of the judge, to stop the case if there is no case to answer. ‘That did not happen in this case and therefore there was a case to answer. That case was answered and the jury took some time to consider their verdict – so it was a properly brought case. 'The idea that if a case results in an acquittal it shouldn’t have been brought is wrong.’ Damage: Keith Vaz MP said celebrities in particular suffer huge publicity . Keith Vaz MP, the committee’s chairman, said that celebrities in particular had to suffer huge publicity and ‘they feel their reputation has been damaged even after they have been acquitted’. Mr Starmer countered that ‘in many cases the fact that a suspect or a person once charged is named leads other victims to come forward’. He added: ‘We have a number of examples where having named somebody once charged, other victims have come forward, enabling a case to be built.’ Mr Le Vell’s former Coronation Street colleague Kevin Kennedy, who played Curly Watts, said yesterday: ‘There are no winners in this. It should never have got to this stage in the first place.’ Speaking on ITV’s This Morning, he added: ‘The anonymity should go across the board.’ Mr Le Vell’s accuser retains her anonymity despite his acquittal. The Ministry of Justice has confirmed, however, that it has no plans to reform the law to allow those accused of sexual offences to retain their anonymity until convicted. Nazir Afzal, the Crown Chief Prosecutor in the North-West, had initially decided not to charge Mr Le Vell in 2011 but was overruled by Alison Levitt QC, Mr Starmer’s principal adviser. Mr Starmer said the original decision . was reviewed and overturned after new evidence emerged, and Mr Afzal . also denied there was a celebrity witch-hunt under way. He said yesterday: ‘I absolutely detest this word “witch-hunt”. It is not a witch-hunt.

"By . Associated Press . The recession and the slow recovery have sharply widened the gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else, according to a new study. The richest 5 percent of Americans had 24 times the wealth of the median household in 2013 - up substantially from 16.5 times as much in 2007, according to the report by University of Michigan researchers. Substantial gains in the stock market have enabled richer Americans to regain much of their wealth. Stock prices had plunged by nearly half during the recession but have recovered all their losses and set new highs. And roughly 10 percent of households own 80 percent of stocks. By contrast, middle-class Americans remain further behind because whatever wealth they have is derived mainly from home equity. Home prices have only partially recovered from the housing bust. Growing disparity: Every income level took a hit in the recession, but the richest households have recovered faster than the median . In the first quarter of this year, 18.8 percent of homeowners with a mortgage still owed more on their homes than they were worth, according to real estate data provider Zillow. An additional 18.1 percent have so little equity that it wouldn't be enough to cover closing costs and make a down payment, Zillow calculates. Fewer Americans even own homes: The home ownership rate fell to 64.8 percent in the first quarter of this year from a peak of 69.2 percent in 2004. The University of Michigan study found that households at all levels lost wealth during the recession and that not even the top 5 percent have fully regained it. The study suggests one reason consumer spending growth has been weaker since the recession than before: When people feel wealthier, they're more likely to spend. Most Americans may still feel poorer than before the recession and so may still be restraining their spending. The losses weren't evenly distributed. For the top 5 percent, net worth fell 16 percent from 2007, just before the recession began, through last year. The net worth of the median household fell much further - 43 percent. Growing disparity: In 2007, the difference between the top 5percent of home and the median was 16.5 times. In 2013 it had grown to 24.2 times . Stocks have roared back after the recession, leading to the rebound in wealth for the richest Americans. Pictures are the NASDAQ Composite Index (red) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (blue) The study paints a bleaker picture of U.S. household wealth than do official figures from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's quarterly report on household wealth has concluded that the nation as a whole regained all the wealth it lost from the recession by the first quarter of 2013. But the Fed report doesn't break out that data for households at different wealth levels. Its overall figures are lifted by big gains among the wealthiest Americans. Fabian Pfeffer, assistant research professor at the University of Michigan, said the new study might have found less of an overall wealth recovery than the Fed did because its sample size wasn't big enough to fully capture the richest 2 percent of Americans. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The top 5 percent of richest Americans were worth 16.5 times as much as the median household in 2007 .

"By . Lydia Warren . A black bear invited himself to a one-year-old's birthday party in Alaska at the weekend and promptly tucked into the cupcakes. The birthday boy's parents, Alicia Bishop and Glenn Merrill, were stunned when the 180 pound male bear crashed through a skylight at their Starr Hill home on Saturday, just minutes before the party was to start. 'I heard my husband yelling, so I poked my head around the corner and there was this crash,' Bishop told MailOnline. 'And a bear landed on the ottoman.' She saw her husband just three feet from the bear - and for a moment, he and the animal just stared at each other in disbelief. Birthday snack: Alicia Bishop holds cupcakes that a bear licked after falling into her Alaska home on Saturday just moments before the start of her boyfriend's one-year birthday party . Merrill ushered his parents and son, Jackson, upstairs and went into another room and shut the door, while his wife stood watching from behind a glass door as he helped himself to the birthday treats. 'The bear walks over to the table and starts eating the cupcakes,' Bishop said. 'I was like, ""Of course!"" I thought he might be a bit shaken up after falling through the ceiling but all he could think about was the cupcakes.' He tested out both the lemon blueberry and peanut butter cupcakes. She added: 'All I could think was, ""I just spent hours setting up and guests are about to arrive!""' But as he tucked in, she tiptoed into the room and opened a door to the outside. The couple were able to shoo him out - but he wasn't done with those cakes. 'He walked around the house and want back over to the window where the food was,' she said. 'Like ""I want more cupcakes"".' Still smiling: Glenn Merrill holds his son Jackson, whose birthday party was rudely interrupted by the uninvited guest on Saturday. The bear had fallen through a skylight, which can be seen broken . The bear eventually left the home when Merill, 45, went next door and grabbed some bear spray from neighbors. The couple said that the animal seemed used to people and was not aggressive. The party still went ahead - with the couple quickly attempting to patch up the broken skylight before moving the celebrations into a different room. Bishop told MailOnline she thinks the bear was able to get on the skylight by climbing onto a gas tank outside their home and jumping up on to the low roof. She added that it was lucky that the bear arrived early for the party. 'How he landed from the sky light, he landed on our ottoman,' she said. 'Our son is often in that room and always around the ottoman - so we were really lucky he wasn't there. 'We're definitely used to seeing bears but having one crash through your ceiling is a huge surprise. We were all in shock.' Police received a call from the couple and about 30 minutes later, received another saying there was a similar bear inside a nearby home. When officers . arrived, they shot the animal when it appeared in the doorway. The bear ran behind . the house, where it was later found dead. Tragic end: The black bear was shot dead after it broke into another nearby home (file picture) Wildlife . officials suspect it was the same bear that went to the birthday party. It was described in both incidents as a young male, weighing about 180 . pounds. Bishop . said she is not completely sure that the bears were the same as they . often see the animals in the area, and a reporter on the way to their . house noticed a similar one crossing the road outside. Authorities told CBC that seeing the bears was a regular occurrence. 'There probably isn't a neighborhood or place where we have homes where the potential isn't there for you to run into a bear or observe a bear,' Ryan Scott of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. 'There is really no place where the potential isn't there.' He added that the officers were forced to kill the animal found in the nearby house because it was a threat to the family. 'We don’t take killing or destroying bears lightly,' he said. 'People were inside that building. I think it was appropriate for that given the situation.'","Alicia Bishop and Glenn Merrill were setting up for their son's party at their Alaska home when the 180 pound bear crashed through their skylight .

"By . Associated Press . The Supreme Court today struck down a 35-foot protest-free zone outside abortion clinics in Massachusetts. The justices were unanimous in ruling that extending a buffer zone 35 feet from clinic entrances violates the First Amendment rights of protesters. Chief Justice John Roberts said authorities have less intrusive ways to deal with problems outside the clinics and noted that most of the problems reported by police and the clinics occurred outside the Planned Parenthood facility in Boston, and only on Saturdays when the largest crowds typically gather. Scroll down for video . Anti-abortion protester Eleanor McCullen, of Boston, left, standing at the painted edge of a buffer zone as she protests outside a Planned Parenthood location in Boston last December. In a ruling today, the Supreme Court struck down a 35-foot protest-free zone outside abortion clinics in Massachusetts saying it violates First Amendment rights of protesters . 'For a problem shown to arise only once a week in one city at one clinic, creating 35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Commonwealth is hardly a narrowly-tailored solution,' Roberts said. While the court was unanimous in the outcome, Roberts joined with the four liberal justices to strike down the buffer zone on narrow grounds. In a separate opinion, . Justice Antonin Scalia criticized Roberts' opinion for carrying forward 'this court's practice of giving abortion-rights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free-speech rights of their opponents'. The case began when Boston-area grandmother Eleanor McCullen and other abortion opponents sued over the limits on their activities at Planned Parenthood health centers in Boston, Springfield and Worcester. 'The government cannot reserve . its public sidewalks for Planned Parenthood, as if their message is the . only one women should be allowed to hear.' At the latter two sites, the protesters say they have little chance of reaching patients arriving by car because they must stay 35 feet from the entrance to those buildings' parking lots. Planned Parenthood provides health exams for women, cancer screenings, tests for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control and abortions at its clinics. The organization said that the buffer zone has significantly reduced the harassment of patients and clinic employees. Before the 35-foot zone went into effect in 2007, protesters could stand next to the entrances and force patients to squeeze by, Planned Parenthood said. Before 2007, a floating buffer zone kept protesters from approaching unwilling listeners any closer than 6 feet if they were within 18 feet of the clinic. The floating zone was modeled after a . Colorado law that the Supreme Court upheld. That decision was not called . into question in Thursday's ruling. Clinic officials said they are most concerned about safety because of past incidents of violence. In 1994, a gunman killed two receptionists and wounded five employees . and volunteers at a Planned Parenthood facility and another abortion . clinic in nearby Brookline. The most recent killing was in 2009, when Dr. George Tiller, who performed abortions, was shot in a church in Wichita, Kansas. Abortion . protesters said that other state and federal laws already protect . health center workers and patients, as well as access to clinics. Mark . Rienzi, who represented the protesters at the Supreme Court, said: 'The . government cannot reserve its public sidewalks for Planned Parenthood, . as if their message is the only one women should be allowed to hear. Today's . decision confirms that the First Amendment is for everyone, and that . the government cannot silence peaceful speakers. That result is good . news for Eleanor McCullen, and it is great news for the women she . helps.'

"By . Associated Press . Guzzlers prevailed Thursday as New York's highest court . refused to reinstate New York City's ban on the sale of big sodas, ruling that . the city's health department overstepped its bounds when approved the 16-ounce . cap on sugary beverages. The court largely ignored the merits of the ban in the . 20-page ruling, but determined the city's Board of Health engaged in . policy-making, and not simply health regulations, when it imposed the . restrictions on restaurants, delis, movie theaters, stadiums and street cart . vendors. ‘The Board of Health engaged in law-making beyond its . regulatory authority,’ the opinion reads. ‘... It is clear that the Board of . Health wrote the Portion Cap Rule without benefit of legislative guidance.’ Gulp: New York's highest court dismissed New York City's appeal to reinstate the Bloomberg-era ban on large sugary soft drinks. In this March 2013 photo, then-Mayor Bloomberg gazes at one of the 64-ounce cups he so vocally despised . The city had hoped Thursday's ruling would overturn a lower . court's decision that blocked the restrictions after restaurants, theater . owners, beverage companies and small stores sued. ‘We are pleased that the lower courts' decisions were . upheld,’ the American Beverage Association said in a statement after the . decision was handed down. The restrictions, if reinstated, ‘would have created . an uneven playing field for thousands of small businesses in the city and . limited New Yorkers' freedom of choice.’ City Health Commission Mary T. Bassett said the . administration of current Mayor Bill de Blasio continues to look for ways ‘to . limit the pernicious effects of aggressive and predatory marketing of sugary . drinks and unhealthy foods.’ Victory: Former partial-term Alaska Governor and failed VP candidate Sarah Palin famously mocked Bloomberg's ban in 2013. Now she and her supporters have won a victory . ‘Today's ruling does not change the fact that sugary drink . consumption is a key driver of the obesity epidemic, and we will continue to . look for ways to stem the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes,’ Bassett said. The case was decided 4-2, with the majority opinion written . by Judge Eugene Piggott Jr. Piggott wrote that city health regulators appeared . to carefully weigh the economic, social and health implications of the ban — a . policy function that Piggott wrote was not the health board's to exercise. The . two dissenting judges wrote that they believe the Board of Health was within . its rights to impose the ban, and that the judiciary shouldn't ‘step into the . middle of a debate over public health policy.’ The city hasn't said whether it plans to try to appeal. But . it's unlikely that an appeal to the Supreme Court would be accepted because the . case centers on local government authority and legislation, not federal issues. Mayor Bloomberg spoke out on the decision Thursday and . condemned the judge for making the decision despite 'irrefutable' evidence that . sugary drinks are horrible for consumers' health. 'We are extremely disappointed by today’s Court decision . that prevents the city from implementing a sugary drink portion cap policy,' he . said, while noting his team is still in the process of examining the court's . decision. Soda has been under fire for years, with health advocates . saying the sugary beverages are unique in their harmfulness because people . don't realize how much high-fructose corn syrup they're guzzling. The bad publicity . has helped lead to a steady decline in U.S. soda sales for nearly a decade. But . other sugary drinks such as sports drinks and energy drinks have been growing. To help curb consumption, lawmakers and health advocates . around the country have proposed soda taxes in recent years. None have . succeeded, however, in part because of heavy campaigning and lobbying from the . beverage industry. In California, a measure that would have slapped a warning . label on sodas was recently defeated. In the meantime, Coke and Pepsi have also been rolling out . smaller cans and bottles, some as small as 7.5 ounces. The idea is that people . would be more willing to drink soda if they could control the portion sizes. The smaller sizes are also more profitable for companies.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Eating out with friends is more likely to lead to boring and unhealthy food choices because of the 'I'll have the same as you' effect, new research revealed last night. Diners tend to pick similar, though not necessarily identical, menu items as the people they are eating with, said the study. And this could mean ditching the diet and any attempt to stick to nutritious or healthy meals for if one person orders dessert then the others will do so too, it added. Choices: Researchers at the University of Illinois found diners tend to pick similar, though not necessarily identical, menu items as the people they are eating with . But strikingly, the findings also showed just how boring people are because most groups of diners stick to the same kind of meals with little evidence of trying something new or different. Researcher Brenna Ellison of the department of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois analysed hundreds of orders in a local full service restaurant. She found clear themes among individual groups of people on a table where they all order similar but not identical items off the menu. For instance, if someone has a meat dish, the others have a meat dish though not necessarily the same one. If one has fish, the others may. And the same for starters and dessert. Options: Diners may struggle to stick to nutritious or healthy meals as if one person in the group orders dessert then the others will do so too . Nutrition, calories and other health labelling does not make a difference, she told the journal Food Quality and Preference. If one person goes for a high calorie choice then the others may do so too, she said. It suggests that despite going out for a meal, most people are 'less variety seeking' than they think. She said: 'Diners wanted to be different from their dining companions, but not too different. 'Diners are happier if another diner orders from the same food category as them. 'And peer effects may outweigh the effects of nutritional information on food choice.'","Researchers at University of Illinois found diners pick similar foods to the people they are eating with .

"By . Associated Press . An attempted carjacking in Seattle failed when three carjackers found they were in a vehicle with a manual transmission and none of them knew how to drive a stick shift. Nancy Fredrickson told KIRO she was getting something out of her trunk Saturday when she turned around to see a gun in her face. Three teens demanded her keys and jumped in her Kia. 'He goes 'I want your keys' and I thought it was a joke!' Ms. Fredrickson exclaimed. Scroll down for video... Victim: Nancy Fredrickson, 70, was pulling garage sale items she just bought out of her trunk, when three teenage boys approached her . Serious: Fredrickson quickly realized that it was serious when she saw a gun pointed at her face. She dropped her keys on the ground when one of the young men repeated himself . Fredrickson said she quickly realized the teen pointing the gun at her face meant what he said. 'He says 'I want your keys!' I says 'There right here on the ground.' I had thrown them down like that,' Fredrickson said while pointing to the pavement. They tried but failed to get it to move and then ran away. The 70-year-old was in tears when she called 911, but later laughed at the inept carjackers. Ran off: The three suspects took off on foot through a nearby parking lot, leaving Nancy’s keys in the ignition . On film: Surveillance cameras caught images of the would-be thieves, but police are still searching for them . Evidence: Though the suspects escaped, police were able to take fingerprints from the car and retrieve DNA and fiber evidence as well . She never imagined a stick shift would prevent a carjacking, but she's happy she and her car were unharmed. Ms. Fredrickson was grabbing something from the trunk of her car when suddenly she saw a gun inches from her face. 'You turn around and here’s this big gun right here, right here,' she said.

He fled in a Plymouth Neon with just $516.02. After eluding police for a day, officers spotted the 50-year-old driving his car near the Taylor St and Crawford Rd, Rock Hill intersection on Tuesday. The father-of-one allegedly didn't stop when police turned on their sirens, leading officers on a high-speed chase down Dave Lyle Boulevard where he allegedly crashed into another car.

"By . Snejana Farberov . The son of Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has . pleaded guilty to burglary and breaking into cars in Colorado under a . deferred judgment agreement. Jedediah . Fox-Udall, 26, entered his plea Thursday and was sentenced to four years . of supervision. If he stays out of trouble and meets the terms of his . supervision, including paying restitution, the case will be dismissed . and he will not be convicted. Deal made: Jedediah Lee Fox-Udall (left), was in court Thursday to plead guilty to charges of trespassing and burglary in deferred judgement deal. He is the son of Senator Mark Udall (right), a Democrat from Colorado . The Colorado senator's son was arrested in January after he was accused of breaking into a home . and cars in Eldorado Springs in Boulder County. At the time, . investigators say he admitted using heroin in the previous two days. He . later enrolled in an addiction treatment program. Fox-Udall pleaded guilty to two felonies — burglary and auto trespass. 'I fully accept responsibility for my actions,' Fox-Udall said in a statement after his sentencing. 'I am deeply sorry for the toll they have taken on the individuals impacted in this incident, and my family and friends. 'I am continuing to work on learning from my mistakes and will put in the work going forward that is necessary and required of me. I am committed to putting my life back into healthy balance.' Prosecutors say deferred judgments are common for people who commit non-violent crimes. Deputies say after they arrested Fox-Udall January 30, he told them he had recently used heroin, but prosecutors say no heroin was found and he wasn't charged with drug possession. His lawyer, Alex Garlin, said during a hearing in February that Fox-Udall was 'dedicated to turning his life around.' 'Maggie and I are deeply distressed to learn of our son's arrest,’ Sen. Mark Udall said in a statement to the Boulder Daily Camera following the arrest. ‘We love our son and stand with him in his commitment to getting the treatment he needs. We appreciate the private space to deal with this as a family.’ Udall is a Democrat from Colorado who represented the region in the House of Representatives before winning his Senate seat in 2008. Senator Udall is running for re-election this year. Last July, Senator Udall's brother James 'Randy' Udall, 61, was found dead after a hiking trip in Pinedale, Wyoming. The Udalls have a long, illustrious history as politicians in Western states. The Senator’s cousin Tom Udall is the senior U.S. Senator from New Mexico and cousin Gordon Smith was a U.S. Senator from Oregon until 2008. His uncle, Stewart Udall, was Interior secretary in the 1960s. His father was the late U.S. Rep.

"By . Snejana Farberov . The fictional serial killer Dexter has claimed yet another victim - this time in New York City's busiest transportation hub. The wife of an African diplomat has filed a lawsuit claiming that she was injured when she was startled by an advertisement for the hit Showtime drama starring Michael C. Hall at Grand Central Terminal. The oversize ad for the show, which finished its eight-season run last year, was spread across the risers of steps leading up to the bustling terminal, said attorney Rehan Nazrali who represents the plaintiff, Ajanaffy Njewadda. Silent 'killer': A woman has filed a lawsuit claiming this oversize poster advertising the Showtime drama Dexter at Grand Central Terminal startled her and made her fall down the stairs . The . lawsuit, filed last week in Bronx Supreme Court, says the placement of . the ad was hazardous and caused her to fall last June. The . gigantic poster featured a closeup Michael C. Hall wrapped in . cellophane. He portrayed a blood spatter pattern analyst moonlighting as . a serial killer known for encasing his victims in plastic wrap. In . a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Mr Nazrali asserted that . the striking image of the fictional serial killer had no place on a . staircase inside a busy train station. ‘It . is designed to be eye-popping, arresting and disturbing,’ he said. ‘The . neurological response you would get from this is shock.’ He added, ‘You do not went to shock people where they’re going up and down the stairs.’ On June 20, . 2013, Mrs Njewadda was walking down the staircase, a vantage point from . which the ad was not visible, but stopped and turned around midway to . look for her elderly husband, a former ambassador from Gambia, the . lawyer said. 'It's a big . face wrapped in cellophane, said Nazrali. 'It scares her.... That . little shock was enough of a trigger to throw her off balance.' Banged up: Ajanaffy Njewadda took a spill, fracturing her right foot, spraining her right ankle and hitting her head, according to her lawyer . Njewadda tumbled down the stairs, fracturing her right foot, spraining her right ankle and hitting her head, he said. The lawyer added that the ambassador’s . wife also had to seek psychological help because she was suffering from . nightmares after her too-close encounter with Dexter. Disturbed: Njewadda, the wife of a former ambassador from Gambia, also allegedly had to seek psycological  help because she was suffering from nightmares after the fall . ‘As far as she’s concerned, there is still residual  trauma,’ said Nazrali. Speaking to MailOnline, the attorney added that his client had never watched the popular Showtime series. Njewadda stayed away from the ill-fated stairway for several months after the fall. She eventually returned to the station, but her lawyer said the woman is still fearful. Named in the lawsuit were Showtime, the New York City Transit Authority, CBS Outdoor Americas which contracted to place the ad, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York City. Mr Nazrani hopes to use this case to start a conversation about the aggressive over-commercialization of public space, and the fact that using 'shockvertisements' like the Dexter ad it is not always ‘harm-free.’ 'I think they should realize that they’re trying to elicit a psychological response from the viewer,' he said. 'They want something kinetic. There’s nothing wrong in doing that, but you don’t want to destroy people.’ The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the lawyer said his client wants a ‘fair deal.’ Speaking to DNAInfo.com, Nazrani revealed that he had tried to reach an agreement directly with Showtime, but an attorney for the network responded that there was nothing wrong with the ad because New Yorker do not scare easily. A spokeswoman at the MTA said it does not comment on pending litigation.","Ajanaffy Njewadda filed a lawsuit against Showtime, the MTA and New York City .

"By . Stephen Wright . greg McGill, a senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service, tried to justify the cost of the case at the Old Bailey by saying it wasn't about phone hacking but about a need to probe privacy breaches . Prosecutors have come under fire after a leading Crown lawyer suggested the £100million hacking trial was necessary to ‘explore the culture of invading privacy’. Greg McGill, a senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service, tried to justify the cost of the case at the Old Bailey by saying it wasn’t about phone hacking but about a need to probe privacy breaches. But critics pointed out that the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards had already addressed the issue. A stream of celebrities poured into the Royal Courts of Justice two years ago to talk about alleged wrongdoing by the sections of the Press and to call for tighter regulations. Critics also said that during the eight-month phone-hacking trial – which finished with just one conviction this week – it emerged that friends, family and even celebrities themselves happily sold stories to the News of the World for money, influence or to prolong their own time in the headlines. Despite this, Mr McGill insisted: ‘This case was not about whether phone hacking took place or whether public officials were paid for information; there are a significant number of recent convictions which show that both did happen. ‘This has been a lengthy and complex trial which was required to explore a culture of invading privacy.’ Privacy experts said a criminal trial was not the appropriate forum to explore such issues. Niri Shan, head of media law at Taylor Wessing, said: ‘A criminal trial is not really the forum to explore the issue of the invasion of privacy. We have already had the Leveson inquiry to do that and there have been a large number of civil actions going through the courts that have also fulfilled that role.’ The Crown lawyer suggested the £100million hacking trial at the Old Bailey was necessary to 'explore the culture of invading privacy' It came as former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, one of five people acquitted this week, claimed he was ‘stitched up’ and that the press was unfairly targeted by police and prosecutors. In an interview with Channel 4 News, Mr Kuttner, who worked at the tabloid from 1980 until 2009, said he and his co-accused had been ‘rounded up’ as part of an ‘assault’ on the Press. ‘I’ve lived with this frankly hideous nightmare for three years. There was no substance to it,’ he said. ‘But I was obviously part of a group who were to be rounded up. I think the State, through its legal arms – the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police Force – chose to take on the Press.’ Mr Kuttner was cleared of being part of the hacking conspiracy dating back to 2000. He added: ‘I resent it for my colleagues, and I am inclined to use the term stitch-up, because that’s what I believe it was. And what lies behind it was an absolute unmerited assault on a free Press.’","Senior lawyer Greg McGill tried to justify cost of case at the Old Bailey .

"By . Becky Barrow . It might feel as if you are just one big bill away from bankruptcy, but a report published today shows that the average worker is actually ‘a millionaire’ - eventually. If you start work at the age of 18, you will have earned a total of £1million by the age of 56 and a half as long as you do not take any career breaks, such as a period of unemployment. But it usually takes much longer for women - age 70 as opposed to 51 for men - to have earned one million pounds. 'This time next year, we'll be millionaires': Del Boy (David Jason, centre) famously says to his brother Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst, right) in BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses that their luck will eventually turn . The report, from the insurance giant Prudential, says it is ‘entirely possible’ for most workers to hit the seven-figure landmark. You do not even have to be a high earner, running a FTSE 100 company or coming up with the next idea for a Google, Apple or BT. The calculations are based on the average salary for each age group from the official earnings figures published by the Office for National Statistics. It assumes that you earn the average salary for your age group at all times. For example, you are earning £9,317 a year between the age of 18 and 21, £20,439 between the age of 22 and 29 rising to a peak of £31,312 in your 40s. But today’s report does highlight the huge gulf between the amount of money that men earn, compared to the amount that their female colleagues earn. In many cases, the two are doing exactly the same job – but the man is just paid more money to do it. Gender split: It usually takes much longer for women - age 70 as opposed to 51 for men - to have earned one million pounds (file picture) On average, a man will have ‘earned his first million’ by the age of 51. But a woman does not reach the landmark until she is 70 because her earnings tend to be so much lower. The shocking 19-year wait faced by women is entirely due to the fact that their salaries tend to be so much lower than men’s salaries. 'Being a millionaire is a dream for most of us. But the reality is that the average UK employee will easily earn £1million in a lifetime of work' Stan Russell, Prudential . In his 40s, a man’s earnings usually peak, with an average salary of £40,246. By comparison, a woman in the same age group is earning only £22,275. Even when a woman’s earnings peak in her 30s, her salary is only £23,075. Stan Russell, a retirement expert at the Prudential, said: ‘Being a millionaire is a dream for most of us. But the reality is that the average UK employee will easily earn £1million in a lifetime of work.’ While they might have earned £1million, they do not actually get to spend this amount of money. By the time the average worker has earned their first million, they will have paid approximately £123,300 in tax and £93,200 in National Insurance, a total of £216,500.","Report by Prudential is based on average salaries for each age group .

"By . Martin Robinson . New allegations: Police are investigating after a man who was in care at Roecliffe Manor children's home in Woodhouse Eaves, Leicestershire said that Savile 'dragged away' a girl later found dead . Police are today investigating whether Jimmy Savile may have been involved in the death of a child during his 50 year campaign of abuse, it was revealed today. The male witness, who claims he was also sexually abused by the late DJ, said he saw Savile and a friend 'drag away' a little girl who was found dead in Leicestershire the next day. The vulnerable child called either 'April or Elizabeth' was being cared for at the Roecliffe Manor children's  convalescent home in Woodhouse Eaves in the 1960s, the informant said. The allegation was detailed in a report . published today following an independent investigation into Savile by . University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. The report stated: 'The Informant stated that he witnessed a girl, who he . believes was called April or Elizabeth, being dragged across the garden . at Roecliffe Manor by “Jimmy” and another man. She appeared to be in a . stupor. 'The next day the Informant was told by the Matron that this girl had died'. However, the report concluded that it could not corroborate the claim and said it had found 'no reference to the death of a child at Roecliffe Manor'. But Leicestershire Police has today confirmed it is investigating the claims. Roecliffe . Manor was shut shortly after the alleged incident in the 1960s. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: 'Leicestershire . Police has received the report on Roecliffe Manor, and started an . investigation to determine if abuse took place and if so to what extent. That investigation is ongoing.' The report did conclude that sexual abuse was 'likely to have taken place' at the home but said its extent could not be known. It added that it 'has not been possible to associate Jimmy Savile with the abuse' other than the claim made by the complainant, who was recovering from tuberculosis between the ages of four and nine. The report's author Sue Walters said her investigation had been 'challenging' because the allegations into the home in the village of Woodhouse Eaves dated back over 50 years. She concluded the evidence of two victims who alleged sexual abuse had taken place was 'convincing', and has passed their complaints to police for further investigation. 'Other than the informant, no other individual interviewed, or record read, made reference to Jimmy Savile (JS) being present at Roecliffe Manor,' the report read. Ms Walters . concluded the evidence she had seen was 'not of sufficient strength in . nature to enable the lead investigator to conclude that the man who . abused the Informant was in fact JS.' The . victim's allegations first came to light when he contacted Operation . Yewtree investigators, who have looked into hundreds of claims of abuse . at Savile's hands, claiming he was abused by the former DJ on at least . four occasions. He told Ms . Walters a man 'called Jimmy' would come to the home, bringing books and . film reels, and 'would have us kissing and cuddling him'. The victim told her 'he managed to make you feel loved and cared for' but had later abused him. Roecliffe Manor (pictured) was shut shortly after . the alleged incident and investigators have not been able to find . evidence that Jimmy Savile had visited, although they believe children . were abused there . On a few . occasions, the man said he and another little girl were taken from . Roecliffe in the back of a camper van by Savile and a male friend, who . had an Irish or Scottish accent. He said that when taken out of the home, they would go to a motorway service station or for picnics. The alleged abuse took place between 1959 and 1964. Welcoming . the findings, Carole Ribbins, the NHS trust's nursing director, said the . trust already had 'very robust processes in place to protect children . and vulnerable adults'. 'However, . we are not complacent and we are in the process of implementing the . independent external investigator's recommendations from the report,' added Ms Ribbins. She praised Ms Walters' thoroughness and said all relevant information had now been passed to Leicestershire Police. The force . said its investigations into the alleged abuse were ongoing, and urged . anyone with information to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 . 555111.","A man who claims he was abused said he saw 'Jimmy' 'drag away' a girl .

"By . Ian Drury . The Foreign Office is searching for a new spy chief after it was announced Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, is stepping down. The boss of Britain's overseas intelligence services – traditionally known as ‘C’ – will leave the post in November after five years. Sir John – often compared to James Bond for his suave manner and good looks – had tried to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding MI6 and was its first head to give a public speech. Sir John Sawers was the first MI6 chief to be chosen from outside the service for 41 years . But his departure comes after a rocky year in which the three British intelligence services – the others are MI5 and GCHQ – were thrown into disarray by CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about surveillance. Only one – Andrew Parker, the director general of the domestic spy agency – will be left. Officials said Sir John’s departure was not linked to the Snowden disclosures. Sir John was the first MI6 chief to be chosen from outside the service for 41 years. His appointment was opposed by senior spies who believed it was an attempt by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to increase its influence after the Iraq debacle, when the intelligence agencies claimed Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction. Sir John's departure, after five years service, was not linked to the disclosures made by Edward Snowden . Sir John, 58, is a career diplomat who has also worked as an envoy in Baghdad and as foreign affairs adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Blair. But he was no stranger to the world of espionage, having trained with MI6 at the start of his career before joining the FCO. Last year he told an intelligence committee hearing the Snowden revelations had been very damaging. ‘They have put our operations at risk. It is clear our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaeda is lapping it up,’ he said. Sir John was accidentally exposed by his wife, Shelley, on the internet shortly after being appointed to the top job, and in one picture he could be seen on a beach in tight-fitting swimming trunks . In 2012, MI6 was also in the spotlight when a coroner criticised spies for hampering the police investigation into the death of Gareth Williams, a GCHQ employee seconded to the agency who was found dead in a holdall in a London flat. Even though he presided over a secret service, Sir John was accidentally exposed by his wife, Shelley, on the internet shortly after being appointed to the top job. To the astonishment of spy-watchers, personal photographs posted on Facebook showing the spy chief on a beach in tight-fitting swimming trunks. Other potentially compromising details about where the family live and work, who their friends are and where they spend their holidays were posted. The names of serving members of MI6 other than its head are secret, so a speculative list of potential successors will not be made public. But one candidate could be Charles Farr, director of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), a close ally of Home secretary Theresa May.","First M16 chief to be chosen from outside the service in 41 years .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . Barclays has been charged with ‘systematic fraud and deceit’ against its customers. The alleged victims include large investment institutions that manage the pension savings of millions. The bank is accused of duping investors who traded shares in its ‘dark pool’, a secretive market where people buy and sell stocks without disclosing information about the transactions, according to a US lawsuit. Charged: The bank is accused of duping investors who traded shares in a secretive market (file photo) Pension funds that traded in the ‘dark pool’ may have lost some of their members’ savings while operating in what they thought was a fair forum – but which was rigged against them. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who launched the lawsuit, said Barclays ‘demonstrated a disturbing disregard for its investors in a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit’. If found guilty, Barclays faces the prospect of multi-million-pound fines, compensation and further lawsuits. The bank is still rebuilding its reputation after a string of scandals including rigging of the Libor interest rate and mis-selling of PPI loan insurance. Shares in Barclays slumped more than 6 per cent after the charges were revealed, slashing the value of the company by £2.3billion in a single day. According to the lawsuit, Barclays hoped to earn an extra £30million a year by expanding its dark pool. To attract investors, it told them that they would be protected from ‘high-frequency traders’, who use super-fast computers to perform trades. Q&A: The lawsuit by the U.S. attorney general against banking giant Barclays explained . In fact, the lawsuit alleges, Barclays invited such traders into the dark pool. Some of these predators were Barclays’ own staff, who stood to make more money for themselves and the bank by exploiting other investors. The bank was also accused of routing investors into its own dark pool rather than to those owned by rivals, where they might have got a better deal. As a result, millions of savers may not have received the returns they might have reasonably expected from their pension fund. The bank’s behaviour amounted to a ‘pattern of fraud and deceit’, according to the charges. Mr Schneiderman said: ‘Barclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters.’ He said Barclays’ dark pool was actually ‘full of predators – there at Barclays’ invitation’. A bank spokesman said: ‘We take these allegations very seriously… The integrity of the markets is a top priority of Barclays.’","Lawsuit by U.S. Attorney General alleges 'disturbing disregard' for investors .

Former goalkeeper Malcolm White, 73, has also been hit with a £25,000 legal bill after he was successfully sued by Emma Grady. Miss Grady, 40, injured her left toe on a homemade wooden sign the pensioner had put on a grass verge outside his home in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire. Malcolm White, left, has been ordered to pay Emma Grady, right, more than £2,500 in damages after she stubbed her toe on a 'keep off the grass' sign outside his house . Emma Jane Grady made a claim against Malcolm White, after she said that she had tripped over a 'Do not park on the grass' sign that he had placed there. The signs can be seen here placed in the grass, circled in red, but they have since been removed . The sign, which measured 4ins by 10in, read ‘Please do not park on the grass’ and was erected outside hisdetached property. Mr White, who played for Lincoln City, Grimbsy Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers, put it there as a favour for villagers who were fed up with parents parking on the grass verge when they collected their children from the local primary school. But he was taken to court after Miss Grady tore the nail off her left big toe on a rusty nail when she stumbled over the sign as she went to collect her daughter from school on November 12, 2012. Miss Grady, who lives half-a-mile away in the neighbouring village of High Hykeham, claimed it took six months for her toe nail to grow back but has been left deformed. A sign on the grass verge in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire said 'Please do not park on the grass' Mr White, who went on to play in America for Los Angeles Wolves, has been ordered to pay Miss Grady £2,541.35 in damages and £24,874.39 in court costs. He denied erecting the sign but his wife Valerie, 72, admitted he did put it up in a telephone conversation with Miss Grady’s solicitor Katherine Trafford. Passing judgement at Lincoln County Court, District Judge Chris Cooper said: 'This case comes down to whether or not Mr and Mrs White or Mrs Trafford is telling the truth. 'It is clear that the claimant suffered sizable injury after the accident. 'I am satisfied that it happened in the way that she said it did and she stubbed her toe on the offending sign. 'I am also satisfied that the signs caused a public nuisance. 'A pedestrian does not have to look at their feet when going about their business.' Mr White has now been forced to pay the cash from his own pocket because his insurance company will not cover his legal bills. In a statement after the hearing, the couple's solicitor Patrick Tedstone said: 'It’s a sad day for Mal and Val. 'They are leaving the village this week after more than 30 very, very happy years, to be closer to family. 'They are very disappointed with the judgement and with the costs, too, but they will respect the judge’s decision. Malcolm White played youth football for his hometown team Wolverhampton Wanderers before signing for Grimsby Town in the late 1950s. He enjoyed a successful trial with the club and stayed with the club for five years making nearly 70 first-team appearances from 1958 to 1963. He went on to play for Walsall, Lincoln City, Bradford City and Halifax Town before going to America to star for Los Angeles Wolves in the late 1960s. Speaking in 2011, he told how, playing for Grimsby, he once saved a penalty from the legendary Brian Clough - who went on to win two consecutive European Cups as manager of Nottingham Forrest. He said: 'When we were in the Second Division, we were competing with the likes of Sunderland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough. 'Against Sunderland, I saved a penalty from Brian Clough in front of 46,000 - mind you, he scored a hat-trick in the same game.' 'They wish everyone in the village well.' A friend added: 'They are gutted. It’s a barmy ruling because the sign was put on the verge to stop parents churning it up with their cars. 'The land is publicly owned but was being turned into a car park by inconsiderate parents. I feel very sorry for them. This should never have gone to court.' Miss Grady said: 'I am relieved this is all over. 'I have been through 18 months of hell. My foot will never be the same again. I am satisfied with the result.'","Malcolm White put sign up next to his home in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire .

"By . Darren Boyle . A leading Libyan human rights lawyer was gunned down inside her own home shortly after she had cast her vote in national elections. Salwa Bugaighis was murdered on Wednesday evening after gunmen burst into her compound in Benghazi  and shot her in the head. Libyan state media reported that Ms Bugaighis was rushed to hospital but died of her wounds. Gunmen burst into Salwa Bugaighis' home in Benghazi and shot her in the head a short while after she had cast her vote in the Libyan parliamentary election. Islamic extremists are believed to have been behind the attack . The human rights activist and lawyer . was leading voice following the 2011 uprising, opposing armed militias . and radical Islamic extremists, who have grown in strength since Colonel . Gadhafi's fall. Libyan . security forces have not yet identified the gunmen, but the country is . being hit by a wave of assassinations targeting secular activists, . judges, moderate clerics, policemen and soldiers. Islamic extremists are understood to be behind many of these attacks. Hours before her murder, Ms Bugaighis had been speaking to Libyan TV Al-Nabaa network channel about a heavy gunfight in her neighbourhood. It is believed that militants tried to ambush government troops protecting a polling station. She said: 'These are people who want to foil elections. Benghazi has been always defiant, and always will be despite the pain and fear. It will succeed.' Hours before her murder, Ms Bugaighis urged voters, such as this woman, to cast their ballots in this week's parliamentary election despite the terror threat . The gunmen asked for Ms Bugaighis' son Wael before shooting a security guard in the leg. The killers broke into the house before shooting her in the head. Ms Bugaighi's husband has not been seen since the attack. The couple had returned to Benghazi from Libyan capital Tripoli to vote in the parliamentary elections. Their children have been staying in Jordan after an earlier attempt to kidnap or murder them failed. Ms Bugaighis has represented Libya abroad since the collapse of the Gadhafi regime. She worked tirelessly towards trying to reduce ethnic and religious tensions in the country. Hassan al-Amin, another human rights activist who has fled Libya because of the constant death threats said: 'All supporters of the truth are threatened.' On her Twitter page, US ambassador Deborah K Jones called her killing 'a cowardly, despicable, shameful act against a courageous woman and true Libyan patriot. Heartbreaking.' Speaking just hours before her death, Ms Bugaighis said there was heavy fighting in her neighbourhood after rebels in a bid to disrupt the election  had attacked government troops  who were protecting a polling station . The U.N. mission in Libya condemned the assassination in a statement, saying ""once again, Benghazi witnesses a bloody attack, the last of a series largely targeting civilians."" Libyans voted on Wednesday in the country's second parliament elections, hoping for stability after three years of chaos since Gadhafi's death. On her Facebook page, Ms Bugaighis posted pictures for herself casting ballots in Benghazi. Later, she gave the interview to Al-Nabaa TV as shelling hit her neighborhood and smoke rose from nearby. She urged people to go to the polls and cast ballots, saying she hoped for a new parliament without the current domination by Islamists. 'From your network,' she told the station, 'I call upon our people in Benghazi to steadfast and be patient because elections must be accomplished.'","Salwa Bugaighis was shot in the head inside her home in Benghazi .

"By . Jason Groves . Unite boss Len McCluskey has been given a £5,000 pay rise to £140,281 - just less than David Cameron's salary . Union chief Len McCluskey has pocketed a £5,000 pay rise  while thousands of his members struggle with wage freezes. The powerful Left-wing Unite boss, pictured below, saw his package jump to £140,281 last year – just short of the salary paid to David Cameron. The 3.7 per cent rise came as thousands of Unite’s public sector members face the fifth consecutive year of pay freezes and below-inflation rises. Unite yesterday defended the 3.7 per cent rise, saying all of its officials had received the same rate. ‘It reflects the fact that union members win better pay deals,’ a spokesman said. Tory chairman Grant Shapps criticised the rise, saying: ‘Ed Miliband’s trade union paymasters have caused misery with strikes and disruption, but now it emerges Red Len has given himself a massive pay rise. It’s do as we say, not as we do.’ The rise was revealed as activists from Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, prepare for a conference in Liverpool next week to finalise a list of hard-line policy demands ahead of next year’s General Election in a bid to drive the party further to the Left. Mr McCluskey will open the policy conference with a rallying call on the economy where is expected to demand that Labour rejects austerity and turns the spending taps back on. The draft agenda for the week-long conference, reveals that activists expect to see a clear return on the £16.2 million Unite has handed Labour since the last election. Policy proposals include the nationalisation of large parts of the private sector at a cost of tens of billions of pounds, the lowering of the state pension age and the abolition of the anti-strike laws introduced by Margaret Thatcher to end the industrial chaos of the 1970s. Militants are pushing for the union to cut its donations to Labour by 20 per cent unless Mr Miliband agrees to reverse all of the Coalition’s spending cuts. The conference will be attended by a number of senior Labour figures, including the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who is expected to back Unite’s call to reverse ‘creeping privatisation’ in the NHS. It comes just weeks before Labour’s National Policy Forum meets to agree the outline of the party’s election manifesto. Labour last night insisted it will write its own manifesto. But, with Labour increasingly reliant on Unite’s cash, Ed Miliband will be under intense pressure to give in to his paymaster’s demands. Militants are pushing for Unite to cut its donation to Ed Miliband's Labour party by 20 per cent unless the shadow leader can reverse all of the Coalition's spending cuts . One motion at the conference warns: ‘The Labour Party is our party, it was formed by the trade union movement and we will not be pushed out by those who want our money and support at election time but do not want us to play any role in the party structures or the formulation of policy.’ Critics point out that Mr Miliband has already accepted a number of Unite’s key demands, including increasing the top rate of tax and introducing rent controls. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke warned that Unite’s policy ideas would ‘kill the economic recovery stone dead’. Mr Elphicke said: ‘This is a dangerous, out of touch agenda that would put the 1970s to shame. It would reverse our economic success, bring irreparable harm to our country and damage our children’s future. ‘But Unite knows that Ed Miliband is so in hock to them that he will struggle to resist their demands. He should put the country’s interests first but he is too weak to stand up to his paymaster Len McCluskey.’ Motions on the draft agenda include a call for mass nationalisation of a swathe of industry, including the water, gas and electricity utilities, the Royal Mail, the railways, the buses, prisons and even care homes. Several motions also call for increases in the state pension age to be reversed so that people can continue to retire at 65, despite the crippling cost of the measure. Labour is also urged to reject fracking for gas, despite its potential to generate billions of pounds for the economy and cut fuel bills. And Labour will be pressed to ‘repeal all anti-trade union laws brought in by Tory governments’. Activists will also pressure Labour to outlaw zero hour contracts, despite their use by hundreds of thousands of people. Labour last night insisted that Mr Miliband would not necessarily accept all of Unite’s demands. A Labour source said: ‘Unite is entitled to debate whatever policies it wants at its conference. We will decide our policies on the basis of what is in the best interests of the country.’","Unite leader Len McCluskey paid £140,281 - just less than David Cameron .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A man who swallowed a live goldfish in McDonald's as part of a sick drinking game has been banned from keeping animals. Robert Atkinson, 20, was filmed buying a goldfish, taking it to the fast food outlet in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, dropping it into a pint of beer and downing the drink. After finishing the beer he proclaimed 'I'm an animal'. The video was later uploaded to Facebook  as part of the NekNominate craze, in which people challenge one another to down bizarre, and in some cases lethal, alcoholic concoctions on camera. Scroll down for video . Cruel: Robert Atkinson, 20, uploaded footage of himself drinking a live goldfish . Guilty: Atkinson admitted inflicting unnecessary harm on the fish . Atkinson, who is unemployed, was taken to court by the RSPCA along with his friend Lewis Summers, 19, who filmed the video. The pair both admitted cruelty charges at Wakefield Magistrates' Court yesterday. At the start of the cruel prank, Atkinson and Summers visit a Pets At Home store and buy the fish while boasting to a shop assistant about their plan. Atkinson said: 'I'm going to call him Dmitri. I want a nice big one, we are going to eat it. I'll buy some chips with it.' The two then head to McDonald's and drop the fish into a plastic cup of beer. Atkinson announces: 'Thanks for the NekNomination, this is a goldfish in beer.' He adds: 'That trick usually works better when I've got my rabbit.' After swallowing the fish he says: 'I'm an animal'. 'Sick humour': Robert Atkinson, left, and Lewis Summers, right, were both criticised by the judge, who said they 'still find' the video funny . The pair was prosecuted by the RSPCA, which received reports of the cruel video from concerned viewers who saw it on Facebook in February this year. Atkinson admitted the charge of inflicting unnecessary harm to a protected animal, while Summers, admitted the aiding and abetting of cruelty. In court yesterday the pair was given a three-year ban on keeping animals, and hit with more than £1,500 in fines, as the judge branded the dare 'simply sick humour'. Prosecutor Andy Davidson, for the RSPCA, told the court: 'The video speaks for itself.' Describing the NekNominate craze to the judge, Mr Davidson added: 'This type of challenge is well-known. It's a dare filmed and broadcasted for other people's entertainment.' The craze took off in February this year, but quickly turned dark after three men died shortly after filming themselves drinking especially potent concoctions consisting of up to a pint of spirits such as gin and vodka. Defence lawyer John Wilkinson told the court his clients hadn't known they were committing an offence when they made the video. Pleased with himself: Atkinson can be seen giggling before starting the dare . Juvenile: The NekNominate craze began this year, spawning bizarre and sometimes dangerous online videos . Plan: Atkinson said he made the video because he knew it would be popular. He was prosecuted by the RSPCA after online viewers reported the abuse . Sentencing them, District Judge Richard Clews told the pair: 'You might say this fish only met the sort of death it would have in the wild. You might say: ""Well it's only a goldfish"". 'Both of those notions miss the point. Apart from anything else, the more defenceless an animal is, the more culpable the abuse is of it. 'It may not be obvious that fish have the same feelings that a dog or cat has, but that does not mean that they are incapable of experiencing pain and it's certainly no justification for treating them like that. 'That creature died a deeply painful and wholly unpleasant death.' The judge added: 'This was plainly planned to some degree and clearly deliberate. You filmed what happened and put it on a social media site. The further aggravating feature is that you both found it so funny, and still find it funny now. That is quite simply sick humour.' Atkinson and Summers were ordered to serve 40 hours of unpaid work and pay a £723 fine each, alongside a victim surcharge of £60. Speaking outside court, Summers said: 'I was shocked when I got the call from the RSPCA. I didn't think it was a big issue with it being a small animal. I'm an animal lover myself and I didn't know I was committing an offence. 'I have thousands of followers on social media, and I posted the video because I knew it would go viral. Some people thought it was funny but there were a few who thought it was cruel. I did later decide to delete the video.' RSPCA spokeswoman Gemma Fowler said: 'It's a horrible thing to do to a living animal, and I'm pleased that the courts have taken the same view. 'I hope that the sentence that's been handed down to the defendants acts as a deterrent and prevents this from happening again in future. It's shocking footage. The district judge was absolutely right. 'They showed a blatant disregard for that animal's life and welfare.'","Robert Atkinson, 20, bought fish from pet store then downed it with beer .

Meanwhile in Bangkok, Thailand, 3,094 kilograms of illegal drugs - including methamphetamine, heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, opium, codeine and marijuana - were burned in a high-powered oven. The products had an estimated street value of £160million. In Pakistan huge sacks of opium were also destroyed, sending huge clouds of thick black smoke high into the air. The drugs were seized from rural farms in the country and in neighbouring Afghanistan. Drug burnings also took place in the Philippines.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Plans to give motorists a 'grace period' to park on double yellow lines have been quietly dropped, MailOnline can reveal. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to save struggling high streets by allowing drivers to park for 15 minutes free of charge. But after the plan was torn apart in a public consultation which raised fears it could lead to high streets becoming clogged up and dangerous, Mr Pickles has ditched the idea. Rocketing parking charges and town centre double yellow lines are forcing families to use out-of-town shopping centres, ministers believe . Mr Pickles told the Conservative spring forum last year: 'I believe we need to give people the good grace to pop into a local corner shop for 10 minutes, to buy a newspaper or a loaf of bread without risking a £70 fine.' But a document slipped out by his department reveals public hostility to the proposal. Businesses and the public were asked by the Department for Communities and Local Government if they supported 'extending grace periods to other areas such as yellow lines and loading bays'. But the 'majority of individuals (55 per cent) and organisations (73 per cent) disagreed with this proposal', the report says. 'There were concerns that allowing free periods in places where parking is not permitted (such as double yellow lines), could lead to confusion.' The report adds that it could also 'encourage more anti-social and potentially dangerous parking and also lead to sequential parking in some popular areas where kerb space might be continually occupied despite there being a restriction in place'. As a result, the Government has dropped its plan for double yellow 'grace periods'. But it has proposed instead to allow motorists an extra five minutes leeway at the end of free on-street parking, to stop over-strict parking wardens fining families for returning to their cars a few minutes after their time has run out. Ministers will introduce a '10 minute mandatory grace period' which they claim will mean 'whether motorists pay for their parking, or it is available free for a time, they can have confidence that they will not be penalised for returning a few minutes late'. The department will also 'work to extrend the same grace period to local authority off-street parking'. Labour's shadow local government secretary Hilary Benn (left) said the Tory Cabinet minister Eric Pickles (right) had been forced to drop his parking plan because it was 'clear that it was never going to work' Labour's shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said: 'Eric Pickles suggested last year that he would allow parking on yellow lines and loading bays. 'This policy has now been quietly dropped and it’s clear that it was never going to work. 'As even he now acknowledges, it would have meant that some spaces would end up being continually occupied.' Mr Pickles first proposed a grace period for motorists last year, when he said that parking charges had become 'ridiculously high'. Several local authorities already allow motorists to park free for up to 30 minutes near local shops, and the Conservatives want to implement similar schemes more widely. Local Government and High Streets Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'Popping to the shops should be simple and pain free. 'Slapping people with hefty fines is akin to criminalising them but by making ten minute grace periods mandatory we can bring some common sense back to parking on the high street and ease every traffic wardens finger off the ticket trigger. 'In addition the public will now get a new right to demand a review of where yellow lines are if they don’t think they are fair or in the right place. 'These changes are part of range of measures that will give drivers a fairer deal by reining -in over-zealous parking enforcement practices that force drivers to out of town shopping centres.'","Eric Pickles wanted to help town centres by allowing drivers to park for free .

"By . Daniel Miller . An overworked Chinese advertising employee died of a heart attack in his office aged just 24. Li Yuan had been working overtime until 11pm every night at the Ogilvy & Mather China offices in Beijing in the month before he died. At around 5pm on Monday he stood up, cried out in pain before collapsing onto the ground, according to a report in the Yangzi Evening News. Overworked: Stressed out Chinese advertising worker Li Yuan died of a heart attack in his office aged just 24 . He was rushed to the Peking Union Medical College, where he was confirmed dead. Doctors said he had suffered a heart attack. The company confirmed that one of its employees had died through its Twitter account yesterday. The tweet read: 'Unfortunately the sad news is true, Beijing has lost 1 of our own. 'He was loved by all of us. Thank u for your kind msgs.' Salute: Li poses for a picture on a social media page. He had reportedly been working overtime for a month and not leaving the office until 11pm every day . China has now overtaken Japan as having the highest number of deaths related to overworking. Nearly 600,000 Chinese workers die from 'exhaustion' each year, according to a report from last year in the official newspaper of the Communist Youth League, The China Youth Daily. Most of the deaths are caused by stress-related heart attacks and strokes. Symptoms associated with such deaths include insomnia, anorexia and abdominal pains. Can stress bring on a stroke or heart attack? Although conventional medical wisdom maintains there is no evidence of a link between mental pressure and heart conditions, recent research has found stress does increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A 2012 study by University College, London, found that those who become stressed are more likely to suffer from hardened arteries than those who remain calm under pressure. Doctors recruited 514 men and women with an average age of 62. None of them had signs of heart disease at the time of the test. In a laboratory, each of the volunteers was put into a stressful situation by being asked to carry out tricky mental tests. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva were then measured. Cortisol is produced by the body when it comes under mental or physical strain. When released, it can causes the arteries to narrow . The volunteers' arteries were also scanned for signs of furring - the accumulation of fatty material on the inside walls. Those whose cortisol levels shot up during the tests were twice as likely to have furred arteries as those who remained calm, the researchers found. In a 2010 study, researchers analysed data from more than 68,000 people over the age of 35 years who took part in the Health Survey for England from 1994 to 2004 and measured the role of anxiety and stress in deaths from all causes, heart disease, cancer and external causes occurring over eight years. They found symptoms of anxiety or depression, known as psychological distress, increases mortality rates from several major causes. Alarmingly, the risk rose among those at the lower end of the scale who would not usually come to the attention of mental health services - about a quarter of people. The British Heart Foundation claims that stress is not a direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Its website claims stress can lead to more smoking, drinking and overeating, but that 'there is no evidence to suggest that stress causes coronary heart disease or heart attacks'.","Li Yuan had been working overtime until 11pm each night for a month .

"By . Steve Doughty . Dozens of celebrities today pressed David Cameron to legalise drugs. They included longstanding campaigners for drug law liberalisation including comedian Russell Brand, rock star Sting, and tycoon Sir Richard Branson. Others among 90 people who signed a letter to Downing Street included left-wing barrister Michael Mansfield QC and author and former heroin addict Will Self, who was once accused of taking drugs on board former Prime Minister John Major’s election bus. Comedian Russell Brand, who has battled drug addiction, has backed the campaign to legalise drugs . Sting recently spoke about using cannabis to help him write songs and the need for a debate about drugs . The letter, organised by the Release drug charity, said that more than 1.5 million people have been subject to ‘unnecessary criminalisation’ for drug possession in Britain over the last 15 years. It said that evidence from Australia, the Czech Republic and Portugal shows health problems are dramatically reduced when drug users are not arrested and prosecuted but given advice and medical help. The letter, which was also backed by the Prison Governors Association and the National Black Police Association, was planned to coincide with drug legalisation protests in London and other capital cities. Nick Glynn, of the National Black Police Association, said: ‘It is time for a mature, informed, objective debate around the UK’s drugs laws. Sir Michael Mansfield QC, left, and Sir Richard Branson were among 90 people to sign the letter . ‘Enforcement of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act has created many unintended, negative consequences and new approaches must be considered, including those which have been successful in other countries. Strategies that avoid criminalising people and focus instead on health and education seem to me to offer a positive way forward.’ The letter also asked for a commitment from Mr Cameron to push for an international review on drug laws through the United Nations. Niamh Eastwood of Release said: ‘In 2002, when the Prime Minister was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, he supported the recommendation that the UN consider alternatives to the status quo. We are asking him to stand by that commitment and recognise the damage that has been done, both nationally and internationally, by repressive drug policies.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg wants 'rigorously monitored' cannabis legalisation . Kathy Gyngell, from the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, said cannabis is harmful, particularly for teenagers and leads to psychosis . The celebrities have some high-level political support. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently put his name to a call for ‘rigorously monitored’ cannabis legalisation. The demand for legalisation met a dusty reaction from Downing Street and fierce condemnation from opponents of drug law liberalisation. A No. 10 spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of decriminalising drugs. With usage at the lowest levels since records began and more people than ever before now more likely to free themselves from dependency through treatment, we are confident this approach is the right one.’ Kathy Gyngell, a research fellow of the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think tank, said: ‘Cannabis is harmful. It is particularly harmful for teenagers. It leads to psychosis in large numbers of cases. Other illegal drugs are also harmful. ‘Drug laws are successful. They have ensured that fewer than six per cent of the population use illegal drugs. Cannabis use has dropped by a third since the 1990s, and cocaine use has levelled off. In Portugal, held up as an example by legalisers, drug use by children has doubled since the laws were liberalised. ‘I believe many of the people who have signed this letter have done so for selfish reasons, because they use drugs themselves.’ Sting gave an interview to the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine at the weekend in which he said: ‘If I’m feeling stuck on a lyric or an idea isn’t quite gelling, sometimes a puff of weed will free it up. I rarely smoke it socially. It’s just a tool, just as a pen is.’ He added: ‘The drug laws aren’t helping. We need a really honest debate in society. People will tend to want to make life richer. Life seems flat a lot of the time. Chemicals, alcohol, marijuana can help.’","1.5 million people charged for drug possession in UK over the last 15 years .

For a nation that would usually consider the Super Bowl as the competition to decide football's world champions, the United States have come a long way in terms of the way they view 'soccer'. This summer's World Cup in Brazil looks to be the first one that really has US fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the tournament on their home soil at USA '94. For once, rather than struggling to drum up support for the USMNT (United States Men's National Team), fans are being turned away from fan parks as Americans attempt to drink in the relative successes of their national team on the big stage. VIDEO Scroll down to watch footage of American fans' wild World Cup celebrations . New found glory: American fans are up for this World Cup - thousands of fans are watching in fan parks . Crushing: But it hasn't all been easy - here fans react after Portugal's late equaliser in Group G . National heroes: The fans are heavily backing their team and thought they would win the World Cup . Passionate: The USMNT's players have shown passion that has inspired their supporters have in Brazil . A pre-tournament survey, carried out across 19 Brazil-bound countries, showed US supporters as fans of one of only four nations that expected their team to win the World Cup - alongside early favourites Argentina, Brazil and Spain. While that confidence and optimism may have been slightly misguided, the US are looking good for a place in the last-16 leaving Portugal and Ghana - both considered to be stronger sides - to fail at the group stage. A draw against Germany in their final group game would guarantee their progress to the knockout stages while a win would see them top the group and set up a potentially favourable tie against likely Group H runners-up Algeria, Russia or South Korea. And the fans are embracing the success. Over seven years on from when David Beckham's move to LA Galaxy heralded a new era - that didn't quite work out - for soccer in the world's third largest country by population, football, as it is increasingly being referred to, is finally capturing the imagination of the fans. Even the absence of Landon Donovan - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm. Celeb support: Will Ferrell, who counts himself as a Chelsea supporter, was seen geeing up fans at an event . Here and there: Two of the USA's 196,838 ticketholders in Brazil cheer the team on against Portugal . Big moment: John Brooks last minute header sent USA fans - and players - into hysteria . Dejected: For a nation that calls the sport soccer, fans were hard hit by Portugal's late eqauliser . Big story: Soccer is now front page news in the states - including their 1-1 win over England in 2010 . Chicago's fan park - laid on for the Portugal game - has a 15,000 person capacity but had to turn fans away, such was its popularity. Videos of fans celebrating John Brooks' last-gasp winner against Ghana have been doing the rounds on YouTube and are on a par with videos of English fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about this year. No country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the USA's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all-time high and beginning to even rival those of America's traditional sports. While the MLS still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the USMNT - it is improving. This year's television viewing figures were low but next year Beckham will launch his own new Miami-based MLS side, while David Villa represents arguably the States' biggest coup following his sign for Manchester City's sister club New York City FC. Chelsea legend Frank Lampard might follow the Spanish striker. Stars: David Villa is coming to the MLS next year and he may yet be joined by Chelsea legend Frank Lampard . Captain America: Beckham is launching his own MLS franchise after playing for LA Galaxy late in his career . USA '94 might have been the best attended World Cup but with over 20million people watching the game against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Sunday - this is the World Cup that is really drawing in Americans. Coach Jurgen Klinnsman will face up against his home nation in the final group game - singing both anthems - and maybe the impact of the World Cup is best summed up by his gesture ahead of the Germany game. Klinnsman has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls 'for an important cause'. For supporters in the US, real football is finally becoming important. Adopted nation: Klinsmann's print-out letter designed to be handed in by American's at their workplaces . Top man: Clint Dempsey, the USMNT's captain is becoming a popular figure in the States . Madness: Fans in American gear react to a goal in a Rio de Janeiro fanzone - thousands have travelled over . USA fans erupted in fan parks and bars when John Brooks scored the winner against Ghana but despaired when Cristiano Ronaldo set up Silvestre Varela to equalise for Portugal and deny them qualification after two games. A win or draw against Germany would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes.","Supporters pack out fan parks to cheer on their new heroes .

When Ross Hutchins received the all clear from cancer last July, it only took him one day to return to the courts of the All England Club for a hit with father Paul and brother Blake. On Thursday, eleven months on, it felt as if Hutchins took another crucial step on the long road back as he walked onto Court No 11 for his first competitive match here for two years. Although he and partner Colin Fleming lost 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 to 16th seeds Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero, Hutchins said: ‘It felt great. This is my home club.

"By . Mike Dawes . Bacary Sagna was clearly enjoying life as he took some time out on the beach in Rio after sealing his move to Manchester City and helping France through to the last 16 of the World Cup. The full-back spent the afternoon with his wife, Ludivine, and their children as the French players were given some time off after Wednesday night's goalless draw with Ecuador.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money. 'For people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time. 'It was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and it was hard to stay focused.

"By . David Kent . Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor believes Luis Suarez has taken a 'massive backward step' after the Uruguay striker was handed another long ban for biting an opponent. Taylor also feels the sanction handed down by FIFA on Thursday should have included a counselling and treatment course for the Liverpool striker to help him with 'a trait he has to get rid of'. FIFA punished Suarez with a nine-match suspension and a ban from playing for any team for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Tuesday's World Cup match. Under the cosh: Luis Suarez, pictured in the hours before FIFA's ruling, has been banned for four months . PFA Chief: Gordon Taylor says that Suarez is spoiling his talent and should be offered counselling to help him . Head down: It is the third time Suarez has been banned for biting an opposition player . It is the third time Suarez has been punished for biting opponents, having been banned for seven matches while playing for Ajax in 2010 and 10 matches when at Liverpool last year . Taylor told Sky Sports News: 'We felt things had got back on track (following his ban with Liverpool), it was up there for everybody to see, but of course this is a massive backward step on the world stage. 'I feel FIFA should have led the way with regard to trying to make sure that this behaviour is just eradicated and insist on there being some serious counselling and treatment for Luis Suarez because there's no doubt he's one of the finest players in the world - but this is a trait he has to get rid of. 'It's just not good for him, for any of his club, his country or the game in general and I've not seen that issue addressed either. 'Of course it's not good when you've got somebody of such talent who spoils that talent by such behaviour and that's why I believe it needs looking at in a serious way and that treatment course needs to be part of any sanction I would suggest.' Security: Uruguay's team hotel in Natal has been surrounded by armed guards in response to the incident . Kop that! Suarez will not be able to play for Liverpool until the end of October . Decision maker: Claudio Sulser said the incident 'could not be tolerated on any football pitch' Chomping at the bit: Luis Suarez appears bites Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 win . On whether he thinks Liverpool will stick by Suarez amid reports of interest from Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer, Taylor added: 'They will have to make a decision. 'The size of the (reported) fee (from Barca and Madrid) is now a clear establishment for both the club and Luis Suarez, but no club wants to lose its very best players, particularly when they are one of the best in the world. 'But on the other hand neither do you want a player who is going to be suspended if he's got a trait in his character that can't be controlled.' Ouch: Chiellini attempts to show the bite marks to referee Marco Rodriguez . Bite night! Chiellini writhes on the floor after the clash with Suarez . Not fooling anyone: Suarez holds his teeth after appearing to sink them into the shoulder of the Italian . Taylor, though, pointed out that the PFA has been successful in helping players deal with problems regarding mental health, frustration and anger in the past. He added: 'I would suggest we've been successful in about two out of three cases. So the odds would be in favour if that was addressed seriously, but of course Luis needs to accept that and be prepared to undertake that.'","FIFA punishment should have included counselling .

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Twenty-four hours after Luis Suarez hit the headlines for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s 1-0 win over Italy, another Liverpool player was drawing attention to themselves for the wrong reasons. Mamadou Sakho, who has started each of France’s three games at the World Cup so far, should have been dismissed in the eighth minute for elbowing Ecuador’s Oswaldo Minda in the face while jostling for a corner. The centre-back could face retrospective action from Fifa for his stray elbow, with the referee not spotting the incident during the game. Not spotted: Mamadou Sakho elbows Oswaldo Minda in the eighth minute but it went unpunished . Strapped: Sakho's leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark but he was lucky to not leave earlier . Sakho’s heavily-strapped left leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark, with Real Madrid’s Raphael Varane the player that replaced him at the back for Les Bleus. It was a disjointed performance from Didier Deschamps’ side, which was somewhat expected when you consider the 1998 World Cup winner made seven changes to the side that sealed a place in the last 16 by trouncing Switzerland 5-2 in their previous group match. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, a late replacement in the squad for injured Clement Grenier, was living in dreamland as he joined Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba in central midfield. From planning his holidays to making his international debut in a World Cup game at the Maracana - all in the space of a month. He looked comfortable on the ball, especially in the second half when France enjoyed a numerical advantage following Antonio Valencia’s dismissal for an over-the-top challenge on Lucas Digne. Elsewhere Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna provided some brilliant deliveries from the right-hand side, particularly when Premier League target Antoinne Griezmann forced Alexander Rodriguez into a smart stop at his near post and when Pogba nodded wide late on. Dreamland: France and Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) joined the action . Block: Manchester City new boy Bacary Sagna provided brilliant deliveries from the right-hand side . His old Arsenal team-mate Laurent Koscielny started in place of Varane, but was shaky on the rare occasions that the impressive Enner Valencia was able to run at goal for Ecuador. France went into the game having not lost in their last six World Cup games against South American opposition, and that record was not put under threat in Rio as Ecuador struggled to create many chances of note. Their place in the knockout rounds was sealed with a win against Switzerland last time out, but that does not excuse what was an impotent performance at the Maracana. A particularly wild effort from Pogba, under no pressure 40 yards from goal, epitomised their bluntness going forward. Unlucky: Karim Benzema couldn't add to his World Cup tally after two impressive opening games . Karim Benzema, so clinical in the opening two games, failed to add to his tally of three tournament goals, as Rodriguez made a string of impressive saves in the second half. The Real Madrid man was perhaps fortunate not to be replaced, particularly as Deschamps clearly had one eye on their last 16 clash with Nigeria. Despite going a man down on the hour-mark Ecuador occasionally looked dangerous on the break. Fortunately for France, Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was on hand to spare their blushes in the final minutes, making a decent save from Juan Carlos Paredes’ curling shot. France’s match was bookended by incidents involving Premier League elbows, as Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud clashed with an Ecuador defender late on.

A woman was caught on a hidden camera injecting drugs into her arm in front of two young children in a pram at a public park in Frankston, south east of Melbourne . The mother handed two men something from her bag and they were captured subsequently crouching down preparing a needle. She turned her back on the men and started injecting the needle into her arm in broad daylight.

She handed the men something from her bag and they were captured subsequently crouching down preparing a needle .

She then turned her back on the men and started injecting the needle into her arm in broad daylight . The footage had only previously been shown to members of Victorian Parliament but Frankston Mayor, Darryl Taylor, has now aired the videos publically claiming a lack of support from government and police. 'We've had a very hard fight in convincing not only government but police that there is a problem. That's why council undertook its own covert operation and collected footage,' Mr Taylor told A Current Affair. Mr Taylor commissioned the council to set up the cameras, which captured more than 30 hours of incriminating CCTV video. Another incident captured a man in a nearby park clearly injecting himself in the arm, before he stood up and pushed away a pram . 'The footage that we collected showed drug use within 100m of the current needle exchange and the police station,' Mr Taylor said. The Mayor said Frankston's 'honey pot' drug culture was thriving because not enough was being done by the government or police to regulate pharmacies that can supply methadone.

"By . Aap . A Senate committee has called for a royal commission to investigate Commonwealth Bank financial advisers who lost the savings of clients through dishonest activities. The committee has also criticised the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) over its handling of the scandal, saying the regulator was timid and too willing to accept the bank's assurances that there were no problems. ASIC has conceded that its trust in the bank was misplaced. A senate committee has called for a royal commission into the Commonwealth Bank . The Senate Economics References Committee report on the performance of ASIC, released on Thursday, concludes a year-long investigation into the actions of Australia's corporate watchdog. The report has called for significant strengthening in ASIC powers. Retiring Labor senator Mark Bishop chaired the committee and was damning in his assessment of both ASIC and the Commonwealth Bank over an investigation of Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFPL) advisers between 2006 and 2010. ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft acknowledged the watchdog's shortcomings when it investigated the bank . The bank failed to open its books and fully identify the number of clients affected and those entitled to compensation, he said. And ASIC was too slow to act. 'It has been unresponsive, it hasn't taken reports seriously, it hasn't pursued investigations properly, agreements that have been reached haven't been enforced, it's tale is a tale of woe,' Senator Bishop told ABC TV. ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft did not deny that the watchdog could have done more to investigate the allegations, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. To rectify their 'misplaced' trust in the bank, Mr Medcraft said the commission had introduced new conditions for the bank to keep its right to provide financial services. Commonwealth Bank is now required to review the cases of more than 4,000 clients for compensation. The committee investigated ASIC's slow response to bank whistleblowers who alerted the regulator to suspect conduct by financial advisers that included forging client signatures to facilitate profit-producing product switches. While some of the advisers have been banned from the financial services sector, Senator Bishop said others continue to work for the bank and some have been promoted. The committee said it remained deeply concerned about the integrity and fairness of a compensation process put in place by the Commonwealth Bank and ASIC after the misconduct was revealed. The committee's report said the bank did not open its books during an investigation into allegations of its financial advisers dealing dishonestly . So far, $52 million in compensation has been paid to more than 1,100 customers but the committee said it had little confidence in ASIC's ability to monitor the compensation process and that the Commonwealth's credibility was 'so compromised that responsibility for the compensation process should be taken away from the bank'. In recommending a royal commission, the committee concluded that the seriousness of the misconduct and the need for a broad review of all client files required a powerful inquiry. It also said that 'the CFPL scandal needs to stand as a lesson for the entire financial services sector'. 'Firms should understand that they cannot turn a blind eye to unprincipled employees who do whatever it takes to make profits at the expense of vulnerable investors,' it said. The 550-page report also investigated predatory lending practices by advisers and brokers between 2002 and 2010. In a dissenting report, deputy chairman and Liberal senator David Bushby said he did not support a royal commission as it would be at taxpayer cost without improving understanding of current problems or increasing compensation to victims.","The report criticised the Australian Securities and Investments Commission .

An armed man has surrendered himself to police following a five-hour siege in which he allegedly held a woman and a baby - who is believed to be her child - captive inside a Queensland home. Police were called to a disturbance at a Larkin Court property in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, about 10.30am on Thursday. They then spent the next three to four hours negotiating with a 37-year-old man who was inside the house. Scroll down for video . A man has been arrested by police following a siege in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, on Thursday . He had been holding a baby captive for almost five hours. A woman was also held hostage but she escaped . During this time, police believe a warning shot was fired near the Caboolture woman causing an injury to her ear, Nine News reported. But later the woman was seen escaping and running away from the residence - leaving the child with the man. The Courier Mail reported the woman had blood smeared on her body and was heard yelling: 'He's found me'. The man, who surrendered to police about 3pm, is expected to be charged with a number of offences - including assault occasioning bodily harm, possession of a firearm and deprivation of liberty. A Queensland Police Service spokesman confirmed the woman suffered a laceration to the back of her head. It is believed she was assaulted by the man during her time inside the house. A man was seen emerged from the Larkin Court house about 3pm with the baby he was holding captive . A female police officer is seen taking the baby who was held inside the home away from the scene . Larkin Court was placed in lock down about 12pm and residents were required to remain inside their homes. Footage showed the man walking out of the house, holding the baby and acting erratically before eventually surrendering to police by laying on the ground. A female police officer took the child from the man's grasp while heavily armed police surrounded him in the middle of the deserted suburban street. The Queensland Police spokesman said the woman and child were taken to Caboolture Base Hospital, but the child did not suffer any injuries. The man is yet to be identified and police are still unable to confirm his relationship with the child.

No one has yet come forward to claim the significant sum, believed to be thousands of dollars, found in a bag of clothing donated to a Red Cross store in Coolangatta, Queensland. It has been more than 48 hours since an elderly woman dropped off the bag and told the staff that she would come back to do some shopping on Tuesday morning. An elderly woman has yet to come forward to claim the significant sum of cash that was found in a bag of donated clothes she dropped off to a Red Cross store in Coolangatta on Tuesday morning . But after the woman didn’t return, the staff took the significant sum of cash, which was inside in a small maroon money zip bag, to the Coolangatta police station. The staff, who knew the woman as she had visited the store several times, suspected she was local to the area but were unaware of her name or address. Although Red Cross area manager Michelle Webster could not confirm the amount of cash found, she conceded that it was significant enough to be missed. ‘Fingers crossed that the rightful owner comes forward,’ she told MailOnline. ‘Once our customers leave our doors it’s difficult to get in touch with them.’ Ms Webster did admit it was possible that the money could have been an intentional donation but the Red Cross wouldn’t accept the cash until there was clarification. ‘We need to make sure and check the donatee definitely did want to donate it,’ she said. ‘Whenever we are in doubt we take the valuables to the police.’ Coolangatta Acting Senior Sergeant Steve Quinn said the police were hoping to access CCTV footage from the store, and or the street. ‘No one has come forward yet to claim the money, which was a significant amount,’ he said.

"By . Freya Noble . Community anger at shocking footage showing an Australian Federal Police officer pepper spraying a dog and throwing sticks at it during a raid on a home has seen the officer pulled from frontline duty. Justen Storay, the owner of Laps, a male bull mastiff cross, has filed an official complaint against the Federal Police who conducted the raid on his home in Griffith, a suburb in the Canberra's innner south, in May. Mr Storay was not home at the time of the raid. An ACT Police spokesperson told the MailOnline in a statement they treat 'allegations such as this seriously' and the matter is currently subject to an 'investigation by AFP Professional Standards.' Scroll down for video . A police officer in the ACT has been seen pepper spraying (top left) a dog during a raid on a home in Griffith, Canberra . The statement said it 'does not condone cruelty to animals in any form. All officers are required to report all use of force actions, and the reported use of oleoresin capsicum spray is part of this requirement.' According to The Canberra Times, the police officer has been taken out of the field and placed in a different department until the matter is resolved. Mr Storay's lawyer, Peter Woodhouse, told MailOnline the AFP were 'circling the wagons' and his first contact with AFP Professional Standards unit since they first viewed the footage was on Wednesday - weeks after the footage was released. 'It seems AFP told the RSPCA the capsicum spray didn't hit the dog,' Mr Woodhouse said. 'The only person who would have been able to give that version is the person who did the spraying, and we don't accept what the person is saying.' Mr Woodhouse also revealed that when police were at his client's house they didn't seize anything. 'They were executing a search warrant in relation to as charge of driving dangerously. I don't know what you could possibly find at someones house to prove that.' The dog's owner is concerned that the attack may have long-term effects on his family pet, who has been 'standoffish' with a different temperament since the incident, the lawyer said. The video shows a plain clothes officer in the backyard of a house in Griffith, Canberra standing some distance from the dog. The officer pretends to bark at the dog, which then appears to bark back at him before running toward the officer, but stops well short of the officer because he in on a chain. Further along in the footage the officer can be seen heading towards the dog who has run out of the shot after being sprayed . The officer runs backwards before pulling out what has been determined to be his pepper spray. He moves back towards the animal, sprays his can in the dog's direction, who then runs out of view of the camera. Pepper spray is a chemical which causes a deep burning sensation in the eyes. Minutes later footage shows two more officers can be seen in the yard, one in plain clothes and one in uniform. The officer who sprayed the dog can be seen motioning in its direction off-screen. Later, he picks up a stick and hurls it what is believed to be in the direction of the animal, which is still not in view of the camera. The officer is now part of an internal investigation after he was also caught throwing a stick (top left) in the dog's direction . According to dog owner Justen Storay's lawyer Peter Woodhouse, the animal has been behaving differently since the incident .","CCTV footage shows a pet dog being pepper sprayed during a home raid .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A man is suing the legal team behind his failed MMR compensation bid - alleging the lawyers pursued a 'hopeless' claim while making millions in legal aid. Matthew McCafferty, 23, of Falkirk, Scotland, developed autism three years after being injected with the vaccine. However, the claim was subsequently dropped after flawed research suggesting there was a link between the jab and autism was discredited. He and his family are now taking legal action against Hodge Jones & Allen solicitors saying the case they raised was issued out of time, raised false hopes and had no chance of succeeding. A man is suing his former legal team from Hodge Jones Allen, pictured, for pursuing a 'hopeless' MMR compensation bid. He says the firm's lawyers issued the claim out of time and raised false hopes of his family receiving payment . Mr McCafferty also alleges the firm litigated 'a hopeless claim funded by legal aid' by which they profited. The family are expected to ask for £50,000 in compensation, it was reported today. The firm - which was established by Sir Henry Egar Garfield Hodge, the late husband of Labour MP Margaret Hodge - denies it was negligent. According to his current firm, Mr McCafferty is the first to instruct action - but they have been in contact with several other families believing they too are entitled to compensation. Thousands of families had instructed legal action following Andrew Wakefield's 1998 research claiming there was a link between MMR and autism came to light. However, by 2001 concerns over the research had surfaced - with the doctor resigning from the Royal Free Hospital that year saying his 'research was unpopular.' By 2003, the research, which was published in The Lancet, was widely discredited. As legal aid was subsequently withdrawn, a majority of claims were dropped. Wakefield was eventually struck off the British Medical Register in 2010. The group action is thought to have raised a £15 million legal aid bill - £9.7 million of which is believed to have gone to solicitors and barristers. Michael Shaw, Mr McCafferty's lawyer of Carter Moore solicitors in Manchester, said today: 'Serious professional obligations rest on both solicitors and counsel who act in legally-aided cases to ensure that the Legal Services Commission is kept informed of the state of the case, and that unmeritorious cases do not continue to receive support. 'Litigation and legal liability depend on evidence - not belief, assumption, hope, or wishful thinking. 'There has not been peer reviewed published evidence to support the hypothesis that MMR vaccine causes autism - the published evidence refutes the link. 'The MMR litigation has cost millions in legal aid for lawyers and experts - but not a penny has been obtained in compensation for any claimant.' Mr . McCafferty is seeking damages to 'include compensation, . distress, expense and inconvenience of engaging in hopeless litigation.' The firm was part set up by Henry Hodge - the late husband of Labour MP Margaret Hodge (both pictured) The firm denies it was negligent in the issuing of proceedings or the timing of the case. A spokesperson for Hodge Jones & Allen said: 'The suggestion that Hodge Jones & Allen would knowingly run a hopeless case is nonsense and completely contrary to our principles and ethics. 'The MMR case was typical of many group litigation cases which were funded by legal aid at that time. Allegations were made that the MMR vaccine caused autism and other conditions. The link was supported by Dr Andrew Wakefield who was the expert retained on the case. 'In such cases where the merits of the case were not clear cut, the Legal Aid Board would typically fund the case for generic investigations to be carried out by specialist solicitors (and members of the Multi Party Actions panel) subject to approved cost limits and regular reports on progress. 'Legal aid was therefore granted for the MMR case to be investigated. The certificate was initially granted to Dawbarns of Kings Lynn. The conducting solicitor Richard Barr moved to our firm in April 1998 and the certificate was transferred to Hodge Jones & Allen. 'Richard Barr then moved on to Alexander Harris and the MMR certificate was transferred to them in June 1999.  We had no further role in the generic investigations after this date. Eventually, the Legal Aid Board decided to withdraw funding. Firm evidence on causation was not forthcoming and the cost risks were considered to be too high. You will be aware that Andrew Wakefield was discredited and eventually struck off by the GMC. 'In the case of McCafferty, we issued proceedings to protect his claim as there is a 10 year limitation period. This is a normal precaution. We do not accept that the case was issued out of time. However, whether or not it was issued out time is irrelevant as it was eventually decided that the case could not be sustained due to lack of causation evidence and funding was withdrawn. Thousands of families had their compensation bids stopped after research by Andrew Wakefield, pictured, suggesting a link between MMR and autism, was discredited . 'No new evidence has come to light since which supports any link between the MMR vaccine and autism . Therefore, Mr McCafferty has not lost the chance of winning compensation for the administration of the vaccine, because we now know that the claim could not succeed. 'To suggest that we took legal aid funds to investigate the case knowing it was hopeless in 1998 and 1999 is completely untrue. At the time, the merits of the case were not clear. A link between the vaccine and autism was strongly asserted by the families and Dr Wakefield and in view of the large number of cases and the seriousness of the condition, it was right for investigations to be carried out. The Legal Aid Board were happy to fund these investigations .' Today, Mr McCafferty's mother Iris Porter described how her son is now 'severely autistic' and lives life to a strictly regimented routine. The 56-year-old said the family had been put under an immense amount of stress after discovering they may not get compensation. She said: 'It has been really, really stressful and to find out that even if it had been successful we might not have got compensation. 'Finding out Matthew had autism was really hard - we were just devastated. But getting a diagnosis was a relief, I felt like it was my fault. 'We put our trust in those lawyers, that they were going to do the right thing and we put our life into their hands. 'They made us think there was a case to fight and that we could win, there were so many people who joined the action, they made us think we stood a chance. 'It was a hard time and I want justice for Matthew, he was a happy healthy baby and then his life suddenly changed. 'I can't work because I'm Matthew's carer, after he left school he went to stay in a transition placement - they didn't want him to come home because they felt he was used to being in that environment. 'But it was really hard having my child away from me - it broke my heart. He eventually came home after he was hurt by another service user, it was really hard for me.  I would walk down to work everyday and burst into tears. 'And it's hard because I know I won't be here forever and that is one of my biggest worries - what happens to him when I'm not here.' In 1998, a medical paper was published in The Lancet. In it, it was claimed that colitis and autism spectrum disorders could be caused by the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The research led to a significant drop in young people getting the vaccine - leading to an increase in all three medical conditions. According to statistics released by the Health Protection Agency, the . percentage of MMR uptake in the UK fell from 88.3 per cent in 1998 to a . low of 79.9 per cent in 2003. Group action - called the MMR Litigation - had its status as group action granted in 1999. Six years later, in 2007, the High Court judge Justice Keith stopped the group action following the withdrawal of legal aid by the legal services commission. All but two claims were discontinued. A pressure group called JABS (Justice, Awareness, Basic Support) was established to represent families wishing to pursue compensation. £15 million in public legal aid funding was spent on the litigation, of which £9.7 million went to solicitors and barristers, and £4.3 million to expert witnesses. In following years, numerous troubling facts were revealed about the investigation. The Sunday Times reported that Andrew Wakefield had manipulated figures and had several conflicts of interest in the research. It was in part retracted in 2004 - with a full retraction instated in 2010. Wakefield was also struck off the medical register that year.","Matthew McCafferty, 23, developed autism three years after having MMR jab .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From battle wounds to medical complaints, skeletons can reveal many secrets about someone’s daily life. Now, a Bronze Age skull discovered in Siberia that has a host of interesting features has been found to have a rare dental anomaly. Using cutting-edge methods, scientists revealed that the owner of the skeleton had a rare case of agenesis, meaning his two central bottom teeth never formed - and it is the first example of this anomaly found in ancient people. Unusual: A Bronze Age skull (pictured) discovered in Siberia with interesting features has been found to have a rare dental anomaly as well as the tip of an arrowhead embedded in his face . The genetic trait is so rare it only affects 0.5 per cent of people, according to experts. The people of the Baikal region, to which the skeleton belongs, buried their relatives in formal graves, unlike most other societies during the Bronze Age. Their practices give archaeologists a better look into the past, some 4,000 years ago, Canadian Light Source reported. The skeleton was discovered in a cemetery northwest of Lake Baikal along with four arrowheads, one of which was found in an eye socket. Experts used radiocarbon dating to establish that the remains belong to a 35- to 40-year-old male living in the early Bronze Age, between 4,360 and 3,935 years ago. Using cutting-edge methods, scientists found that the owner of the skeleton had a rare case of agenesis so that his two central bottom teeth never formed (pictured) Located: The skeleton was discovered in a cemetery northwest of Lake Baikal in Siberia (mapped) along with a disk and four arrowheads, one of which was found in an eye socket . An iron tooth implant fitted 2,300 years ago could be earliest false tooth ever found in Western Europe, it was reported last month . The dental implant was discovered in the timber burial chamber of an Iron Age woman who died in her twenties in Le Chene, northern France. Archaeologists believe the false tooth was added to improve the appearance of the corpse as the procedure would have been too painful to endure while alive. The implant came in the form of an iron pin found in place of an upper incisor tooth, from which a false tooth would have been attached. Scientists believe the iron spike was pounded into the pulp canal of nerves and blood vessels to make sure it stayed in place. The procedure would have been excruciating had the lady been alive when it was performed. Iron corrodes inside the body, and one theory is that the lack of sterile conditions may have led to an infection that ended the young lady’s life. Another possible scenario is that the dental implant was fitted after her death for aesthetic reasons. Bioarchaeologist Angela Lieverse from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, has been familiar with the unusual skull for a decade when she noted its missing teeth, as well as a stone arrowhead embedded in the area below the place the teeth should be. ‘We knew there was a projectile, we could see it, but we didn't know if it occurred years before the individual died or if it happened around the same time as his death,’ she said. ‘I suspected it happened earlier and had something to do with the very unusual missing teeth.’ Using powerful X-rays to examine the specimen at the university, a team of scientists were able to reconstruct the fragment of the arrowhead in the jaw, using imaging techniques. ‘We discovered that the missing teeth had nothing to do with the projectile,’ Dr Lieverse said. The experts discovered that the man had agenesis, where the two central incisors do not form. The specimen is the only example ever documented by archaeologists to feature this genetic dental abnormality. During scans, the researchers also solved the mystery of the embedded arrow tip. Dr Lieverse believes the projectile is a piece of the one also found in the eye socket, suggesting it was probably removed from the man’s face during a fight, or at burial. Interestingly, there is very little history of violence in the region at that time – with only two more skeletons bearing evidence of fights – but ‘a projectile fired into somebody’s face is probably not an accident,’ Dr Lieverse said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Crude contraptions using mirrors to see round corners have been used for centuries as spying devices, as well as at war. But now scientists have developed a camera system that lets users see round corners using laser light. By tracking diffusely reflected light, the invention reconstructs the shape of objects outside of the field of view. Lights, camera, action! Computer scientists have developed a camera system (pictured) that that lets users see round corners without using a mirror. Using diffusely reflected light from a laser, it reconstructs the shape of objects outside of the field of view . Researchers at the University of Bonn and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, came up with the array of devices. A laser is shone on a surface, such as a wall, and serves as a source of scattered light, as well as the source of information. In a demonstration, a laser is shown shining on a white wall, while a camera watches the scene. All it can see initially through the lens is a ‘spot’ of light. A computer records the image and the data is processed so the outlines of an object gradually appear on a screen - but it is behind a partition, proving that the camera can see round corners. Matthias Hullin, of the University of Bonn, explained: ‘This is an actual reconstruction from diffusely scattered light. Our camera, combined with a mathematical procedure, enables us to virtually transform this wall into a mirror.’ This graphic shows the set-up of the equipment. The light source (red) and camera (field of view marked in blue) both look at a white wall. The objects the experts want to reconstruct (green box) are hidden and are only accessible through indirect reflections off the diffuse wall . The laser 'dot' on the wall is a source of scattered light, some of which falls back onto the wall and into the camera. ‘We are recording a kind of light echo, that is, time-resolved data, from which we can reconstruct the object,’ he said. ‘Part of the light has also come into contact with the unknown object and it thus brings valuable information with it about its shape and appearance.’ To be able to measure such echoes, a special camera system is required, which the team developed. In a demonstration, a laser was shown shining on a white wall, while a camera watched the scene. All it could see initially through the lens was a 'spot' of light. These large cardboard letters were hidden out of the cameras' field of view in the experiment . The computer recorded the image and the data was processed so the outlines of the hidden object gradually appeared on a screen, proving that the camera can see round corners. The reconstruction of the cardboard letters is shown . Unlike conventional cameras, it records not just the direction from which the light is coming, but also how long it took the light to get from the source to the camera. This technology is nothing new in itself, as such image sensors are found in depth image cameras used in video game controllers. The scientists said the challenge was extracting the information needed from time-of-flight measurements. Professor Hullin compared the situation to a room which reverberates so greatly that someone can no longer have a conversation with another person. The new camera system lets people see round corners without using a mirror, like a traditional periscope (pictured) ‘In principle, we are measuring nothing other than the sum of numerous light reflections which reached the camera through many different paths and which are superimposed on each other on the image sensor,’ he said. This problem, known as multipath interference, has been baffling engineers for a long time. Traditionally, they would attempt to remove the undesired multipath scatter and only use the direct portion of the signal. Based on an advanced mathematical model, the computer scientists developed a method that can obtain the desired information exclusively from what would usually be considered noise rather than signal. Since multipath light also originates from objects which are not at all in the field of view, the researchers can make visible what is virtually invisible. ‘The accuracy of our method has its limits, of course,’ Professor Hullin admitted, as images of what is around a corner are only shown as rough outlines. But the scientists hope that higher resolution images will be possible soon. They will  report on their research at the international Conference for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) taking place next week in Columbus, Ohio.","Computer scientists at University of Bonn developed the camera system .

"By . Mark Prigg . It has become the latest must-have app, and raised over $1m in funding - despite being described as pointless. However, Yo - which lets you send just that word to friends - has been hacked, with students claiming they can extract the phone number of any user. The app's makers admit the flaw is real - and say they are 'still working' on fixing it. An app called Yo (logo pictured) is currently taking the internet by storm. Since launching in April it has amassed 50,000 users and has apparently been given $1 million in funding. The app is available to download for free on both iOS and Android and lets users send the word yo to others - and nothing else . The 'Yo' app can be downloaded from the iTunes store or Google Play for free. When the app is loaded up users are asked to pick a username. Friends can then be invited to the app by text, Facebook or Twitter. When a friend's username is added, tapping on it will send them a yo. They will then receive a notification saying they have received a yo - and that's it. An additional feature involves adding the user 'WORLDCUP', which will then send you a yo every time a goal is scored in the 2014 Brazil World Cup. But you won't know who scored without checking up elsewhere. Other functionality is promised for the app in the future. TechCrunch said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app. 'We can get any Yo user's phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back),' the students said. 'We can spoof yos from any users, and we can spam any user... We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that).' Other developers have been able to recreate the flaw. Others have claimed there are other problems - one even managing to send Yos pretending to be SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk. In just over two months it has gained £590,000 ($1 million) in funding and now has a growing userbase of about 50,000. According to the Financial Times the app took just eight hours to build but is quickly proving a hit with its ‘single-tap zero character communication tool.’ Or Arbel, the app's creator. told TechCrunch he was dealing with the issue, but would not elaborate further.'Some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on,' he said, adding that he had hired a specialist security team. 'We are taking this very seriously.' Similar problems have hit apps such as Snapchat and Tinder in the past few months. The firm boasts that it takes 11 taps to send the word ‘yo’ on a rival messaging service like WhatsApp compared to just two on their app. When the app is first installed you will be asked to pick a username. You can then add the names of friends to send them a yo (left). When a yo is sent the recipient will receive a notification that they have received it (right), and nothing else. The company says it is a ‘single-tap zero character communication tool' Some of the tongue-in-cheek reviews on the iTunes store were quick to eschew the apparent qualities of the app. ‘Since downloading Yo, all my relationships have improved and I've regrown most of my hair,’ said one reviewer. ‘Receiving a yo is fast becoming the highlight of my day,’ added another on the Google Play store. ‘So much mystery! Why is this person yo-ing me? Should I respond?’ The initial $1 million for the app was supplied by investors associated with Moshe Hogeg, a CEO involved in a social network called Mobli. Whether the app continues to wide its wave of success remains to be seen.","San Francisco company's app Yo is available free on iOS and Android .

'This . hasn't made me reluctant to breastfeed in public and if I go back to . the pool I will still breastfeed there, but some women would have been . put off by being treated like this.' The . manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes . breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in . the pool. But the . mother said: 'It is irrelevant whether I was in the water or not because . that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with. 'She didn't mention health and safety issues, she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding.' Family: Ms Howes, a midwife, with her daughter Connie and her mother Virginia Howes, also a midwife . Miss Howes's mother Virginia, who also works as a midwife, accused the centre of discriminating against nursing mothers. 'It is discrimination to ask a woman to move on account of the fact she is breastfeeding,' she said. 'The word offensive was used several times both at the Stour Centre and when my daughter spoke to a member of staff on the phone afterwards. Should mothers be allowed to breastfeed in swimming pools? 'It's 2013, for goodness' sake - you see more body walking around the streets! My daughter is very discreet. I want a public apology and assurance that the Stour Centre has a policy in place to protect breastfeeding mothers - not discriminate against them.' Stour Centre manager Kim Walters said: 'At the centre we have regular users who breastfeed in the cafe, so breastfeeding is widely accepted. 'This is the first time breastfeeding has taken place in the pool environment and I stress that the only reason the mother was asked to move was purely down to the feed taking place in the water. 'We have apologised to the mother involved if some unfortunate words were used in conversation and will ensure all staff are fully aware and trained accordingly.' Ms Howes said she would go to the side of the pool after being told that the lifeguard was 'offended', but the manager instead requested that she finish the feed in the changing room . The manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in the pool . Apology: Bosses at the Stour Centre in Ashford have said sorry to Ms Howes for the incident last Saturday . Emma Wood, chief executive of Ashford Leisure Trust which runs the centre, has now apologised to Ms Howes and claims the company supports the right to breastfeed. 'Ashford Leisure Trust fully supports breastfeeding at all its sites and understands the legal rights of mothers to do this,' she said. 'On this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - i.e. feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water, and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested. 'We do of course apologise for any upset caused. The staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby. It may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation, but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother.'","Sophie Howes, 27, was swimming with eight-month-old Connie in Ashford .

"By . Lydia Warren . A bride-to-be has been killed in a car crash as she drove to her bachelorette party. Collette Moreno, a 26-year-old mother-of-one, was being driven to Lake Ozark, Missouri by her best friend on Friday afternoon when they tried to overtake a truck but were hit by an oncoming vehicle. She later died from her injuries. Moreno's fiance, Jesse Arcobasso, sobbed as he spoke about his loss just four weeks ahead of their wedding date, and revealed her five-year-old son can't yet comprehend where his mommy is. 'He doesn't quite understand everything just yet,' Arcobasso told KCTV as he was comforted by family members. 'I know it's going to take time.' Scroll down for video . Moments before tragedy: Collette Moreno, left, shared this image of her and best friend Ashley Theobald driving to Lake Ozark on Friday for her bachelorette weekend. Minutes later, they were hit by another car . Loss: Collette Moreno has been killed just four weeks before she was due to marry fiance Jesse Acrobasso . Moreno, . who lived in Kansas City, and her best friend, Ashley Theobald, were . driving on Missouri Highway 5 on their way to a weekend of partying when . the tragedy unfolded. The . bride had shared her excitement on Facebook in the hours before - . uploading a photo showing her drinking wine to mark the start of the . weekend and sharing a selfie of her and Theobald on the road just . minutes ahead of the crash. Speaking . to KCTV, Theobald said that Moreno had started suffering from an asthma . attack as they trailed a truck with heavy exhaust fumes, so she had . attempted to get past it on the two-lane road. 'We both thought it was clear and there . was a hill that neither one of us saw,' she said through tears. 'I . tried to go around and there was a truck coming and I swerved and he . swerved with me.' Joy: Ahead of the crash, Moreno shared this photo, left, showing her starting the bachelorette weekend celebrations with a glass of wine. She is also pictured right at her bridal shower three weeks ago . Loved: Moreno, an office assistant for a doctor, leaves behind her fiance, pictured, and a five-year-old son . Theobold, driving a 2013 Chevy Malibu, saw the oncoming 1999 Dodge Ram, driven by 25-year-old Melvin E. Garber, as it crested the hill and both drivers swerved to avoid colliding. But the Dodge struck the passenger side of . the women's car, which then hurtled off the left side of the road. The Ram traveled on the right side of the road and crashed, and both cars were totaled. Theobald and Garber both suffered minor injuries, and when Theobald spoke to Moreno - who had been wearing a seatbelt - she was conscious but not responding. 'I was talking to her. She couldn’t talk . back but she was nodding at me,' Theobald told Fox3. 'I didn't know it was . as bad as it was because she wasn't physically super beaten-up.' The women . were taken to University Hospital in Columbia, where Moreno was . pronounced dead from her injuries at 5.30pm, three hours after the . crash. Devastated: Her fiance, Jesse Arcobasso, sobs about his loss as he is comforted by family members . Overwhelmed: Theobald said she thought her best friend was OK because she did not look hurt . As soon as Arcobasso, 28, learned about the accident, he headed to the hospital. 'I was just trying to hold on to the fact that she was going to be okay,' he said. The Missouri Highway Patrol has said Theobald will face no charges. Moreno's death has left her family, friends and fiance devastated. The pair, who became engaged last year, were due to get married on July 26 in Jamaica. Her son Braden, who lived with Moreno and Arcobasso, has also been left without a mother. His father lives in the Kansas City area. Friends have set up a fundraising page to help raise money for Moreno's funeral and for her family - most of whom live in California - to travel to Missouri.","Collette Moreno was a passenger in a car driven by her best friend, Ashley Theobald, as they headed to Lake Ozark, Missouri on Friday .

"By . Lydia Warren . A father whose wife succumbed to cancer before she could meet their daughter, who was being carried by a surrogate, has revealed Hollywood execs approached him to make a film about their lives - but he turned them away. Nate Yoho's heart-wrenching story hit headlines across the world after his daughter Caralyn was born on November 26 last year, four month's after the death of her mother, Laura, on July 23. But when Yoho, from Des Moines, Iowa, got a call from someone wanting to make a movie about their lives, he passed it up. 'I just need the time to live my life,' he told the De Moines Register of his decision. 'It was very strange. People were telling us how touched and . inspired they were by this story, and I realized they were talking about . my life. It was strange. I needed to get some distance from that.' Together: Nate Yoho holds his daughter Caralyn, who was born 4 months after her mother died . Now he is focusing on moving forward with his six-month-old daughter, who was carried by Laura's best friend in the ultimate show of friendship. After his wife's death, the 31-year-old dad started a home training business and has now set up his own gym, CrossFit in Des Moines. On Saturday, he'll take part in the Head for the Cure 5K on Sunday to raise money for brain cancer research and treatment. 'It's . a way to keep Laura's memory alive,' Yoho said. 'She was the runner . in the family. Brain cancer is the deadliest cancer, but it's so . underfunded. If I can do a little bit to help with that, I'm happy.' Loss: Nate is pictured with his wife Laura, who passed away last year after battling a brain tumor . Gift: Best friend Kara Stetson, right, offered to carry the Yohos' baby. They are pictured on their wedding day . Yoho met Laura Brammeier, a personal trainer, in 2007 at Aspen Athletic Club on Merle Hay Road. The couple, who shared a passion for fitness, fast fell in love and in 2010, he proposed to her - at the end of a run. Laura, 20, first learned that she had brain tumors after passing out at a gym in 2010, a few weeks after the couple got engaged. Originally doctors thought she had suffered a stroke, but as the symptoms persisted the couple sought a second opinion. She was diagnosed with a brain tumor and even when they were removed in surgery, they returned. But she never showed any signs of giving up, and the couple wed in 2011. Laura had eggs frozen before starting . treatment and, when the couple decided they were ready for a baby, her . best friend Kara Stetson offered to act as a surrogate. Missed: Laura was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor in 2010 after she fainted at the gym . Kara previously said: 'I just felt so happy that there was something I could do for her family and his family, and selfishly for me, to keep a part of Laura alive on this Earth. 'Laura and I are very close so I think it came easy to both of us, the idea.' Laura died, peacefully, shortly after having her baby shower. Four months later, Caralyn was born and Nate stayed with Kara's family for a few days as he settled into his role as a dad. 'Caralyn's birth was certainly up and down,' he told the Des Moines Register. 'I wish my wife was here but the joy of having [Caralyn] here, I know she wouldn't want me to be sad.' While still grieving for his wife, Nate said he was able to look forward, thanks to his daughter. 'Part of it's having a little bit of my wife back ... I can see her when my daughter smiles,' he said.","Nate Yoho welcomed his daughter Caralyn in November - four months after he lost his wife, Laura, to a brain tumor .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kristy Richardson, 38, told staff three times that she needed a gluten-free tagliatelle but was unknowingly served regular pasta and suffered a 'nasty reaction', a court heard . Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's restaurant chain has been fined after staff served the wrong kind of pasta to a woman with a severe food allergy. Mother Kristy Richardson, 38, who has coeliac disease, which means she is unable to digest gluten, suffered a 'nasty reaction' after being served regular pasta. She was violently sick for around five hours after the meal in Portsmouth, Hants, which she had been enjoying with her husband on their wedding anniversary. A court heard how she told staff three times she needed a gluten-free tagliatelle but in a terrible 'misunderstanding', she was unknowingly served regular pasta. Mrs Richardson also suffers from an illness that means she needs a heart and lung transplant. The sickness meant she was temporarily removed from the register. A judge today fined the famous eaterie £8,000 for breaching food safety laws and ordered it to pay £9,212 costs. The chain serves an estimated five million diners a year. Prosecutor . Malcolm Gibney, for Portsmouth City Council Trading Standards, said: . 'Mrs Richardson and her husband attended for lunch for their wedding . anniversary with the intention of having an enjoyable meal. 'Mrs Richardson was diagnosed as a coeliac sufferer at the age of 19 and is very conscious of her diet. 'She . wanted to check that the restaurant could serve a gluten free meal and . she suffers from a number of other illnesses so wanted to ensure the . staff knew what her needs were. 'She spoke to the maitre d' and was assured that gluten free pasta could be provided, so an order was placed and consumed. 'But within a couple of hours Mrs Richardson started to feel nauseous and continued to vomit over the next four or five hours. 'As a result she suffered a very nasty reaction and an auto-immune response to other medication she had.' A telephone call to the restaurant revealed that she had been served wheat pasta, despite telling three staff members she must have a gluten-free dish. Environmental health experts swooped on the premises and an investigation was launched, revealing 'lamentable failures' over food allergy issues. A judge has fined Jamie's Italian £8,000 for breaching food safety laws and ordered it to pay £9,212 costs . At first, the company suggested there had been a 'mix up' when Mrs Richardson gave a waitress her order on November 17, 2011. A legal battle followed, but the firm . last month pleaded guilty to selling food not of the nature, substance . or quality demanded by a purchaser. The offence is a breach of the Food Safety Act 1990. Jamie's . Italian failed to exercise due diligence and take all appropriate . precautions that meals were served as requested, it was heard. New procedures and extra training have now been introduced. Harry Vann, mitigating, said Mrs Richardson's waitress thought she . ordered a vegetarian, rather than gluten-free and vegetarian option. Mr Vann said: 'Jamie's Italian sincerely apologises that it has fallen short of its food safety obligations. 'It . takes this extremely seriously. It is a matter of very sincere regret . to the company that any customer should suffer illness as a result of . any meal served by us. Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurant chain was fined after serving the wrong kind of pasta to Kristy Richardson, a coeliac . 'The failure to provide to a customer what was ordered is made out and the company fully and frankly accepts that.' A . 'specific allergy' button has since been added to the machine waiting . staff use to place orders, Mr Vann told Fareham Magistrates Court. This addition meant there is now 'no way' an allergy could be missed by kitchen staff, he added. District Judge Anthony Calloway said: 'Mrs Richardson's victim impact statement sets out the difficulties that affect her. 'I accept that the root cause of the incident was a misunderstanding between staff. No system could be immune to the misunderstanding which happened in this case and the company is fitting that due diligence. 'Its food safety systems fell short of expectations in this particular case and the company have apologised to Mrs Richardson and taken steps to adjust and tighten their operation.' He ordered Jamie's Italian Limited to pay an £8,000 fine plus £9,212 costs. The first Jamie's Italian restaurant, a business venture between Jamie and his old friend Gennaro Contaldo, opened in Oxford in June 2008. Their goal was to use fresh, locally sourced ingredients and show British diners 'the passionate, humble and sociable attitude of Italians towards food'. It soon spread across the country, with eateries in London's Canary Wharf, Brighton, Bath, Cardiff, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool and Glasgow. In 2011, the chain opened its first restaurant overseas in Dubai. There are now more than 30 worldwide. Alan Cufley, head of service for environmental health at Portsmouth City Council, said: ""Having a meal out should be an enjoyable experience where you expect to receive the food you ordered. 'This is incredibly important if you have a diet-related condition, as this case highlights. 'Anywhere that sells or prepares food, regardless of size, has to follow food safety legislation and we must take action against those that put customers' health at risk. 'I'm pleased to say Jamie's Italian have accepted their responsibilities in this case and have now improved procedures for special dietary requests.' Mrs Richardson is on the organ donor register for a double lung transplant, and at the time of the meal was on the heart transplant list, after developing pulmonary hypertension - a potentially life threatening condition - during pregnancy. A friend, who did not want to be named, said: 'This was only the second time that Kristy had been out with her husband since giving birth. 'It was an awful time for them, with Kristy being told she had a terminal illness and having to look after a baby. 'They wanted to have a quiet meal to celebrate after a tough couple of years and it all went wrong.'Mrs Richardson had given birth to her daughter, Eleanor, in December 2009. Eleanor was 10 weeks premature and was delivered by caesarean. With Eleanor in childcare, the couple had taken a rare moment to relax with a meal and a cinema visit. The friend said: 'Kristy had been so ill. She has been a coeliac since her teens so she knew not to eat pasta. 'She asked three times for non-gluten free pasta and they served it her anyway.' Mrs Richardson refused to speak because of a legal agreement drawn up as part of her out of court settlement with Jamie's Italian. This figure was not discussed in court but was taken into account by the judge.","Kristy Richardson, a coeliac, told staff she needed gluten-free pasta .

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft has finally fixed a disastrous bug in its Internet Explorer web browser so severe the U.S. Department of Homeland Security advised computer users to abandon the software. Adrienne Hall, general manager of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing, said in a statement that the company decided to fix the problem quickly for all customers, saying it takes the security of its products 'incredibly seriously.' The firm also decided to issue a fix for users of Windows XP, even though it officially no longer supports the software. Scroll down for video . Clean-up: Microsoft is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend . Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug, which targets Internet Explorer versions 9 through 11. Those versions take up 26.25 percent of the browser market, according to FireEye, the cybersecurity software company that caught the bug. The bug, however, reportedly affects versions 6 through 11. Together, those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare. In addition to possibly switching to an alternative web browser, US-CERT advised businesses to consider using a free Microsoft security tool known as EMET, or the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, to thwart potential attacks. Security experts say EMET is helpful in staving off attacks, but businesses are sometimes reluctant to use it because it can cause systems to crash due to incompatibility with some software programs. Microsoft first reported the problem on Saturday, saying it was aware of 'limited, targeted attacks' and that the vulnerability affected Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11. The company said users with automatic updates enabled don't need to take any action. 'For those manually updating, we strongly encourage you to apply this update as quickly as possible following the directions in the released security bulletin,' it said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has advised computer users to abandon Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser until the company fixes a security flaw that hackers have used to launch attacks. The bug is the first high-profile security flaw to emerge since Microsoft stopped providing security updates for Windows XP earlier this month. That means PCs running the 13-year old operating system could remain unprotected against hackers seeking to exploit the newly uncovered flaw, even after Microsoft figures out how to defend against it. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a part of Homeland Security known as US-CERT, said in an advisory released on Monday morning that the vulnerability in versions 6 to 11 of Internet Explorer could lead to 'the complete compromise' of an affected system. 'We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,' Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute warned in a separate advisory, that US-CERT linked to in its warning. Microsoft Corp is rushing to fix the bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies. Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug, which targets Internet Explorer versions 9 through 11. Those versions take up 26.25 percent of the browser market, according to FireEye, the cybersecurity software company that caught the bug. The bug reportedly affects versions 6 through 11 of Internet Explorer . The bug, however, reportedly affects versions 6 through 11. Together, those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare. PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP. FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed 'Operation Clandestine Fox.' FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active. It described the hackers as 'extremely proficient at lateral movement' and 'difficult to track.' 'It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defense and financial sectors,' FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. 'It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point. It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering.' He declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser. The firm has come under fire for the amount of time it took to issue a fix . Microsoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights. FireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert. Yet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said. 'Microsoft should move fast,' he said. 'This will snowball.' Still, he cautioned that Windows XP users will not benefit from that update since Microsoft has just halted support for that product. The software maker said in a statement to Reuters that it advises Windows XP users to upgrade to one of two most recently versions of its operating system, Windows 7 or 8.","Microsoft first acknowledged bug on Saturday .

"By . Martin Robinson . Legal battle: Dr Mikhail Gryaznevich claimed he was fired by the government because his research offered a solution to end global warming. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority settled out of court . A scientist working on a new power source has agreed an out-of-court settlement with Britain's atomic agency after claiming they sacked him because his research could halt global warming. Dr Mikhail Gryaznevich believes small fusion machines, known as tokamaks, could be the answer to providing clean and plentiful electricity. But he sued the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) after claiming bosses suppressed his work, bullied him and then sacked him in a bid to discredit him and his work. The agency, who said he was making 'unsupported' claims about his work for financial reasons, settled with him today. The Russian-born physicist had worked for the UKAEA for more than 22 years when he was sacked from his job working at their research facilities near Abingdon, Oxfordshire last year. 'I have an exemplary record as an outstanding fusion scientist and innovator,' he told the tribunal. 'I have tried to do my duty to the UK, giving all my experience and capability to promote the faster way to fusion energy. 'I was invited to come to the UK to do this research which has been hugely successful by any measure and which led directly to the flagship of the UK's own fusion research programme. Now I have been fired for pursuing this research.' He said in late 2012 the chief executive of UKAEA, Professor Steven Cowley, was 'rude and intimidating' towards him at a meeting and accused him of 'wrongdoing'. He said: 'Even worse, it appears that a Professor Cowley was attempting to stop my work because it might reveal the inconvenient truth that research on small tokamaks can help to accelerate the development of the fusion energy as a promising solution to global warming and possible shortage of energy.' 'Fusion energy is likely to bring major global environmental benefits. 'Hence suppressing a promising area of fusion research and deliberately ignoring its potential advantages is likely to cause damage to the environment in future.' Problems arose around three years after Dr Gryaznevich co-founded Tokamak Solutions UK Ltd (TSUK), a commercial venture making small tokamaks with a view to generating electricity in years to come. He said a prior arrangement to allow him to take unpaid leave to attend conferences outside his role for the Authority, a situation apparently supported by Professor Cowley, suddenly changed in late 2012 when he was told there was a conflict of interest. 'I still don't understand what possible potential there is for conflict and I don't know what damage I could have caused to the respondent,' he said. 'I have quite reasonably asked for this information but it has not been given to me.' He was sacked in March last year and told the tribunal he had tried to encourage UK universities to become involved in tokamak research but that Professor Cowley had tried to thwart his efforts and told the universities that the machines did not help fusion research. Long serving: Dr Mikhail Gryaznevich worked for the UKAEA for 22 years, here at its research facility at Culham, Oxfordshire . At the start of the tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire, Hilary Winstone, counsel for UKAEA, challenged the claimant. She said there were doubts over Dr Gryaznevich's scientific theory but that the Authority had allowed him to conduct his work. Miss Winstone argued that in his bid to attract venture capitalists to fund the work, Dr Gryaznevich had made claims about being able to generate electricity 'within ten years'. 'He made the claims for financial gain. He didn't really believe them,' she told the tribunal panel. The tribunal was sensationally halted this afternoon after Dr Gryaznevich and the UKAEA reached an out-of-court settlement over his unfair dismissal claim. The agreement means his claim was withdrawn and the case dismissed. Dr Gryaznevich, 59, from Culham, Oxfordshire, who brought a scale model of the tokamak technology to the tribunal, said: 'It was never about money from the very beginning. We want to succeed with fusion energy. 'We hope in the future that we will be able to work with the UKAEA. We have experiments continuing at Culham laboratory tomorrow.' Dr David Kingham, chief executive of Tokamak Energy, who represented his colleague at the tribunal, added: 'We are great enthusiasts for fusion and we have made a decision to get back to doing that. 'There are great facilities at Culham which we want to work with as and when we can.'","Dr Mikhail Gryaznevich sued the UK Atomic Energy Authority after sacking .
Argued it was because his fusion research found 'solution to global warming'
'I was invited to come to the UK to do this research, which led to the the UK's own fusion programme. Now I've been fired for pursuing this research'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . Insight: Timothy Cannon has lifted the veil on the previously secretive execution process . A top corrections officer has lifted the lid on how Florida carries out its executions - revealing that all officials test the death chamber to ensure it is comfortable for the doomed inmate. Timothy Cannon, the assistant secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections and the team leader present at every execution, spoke out about the previously secretive process as part of a lawsuit involving an inmate who is fighting a new execution drug. The lawsuit has been brought by attorneys for Paul Howell, who is scheduled to die by lethal injection on February 26 for killing a state trooper in 1992. His lawyers argue that the first of the new injected drugs, midazolam, isn't effective at preventing the pain of the subsequent drugs. Cannon told a Leon County court in his testimony that . ahead of executions, each team member 'has to serve in the role of the condemned . during training at some point'. 'We've . changed several aspects of just the comfort level for the inmate while . lying on the gurney,' he said. 'Maybe we put sponges under the hand or . padding under the hands to make it more comfortable, changed the pillow, . the angle of things, just to try to make it a little more comfortable, . more humane and more dignified as we move along.' He then detailed the inmate's final moments from the officers' points of view. Routine: His testimony, which was given as part of a lawsuit against a new execution drug, revealed that they now carry out a new 'consciousness check' to make sure the inmate is not conscious . He said an . inmate is first injected with two syringes of midazolam and a syringe of 'flush' - saline solution to get the drug into the body. Midazolam is a . sedative. Once the three syringes have been administered from an . anonymous team of pharmacists and doctors in a back room, Cannon carries out consciousness checks. Cannon . told a Leon County court that a new inmate 'consciousness check' is . given due to news media reports and other testimony stemming from an . October 15 execution - the root of Howell's suit. Death . row inmate William Happ was the first to receive the new lethal . injection drug trio and an Associated Press reporter noted he acted . differently during the execution than those before him. It appeared Happ remained conscious longer and made more body movements after losing consciousness. Cannon . said that during Happ's execution and the ones that came before it, he . did two 'consciousness checks' based on what he learned at the Federal . Bureau of Prisons in Indiana. Fight: Paul Howell, left, is scheduled to be executed at the end of the month in Florida for killing Trooper Jimmy Fulford, right, with a homemade bomb in 1992. He is fighting the new drug, claiming it takes longer to kill . These . are a 'shake and shout,' where he vigorously shakes the inmate's . shoulders and calls his name loudly, and also strokes the inmate's . eyelashes and eyelid. After . Happ's execution, Cannon said the department decided to institute a . 'trapezoid pinch', where he squeezes the muscle between an inmate's neck . and shoulder. It was added . 'to ensure we were taking every precaution we could possibly do to . ensure the person was, in fact, unconscious,' Cannon said. 'To make sure . that this process was humane and dignified.' During the consciousness checks, the anonymous team of doctors in the back room . watches the inmate's face on a screen, which is captured by a video . camera in the death chamber. The inmate is also hooked up to a heart . monitor, Cannon said. There are two executioners in the back room . - the ones who deploy the drugs - along with an assistant team leader, 3 medical professionals, an independent monitor from the Florida . Department of Law Enforcement and two corrections employees who hold an open line to the governor's office. Put to death: The lawsuit comes after William Happ, left, appeared to stay conscious for longer with the new drug used in executions last year. He was put to death for raping and killing Angie Crowley, right, in 1986 . Protesters: Florida Highway Patrol cars frame protesters rallying against Happ's execution last year . If the team determines that the inmate is unconscious, the other two lethal drugs are administered. But lawyers for Howell say that they are concerned that the midazolam does not produce a deep enough level of unconsciousness to prevent the inmate from feeling the pain of the second and third injection and causes a death that makes the inmate feel as though he is being buried alive. 'Beyond just the fact that Constitution requires a humane death, if we decided that we wanted perpetrators of crime to die in the same way that their victims did then we would rape rapists. And we don't rape rapists,' said Sonya Rudenstine, a Gainesville attorney who represents Howell. 'We should not be engaging of the behavior that we have said to abhor. If we are going to kill people, we have to do it humanely. It's often said the inmate doesn't suffer nearly as much as the victim, and I believe that's what keeps us civilized and humane.' Corrections spokeswoman Jessica Cary said on Wednesday that the department 'remains committed to doing everything it can to ensure a humane and dignified lethal injection process'. Lethal dose: Happ was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride, pictured, and witnesses said he appeared to stay conscious for longer before dying . Cannon's testimony is . notable because it shows that the Department of Corrections has changed . its procedures - namely the consciousness checks - since the state started using a new cocktail of lethal . injection drugs. Howell, the inmate appealing the execution based on the new drug, is scheduled . to die by lethal injection later this month. In 1992, Howell made a bomb intended to kill a woman who could link him to an earlier murder, put it in a microwave, wrapped it like a present and commissioned a friend to drive it to her home. But the friend was stopped for speeding on the way to her house by Trooper Jimmy Fulford, who learned that the car had been loaned by Howell. Officers told him the friend would be taken to custody - and he did not tell them the car was containing a bomb. Fulford was later granted permission to search the car and was holding the package when it exploded, killing him. Howell was charged with the trooper's murder.","Timothy Cannon, who is present at every execution in Florida, has revealed details about executions during a lawsuit against new execution drug .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He is the man behind some of the most famous portrait paintings in history. Yet, ironically, art experts still have relatively little idea what Leonardo da Vinci himself looked like. Because the Renaissance genius left no self-portraits from his youth, academics have been forced to explore their suspicions that he may have placed his image into one of his own masterpieces. Code cracked? Art historian Dr Ross King has presented new evidence which he believes shows that Leonardo da Vinci used his own face for two apostles, Thomas and James the Lesser, in his painting of the Last Supper . Staring them in the face? Dr King references a portrait believed to be of da Vinci in his later years showing him with a Greek nose and flowing hair, much like the two apostles. Thomas is also pointing his finger upwards in the 500-year-old mural, a gesture which Leonardo's contemporaries viewed as a da Vinci trademark . Now one art historian believes he has uncovered new evidence that the great man inserted himself not once, but twice, into his famous mural, The Last Supper. Ross King, the author of the international best-seller Brunelleschi's Dome, makes reference to a poem written in the 1490s, while Leonardo was painting The Last Supper, by his friend Gasparo Visconti. In it, Visconti makes fun of an unnamed artist for putting his image into his works 'however handsome it may be'. Dr King also cites the famous portrait of a man in red chalk, sketched around 1515, which is thought to show Leonardo in his advancing years. He has a Greek nose, flowing hair and a long beard, much like the faces of the apostles Thomas and James the Lesser in the 500-year-old Last Supper. Clues: According to Dr King, the portrait of a man in red chalk (left), believed to depict da Vinci around 1515, has similar features to those shown in the two apostles. Some art experts also believe the Mona Lisa (right) may be a self-portrait . Steeped in history: The Last Supper was painted on an end wall in the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy, for Leonardo's patron Duke Ludovico Sforza and his duchess Beatrice d'Este . Thomas's upturned finger was also considered by contemporaries as a trademark Leonardo gesture. Dr King told the Independent: 'The Last Supper is the only work that no one, either crackpot or academic, has tried to identify as a Leonardo portrait.' Renowned Leonardo scholar Charles Nicholl said: 'Of all the apostles that (Leonardo) would wish to be identified with, I think Doubting Thomas would be top of his list because Leonardo was a great believer in asking questions rather than accepting what people tell you.' The Last Supper was painted on an end wall in the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy, for Leonardo's patron Duke Ludovico Sforza and his duchess Beatrice d'Este. It has faded substantially over time, but underwent a 21-year restoration from the 1970s which sparked considerable controversy because of the subsequent changes in tones and colours. Finding images of Leonardo in his paintings has become a popular pastime with academics, with some even suggesting that the Mona Lisa is in fact a self-portrait in disguise. Bloomsbury Publishing will publish Dr King's latest research in Leonardo And The Last Supper on August 30. It will also feature as BBC 4's Book of the Week at the same time.",Art expert believes Thomas and James the Lesser are self-portraits of Renaissance genius .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bill Clinton has claimed his wife isn't out of touch with ordinary Americans after the former First Lady claimed to have been 'dead broke' when leaving the White House. As the former first couple appeared at an event to talk about the gap between rich and poor on Tuesday, Clinton was forced to defend his wife's recent comments. With Hillary expected to make a 2016 presidential bid, her husband was at pains to point out that the couple understood the economic plight of many families, despite their millions. Defense: After Hillary Clinton's claims that she struggled after leaving the White House, Bill claimed she wasn't out of touch .

The couple appeared on Tuesday at the . annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative America. At the event . the former president said his wife was committed to addressing income . inequality.

'We . had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece . together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's . education. You know, it was not easy.' The Clintons are now the wealthiest living family to have left the White House, with Bill worth an estimated $38 million. Republicans . have seized on Hillary's remarks and her comments in other interviews, . pointing to the millions of dollars the family has earned since the end . of Clinton's presidency. More . than two years before the next presidential election, GOP officials . have sought to undermine Hillary Clinton's standing with working-class . families who have been supportive of the family's political campaigns in . the past. If she runs for . president, Republicans say Mrs Clinton could be vulnerable to charges of . being a Washington insider insulated by private jets and six-figure . speaking fees at a time when many Americans struggle. The . tactic could represent a payback of sorts after Democrats portrayed . Republican Mitt Romney as a plutocrat during the 2012 presidential . campaign. During the . interview, the ex-president told Gregory that his family's . personal wealth was the 'wrong debate' and the focus should be on how . political leaders address 'the central challenge of our time which is . the demise of the American dream'. With . the gap between the rich and poor on the minds of many Americans, Bill . Clinton said most Americans do not resent someone doing well . financially. 'I think they resent it if they're not getting a fair deal,' he said. He . also said the couple visit their local grocery store on weekends like . anyone else. 'We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on,' he said. Hillary Clinton . did not address the debate over the family's wealth at the meeting, but . announced projects to create job opportunities for young people. The initiatives - by companies such as The Gap, JPMorgan Chase and Marriott - train and hire young people. The . project, called Job One, is to help young people age 16-24 who are out . of school and unemployed. Students preparing for the workforce in the . aftermath of the recession have faced persistently high unemployment . levels at rates about twice the national average. 'For . those who don't get a college education or even high school, most doors . just won't open, no matter how hard they knock,'the former first lady . said. A longtime child . advocate, Clinton also announced projects aimed at promoting brain . development and literacy for babies and toddlers. The . event took on the air of a Clinton alumni association, with several . former members of Clinton's White House team in attendance, including . former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Clinton economic . adviser Gene Sperling. Debt: Clinton recently claimed that when she left the White House in 2001 the family were 'dead broke' An . afternoon news conference put Mr Clinton alongside longtime labor . allies such as AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Randi Weingarten, . president of the American Federation of Teachers union. Yet . even in a roomful of Clinton admirers, the debate got spirited at . times. During a panel discussion on economic justice, Mr Clinton and . former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina - an ex-adviser to Romney - . tangled over the merits of raising the minimum wage and the role of . government in the economy. When Fiorina suggested the Obama administration was crushing the coal industry in West Virginia, Clinton interjected. 'Who had the smallest government workforce since Eisenhower? Me. That's right. You declared the era of big government over,' Fiorina said. 'Yeah, but I didn't declare the era of weak government that had nobody at home at the SEC before the financial crisis,' Clinton said to roars of approval, referencing complaints that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to effectively police Wall Street.","Bill was speaking at Clinton Foundation event on income inequality .

"By . Rob Preece . On trial: Bruce Roth is accused of abusing five pupils at two boarding schools where he taught . A former teacher at one of Britain's most prestigious boarding schools sexually abused boys when he crept into their dormitory in the middle of the night, a court heard today. Bruce Roth, 46, is accused of groping three pupils while he was a housemaster at £30,000-a-year Wellington College, in Berkshire, where a biographer of Tony Blair is now the master. Roth is also alleged to have abused two boys at another private school where he worked previously - King's School in Rochester, Kent. Reading Crown Court heard that he performed sex acts on some of the boys and encouraged one child to do the same to him. He was arrested after one of his alleged victims contacted the charity ChildLine. Roth denies 17 counts of sexual offences against children. The court heard that Roth was exonerated of abusing the two King's School pupils years before the alleged offences at Wellington College are said to have taken place. Two complaints were made against the maths teacher after he allegedly sexually touched one boy and repeatedly abused another, both aged between eight and 10, between 1987 and 1994. But the accusations were dropped, the second time following an internal investigation. It is alleged that Roth then went on to abuse the three boys at Wellington College. Daniel Fugallo, prosecuting, told the jury: 'Since the 1980s he has been a teacher and housemaster at important boarding schools and that is of central importance. 'The jobs that he has held relate to the allegations in this case. 'Over a period of 20 years, from the late 1980s through to 2009, he has abused his position of trust as a teacher by touching five boys in his care for his own sexual gratification. 'These boys were at the time these offences took place, say the prosecution, between eight and 15 years old. 'They are now all young men in their late 20s and 30s. 'These men were not friends at school when they were boys and have not become friends after leaving school. 'They were in different years, in fact two of them went to an entirely different school in a different county from the other three.' Prestigious: Roth is alleged to have abused three pupils while he was a housemaster at Wellington College, where annual fees are about £30,000 . The court heard that, during Roth's time at King's School, concerned relatives of two pupils reported him to staff. The first incident involved Roth touching one boy's groin after he suffered a playground injury, the jury was told. After a complaint was made by one of the boy's families, a member of staff at the school asked Roth about the incident and he told them he was teaching the boy how to apply ointment to a rash. The family member was satisfied with this explanation, the court heard. Years later, the alleged victim, then a grown man, contacted Roth on Facebook and asked him if he was a paedophile. Roth replied: 'I don’t remember any such incident, I certainly wouldn’t do anything like that. 'I have always tried my best to look after anyone in my year, I’m not a paedophile.' Well known: Impressionist Rory Bremner (left) is a former pupil at Wellington College, where Anthony Seldon (right), a biographer of Tony Blair, is the Master. Mr Bremner was not at the school when Roth taught there . The boy recalled how Roth would often punish boys by making then strip to their underwear and run laps, or lie on their backs and memorise constellations, the court heard. The second complaint related to a claim that Roth had gone into a boy's dormitory at night. He would sit on the edge of the boy's bed and tell him not to turn over, Mr Fugallo said. Roth would then stroke the boy's chest and put his hands down his pyjamas and touch his genitals, it is alleged. Mr Fugallo said: 'Mr Roth would say things like ""stay there"" and then would leave.' The school held an internal investigation but the matter was dropped after a staff member carrying out the inquiry thought nothing could be proved because it was the teacher's word against the boy's. The court heard that Roth later worked at Wellington College, where Tony Blair's biographer Anthony Seldon is now the master and former pupils include impressionist Rory Bremner. Historic: Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh meet staff at Wellington College in 1959, one of several royal visits to the school . Mr Bremner is not a complainant in the case and was not at the school at the time of the alleged offences. It is alleged that Roth abused Wellington College pupils in their dormitory. One alleged victim reported the matter to ChildLine and later told a school counsellor, which triggered a police investigation. The court heard that Roth was arrested in October 2010 but told police that he had not acted inappropriately and had given the boy no more than a reassuring tap on the shoulder. He also told officers that the boy 'had a sinister side to him' and was a 'fantasist', the jury was told. The court heard that Roth’s computer was analysed by police and it was discovered that he had typed 'teen boy sex' into a search engine. The computer expert also found a number of pictures of young men with their shirts off, as well as pornographic images. When asked about the computer evidence, Roth blamed it on boys 'mucking about' with the machine, the jury was told. Mr Fugallo said: 'The search terms were entered around the hours of midnight and some during August when the school were on holiday.' The trial continues.

"By . Sam Webb . Volte face: Alexandra Swann has expressed doubts over Ukip's increasingly hardline stance on migration and will not campaign for them . A young politician hailed as the 'future face' of Ukip has sensationally announced she will not campaign for the party any longer because of its tough rhetoric on immigration. Alexandra Swann, a former National Deputy Chairman of Conservative Future, defected from the Tories in 2012, claiming the party had lost its core values. Ukip leader Nigel Farage personally announced her defection at Ukip's spring conference in Skegness that year. But now she has expressed doubts over Ukip's increasingly hardline stance on migration. Her political turnaround was unveiled after she told a presenter on Headline London, a current affairs show on TV station London Live, that she didn't want to be introduced as a member of Ukip. 'The focus moved to immigration. It was difficult with the anti-gay marriage stuff. Now so much of their argument is anti-immigration which didn’t sit well with me,' she said. 'I haven’t officially left or fallen out with anyone but I can’t bring myself to campaign for them,' she added, in an interview with The Independent. She added that she feels immigrants should be given or denied residency in the UK based on their skill level, as opposed to their nation of origin. She has not, however, quit the party. The staunch libertarian stood as a Ukip candidate for Farnham North in the Surrey County Council elections last May, but was narrowly defeated by the Tory incumbent, Denise Le Gal, by just 43 votes. A Ukip spokesman would not comment. A statement on her website outlines why she initially quit the Conservatives for Ukip. It says: 'I left the Conservative Party because I no longer believe it is the party of freedom, aspiration, wealth creation and individualism; because I believe Cameron is doing to the Conservative Party what Gladstone did to the Liberals; because UKIP is the only party that promotes the values that originally led me to the Conservatives and because this ""Conservative-led"" government submits to every liberal-left piety imaginable.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) was widely considered to have beaten Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg  in a televised debate earlier this month . Her announcement comes as the party celebrates Farage's victory over Deputy PM Nick Clegg in two televised debates. Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year’s General Election after his success in the televised clashes with Clegg. A poll for The Mail on Sunday in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader is considering standing as an MP in 2015, shows he could easily win. Asked by pollsters Survation if they would vote for Mr Farage as their MP, 33 per cent of people in Folkestone said yes, just three per cent less than those who said they would vote for sitting Conservative MP Damian Collins.","Swann says the party's tougher stance on migrants is not why she joined .

"By . Anthony Bond . Two 'bullying' nurses at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital ordered staff to fake casualty records to meet waiting time targets, a hearing was told today. Sharon Turner and Tracy White falsely logged that patients were discharged earlier than they really were because of targets that required them to be dealt with within four hours, it was said. Any staff who tried to disobey the senior nurses' orders were told that unless they lied, the hospital would get fined and they would get the sack, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Accused: Nurses Tracy White, left, and Sharon Turner, right, who worked at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital ordered staff to fake casualty records to meet waiting time targets, a hearing was told . Employees are said to have regularly sworn in the presence of patients, with Turner allegedly racially abusing a junior Asian doctor by calling him 'Osama's mate' and asking if he had a bomb in his rucksack. Black patients were also sometimes allegedly made to wait longer than those of other ethnicities, the hearing was told. Whistleblower Helene Donnelly has claimed she was 'ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times. She said: 'The demands by Sister White and Sister Turner would appear frequently, during almost every shift. 'Sister Turner and Sister White would . often demand I or my colleagues change the discharge times to avoid a . breach. They would frequently lie about discharge times, and pressurise . members of staff to lie. Whistleblower: Helene Donnelly has claimed she was 'ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times . 'They would speak nastily and swear at people who did not change the times, or would change the times themselves - change the discharge times behind my back. 'I believe everyone in A&E must have been aware of what was going on - even junior doctors. 'It is my opinion senior managers must have known staff were altering discharge times. There were gaps in the paperwork. 'To . me, falsifying patient records seemed insane. I was told, in no . uncertain terms, if we did not meet targets heads would roll. 'I was concerned about the terrible consequences our actions would have on patient care.' She claimed senior nurses 'would use scaremongering tactics to make us comply' with their orders to fake records. 'They would tell us if we had a patient in breach we could lose our jobs.' The . panel heard some patients were inappropriately sent on to other . departments in the hospital without being properly assessed, or even if . A&E staff knew there were no available beds there. Mrs Donnelly said sometimes staff were in such a rush to get patients out of casualty within four hours that staff 'left patients to lie in soiled sheets to meet the targets.' Recounting one occasion where she was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White's handwriting. But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery was hers, the panel heard. 'I realised Sister White would have been happy for me, a junior nurse, to taker the blame for her actions,' said Mrs Donnelly. 'As a result of this, absolutely nothing happened to Sister White in terms of disciplinary action.' Both Turner and White were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008, but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them. Worrying: Nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at Stafford General Hospital if they breached the four-hour limit for treating patients and 'made a spectacle of', it was claimed . During their suspension, Mrs Donnelly said the 'incurred the wrath' of their friends in A&E. Mrs Donnelly said of their return: 'Nothing had been learned other than how to break the rules more subversively.' She said: 'Sister White would deliberately make patients wait.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple suppliers are about to begin mass production of two new iPhones set to be launched in September. It has been rumoured the 4.5 inch version of the handset would launch first, followed a month later by a 5.5inch version. However, now it believed both could be unveiled at the same time. Scroll down for video . Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). 'Apple is ramping up on two bigger devices, said Bloomberg, saying its sources asked not to be identified because the plans are private. 'One model will have a 4.7-inch display, compared to the 4-inch screen of the current iPhone 5s, that may be available to ship to retailers around September, said two of the people. 'A 5.5-inch version is also being prepared for manufacturing and may be available at the same time, the people said.' Hundreds of thousands of new employees have been drafted in by suppliers to meet the expected huge demand. According to a new report from RBC Caputal Markets, 'Overall, our survey suggests that consumer demand foran iPhone 6 is solid.' The firm surveyed 4,000+ consumers, and found many would be swayed towards the iPhone by a bigger screen. '35% of the users who don’t expect to purchase an iPhone would do so should Apple offer a larger form factor,' it said. However, it did find consumer's number one request was better battery life - followed by a bigger screen. It also found people would pay a premium for the big screen. '26% of the consumers are willing to pay a $100 premium for a 5.5"" screen size,' the report claimed. According to RBC Capital Markets, . a quarter of potential iPhone 6 buyers would be willing to pay $100 more for their iPhone to have a 5.5-inch screen over the other rumored size of 4.7 inches. Hon Hai Precision Industry will recruit over 100,000 people in mainland China to produce the newest iPhone from Apple, Taiwan's Economic Daily News reported on Monday, in what the report called the firm's largest single hiring spree in China. Fellow Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp will also expand its workforce in one mainland factory by 30 percent, in response to expected high demand for the new iPhone. The handsets have been plagued by leaks. While numerous images of the 4.7-inch version have been leaked over the past few weeks, until recently details of the 5.5 inch model have remained a mystery. Now, prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). While the photos themselves aren’t groundbreaking, they suggest Apple is already producing components for the larger-sized phones, according to 9 to 5 Mac who first reported the leak, after Dickson tweeted the images. An image last week, also leaked by Dickson, revealed the two new models side-by-side. These latest photos are the first images of the 5.5-inch version's display part. Foxconn, which manufacturers around 70 per cent of the phone, recently hired 100,000 additional workers in mainland China to help produce the iPhone 6. Both these moves suggest Apple is gearing up for the launch of new iOS devices around the usual September timeframe. The 5.5-inch version of its iPhone 6 is expected to rival the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (pictured) An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . Separate reports have suggested the 5.5-inch model will be released several weeks before the 4.7-inch model, and will be produced in limited numbers. Based on previous leaks, the new set of iPhones will launch in a thinner aluminium body and will include a sapphire crystal display covering for improved strength. Users of Apple's next handset may also be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system. Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung. Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . Both iPhones are also thought to include a higher-resolution display with a pixel ratio of 1704 x 960. They may also include an A8 system-on-a-chip for improved efficiency, performance boosts, and better battery life. Apple also has the iWatch in the pipeline for release this year, which will include more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularized the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . This concept iWatch, pictured, incorporates rumoured Healthbook fitness features that leaked in March, but experts claim Apple could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically designed to track health .","Foxconn has hired 100,000 more workers in China to produce iPhone 6 .

"By . James Black . Hundreds of Brits on a day-trip to Lapland today feared they would not get home for Christmas after their return flight was cancelled. The fed-up tourists were this afternoon waiting to find out when they would be flown home - nearly a whole day after their plane was due to take off. More than 200 passengers were put up in a hotel near the airport in Kittila, Finland, last night - but only after spending more than four hours sitting in the stationary plane. Ben and Michelle Courtney with their two children Kitty and George . Families were left waiting for four hours before being told they would have to stay overnight at a hotel . Desperate to get home are Ben and Michelle Courtney, who took their two older children on the day-trip - but left their 20-month-old twins behind. Michelle, 30, said: 'This is my worst nightmare. We only left the twins because we thought we'd be back the same day. 'They are being looked after by my sister, but I've never left them this long and I'm desperate to get home. 'At the moment I've no idea when that will be, I'm not even sure we'll be back for Christmas. It's just awful.' The couple from Eltham, south east London, paid £1,700 to take George, eight, who has autism, and Kitty, five, on the dream trip to see Father Christmas in Lapland. Hairdresser Michelle, who booked the trip through Canterbury Travel, said: 'It was meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime fairytale trip, but it's been awful. 'Even the trip itself was disappointing. I thought Lapland was going to be magical, but it's been a disaster. 'We had to wait outside in minus 30 degrees in a queue to see Father Christmas and when it was finally the kids' turn I fainted because I was so cold. 'We were told we would be having snowball fights with elves, but the elves were moody and wouldn't even talk to us. 'There wasn't even a Christmas tree and I didn't see any fairy lights - it was pitch black.' The family got an early morning Thomas Cook flight out of London Gatwick on Saturday and were due to fly back at 7.50pm the same day. Michelle said: ""We boarded the plane at 7pm, but it never took off. We were sat on the tarmac until 11pm wondering what was happening. 'They refused to give us any food and drink while we were waiting - it was just awful. I've never heard so many children crying all at once. 'Apparently the valve that stops the engine from freezing was faulty and they just kept telling us they were trying to fix it. Originally meant to be a day trip, the Lapland visit has turned into a disaster for many families . 'Eventually they took us off the plane at 11pm and put us up in a hotel. 'They've told us we will get an update on what is happening at 4pm today so all we can do is wait. 'We can't leave the hotel because it's too cold outside and they've taken away our snow suits."" A spokeswoman for Canterbury Travel said this afternoon they hoped to be able to send the passengers home on a 4.30pm flight. She said: 'We have had two staff with our clients at the hotel all day keeping them updated. 'Fingers crossed all the passengers should be heading home on a 4.30pm flight.' She added she was ""stunned"" to hear about the Courtney family's disappointing Lapland experience. She said: 'I am really disappointed to hear this. Not one single complaint has come to our ears. 'Historically we have had really good feedback from our Lapland tours.' A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said a plane was due to depart from Kittila either late afternoon or early evening to return the 235 passengers to London Gatwick. She said: 'We are doing everything we can to make their plane ready for departure as soon as possible. 'We've provided overnight accommodation, meals and drinks to ensure passengers are comfortable and we expect to have them back in England by the end of the day, in plenty of time to enjoy Christmas at home. 'We're also planning to have a little thank you present for the children on arrival in Gatwick to say thank you for their patience.'","More than 200 passengers stranded for four hours on plane .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A woman had an epic meltdown this week on a Tampa, Florida-bound flight. The unidentified woman screamed over and over at the top of her lungs after going up and down the aisles of the plane telling people to pray for her deceased mother. ‘God you’re my savior,’ she repeated as often and quickly as possible, while contorting and shaking in her seat as shocked passengers tried not to draw her attention. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Seeking salvation: The blonde woman in this YouTube video had an epic meltdown as the man in the black hat tried to calm her down . The video, uploaded Wednesday to YouTube, has had well over 100,000 views, and shows the woman going . crazy as the plane lands in Tampa. Perhaps distraught over the recent loss of her mother, the woman is seen at the beginning of the video screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ at the top of her lungs. Shot by Reed Stanley, video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical woman trying to calm her down. His failure to calm her elicits an exasperated shrug of the shoulders. ‘She’s been freaking out for the last 20 minutes,’ Mr Stanley explains over the shouting woman. ‘She started off by telling everyone to pray for her mother who just passed away. ‘She went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother,’ Mr Stanley further explains as the woman’s tirade shows no signs of slowing down. ‘ . Get me out of here: The woman in the aisle seat can't get off the plane fast enough . The woman appears to be both looking at her powered on smartphone and reading a magazine while repeatedly screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ in non-stop repetition. The man sitting next to her continues to try to calm her down as passengers shown behind her are tiring of the routine. ‘I don’t know if this guy next to her knows her or not,’ Mr Stanley further narrates over the unending barrage of proclamation, ‘but he’s been trying to calm her down the whole time.’ The plane then appears to touch down on the airport runway, as it visibly shakes before lights and other vehicles are then seen outside the window behind the distraught woman. The man’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her, as she points and yells ‘don’t f**king touch me’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to God for cursing. She then goes right back into repeating ‘God you’re my savior and fast and loud as she can. Clearly distraught: The crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant . Right as she appears to run out of steam, finally quieting down, Mr Stanley explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman doesn’t make a run for the plane’s door. ‘If she tries to go back, we’re going to block her,’ Mr Stanley said as the woman’s meltdown caught a second wind. Though not as loud and fast as before, the mantra is repeated over and over. It is not clear what the woman’s ultimate fate was, she has not been publicly identified. Then, like a voice from the heavens, an automated message advised passengers to ‘remain in their seats’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate. Salvation had finally come for the passengers, the end of their hellish flight.","The unidentified woman had recently lost a parent .

"By . Amanda Williams . Carole Middleton - the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - was one of the victims of phone hacking by the News of the World, it has today been reported. She joins a list of other associates and members of the Royal Family who were revealed throughout the trial to have had their voicemails intercepted by NotW journalists. It comes after a jury has failed to reach verdicts on two outstanding charges against former editor Andy Coulson and journalist Clive Goodman. Carole Middleton - the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - was one of the victims of phone hacking by the News of the World, it has today been reported . The jury resumed deliberations on the case of the ex-No 10 spin doctor today as the political fallout from his conviction for plotting to hack phones at the News of the World raged in Westminster. But jurors concluded they could not agree and were discharged after nine days’ deliberation and 139 days of the trial. Coulson faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced next week along, after he was found guilty conspiring to hack phones over six years. The former spin doctor, who was forced to resign as David Cameron's director of communications over the scandal, now faces the possibility of prison. His ex-lover and colleague Rebekah Brooks was cleared of all charges. Amid . the gravity of the accusations, the eight-month trial revealed . fascinating details of the private lives of the Royal Family. They . included revelations that Prince William used the pet name ‘babykins’ for Kate Middleton in a phone message hacked by the News of the World, . and that he was nearly shot with blank rounds after getting lost and . walking into an ambush while on an Army training exercise in woodland . near Aldershot in Hampshire. Walking free: Rebekah Brooks raises a slight smile as she leaves the Old Bailey with her husband Charlie after she was cleared of all charges following the hacking trial. He said they were 'treated like terrorists' by police . William also apparently left a . voicemail on Prince Harry’s phone in which he pretended to be his . brother’s then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy and called him a ‘big hairy fat . ginger’, and that Miss Davy drove Harry ‘nuts’ with a barrage of calls . and texts while he was training to be an Army officer, according to News . of the World royal editor Clive Goodman. William . was allegedly kicked out of Harry’s passing-out party at Sandhurst in . 2006 for ‘braying Hooray Henry’ antics, according to Mr Goodman. And . Princess Diana allegedly leaked information about the Royal Family to . journalists to reveal the forces ‘ranged against her’. Prime Minister David Cameron apologised for hiring the former tabloid editor after the Old Bailey jury convicted Coulson of being part of a six-year hacking conspiracy but cleared his ex-lover and colleague Rebekah Brooks. The eight women and three men of the jury were considering allegations that Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, conspired with former royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, of Addlestone, Surrey, to commit misconduct in a public office by agreeing to pay police officers for two royal directories. They both deny the two charges. Mr Justice Saunders, who has already made clear his frustration with politicians commenting on the case before it has finished, told the jurors today it was 'extremely important ' that they followed his direction to ignore entirely anything they had heard on the radio, seen on the television or read in newspapers, no matter who said it. Coulson was recruited by Chancellor George Osborne to head the Tory media operation within months of resigning as News of the World (NotW) editor in January 2007 because hacking happened on his watch. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street, he took on duties heading the No 10 spin operation, quitting shortly before he was arrested when the phone-hacking scandal erupted again four years later. Final day: Coulson was mobbed as he arrived at the Old Bailey today before the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the final two counts he faced . Conviction: Coulson is likely to face up to two years in prison and will likely be sentenced next week . Following the verdict yesterday, Mr Cameron said: 'I take full responsibility for employing Andy Coulson. I did so on the basis of undertakings I was given by him about phone hacking and those turned out not to be the case. 'I always said that if they turned out to be wrong, I would make a full and frank apology and I do that today. I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that.' Mr Osborne said: 'We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it's clear that we made the wrong decision.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'The question for the Prime Minister is: is a partial apology enough or do we have to look into what went wrong? 'There was a guilty verdict yesterday of a man, Mr Coulson, who was already accused of such things when he was brought into Downing Street by the Prime Minister and a decision was made - and this will be put to the Prime Minister today - not to have Mr Coulson properly vetted, as people in his job always have been.'","Andy Coulson found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones while editor of the News of the World .

"By . Suzannah Hills . On trial: Teacher Bruce Roth is accused of sexually abusing students while working at King's School in Rochester, Kent, and Wellington College in Berkshire . A young boy took an overdose of tablets after he was allegedly abused by his teacher at a top public school, his mother told a jury today. The boy only told his parents what had happened after details of the police investigation into his teacher Bruce Roth’s alleged molesting of boys appeared in a national newspaper. Roth is on trial for sexually abusing boys in his care at two schools he worked at - King’s School, in Rochester, Kent, and the prestigious Wellington College, in Crowthorne, Berkshire. The boy's mother today told Reading Crown Court that her son, who was then a student at Wellington College, blamed his paracetamol overdose on 'trouble with a girl'. She said: 'I think we had gone to bed and he came in and told us he had done it. He must have been 14 or 15 years old. 'I took him to the hospital and he was treated and we came home early in the morning the following day and I talked to him and he said he had broken up with a girlfriend and he hadn’t realised how many [pills] he had taken, and I believed him.' But many years later, while her son was at university, he told his parents what had really happened. In 2010, when the boy was no longer at Wellington College, the parents were contacted by a friend who told them of the investigation into Roth. She said: 'I asked my daughter if she knew anything about it or if there was anything I should be concerned about and she said we should talk to our son.' The worried parents drove to see their son at university and took him out for a meal, sitting in a dark corner of a restaurant, where they asked him directly what had happened. His mother continued: 'He went very quiet and started fidgeting. He told us he had been abused by Mr Roth at Wellington for nine months in his first year. The schoolboy claims he took a drug overdose after being abused by Roth while a pupil at Wellington College, Crowthorne, Berkshire . Roth also faces allegations of abuse while he a teacher employed at King's School, in Rochester, Kent . 'He said: ‘I never want to talk about it again'. He has only ever referred to it as ‘it’ since then.' The parents arranged a meeting with Wellington’s Master, Dr Anthony Seldon, who put the police in touch with them. The court heard how Roth had befriended the boy’s parents and would be invited for dinner at their home. His mother told the jury: 'He came on more than one occasion. 'He had been so helpful to our son, musically and academically. I don’t know how it happened, we invited him to supper on occasion.' The mother said that when he would arrive at their home he would often bring a bottle of wine or Champagne or a box of chocolates. Historic: Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh meet staff at Wellington College in 1959, one of several royal visits to the school . He also gave his alleged abuse victim gifts, including a computer game, a cockerel toy and a polo shirt. His mother continued: 'I think we probably said at the time that that was too generous and not needed.' She added: 'Our son hated it but I just put it down to a master coming to dinner. 'He was also very rude [to Roth], which I thought was a little out of turn.' Roth, aged 46 years, denies all 17 charges against him, four of indecent assault on a male person under 16, four counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in a sexual activity and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

Stinger is then believed by police to have told the woman he would ‘finish her tattoos’ before using an ink gun to write ‘RATTA 100%’ on her stomach. Calder then repeatedly beat her until she passed out, police said. Stinger was the only gang member she could identify out of the seven that were in her apartment that afternoon.

"By . Chris Greenwood . and James Slack . and Wills Robinson . A suspected gun factory which used a state-of-the-art 3D printer was uncovered by police yesterday. Stunned officers believe a gang were using the machine to make deadly firearms. They recovered a freshly-made plastic magazine and trigger during a raid in Bagley, Manchester, which could be used to create a handgun. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Technology: Greater Manchester Police found what they thought was a gun-making machine during a raid . One senior officer said organised crime gangs are acquiring technology on the high street to make guns ‘in the privacy of their own home.’ Det Insp Chris Mossop, of Greater Manchester Police, told Sky News: ‘These could be the next generation of firearms.’ The discovery is believed to be the first of its kind in Britain and confirms the worst fears of security chiefs. They warned just a few weeks ago that criminals were attempting to use 3D printing technology to manufacture guns. Police fear terrorists and criminals could use the machines and plans that are readily available to download online to circumvent gun controls. Parts: Officers found a number of components which could have been used to make a handgun, including a trigger . Ministers have also been warned that the plastic parts may not be detected by x-ray machines and other airport security checks. The seized parts, which were found near an industrial 3D printing machine, were being examined by forensic experts last night. A police spokesman said a man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of making gunpowder. In the U.S., several guns have already been produced using the technology, with varying degrees of success. One of the latest models, which includes a rifled barrel to ensure deadly accuracy, is said to have been made with just £15 of materials. The latest generation of 3D printers work by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects. The guns are assembled from separate printed components made from plastic, with only the firing pin and a few bolts made from metal. The Home Office said it will not be possible to ban 3D printers, so officials are working on alternative strategies. Bullets: Officers believed this  piece of plastic was a freshly-made shell magazine . In May, blueprints for the first-ever plastic gun produced on a 3-D printer were downloaded over 100,000 times in the first four days after they were uploaded. Designs for the 'Liberator' pistol were posted online by the US company Defense Distributed.However the U.S. State Department ordered the website to take down the blueprints, on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations. The blueprints, that could be produced on 3-D printers costing as little as £600 were seen as a breakthrough because no one had previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition and could pass through security scanners without detection. The first plastic gun to be assembled in this way cost just £16 and was built using the state-of-the-art machine, some nails and some household screws. The engineeer was able to fire nine .38 caliber bullets. These could include stiff jail sentences for possession of the weapons and making it illegal to download the plans. Officials believe that other criminal groups have attempted to construct weapons prior to the Manchester discovery. A . new strategy document by the National Crime Agency warned: ‘We need to . develop counter-measures for the imminent risk that 3D printing will . facilitate the manufacture of weapons or part of weapons’. In the U.S., more than 100,000 plans for a plastic gun known as the ‘liberator’ were downloaded within hours. The explosion of interest provoked the Government into ordering the Texas-based company who produced them to take them down. It used a 3D printer that cost £5,140 from the online auction site eBay to make the parts which, when assembled, create a working handgun. Police have also warned of the danger of guns being ordered over the internet from the U.S. In Merseyside, police tracked the delivery of a handgun to 15-year-old boy after it was ordered online. The Manchester raid took place as part of a huge operation to tackle organised criminals linked to drugs, guns and money laundering. More than £330,000 worth of drugs, counterfeit goods worth £2m, £25,000 cash and weapons including a Taser and a baton have been recovered. Deadly: What appears to be a sniper rifle equipped with along-sighted lens was recovered during the operation . Arsenal: Officers also found rifles during the operation. At least 100 raids were carried out around the city . Handgun: Pistols and air-rifles were also discovered as police looked to clamp down on organised crime . Manufacturing: They also found glue, labels and a collection of tools which are alleged to have been used to produce counterfeit goods . There are currently more than 160 known organised criminal gangs in Greater Manchester, costing the local economy between £850 million and £1.7 billion each year. Chief Constable Peter Fahy said that 3D printer guns are ‘a new phenomenon’. He said: ‘We will really need to look at this new development. Certainly we feel that we are having success - and the important thing is not to be defeatist about this. ‘It is not to think that we’ll never win that these people are cleverer than us, they are not, they are just more violent than us.’ Detective Mossop added: 'This is a really significant discovery for Greater Manchester Police. Caught: Greater Manchester Police raided a warehouse filled with what are allegedly counterfeit goods . 'If . what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of . constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised . crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high . street to produce the next generation of weapons. 'In . theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their . own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to . the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities. 'Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle. 'These . could be the next generation of firearms and a lot more work needs to . be done to understand the technology and the scale of the problem. 'If . what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine . firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against . this next generation of homemade weapons. 'I would strongly urge anyone who has information about the whereabouts of a gun in their community to call us.' Finished product: A fully-assembled plastic gun made by a printer would look similar to this . Intricate: Each of the components would have been made individually in the machine before being put together using nails and household screws . Risk: In May, Mail on Sunday reporter Simon Murphy was able to get one of the weapons through security checks and onto the Eurostar . The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the USA earlier this year. The controversial group who manufactured the gun, Defense Distributed, group spent a year trying to create the firearm, which was successfully tested at a firing range south of Austin, Texas. According to the group's website Defense Distributed is a 'non-profit corporation in the state of Texas, organised and operated exclusively for charitable and literary purposes'. The group says their main aims are: 'To defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, through facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms; and to publish and distribute, at no cost to the public, such information and knowledge in promotion of the public interest.' The gun was made on a 3D printer that cost £5,140 from the online auction site eBay.It was assembled from separate printed components made from plastic - only the firing pin was made from metal. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas.Earlier this year Mr Wilson told the BBC: 'I think a lot of people weren't expecting that this could be done.' Mr Wilson, who describes himself as a crypto-anarchist, said his plans to make the design available were 'about liberty'. He told the BBC: 'There is a demand of guns - there just is. There are states all over the world that say you can't own firearms - and that's not true any more.'I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. It's not up to the political players any more."" Asked if he felt any sense of responsibility about whose hands the gun might fall into, he told the BBC: ""I recognise the tool might be used to harm other people - that's what the tool is - it's a gun. 'But I don't think that's a reason to not do it - or a reason not to put it out there.' 3D printing has been hailed as the future of manufacturing. The technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects .

"By . Bianca London . Most women are put off dieting by pictures of celebrities such as Michelle Keegan and Elle Macpherson flaunting their perfect bikini bodies, according to new research. Far from being inspired to get in shape too by beach pictures of their favourite celebrities, the images have the opposite effect - with 62 per cent of women saying they are actually less inclined to diet after seeing them. More than half (54 per cent) say they are more likely to ‘give up’ rather than lose weight because they realise they will never be able to get the body they really desire. Putting us off: Rather than inspiring us to lose weight, new researcjh reveals that most women are put off dieting by pictures of celebrities such as Michelle Keegan flaunting their perfect bikini bodies . And a further 57 per cent moaned that even when they do lose weight, they are disappointed with their pictures taken on holiday because they appear fatter than they had hoped. The celebrity who does most to stop women dieting is ex-Coronation Street favourite Michelle Keegan, whose barmaid character Tina McIntyre was recently killed off in the soap. The second biggest diet killer is Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, followed by supermodel Elle Macpherson - still looking fabulous at 50 - Miranda Kerr and Gwyneth Paltrow. The survey also revealed that a staggering 85 per cent of women admitted to looking at pictures of stars on the beach via the media. We'll never compare! The survey found that over half of women say they are more likely to 'give up' rather than lose weight because they realise they will never be able to get the body they really desire, with Elle Macpherson being one such example . A further 72 per cent consciously compared the celebrities’ bodies with their own and 64 per cent of women said they ended up feeling ‘deflated’ when they compared stars’ bodies to their own. This feeling of deflation rose to 84 per cent when the star was the same age or older than the real woman viewing the image. The vast majority of women (71 per cent) reckon air-brushed pictures of celebrities looking perfect on the beach give real women unrealistic role models to aspire to. Most women (82 per cent) would prefer the celebrities’ beach pictures to be seen unaltered - just like real women’s holiday snaps. Comparisons: A further 72 per cent consciously compared celebrities' bodies, such as Miranda Kerr's, with their own and 64 per cent of women said they ended up feeling 'deflated' when they compared them . A spokesperson for Forza supplements, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s no surprise that women find the ""perfect"" pictures of Michelle Keegan and other celebrities such as Elle Macpherson and Gwyenth Patrow a bit depressing. 'How can real women, without personal trainers and macrobiotic diets, hope to compete? 'The truth is they can’t and they shouldn’t. They have far more important things to do like getting on with their careers and running their families.' Will we ever look like them?

"By . Katy Winter . Known as the most glamorous of Twags (that’s Tennis WAGs), Kim Sears certainly kept that title as she arrived at Wimbledon today. There to support long term beau Andy Murry in his first game of the tournament against Belgium's David Goffin, Kim chose to wear her own 'tennis whites' in a show of support. With her trademark blow-dry firmly intact, Kim swept passed waiting photographers outside the stadium looking a tad nervous, no doubt residual fears from Andy’s crushing defeat at Queens earlier this month. There was no need to worry this time, though, as Andy won his first round match against David Goffin in straight sets. Scroll down for video . Kim Sears arrived at the Wimbledon Tennis Club ahead of boyfriend Andy Murray's first match . Kim sported a deep tan which was accentuated further by her choice of white and cream outfit . Kim was seen to both rejoice and agonize as the match progressed and Murray was in turns triumphant and defeated through the sets . Kim waved to Andy during a break in the tense match, which ultimately saw him come out victorious . Kim is known as much for her expressive face as for her perfectly blow dried hair . At times the pressure seemed to get to the usually composed Kim as she watched her boyfriend defend his title . Sporting bare legs Kim showed off her deep tan against her white lace Jennifer dress from Reiss and white wedged heels. Clutching some serious arm candy in the form of her £1395 over sized cream leather Aspinal of London 'Marylebone' tote and her favourite Pandora charm bracelet, the only pop of colour in her outfit came from a thin pink belt and the green ribbon holding her VIP access card. As defending champion Murray will play the first match on centre court in the opening game of the men’s singles championship this afternoon. Despite the tension Kim seemed to enjoy the day, a times looking positively elated . Devoted Kim, who met Andy when she was just 17, attends many of his matches, watching animatedly from the sidelines . Andy's crushing defeat just weeks before the start of Wimbledon must have increased Kim's anxiety about the match . Kim and Murray's mother Judy, who once described Sears as the 'best thing' to happen to her son, greet each other warmly as they both took their seats court side . Kim's nerves are likely to be running high as she watches Andy defend his title in the first Wimbledon match . Kim, who has been dating Murray for nine years, is known for her trademark pristine blow-dried hair . However Kim’s nerves are likely to be running high as she watches her boyfriend of nine years on court today. The 25-year-old artist, who met Murray who met Murray when she was studying for her A levels aged just 17, was courtside at his surprisingly easy defeat earlier this month at the Queen’s Club in London. The British No 1 was beaten in straight sets 7-6 6-2 by Radek Stepanek, the 35-year-old ranked No 42 in the world, and beaten well. Kim carried a £1395 oversized cream leather Aspinal of London Marylebone tote in ivory and mouse python . Kim looked a little anxious as she arrived this morning, no doubt due to Murray's shock defeat at Queen's earlier this month . However, despite the undoubted pressure he is feeling entering Wimbledon as defending champion, having Kim by his side will be a comfort. Murray, 27, has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship. He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’ Kim applauded her boyfriend on court as she watched the crucial match with a friend . Kim and Andy live together in a a five bedroom property with two double garages in Oxshott, Surrey, which he bought for £5m in 200, and while she runs her own successful animal portrait company she is a constant and devoted support to the tennis star. Murray's own mother Judy once described Sears as the 'best thing' to happen to her son. The pair are obviously close, greeting each other in a warm embrace as they both took their seats before the beginning of the match. Judy, 54, herself a tennis coach entertained some of the waiting crowds by playing a few rallies with them.","Kim arrived at Wimbledon ahead of boyfriend Andy Murray's first match .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . They have a reputation for creating tear-jerking adverts that tug on the heart strings with a moving story played out to a soulful song. And this year's John Lewis advert doesn't disappoint. The £7m campaign uses a split screen to tell the love story of two young people divided by decades. Unknown actors Alice Issaz and Thomas Vernant play the part of the love struck couple, with Alice embarking on a relationship in the 1920s and Thomas in the present day. The pair never physically meet but their stories run side-by-side as they visit the same romantic haunts and go about their daily lives. Scroll down for video . Parallel lives: The John Lewis advert begins with a girl and boy getting ready in their respective flats - but one of them is in the 1920s and the other in the present day . Going on a date: The couple then head out walking on the same street decades apart . Refreshment: The pair arrive at the same building which is a tea room in the Twenties and a coffee shop today . Twin worlds: They sit at the same table as the love story unfolds to the soundtrack of a Paloma Faith cover of INXS's 'Never Tear Us Apart' In one scene, Alice goes on a date at an Art Deco cinema while Thomas is on the same aisle in the present day wearing 3D glasses. In another segment, flapper girl Alice does the Charleston at a dance hall while Thomas is seen on the same dance floor which is now a jumping night club. Another scene emphasises how technology has moved on with Alice working at a telephone exchange and using pen and paper to write, while Thomas has a flat screen TV in his home and uses a tablet device to send messages. Saturday night at the movies: The couple, played by Alice Issaz and Thomas Vernant, are seen outside the same cinema . Times have changed: In the modern day, the audience watch the film with 3D glasses . Touching: Their hands come tantalisingly close - even though they are separated by nearly ninety years . The story plays out as if the pair have had a argument and then realise the error of their ways. They send an apology before running to the same location to be reunited and walk into the same building side-by-side as a message appears on the screen - 'what's important doesn't change' - followed by John Lewis' slogan 'never knowing undersold since 1925.' The company said they hope the advert proves that 'while many aspects of our lives today are . different to how they were almost 100 years ago, the really important . things haven't changed at all', since John Lewis started trading in 1925. Pedal power: They then go for a bike ride in the £7m campaign that was shot in Prague . Brushstrokes: At a gallery, Alice views a watercolour painting while Thomas looks at a contemporary piece . Flapper girl: Alice does the Charleston at a dance hall while Thomas is at a jumping night club . Technological advances: A telephone exchange is used in the Twenties while in the modern day, messages are sent via a tablet device . Anna Braithwaite, a marketing manager at John Lewis, said the advert, shot in Prague under the direction of Ringan Ledwidge, has 'got to be one of the biggest shoots we've ever worked . on.' She added: 'The fact we have this split screen with half in the 1920s and . half in the modern day has provided twice the challenge for us.' John Lewis' director of marketing, Craig Inglis, added: 'When I saw the script, I thought it was a beautiful, enduring love . story but told in a really innovative way.' As in their previous advertising campaigns, the soundtrack is a key element in telling the story. Trouble in paradise: The couple appear to have an argument... ... with Thomas looking hurt and confused as his true love storms off . Please forgive me: They then realise the error of their ways with Alice writing an apology with pen and paper and Thomas sending a message via his tablet . For this year's campaign, British singer-songwriter Paloma Faith is the vocalist with a soulful cover of INXS's 1988 hit 'Never Tear Us Apart'. The single will be released this week and Paloma will be hoping the John Lewis effect will have the magic touch on sales that previous artists on their campaigns have enjoyed. According to the Telegraph, John Lewis have been directly responsible for the sale of 1.04 million singles that have been used in its adverts since 2009. This includes Ellie Goulding's cover of Elton John's 'Your Song' which shot to number one after it featured in their 2010 Christmas advert. She went on to perform the song at the wedding reception of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as the couple had their first dance as man and wife. Reconciliation: The couple run to the same spot . 'What's important doesn't change': The advert aims to show that while times have moved on, human relationships are still the same . Appealing to early Christmas shoppers: 'Never knowing undersold' is the slogan of the campaign, which will be followed in seven weeks by John Lewis' 2012 festive campaign . Also in 2010,  Fyfe Dangerfield climbed into the top ten with his cover of Billy Joel’s classic 'Always A Woman To Me' after it was used in the High Street brand's touching advert which showed a woman on the path of life from childhood to becoming a wife, mother and grandmother. But with their 2012 autumn advert, John Lewis had the hard act of following their 2011 Christmas advert that could reduce people to tears by just thinking about it. The advert featured a little boy desperately waiting for Christmas because he was so excited about giving a gift to his parents. The advert featured a moving cover of The Smiths 'Please, please, please let me get what I want', by the then unknown Amelia Warner, AKA Slow Moving Millie. Her version reached number 31 while The Smiths also re-entered the charts as people rushed to download the original. She's got soul: A cover by British singer Paloma Faith features in the new ad . But John Lewis needn't have worried about their latest advert failing to live up to expectations as it has been heaped with praise on Twitter after it debuted on television this week. June Hurst ‏tweeted 'another tour de force! Love it', while Stevie Johnson said, 'absolutely love the new John Lewis advert. 'What's important doesn't change.' Makes me feel all warm inside.' 'No teenage icon' ‏@Tanyelala added: 'I want to hug the creators of every John Lewis advert.' Although John Lewis will be hoping their current advert will pull in early Christmas shoppers, the parallel lives love story is not their festive advert for 2012. This has already been filmed in New Zealand and will air in seven week's time - so get the hankies ready. Delightful: Last Christmas little Lewis McGowan brought a tear to everyone's eye as the little boy desperately waiting for Christmas day... Counting down the days: The ad featured a cover of The Smiths 'Please, please, let me get what I want' Touching: The twist at the end was that Lewis was waiting to give his parents a gift . Journey of life: The 2010 advert began with a little girl celebrating her birthday . Milestones: Viewers watched her grow up to marry... ... and become a mother, then grandmother to the soundtrack of 'Always A Woman to Me', a cover of Billy Joel's hit by Fyfe Dangerfield .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Do you always take the lift rather than climb that flight of stairs? Or struggle to eat any fruit or veg? If so, you could be dramatically increasing your risk of cancer - and using the quiz below, you will be able to gauge by how much. There is strong scientific evidence to suggest that lifestyle is a big factor when it comes to developing cancer. Scroll down for video . Scientists say about 89,000 cases of cancer could be avoided if we took measures such as eating a healthy diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains and pulses . Just today it was announced there has been a steep rise in rates of lifestyle-linked cancers in England. Liver cancer rose substantially over the past decade - by 70 per cent among men and 60 per cent among women between 2003 and 2012, according to new figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Rates of malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, have risen by 78 per cent among men and 48 per cent among women over the same period. The main causes of liver cancer are tobacco, infections with hepatitis B and C ,and excess alcohol consumption. But being . physically active, maintaining a healthy weight and eating a diet rich . in plant foods, such as cereals, pulses, fruit and vegetables, have all . been proven to cut the risk of developing cancer,  scientists at World . Cancer Research Fund say. Kate Mendoza, the organisation’s Head of Health Information at the charity, said many people still don’t realise that the way that they live – from what they have for breakfast to how active they are – could help save them . from developing the devastating disease. She added that about 89,000 . cases of cancer could be avoided if we ate a healthy diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables, . wholegrains and pulses, were as physically active as we could be and maintained a healthy weight. This includes 20,100 bowel cancer cases, . 21,000 breast cancer cases and 8,300 prostate cancer cases. Now the charity has developed a short quiz that can show you whether your . lifestyle is helping protect you from cancer - or increasing your risk. It asks about your job, your shopping habits, what you eat and . other lifestyle choices, before estimating whether you need to make any . changes to help reduce your risk of the disease - and advising what these should be. Ms Mendoza added: 'Even small changes to lifestyles can make a big difference. 'It can be confusing knowing what to do to avoid developing cancer, but our research has shown that there are some clear choices people can make to help protect themselves against the disease.' TAKE THE TWO TESTS HERE... PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUIZ . The World Cancer Research Fund’s top recommendations for cancer prevention are: . Be a healthy weight – Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight . Physical activity – Be active for at least 30 minutes a day . Plant foods – Eat a variety of vegetables, fruits, wholegrains and pulses . Energy . density – Avoid sugary drinks and limit consumption of energy-dense . foods (particularly processed foods that are high in fat, low in fibre, . or high in sugar) Meat – To reduce your cancer risk, eat no more than 500g (cooked weight) per week of red meat, like beef, pork and lamb, and avoid processed meats such as ham, bacon, salami, hot dogs and some sausages. As a rough guide 500g of cooked red meat is the same as 700 to 750g of raw red meat. Alcohol – Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day . Salt –Salt is linked to 14 per cent of stomach cancer cases in the UK. Our daily intake of salt should be less than 6g (2.4g sodium) – we actually need much less than this. Supplements – Don’t rely on supplements to protect against cancer . Breastfeeding – Best for mothers to breastfeed exclusively for up to six months and then add other liquids and foods . Cancer survivors – Those who have survived cancer should follow these recommendations for cancer prevention where possible.","Figures out today show a steep rise in rates of lifestyle-linked cancers .

"By . Andy Dolan . A coroner stunned an inquest into a honeymooner’s death by asking her husband if he had been involved. Kristy Cadman-Jones, 27, died of a drugs overdose at a luxury hotel in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, towards the end of a month-long tour of the Far East with Damian, 31. At the time of her death in January it was suggested that she had suffered a heart attack. Kristy Cadman-Jones died while on a romantic month-long honeymoon in Asia with her new husband Damian . The coroner quizzed Damian Cadman-Jones, pictured yesterday, at the Leicester inquest into the death of his wife . However, the inquest heard yesterday that she was killed by a huge amount of pure heroin. Mr Cadman-Jones, a solicitor, claimed the couple had been offered what . they thought was cocaine by two travellers they met in a bar that night. He ‘suspected’ that his wife, a recruitment agency branch manager, took . some. The inquest was also told that within hours of the bride’s death someone . had attempted to make a claim on her life insurance policy. In extraordinary scenes, coroner Donald Coutts-Wood quizzed Mr . Cadman-Jones about the circumstances surrounding her death and pointed . out inconsistencies in his statements. He asked: ‘Were you in any way involved with others in any intention to end your wife’s life?’ Mr Cadman-Jones denied this – and said he did not know who contacted . Zurich, the insurance company with whom he and his wife held life . insurance policies. Mr Coutts-Wood also asked Mr Cadman-Jones why he was ‘so desperate’ to . have his wife’s body embalmed within 48 hours, explaining that the . process could hamper toxicology tests. Mr Cadman-Jones told the hearing . at Leicester Town Hall – where the couple were married – that he made . the decision so his wife could ‘say goodbye to her mother’, who did not . fly out to Cambodia. The inquest heard that when he filled in a claim form relating to his . wife’s life insurance policy later in the year, he put the cause of . death as ‘heart and cardiovascular failure’ – despite the fact he had . received a report from the post-mortem examination outlining the cause . of death as morphine and codeine toxicity as a result of taking heroin. Mr Cadman-Jones said he had completed the form several months earlier . and had not checked it before sending it off. The inquest also heard how Mr Cadman-Jones’s first statement to the . authorities did not mention drugs, but a later one described how a pair . of ‘experienced travellers’ had offered him and his wife cocaine on the . night of her death. Mr Cadman-Jones said he did not see his wife taking drugs that night, . but admitted she took them ‘once in a blue moon’. A coroner recorded an open verdict into the death of the recruitment consultant, who died in her sleep . Mr Cadman-Jones first realised there was something wrong with his wife when he woke a few hours later to find her unresponsive . Mr Cadman-Jones tried waking his wife by shaking and shouting her, throwing water in her face, before beginning CPR and calling for an ambulance . Kristy Cadman-Jones on her wedding day with friends. She was married six months before taking her honeymoon . Kristy, second from left, and Damien Cadman-Jones, far right. The couple married at Leicester Town Hall . He declined to answer . when asked if he had himself used drugs in the past. Recording an open verdict, Mr Coutts-Wood said he did not find Mr .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you thought tending to plants on Earth was tricky, then try growing them in the hostile environment of space. That’s exactly what one scientist from Virginia is hoping to do using meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes. If the study proves successful, it could help humans grow their own food in space, helping in the quest to colonise other planets. Dr Michael Mautner has attempted to grow plants in nutrient-rich meteorite soil. ‘A variety of soil bacteria, algae, and asparagus (pictured) and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid/meteorite soils and also in Martian meteorite soils,’ Dr Mautner reported . At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. But Dr Michael Mautner isn't the only one looking at space farming as a possible solution to getting food into space. Nasa currently has plans for a 'space farm' and is already experimenting with growing lettuce on the ISS. As well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping a 'space farm' will deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions. It could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their overall general health. The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps. Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants. As one of the world's only ‘astroecologists’, Dr Michael Mautner thinks it is entirely possible to, in the future, directly grow certain plants on other planets. This will be vital for a future colony to survive on Mars, he claims. The privately-funded Mars One mission plans to  have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Meanwhile, Nasa believes putting man on the red planet will be possible by 2030. But one of the biggest challenges is providing food to sustain astronauts. Currently its costs nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space. The ability to grow cosmic cuisine will cut these costs and provide astronauts with ‘horticultural therapy’ to reduce stress. Dr Mautner from Virginia Commonwealth University researcher told Motherboard that meteorites often contain phosphate, nitrates, and even water that plants can feed on. To grow the plants, Dr Mautner ground up meteorites to create something closely resembling soil. To grow the plants, Dr Mautner ground up meteorites, such as the one pictured, to create something closely resembling soil. His plan is to eventually find several different plants and extraterrestrial soil types that provide the best conditions to farm in space . Dr Mautner’s (pictured) experiments are at an early stage. For instance, he has not yet considered the lack of oxygen on other planets or gravity conditions . ‘A variety of soil bacteria, algae, and asparagus and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid/meteorite soils and also in Martian meteorite soils,’ Dr Mautner reported. His plan is to eventually find several different plants and extraterrestrial soil types that provide the best conditions to farm in space. ‘Given the estimated amounts of asteroid materials shows that these resources can support trillions of humans comfortably in our solar system, and eventually, in billions of other solar systems throughout the galaxy,’ Dr Mautner said. Dr Mautner’s experiment are currently at a very early stage. For instance, he has not yet factored in the lack of oxygen on other planets, or the varying gravity conditions. But, he believes, this is the first step to providing the tools needed for humans to better explore the solar system and beyond. ‘Life on Earth is fragile, endangered by nuclear proliferation, genetic misengineering, runaway climate change or major asteroid impacts, and limited by depleting resources,’ Dr Mautner said. ‘Eventually, Earth will become uninhabitable by the expanding sun. In contrast, life in many independent worlds in space can secure life for trillions of eons.’ Dr Michael Mautner isn't the only one looking at space farming as a possible solution to getting food into space.

"By . Paul Cahalan . A UKIP politician took his young female researcher to a strip bar and watched as a topless dancer cavorted in front of them, it was claimed last night. Roger Helmer, a married MEP who is standing in next month’s Newark by-election, took Alexandra Swann, then 24, to the Manhattan bar in Brussels, she claims. Miss Swann says she was made to feel ‘deeply uncomfortable’ by the 70-year-old’s behaviour, but felt unable to speak out for fear of losing her job. Alexandra Swann, right, claimed that she was sacked as a researcher for UKIP after an MEP took her to a strip club . Miss Swann, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party youth wing who defected to UKIP in 2012, worked for Mr Helmer for five months that year while he was attending the European Parliament. She claims she was later pressured by Mr Helmer to resign, and threatened by another UKIP member that her reputation would be ‘trashed’ if she ever spoke publicly about the strip bar. Alexandra Swann said she was sacked by UKIP MEP Roger Helmer after he took her to a lap dancing club . Mr Helmer, who has been married twice and has children with his first wife, strongly denies the allegations and described Miss Swann as ‘a serial fantasist’. Miss Swann began working for Mr . Helmer in April 2012, said they visited the bar in September that year. She added: ‘The bar was called Manhattan. I had never heard of it but . now I know it is where a lot of MEPs go. There were scantily-clad women . and they were dancing. ‘It was deeply uncomfortable, but what could I do? I loved my job.’ Miss Swann, now 26, said that straight after the UKIP conference in Basingstoke that year, Mr Helmer sacked her. Last night Mr Helmer said: ‘I have a vague recollection of what she might be referring to. ‘After . a meal with my staff, she wanted to have another drink and I took her . to a bar. It became clear it was a bit of a dodgy bar, so we finished . our beers and left. The detail is frankly a load of nonsense.’ Roger Helmer MEP said he had a 'vague recollection' of what Ms Swann was referring to and described it as 'frankly a load of nonsense'","Former UKIP researcher accuses MEP of sacking her after strip club visit .

"By . Anna Edwards . When it comes to bells, nothing's been going right for Olympics organisers today. There was confusion - even for over-excited Boris Johnson - this morning when Big Ben chimed at the bizarre time of 8.12am. And as puzzled onlookers struggled to fathom the timing, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt almost took out spectators at another event when a bell he was ringing flew off its handle. The farcical scenes unfolded as the capital prepared to begin the 'greatest show on earth' tonight by welcoming in the 2012 Olympics. Ding-dong! Scroll down to watch the video . Careful! Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt rings his bell a little too enthusiastically this morning, sending the entire brass body of the instrument flying into the crowds . An Olympics official looks on as the bell flies towards her. Mr Hunt is unaware at this moment of the potential disaster his ringing could cause . Yikes! M Hunt grimaces as he realises that his bell has broken. Luckily, nobody was injured after the accident . The Culture Secretary was ringing his . bell in his right hand on the deck of HMS Belfast when the brass became . detached from its wooden handle and shot through the air above the deck . of the Second World War cruiser. He watched helplessly as the bell . disappeared among a group of Olympics fans, his face betraying the fear . and horror that a bystander maybe seriously hurt. But fortunately the bell missed . hitting anyone, with a clearly relieved Mr Hunt caught on a Sky News . camera saying: 'Oh, oh dear! Are you all right? Health and safety! Are you OK? There we are, disaster averted.' The Belfast is permanently moored on . the Thames near London's Tower Bridge, with Mr Hunt aboard as part of . the All the Bells celebration as people across the country rang bells to . mark the start of the 2012 Games. Health and safety! Mr Hunt, Secretary joins more than 300 bell ringers at the HMS Belfast today... before his accident . The Tory minister later made light of the near-miss, comparing it with a scene from the BBC comedy Twenty Twelve. He wrote on Twitter: 'Oops bell broke . taking part in Martin Creed's ringing in of the Games...no one hurt but . classic #twentytwelve moment.' Mr Hunt later told the BBC: 'I was . ringing a bell in a very excited way and it collapsed in my hand and . went flying off. I had my very own 2012 moment. It was a clanger.' The first of today's celebration . began with Big Ben chiming non stop for three minutes from 8.12am while . hundreds of churches and people across the nation rang their bells to . greet the official start of London 2012. The hour bell of the landmark Palace of Westminster pealed 40 times over the following three minutes. Special permission had to be gained for the hour bell at the Palace of Westminster to be allowed to toll out of its regular sequence. But the actual timing of the event baffled many, as well as the London Mayor, who could not understand why it was ringing at that particular minute and so far in advance. London Mayor Boris Johnson was puzzled when the bells rang out at 8.12am for three minutes . On the public's growing enthusiasm about the Olympics: 'A benign sort of virus passing from individual to individual'. On describing his role in the opening ceremony: 'Just part of the politburo sitting there on the platform looking out rapturously'. On the growing excitement about the Games: 'The Geiger counter of Olympomania is quivering towards the red zone...' On the Opening Ceremony: ' I think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this'. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, presenter James Naughtie explained the idea, before revealing that the excitable Mr Johnson was just learning about it too. He said: 'It is being rung at 8.12am because it's 12 hours until the 24 hour clock will reach 2012. 'Slightly . complicated but you get the point. That was Boris Johnson on the phone, . who obviously didn't know that coming on the line.' To which Mr Johnson said: 'Yes, I was a bit mystified about that.' Many have questioned why the bells are being rung 12 hours before the clock reaches 20:12, and not just wait until tonight. Twitter users posted their confusion about their idea, saying the timing made no sense. Shelley . Taylor Tweeted: 'Why were the bells at 8:12am? That makes absolutely no . sense with the 24 hour clock if they were going for 20:12.' Another, called Johny Cassidy, posted: 'Would it not make more sense to ring Big Ben at 20:12 tonight?' The . celebrations are believed to be the first time that the strike of Big . Ben has been rung outside its normal schedule since February 15 1952, . when it tolled every minute for 56 strokes for the funeral of King . George VI. The bells at the . National Assembly for Wales, Stormont in Northern Ireland and the . Scottish Parliament also rang so that all four Parliaments chimed in . unison at 8.12am, Olympics chiefs said. Town Crier John Melody at Southampton Civic Centre gets into the London 2012 spirit by ringing his bell . Ring in the Games! Royal Navy communications rating Sophie Pickford, rings RFA Mount Bay's ship bell in Portland Harbour as part of the national All the Bells event to celebrate the start of the London 2012 Olympics . The cacophony of sound is for the All . The Bells event, the brainchild of Turner Prize-winning artist and . musician Martin Creed who is encouraging everyone in the UK to ring a . bell. The piece of conceptual art, which has . the official title Work No. 1197: All the bells in a country rung as . quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes, was devised as part . of the London 2012 Festival. Confusion . aside, thousands threw themselves into the spirit of the event, with . church bells, bicycle bells and even mast bells being rung all over the . country as excitement swept the nation. Speaking . on the Today programme, Mr Johnson said the games had swept aside even . the most cynical of sceptics and he hoped they would 'bring the whole . country together'. He said . all expectations of the success of the Olympic Torch Relay had been . surpassed as excitement about the games passed from person to person . like a 'benign sort of virus'. He said: 'It's unbelievable to watch people who are normally sceptical types to be caught up with the Olympic spirit.' The red-faced blunder for Locog at Lord's was the latest of several slip-ups by organisers before the Opening Ceremony. On Wednesday, video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a South Korean flag during the warm-up of North Korea's women's football match at Hampden Park. The incident saw North Korea's players walk off the pitch in protest, before the glitch was fixed an hour later. It is thought a video producer in London - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe. And just yesterday, Olympic programme producers referred to Welsh Team GB footballer Joe Allen as being English. Organisers had anticipated about 1.5million people coming out to see the Torch Relay, but figures suggested it was closer to 3.9 million. And the mayor, who won re-election ahead of the Games in May, said the palpable public enthusiasm for the Olympics was a huge opportunity for London. 'It is our chance to show the world what we are all about, our chance to throw a great party. 'There are very, very important economic reasons for trying to get the best out of the Games... I want to see great economic benefits from these Games. 'We have so many things going for us and the games is a chance... for us to show those things off and that is not unimportant.' Mr Johnson said he would be watching as much sport as he could during meetings and events he attends in his capacity as London Mayor. And he said tonight's Opening Ceremony would be a brilliant set-piece to launch the 16 days of competition. He said: 'It's a long time since I saw Danny Boyle's rushes and I can't reveal, for those who don't know what's going to happen, the details. 'It was an absolutely brilliant piece of theatrical organisation. I think people are going to well up with hot tears of patriotic pride when they see this.' As part of the celebrations, The bell on board the royal rowbarge Gloriana also pealed for three minutes as it processed down the Thames, carrying the Olympic flame and a ceremonial cauldron. HMS Belfast fired its canons in a countdown to 8.12am as 300 children, sea cadets, brownies and Town Criers gather on board to ring an assortment of bells. Others taking part include The Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the British Army, the RAF, the National Trust, the National Theatre, the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers, the Royal British Legion and the Women’s Institute. Tower Hamlets, one of six Olympics host boroughs, rang in the changes as one of its councillors joins a Pearly Queen of Bow for a ding-dong at the historic Bow Church. The traditional Cockney welcome with Councillor Rania Khan was witnessed by the Rev Debbie Frazer, who is new at the church. The Gloriana, carrying the Olympic flame, moves off from a barge containing giant Olympic rings, and right, the boat passes by Big Ben . The Queen's row barge 'Gloriana' carries the Olympic flame along the river Thames from Hampton Court to City Hall today, the last stage of its journey to the Olympic stadium . The full three-minute chime was . broadcast on BBC Breakfast, BBC Radio 2 and every BBC local radio . station across the UK, with a potential live audience of more than 10 . million people. Bells rang everywhere from Britain’s . northernmost inhabited house in Skaw in the Shetland Isles, to the UK’s . most westerly church in Tresco in the Scilly Isles. It aims to set a world record for the . largest number of bells to be rung simultaneously and can include any . from children with handbells, through people ringing bicycle bells and . doorbells, to experienced change ringing experts of tower bells and . church bells.

"By . Tara Brady . Lawyers for two terror suspects currently being held by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay have accused Poland of human rights abuses. They say they fell victim to the .

Europe's role in the CIA's 'extraordinary rendition' of terror suspects . has reached European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers for two terror suspects currently being held by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay accuse Poland of human rights abuses . One of the cases concerns 48-year-old . Saudi national Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who currently faces terror . charges in the U.S. for allegedly orchestrating the al-Qaeda attack on . the USS Cole in 2000, a bombing in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed . 17 sailors and wounded 37. The second case involves 42-year-old . Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian also held in Guantanamo. Zubaydah has never . been charged with a crime. A declassified report released in . 2009 showed the CIA deemed al-Nashiri and Zubaydah as 'high value . detainees' meaning they are held under ultra-secure conditions in a . secret section of Guantanamo known as Camp 7. Human rights groups believe about eight terror suspects were held in Poland, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks . Both men say they were brought to . Poland in December 2002, where they were detained and subjected to harsh . questioning in a Polish military installation in Stare Kiejkuty, a . village set in a lush area of woods and lakes in the country's remote . northeast. There they were subject to mock . executions, waterboarding and other tortures, including being told their . families would be arrested and sexually abused, said Amrit Singh, a . lawyer representing al-Nashiri. 'This case is an opportunity to break . the conspiracy of silence about the participation of some European . governments in the CIA's rendition program, Singh said. 'These acts . occurred on Polish territory with the acquiescence and connivance of the . Polish authorities,' Singh said. Polish prosecutor Janusz Sliwa said . that Poland should be allowed to complete its own investigation into the . claims before having them taken up by Europe's human rights court. Sliwa is leading the Polish investigation, which has gone on for five years without an outcome. They are asking the court to condemn Poland for various abuses of rights guaranteed by Europe's Convention on Human Rights. Former CIA officials have said that a prison in Poland operated from December 2002 until the fall of 2003.

Polish leaders in office at the time - . former President Aleksander Kwasniewski and former Prime Minister . Leszek Miller - denied the prison's existence. Detained: The men are currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba . In his memoir Decision Points . former President George W. Bush writes that he ordered the CIA to . subject about 100 terror detainees to harsh interrogation techniques, . arguing the methods did not constitute unlawful torture and that they . produced intelligence that prevented further attacks. The CIA has never said where the . black sites were based, but intelligence officials, aviation reports and . human rights groups say they included Afghanistan and Thailand as well . as Poland, Lithuania and Romania. Polish prosecutors opened an . investigation into the matter in 2008.  It has been extended several . times and remains pending, although authorities have never disclosed the . investigation's terms or scope. Sliwa said that Polish investigators . have not had access to the two men. He acknowledged that their . investigation has been long, 'but not excessively lengthy.' All the prisons were closed by May . 2006. Interrogations at sea have replaced CIA black sites as the U.S. government's preferred method for holding suspected terrorists and . questioning them without access to lawyers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager with terminal cancer who penned a farewell song to his friends and family that became an internet hit has passed away after a four-year battle. Zach Sobiech, 18, from Minnesota, died on Monday morning surrounded by relatives and loved ones. His death comes six months after he released a song, 'Clouds', which he wrote after learning that he was fighting a losing battle against a rare bone cancer and had just months to live. The catchy tune was such a hit that celebrities including Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Jason Mraz teamed together this month to produce a version of them lip-synching the song for his birthday. Scroll down for videos . Saying goodbye: Zach Sobiech, who penned a song about his experience with a rare terminal bone cancer,  passed away on Monday morning at the age of 18. He was surrounded by friends and family . Zach was just 14 when he diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2009 and led to numerous surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. In 2012, doctors discovered the illness had spread to his pelvis and lungs. When he was faced with the decision of losing one of his legs and half his pelvis to momentarily stall the illness, his family agreed they should put his quality of life first, and forewent the treatment. With doctors telling him he had just months to live, last year he recorded a farewell song entitled 'Clouds' to say thank you to family and friends. After posting the video to YouTube in December, it quickly spread across the internet, and has now been watched nearly three million times, even gaining a celebrity following. Battle: He had been diagnosed with cancer at 14 but continued to remain positive until the end . Upbeat: Shortly before his death, he also featured in a documentary entitled 'My Last Days', pictured . The . gentle, acoustic melody features Zach on the guitar and the lyrics to . the tune express his appreciation for the time he does have. 'And . we'll go up, up, up/ But I'll fly a little higher/ We'll go up in the . clouds/ because the view is a little nicer,' the lyrics read. Last year the family set up the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund to raise money for the Children’s Cancer Research Fund. All proceeds from digital downloads of his song goes towards the charity. After the popularity of the song, record label BMI flew Zach and his family to New York to sign a record deal - and it also caught the attention of some famous faces. Support: Ashley Tisdale, left, and Rachel Bilson, right, were among the celebrities who recorded themselves lip-synching the song for a special birthday message for Zach's 18th birthday this month . Helping out: The touching video also starred Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad, pictured . Earlier this month, dozens of celebrities, including Jason Mraz, Anna Faris, Rachel Bilson and Ashley Tisdale, joined forces to make a response, lip-synching his words. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad, comedian Sarah Silverman, The Hangover's Ed Helms, and folk band the Lumiereers also make appearances in the video. Zach also featured in a documentary directed by Justin Baldoni for a reality series, 'My Last Days'. In the opening scenes, Zach says to the camera: 'I want everyone to know: You don’t have to find out you’re dying to start living.' Baldoni told CNN: 'Going out to see . Zach in Minnesota was one of the greatest experiences of my life... He . is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets. You leave and you . think: ""I want to be a better person"".' Loved: His parents, who have praised Zach's positivity and talent, also featured in the latest video . Fans: Zach has used his time to perform his song for others and raise money for cancer research . Zach's mother Laura told CNN that her son slept a lot in his final days but still tried to muster enough energy to play the guitar and laugh with his friends and family. 'That's what Zach's always been really good at: recognizing what is good and being grateful for it,' she said. 'It's the first thing he seeks out, his starting point. He taught all of us how it's done.' Last year, he explained to CBS: 'With my situation you don't have . time to be sad or angry or anything. You have to just go because you . don't have that much time.'

"By . James Chapman . Demetri Marchessini (pictured) was Ukip's sixth largest donor last year according to recently released figures . A major Ukip donor claimed yesterday that a husband can never rape his wife, insisting: ‘Once a woman accepts, she accepts.’ Demetri Marchessini, a retired Greek business tycoon, also said black slaves had a ‘much better life’ than they would have had in Africa, gays are incapable of fidelity and women should be banned by law from wearing trousers. His bizarre outburst is the latest embarrassment to hit Ukip, which has been forced to distance itself from eccentric and offensive views of a string of candidates and supporters in recent weeks. Despite the setbacks, the party recorded its best-ever poll result yesterday, with ComRes suggesting it was on course to secure 38 per cent of the vote in this month’s European elections. Mr Marchessini was Ukip’s sixth largest  individual cash donor last year. The party  suggested it would have nothing more to  do with him after he expressed what it  called ‘unpalatable’ views, but deputy  chairman Neil Hamilton said last night that while his remarks were ‘eccentric’, it would continue to accept his cash. In his first TV interview, Mr Marchessini insisted there was ‘no such thing’ as rape within marriage. ‘When you get married you promise to look after the other person for the rest of their life,’ he tolfd Channel 4 News. ‘If you make love on Friday and make love Sunday, you can’t say Saturday is rape. ‘Once a woman accepts, she accepts and especially when she makes a vow on her wedding day.’ He said he . believed women should be banned by law from wearing anything other than . skirts, adding that they must dress to excite men. ‘May . I tell you that the incidences of love-making in Western Europe has . fallen drastically,’ he said.  ‘If men don’t make love to women the . Western world is going  to disappear.’ Ukip has faced strong criticism over a host of opinions expressed by its candidates and supporters . A new ComRes survey for ITV News shows 38 per cent of people are planning to voe for Ukip on May 22 in the European Parliament elections . On homosexuals, Mr Marchessini said there was ‘no love only lust’ and there is ‘no such thing as fidelity’ in their relationships. ‘They just all go out looking for action,’ he said. ‘That’s the way it is.’ He also defended the slave trade, saying that those transported from Africa ‘had a much better duration of life and a better life in America’. The tycoon said Ukip was ‘always’ asking for money and a previous declaration by a party spokesman that the party was distancing itself from him was ‘stupid’. When asked whether Ukip should take money from a man with such views, party leader Nigel Farage said: ‘Possibly not, no. Ask the treasurer. I don’t run everything.’ Mr Hamilton said: ‘It’s not dirty money. He has got eccentric views. We don’t endorse those views [but] what he says is not illegal.’ Despite the barrage of negative publicity a ComRes poll for ITV News yesterday put Ukip on course to win a resounding victory in the European elections. It is on 38 per cent among those certain to vote – 11 points ahead of Labour, with the Conservatives on 18 per cent and the Liberal Democrats a miserable 8 per cent.","Ukip has secured 38 percent support among the electorate according to polls .

"By . William Turvill . Tom O'Gorman was allegedly murdered following a row over a chess match at his home in Dublin . A man allegedly murdered after a row over a chess match was stabbed dozens of times in what Irish police called a ‘horrific killing’ in an ‘almost unimaginable crime scene’. Tom O’Gorman, a 39-year-old researcher with the Iona Institute, was badly mutilated in the attack at his home in an affluent Dublin suburb. Police have arrested Mr O’Gorman’s Italian lodger and senior security sources said the scene was ‘like an abattoir’. It was said to be so shocking that the two officers who found the body will be sent for trauma counselling. It is understood that the arrested man’s face and clothes were covered in blood  when officers arrived shortly before 2am yesterday. It is understood the arrested man – a 34-year-old who had been living with Mr O’Gorman for a number of months – was the person who alerted police. Investigating officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death, which will be treated as murder as soon as post-mortem examination results are confirmed. The arrested man calmly phoned them and led them into the sitting room where Mr O’Gorman’s body was. A senior source said: ‘This is a truly horrific killing and almost an unimaginable crime scene.’ In custody last night, the accused told officers that a row stemmed from Mr O’Gorman engaging in a chess move that was against the rules. Sources say there was ‘nothing to indicate’ the Italian – who is from Palermo but has been in Ireland for a number of years and works for a large pharmaceutical company – was a violent or crazed person. Mr O’Gorman and the man were said to be on ‘very friendly terms’ and were friends on Facebook. The crime scene was said to be so shocking that the two officers who found the body will be sent for trauma counselling . The victim had lived on his own in . the house after his mother, Ann, passed away two years ago. Last year he . started renting out a room in the detached house on Beechpark Avenue in . Castleknock, west Dublin. Police . have been liaising with Interpol to see if the arrested man has any . previous convictions in Italy or elsewhere. He has never come to their . attention before. It is expected the accused – who has made admissions relating to the attack – will be charged today. Security . sources said alcohol was ‘not a factor’ in the alleged attack and that . the accused appeared to have ‘lost it’ following the chess incident. Only Mr O’Gorman and his tenant were thought to be in the house at the . time. Mr O’Gorman . previously worked as a journalist for the Catholic newspaper The Voice . Today. For the past seven years, he worked as a researcher for the Iona . Institute, the conservative organisation which promotes religion in . society. The scene has been sealed off for a full technical examination by forensic experts . Institute director David Quinn yesterday spoke of the organisation’s ‘total shock and deep sorrow’. He said: ‘He was a fond and dear friend and we will all miss him. We extend our deepest commiserations to his family and above all to his sister and brother, Catherine and Paul. May Tom rest in peace.’It is believed Mr O’Gorman’s brother lives in Donegal and his sister is in England. Their father, Thomas, died a number of years ago. For the past ten years, Mr O’Gorman also served as a Minister of the Eucharist at Our Lady Mother of the Church, which is located on Beechpark Lawn, just around the corner from Mr O’Gorman’s house. Curate Fr Denis O’Connor said Mr O’Gorman was highly respected in the community. He told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘He was a lovely man, he was here every Sunday. It’s terrible… he was a very devout man.’ Asked how parishioners felt, he added: ‘The few that have heard it, they’re absolutely distressed and upset and troubled by it.’ Fr O’Connor added: ‘He was a gentleman, the poor man, that’s a terrible way he’s gone – no one should go like this, whatever happened. I don’t know what happened. May God give him rest and peace.’ Iona Institute director David Quinn (pictured) said: 'Tom was a friend as well as a work colleague to us all' Rory Maguire, a friend of Mr O’Gorman’s for 20 years, lay flowers at his house last night after finding out about the killing at Mass. He said: ‘I just broke down crying. I cried the whole way through Mass. Tom was an extraordinary person. ‘We just instantly became friends… He was tremendous, he was so funny… He was an absolute gem.’ Mr Maguire, who went to primary school with Mr O’Gorman, said Mr O’Gorman was ‘genuinely loved’. He said: ‘He was an enormously deep person and an absolute gentleman.’ Editor of the Irish Catholic Newspaper Michael Kelly also expressed his shock. He tweeted: ‘Very sad at the murder of a friend in Castleknock. An absolute gent and all-round good guy.’ Mr O’Gorman had a BA and MLitt in history from University College Dublin and a Diploma in Legal Studies from the Dublin Institute of Technology. One neighbour also said he attended Castleknock College. His body was removed from the scene yesterday for a postmortem by State pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy. Last night the house remained sealed off for a forensic examination. The Italian man remained in custody in Blanchardstown police station last night. On his Facebook page it says he is a customer service representative at Allergan pharmaceuticals. It says he has a masters in business ethics, consumption and social responsibility from the University of Siena – Arezzo.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A couple who both suffered  severe head injuries that left them with the long-term brain damage and severe memory loss have credited their newborn baby as their 'living timekeeper'. Louise and Geraint Jones, from Llantrisant, South Wales, have both suffered injuries that changed their lives for ever. Louise, 29, and Geraint's long-term memories are poor and their short-term memory is limited to around 24 hours. Louise and Geraint Jones say that newborn baby Cian is a living timekeeper.The Welsh parents both suffered severe head injuries that left them with the long-term brain damage and severe memory loss . But the arrival of their newborn baby Cian in March this year has turned their lives around in many ways - not least because having a child appears to have boosted both their memories. Geraint, 28, has a memory so short he relies on reminders he sets on his phone to help him complete simple everyday tasks. At the height of his memory loss, he would set an average of five reminders per hour, or nearly 90 reminders a day, to do everything from cooking meals to leaving the house. Living with memory loss can be dangerous - Geraint has set fire to his kitchen towels on five occasions, when he forgot to switch off the cooker. Louise copes with her forgetfulness through disciplined ritual, where she performs the same strict routine each-day. But Cian, born in March this year, has improved his father's memory so much that instead of 90 phone reminders, he now only needs three or four to survive the day. Geraint (left) was the victim of an unprovoked attack in 2007 when he escorted a female friend home late at night. He was left with brain damage, a broken jaw and severe cuts and bruises . Louise Jones (centre) is pictured out with friends before being hit by a car in 2007. She suffered a fractured skull, hip and jaw and still suffers with balance problems and severe memory loss. 'My memory is improving every day since Cian came along,' said Geraint. 'When it comes to him we have the same schedule every day because he is regular as clockwork. 'Not only is he the happy son we would have wished for, but, I find when it comes to his needs, I remember to do everything I need to for him. 'I know exactly when to feed him, cuddle him and take him out in his pushchair. With such little person to look after and my brain seems to have switched into a higher gear since he came along. Louise and Geraint Jones married June 2011. The pair met in 2008 after meeting at the Head Start support group for people with head injuries. 'I don't just feel like a new father, I feel like a new man thanks to my little boy.' Despite this change in their fortunes, Geraint and Louise have overcome life changing injuries to start a family together. In 2007, Louise was left in a coma after she was hit by a car while walking home on a night out with friends. She suffered a fractured skull, hip and jaw and was hospitalised for five months. Since Cian's birth in March this year, Louise and Geraint have lived according to his bodyclock. They say that Cian wakes up at 1.30am and Geraint gets up, washes him and . then brings him to Louise for feeding . She still suffers loss of balance, severe memory loss, fatigue and walking problems. Geraint was the victim of an unprovoked attack  in May 2004 when he was escorting a female friend home late at night. He ended up in intensive care for a week with brain damage, a broken jaw and severe cuts and bruises. The pair fell in love in 2008 after meeting at the Head Start support group for people with head injuries. They married in June 2011. By 10.30pm the parents are in bed for an early start the next day to tend to baby Cian. The couple get help from all four grandparents and they employ two support workers to help them . Louise agrees that Geraint's memory has improved considerably since Cian was born. She said: 'When I ask for Geraint to get food out of the freezer for tea, he often tells me - ""Yes love I'll do it in a minute""'. 'Of course, within moments he will have totally forgotten and will start something completely different, leaving me hungry. 'But when it comes to Cian, he'll be up in the morning making the bottles ready without me even saying anything to him. 'I don't understand how he can remember Cian's needs without any problem - but everything else, including me, he'll easily forget about.' Thanks to baby Cian, Louise and Geraint are more independent than ever . The family now follow a schedule based around Cian's predictable body-clock. 'Cian now wakes up at 1.30am in the morning,' she said. 'Geraint will get up, clean and wash him if he needs it and then bring him to me for feeding before he goes back to sleep. 'Then by 6.30am Cian will wake up again and we'll do the same. By eight o'clock, we'll be preparing breakfast for ourselves. 'Then by ten, I'll go shopping and Geraint will be at home doing any household jobs that need doing. We have lunch together at one in the afternoon and dinner by seven. 'By 10.30pm, we're in bed for an early start the next day.' Louise, Geraint and Cian get help from all-four grandparents, plus two support workers they employ to help them. They hope that as Cian grows up, his memory will help them get by even more so. 'We hope as he grows up and starts to speak, Cian's memory will help us get by even better as a family,' said his father. Peter McCabe, Chief Executive of brain injury association Headway said: . 'It is heartwarming to see Louise and Geraint doing so well and proving there is life after brain injury. 'Memory loss following brain injury is common and can take many forms. 'For some, it can mean losing the memory of significant periods of their lives, while for others short-term memory loss can make performing basic everyday tasks that most of us would not think twice about a real challenge. 'While there is no simple solution to memory loss, at Headway we help people to develop coping strategies to help them manage the effects of their brain injuries. This support can be vital to individuals and families as they look to rebuild their lives following brain injury.'","Louise Jones, 29, was knocked down by a car in 2007, hospitalised for 5 months and left with poor memory, balance problems and difficulty walking .
Geraint Jones, 28, was attacked after walking a female friend home and was left with memory loss, brain damage, a broken jaw and deep cuts .
Geraint's memory was so poor he had to set 90 reminders - to do things such as leave the house and cook a meal -  on his phone each day .
But since birth of son Cian in March, Geraint must only set 3 or 4 each day ."
"By . James Chapman . Open NHS: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured yesterday at the Healthcare Innovation Expo 2013, will outlaw 'gagging clauses' for NHS staff . Gagging clauses which have prevented hundreds of NHS whistleblowers speaking out are to be outlawed. Departing staff will instead be given a new legal right to raise issues that could be in the public interest, such as patient safety, death rates and poor care. Last night Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted that creating a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ across the NHS was vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which as many as 1,200 patients died. In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said that so-called ‘compromise agreements’, under which NHS staff cannot raise anything embarrassing to their employers when they leave their jobs, would be barred with immediate effect. ‘There has been a culture where people felt if you speak up about problems in the NHS you didn’t love the NHS. Actually, it’s exactly the opposite,’ the Health Secretary said. ‘We need a culture of openness and transparency if we are going to stop another Mid Staffs from happening. 'The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end.’ Senior figures in the NHS had warned that the case of whistleblower Gary Walker, who broke a gagging clause to speak to the Mail about high death rates, was the tip of the iceberg. MPs want to question embattled NHS boss Sir David Nicholson about £14.7million of taxpayers’ money spent over three years on almost 600 ‘compromise agreements’ with departing staff. An estimated 90 per cent of the documents contain gagging clauses which ensure potential whistleblowers are silenced, but there have been growing calls for the practice to be stopped. The Health Secretary said: ‘We are just going to ban them. All these compromise agreements have to be approved by the Department of Health and the Treasury. ‘We are now saying we won’t approve any with a confidentiality clause that prevents people speaking out about patient safety or patient care. 'We will make sure there is a specific clause in them saying that nothing in them can prevent people speaking out on issues such as patient care. ‘Mid Staffs happened because there was a culture of covering up problems. We need to encourage front-line NHS employees who see problems to come forward, in the first instance to tell their own institution about them but then having the ability to go beyond that if they don’t think anything is being done about their concerns. Gagging culture: NHS boss David Nicholson, pictured speaking at the same event as the Health Secretary yesterday, may be questioned over the £14.7million of taxpayers' money spent on 'gagging' departing staff . First step: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the ban on gagging is only part of the government's response to what happened at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust . ‘That culture of openness and transparency is at the heart of what we are going to try to do to drive up standards across the NHS. ‘This can only be part of our response to Mid Staffs. If we have a culture where whistleblowing is necessary then obviously something has gone wrong.’ Mr Hunt said a new chief inspector of hospitals would be charged with ‘creating a culture of consistent striving for excellence’. ‘The chief inspector will examine lots of areas, but one third of the entire score for a hospital will be based on patient experience – the extent to which patients would recommend your hospital to friends and family, the extent to which your complaints procedure actually listens to people,’ the Health Secretary said. ‘In too many hospitals, staff think that patient care is something you do when you have done everything else.’ Previous headlines: The Mail reporting on the whistle-blowers on February 15 this year . Mr Walker claimed he was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals on a trumped-up charge after raising concerns about patient safety. The father of two said he accepted a so-called supergag as part of a settlement package of an unfair dismissal claim, reported to be at least £500,000, in 2010. He broke the terms to speak out last month about a ‘culture of fear’ in the NHS. He claimed Sir David Nicholson ignored him when he raised concerns about patient safety in 2009. Despite indications that support for Sir David is waning in Number Ten, Mr Hunt said he had an ‘honest disagreement’ with those calling for the head of the NHS to resign. ‘I don’t think he was personally responsible for Mid Staffs. He was part of a whole targets culture that went badly wrong so he has responsibility in the same way that all managers did,’ he said. ‘But he also led the campaign to bring down MRSA rates and bring down waiting lists.’ Ministers also fear the disruption that would be caused by Sir David’s exit in the next few weeks, with 30,000 people in the NHS due to start new jobs on April 1 as a result of the Government’s NHS reforms. Sir David is due to appear before MPs investigating disastrous health service IT projects next week, but members of the public accounts committee also want to question him about his own expenses claims. By Claire Ellicott . Gag: Daily Mail on February 18 this year . Journalists were banned from filming Sir David Nicholson’s speech and asking him questions at a conference where he spoke of promoting ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS. Some photographers were also told they could not take pictures at yesterday’s event where the embattled head of the NHS gave the keynote speech. Sir David talked of developing a culture of being ‘absolutely clear about both the good things and the bad things that happen in our NHS’. Television crews were prevented from filming his speech but afterwards he gave a short statement to them. Sir David would not take questions and NHS press officers asked TV crews not to follow him around during the rest of the NHS conference. He is under pressure to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died between 2005 and 2009. For part of that time, Sir David was chief executive of the strategic health authority that oversaw the Mid Staffordshire trust. Robert Francis QC published his report into the scandal last month. During his speech, Sir David said: ‘He [Francis] talks about a culture, a positive culture of learning, of openness, of transparency, of getting information out and being absolutely clear about both the good things and the bad things that happened in our NHS in a pretty matter of fact and organised way. ‘That is exactly the culture that you need to develop and support innovation. That open and transparent culture… That is the culture we should develop and promote in the NHS.’ Journalists vented their frustration at the secrecy surrounding his appearance at the ExCel Centre in east London. Victoria Macdonald, Channel 4 health reporter, tweeted: ‘This is a first. told we can’t film David Nicholson speech today. Sensing the hands of Downing St in this one.’","Jeremy Hunt bans 'compromise agreements' gagging departing NHS staff .

"By . Dan Bloom . Tonnes of clothes are feared to be destroyed after a fire ripped through four floors of fashion giant ASOS's only British warehouse. More than 50 firefighters were called on Friday night to the firm's headquarters in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, which is the size of six football pitches and handles £1.2billion in sales a year. No one was injured but 500 staff were evacuated and thousands of potential customers left in limbo after the company replaced its website with a message saying it was 'pausing' all new orders. Today the firm said customers would be able to apply for refunds as photos emerged of a huge pile of shoes, shirts and dresses outside the warehouse. Up in smoke: Huge piles of clothes were amassed outside ASOS' warehouse today after an arson attack . The major fashion firm is still assessing the damage, which looks to include shoes, dresses and shirts . Vast: An estimated 10million items were in the distribution centre. It is not known how many were damaged . Staff had not yet been allowed back into the building this afternoon while the clean-up operation was under way. In a statement, ASOS said its 'overriding concern' was its staff, adding: 'We are very relieved that no one has been hurt.' ASOS spokesman Matthew Smallwood told MailOnline today: 'I can confirm that some orders have been delayed but cannot confirm how many at the moment. When will my clothes arrive? Some orders have been delayed, but the firm can't yet confirm how many, or for how long. However, it says the warehouse will hopefully be back up and running tomorrow. Has my order been cancelled? At this point ASOS is not believed to have cancelled any orders - yours will come, but it might take a little longer. I don't want to wait. How do I get a refund? Visit the firm's customer services page and click 'cancel order'. 'Customers will either receive a full refund or get their orders as soon as possible.' Mr Smallwood could not confirm what proportion of the firm's stock was damaged, but said: 'As in any fire there are some items that are fire damaged, some that are smoke damaged and some that are water damaged.' Customers calling this morning had difficulty confirming whether their orders had been disrupted or when the service would be back online. Though most expressed sympathy for the staff, some complained about the fire on Twitter. @Lameese_Yousif said: 'Can't believe I probably won't receive my prom dress. Thanks alot ASOS', while @HeyItsJoy added: 'Thanks asos... I really wanted to order today aswell. Can we all get free next day delivery pls pls.' A statement on the website for ASOS, short for As Seen On Screen, said: 'Dear Customers, we have pressed pause on the ASOS website, this is due . to a fire in our Barnsley distribution centre in the early hours of . Saturday morning. Huge: The ASOS warehouse in Barnsley claims to be the largest employer in South Yorkshire . Back to work: Staff clean up at the ASOS warehouse in Barnsley after it was hit by a fire on Friday night . Damage: Despite the scale of the fire, ASOS said it hoped operations would be back to normal within a day . Reaction: Not all customers were sympathetic - one on Twitter was upset after the website went offline . Prom dress: Fashionistas voiced their shock at the fire - as well as the delay to their summer wardrobes . Offline: How the ASOS website appeared this morning after a huge fire ripped through its distribution centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. All new orders have been temporarily suspended, the firm said . Launched in 2000 by Briton Nick Robertson (right) - the great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed - and fellow entrepreneur Quentin Griffiths, ASOS is now one of the biggest fashion names in the country. Making its name with loud, characteristic prints and own-brand designs, the firm exploded into life despite critics insisting shoppers would want to try things on before buying. By 2005 it had a million users, but user numbers would only truly take off once it introduced free shipping in 2010. Last year it boasted offices in New York, Lille, Berlin and Shanghai and almost 8million users. Its founders are now multi-millionaires, a status unlikely to be rocked by this week's fire. In 2005 the firm faced a remarkably similar setback when its previous warehouse was damaged in the Buncefield oil terminal explosion in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The firm's finances could be dented, however. With it hoping to make £1.2billion of sales through the warehouse this year, each day lost to the fire could cost an average of £3.2million. 'Thankfully . no one was hurt and we expect to be back to normal for you in the next . day or so. So please hold on to your orders, we will be back with you . soon'. Customers can ask about refunds through the company's customer services line. South Yorkshire Police are treating the fire just after 10pm on Friday as deliberate. The . warehouse, which claims to be the largest employer in South Yorkshire . with 3,000 workers on peak days, contained an estimated 10million . clothes packages when the fire broke out. Investigating . Fire Officer for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, Simon Rodgers, said: . 'The fire involved four floors of the warehouse and the blaze was . contained in the area of origin by firefighters. 'ASOS staff had a good evacuation process in place which assisted the . emergency services and allowed the fire to be brought under control more . quickly.' Three of the ten fire engines had to be called in from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue. A . fire service spokesman said at 7am today: 'The fire is now out, with . one fire engine remaining at the scene to ensure any remaining ""hot . spots"" to not reignite. 'At its height, the fire was tackled by 10 fire engines, an aerial ladder platform and a High Volume Pump.' Michael . Dugher, MP for Barnsley East , tweeted last night: 'Huge thanks to the . brilliant crews from @SYFR + @West-Yorks-FRS for tackling the @ASOS . fire. They do a magnificent job. Glad no one hurt.' One . of Brtiain's fastest-growing online firms, the retailer sells fashion . and beauty products and last year made sales of more than £750million. Blaze: The fire spread to four floors of the warehouse in Barnsley and involved more than 50 firefighters . Fashion giant: How the retailer's website usually looks. It expects sales to top £1billion this year . Global hub: ASOS runs its operations from the warehouse in Barnsley and it had around 10million packages .

"By . Nick Fagge . Tributes have been paid to a British construction worker apparently killed by terrorists in Nigeria. Brendan Vaughan was named by Foreign Secretary William Hague as the British national believed to have been murdered - along with six other foreigners - at the hands of captors. Mr Hague condemned the likely killing as 'cold-blooded murder' and said he would work with the Nigerian government to bring those behind the attack to account. Shot dead: British engineer Brendan Vaughan, pictured with girlfriend Orasa Arpornkaew, was murdered 'in cold blood' in Nigeria by Al Qaeda kidnappers . No further details about Mr Vaughan . have been released but tributes have begun to be posted on Facebook by . friends of construction worker Brendan Vaughan, who is originally from . Leeds but now lives in Thailand. One of Mr Vaughan's friends - Peter Dixon - left a message on the site saying 'Rip mate'. Mr Vaughan's Thai girlfriend, Orasa Arpornkaew, wrote: 'You're always in my heart.' Dom Cooney posted: 'Can't believe it. he was like an ox.' Mr Vaughan's page includes details of where he was working in Nigeria and photos of armed protection guards at his compound. It appears he had left West Yorkshire and started a new life in Thailand with Ms Arpornkaew. Scroll down for video . Online: A video was posted online by Islamist terror group Ansaru, claiming that they had killed seven hostages captured in February. Nigeria's President claimed today that some of the hostages might actually still be alive . Operation: Reports appeared on a local Nigerian website two weeks ago saying that five British planes were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja and linking them to a rescue operation for the hostages . Yesterday, Mr Hague said in a statement: 'This was an act of cold-blooded murder, which I condemn in the strongest terms. 'My thoughts are with his family, and the families of the other hostages, who will be devastated by this tragic loss. 'I offer them our deep condolences at . this terrible time, and know that the thoughts of people up and down . our country will be with them.' He added: 'Responsibility for this . tragic outcome rests squarely with the terrorists. I am grateful to the . Nigerian government for their unstinting help and co-operation. 'We are utterly determined to work . with them to hold the perpetrators of this heinous act to account, and . to combat the terrorism which so blights the lives of people in northern . Nigeria and in the wider region.' Foreign Secretary William Hague called Mr Vaughan's murder. He also vowed to work with the Nigerian government to bring the killers to justice . Those kidnapped included three . Lebanese citizens and one each from Britain, Greece, Italy and the . Philippines - all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company . with an operation in Bauchi state, local officials said at the time. A message from Ansaru, the extremist . group behind the February 16 kidnappings, said on Friday that the . hostages were killed after British warplanes were reported to have been . seen in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi by local journalists. In a statement, the group said: 'As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed.' Commenting on the claim, the Foreign . Office said: 'There are a number of deployments as parts of various . engagements in Africa which will include the movement of assets.' Earlier yesterday, an Italian foreign ministry statement said all seven hostages had been killed in this latest case. Pictured: An image taken from a video previously issued by Nigeria Islamist group Ansaru, standing behind a banner reading 'Ansar al--Muslimeen in the Land of Black Africans' The statement said: 'It is an . atrocious act of terrorism, against which the Italian government . expresses the most firm condemnation, for which it can find no . explanation, except barbarous and blind violence.' The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs . said in a statement that 'the information available points to the death . of a Greek citizen' and his family had been notified. The statement said the ministry . believed no operation was mounted to free the hostages and the extremist . group at no stage either communicated or expressed demands for the . release of the hostages. Ansaru said a video of the killings . would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting . appeared to show a gunman standing over bodies. Statement: The message, attributed to Ansaru, posted online claiming that the seven hostages had been killed . Local media: A report, published by Leadership Weekend, claimed that five British 'jet bombers' were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja . Ansaru cited two local media reports claiming . that British planes had arrived in Nigeria to assist a rescue operation . for the terrorists but the MoD categorically denied that British troops . were involved in a rescue . Workers: The group were all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company with an operation in Bauchi state . Industry: Photographs from Setraco's site showing the company's workers carrying out various operations . A British hostage was killed by his captors in Nigeria in March 2010 when a UK Special Forces rescue operation ended in tragedy. Chris McManus was executed by gunmen as members of the Special Boat Service and Nigerian soldiers moved in on the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists’ hideaway. Fellow hostage, Italian Franco Lamolinara, was also killed. The pair had been held for ten months. Footage of the 28-year-old engineer blindfolded alongside three armed men was broadcast, showing the terrified hostage pleading for his life. The botched rescue was triggered when – after months of searching – the SBS found the heavily protected location where the men were being held. Mr Cameron said authorities had decided to go ahead with the rescue after receiving 'credible information about [the men's] location'. They claimed a message from Nigerian . President Goodluck Jonathan which said the government would do anything . in its power to free the hostages also sparked the decision to kill the . hostages. Ansaru previously issued a short . statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners on . February 16 from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about . 125 miles (201km) north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state. The attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, authorities said. Then the attackers blew up a back fence at the construction company's . compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and . police said. The gunmen appeared to be organised . and knew who they wanted to target, leaving the Nigerian staff unharmed, . while the foreigners were quickly abducted, a witness said. In January 2012, Ansaru declared . itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main . terrorist group, analysts say. Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western . education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings . and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. Boko Haram has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to a recent estimate. Yesterday, a military spokesman said . at least two soldiers and 52 Boko Haram fighters were killed in . Maiduguri in fighting after a visit by the president. It is not the first time hostages have been killed in Nigeria. British national Chris McManus and . Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara died in a failed rescue bid in March . last year as Nigerian troops and UK Special Boat Service commandos . tried to end their nine months in captivity.
