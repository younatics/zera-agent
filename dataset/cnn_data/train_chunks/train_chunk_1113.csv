"Mikael Lustig has rubbed salt in Rangers’ wounds by insisting they are currently no match for Aberdeen or Dundee United — let alone Celtic. Ronny Deila’s side eased to a League Cup Final showdown with United on March 15 after comfortably seeing off the Ibrox men 2-0 on Sunday. In what was widely regarded as the most one-sided derby in history, the Premiership leaders progressed to the showpiece without the need for Craig Gordon to make a meaningful save. Mikael Lustig says that Rangers deserve to be in the Scottish Premiership but aren't better than many teams . Given Rangers’ Championship status, Lustig acknowledged he and his Celtic colleagues were only doing what was expected of them. He believes that if their greatest rivals claim a Premiership place in time for next season, they will struggle to usurp the teams currently sitting second and fourth in the table, either side of Inverness Caley Thistle. ‘Rangers should be in the Premiership because they still have some decent players,’ said the Swede. ‘But I think, right now, Aberdeen and Dundee United are better teams.’ Asked if he was surprised at Celtic’s domination of their old foes, Lustig replied: ‘Not really. Obviously, we should be better. I think the first goal was really important and, once we went 2-0 up, that was it. ‘They stayed with the same tactics and dropped back. We still managed to find spaces between their back four, though. ‘In the first 10 minutes, we started with a really good tempo. We were speaking with each other during the whole game to stay focused. We knew if they scored and made it 2-1, it could have been different — but I felt really comfortable. ‘They maybe had one shot or cross that was a bit dangerous, but that was it. We made it difficult for Rangers and we wanted to score more goals, but you also don’t want to concede anything.’ Hoops striker Leigh Griffiths (28) heads his side into the lead on ten minutes and sends them on their way . Victory in the first derby in three years was just the first assignment of a defining period for Celtic. A trip to Dens Park in the Scottish Cup awaits on Saturday, with home and away clashes against Inter Milan in the Europa League the tasty appetisers for a Premiership clash with Aberdeen at Celtic Park on March 1. ‘February is a big month for us,’ Lustig added. ‘We are in the League Cup Final and still in every competition. We just need to be ready. ‘We have been strong recently and not conceded many goals. If we are strong defensively, we will be good in attack, too. We are looking better every week. ‘We will get asked questions because Aberdeen have been winning, but we have to focus on our game. If we play to the level we know we can, we should be able to beat teams.’ Even before Leigh Griffiths’ header laid the foundations for the most perfunctory of wins, it was apparent Kenny McDowall’s chances of semi-final success were about as high as the man who seeks to scoop the lottery without first buying a ticket. Shorn of quality, the Rangers caretaker manager had little option but to load his midfield, sit deep and limit the space in which Celtic’s fleet-footed front four could operate. Kris Commons (15) celebrates after scoring Celtic's second goal and is mobbed by his team-mates . The pay-off was that veteran Kenny Miller spent much of the game operating in a different postcode from his team-mates. His withdrawal to a deeper role at the interval, with substitute Jon Daly thrown further forward, proved about as threatening as a pop gun. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon could have kept goal in his dinner suit without so much as a thought for dry cleaning. ‘Rangers played how we thought they might, trying to get men behind the ball and looking to hit us on the counter-attacks with a more direct ball,’ said Gordon. ‘They were just looking for one of them to fall kindly. It doesn’t take a great deal of luck for that to work, a misplaced header or whatever it might be, and they have a chance. But it didn’t work out for them. ‘We dealt with it fairly well and read whatever they tried. ‘When Jon Daly came on, he made things a bit more difficult, winning a few more balls. But we managed to read the flick-ons and not give them any chances.’ The players clash in a highly-heated match between the two Old Firm rivals in the League Cup semi-finals . Down the years, Celtic’s goalkeepers have had to become familiar with long periods of inactivity on those occasions where the front line are engaged with putting cannon fodder to the sword. In such circumstances, complacency can creep in. ‘I made sure I kept my concentration,’ added Gordon, now a veteran of the Edinburgh, Tyne-Wear and Glasgow derbies. ‘From the start, I was looking to dominate my box and come to take any balls coming in. I knew that if we gave away free-kicks, they would be looking to put us under pressure. ‘That was my mindset — to be aggressive, come for crosses and aim to take the pressure off us. ‘We were comfortable in the game. It was about us controlling what we could and trying to play football on what was a difficult surface.’","Celtic beat Rangers 2-0 in Old Firm clash on Sunday .

"Police officers may face compulsory fitness tests and diets to help them get in shape after it emerged that up to one in five is clinically obese. A major review of policing has called for running tests and assault course-style assessments to ensure officers can carry on chasing criminals. Anyone who cannot meet minimum fitness standards – including the most senior officers – would face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal. The review of police pay and . conditions, which was published yesterday, also recommends that the . retirement age for new recruits should be raised from 55 to 60. The review said a survey of one force had found that barely one in four male officers was normal weight. In . the Metropolitan Police 52 per cent of male officers and staff were . overweight, 22 per cent were obese and 1 per cent were morbidly obese. Blobbies on the beat: Police officers may face annual fitness tests to make sure they stay in shape . One senior officer told the review some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot complete the warm-up exercises’. The review was carried out by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, who said police employment practices had been largely unchanged for 35 years and could not be left alone because of the budget crisis. The report recommends major reforms aimed at saving £1.9billion over five years. It also calls for: . Review: Tom Winsor recommended in his report published today that police officers should face annual fitness tests . The starting salary for police constables to be cut from the current £23,500 to £19,000 for someone with no police-related experience. An end to automatic pay rises for years of service and new performance-related pay scales for in-demand skills and unsocial hours. Ending the ban on making officers redundant, to allow chief constables to cut jobs when budgets fall. Direct entry into the police at superintendent rank for outsiders from business, the military and the security service and fast-track schemes for high-flying graduates. If accepted in full by Home Secretary Theresa May, the changes would mark a major step away from the ‘job for life’ culture. Currently most police retire at around 50 on a full pension after 30 years’ service. Those who joined in 2006 and after will have to work until 55 and complete 35 years’ service to claim a full pension. Mr Winsor recommends the retirement age should increase by five years to 60. Currently the only fitness tests are for those applying to become police officers, or those joining specialist squads such as firearms. Under the recommendations anyone who repeatedly fails fitness tests should be put on restricted duties, lose nearly £3,000 a year from their pay and ultimately be dismissed. By September next year officers should be able to complete a series of 15metre shuttle runs, keeping up with an accelerating beep for three and a half minutes, and basic strength tests. Although new police officers face a fitness exam when they sign up, there is no re-testing. With such a lax regime, It is little surprise that 52 per cent of policemen in the Metropolitan Police are overweight. When they are first recruited, would-be officers face a running test and two strength exams. Officers have to undergo the bleep test - running between two points 20 metres apart. The bleeps get steadily faster throughout the test. Police recruits have to achieve level 5.4 - which is the equivalent to running at 5.5mph for three minutes 35 seconds. As the average walking speed is 3mph, participants barely need to break into a run to pass. The test has been described as a 'joke' by serving officers. Australian Police forces also use a bleep test when testing recruits who have to achieve up to level nine. From next September, officers could face annual retests. In the strength test, officers have to push a 34kg weight and pull a 35kg weight. In addition, they have to have a grip strength of at least 32kg. This is measured on a dynamometer. By September 2018 all officers should . pass an assault course-style circuit test including crawling, jumping, . climbing, running up stairs and dragging a ‘body’ away from danger. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment . should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms to help . them get fit. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses, . or given health and diet advice. The report said that having too many . officers who were unfit could undermine the response to major incidents . such as last summer’s riots. Mr Winsor said: 'It is clear that the . existing pay system is unfair and inefficient. It was designed in 1920 . and has remained largely unchanged since 1978. But he added: 'Officers who work on . the front line, exercising their powers as constables in the most . difficult circumstances, have nothing to fear from this review.' Mr . Winsor said: 'I think the public will be surprised that after passing a . fitness test at the point of entry, except in special units like . firearms, physical fitness is not tested again in a 30, 35-year career.' An initial annual test requiring . officers to reach level 5:4 on the bleep test should be brought in by . September next year, he said. This is equivalent to an average speed of 8.8kph (5.5mph) for three minutes 35 seconds, he said. Former West Midlands chief constable Sir Edward Crew, who worked on the review, added: 'We are not looking for supermen.' Mr Winsor predicted that many officers . would welcome the proposals, saying they would see it 'as a necessary . protection for themselves and the public'. Mr Winsor also said a 'system of . compulsory severance for police officers with less than full pensionable . service, analogous to redundancy, would materially improve the ability . of chief officers to alter forces’ workforce size, structure and . composition according to the projected needs of those forces and the . public they serve'.","Police officers face fitness testing when signing up - but no retesting in a 35-year career .

"Showbusiness veteran Cilla Black, pictured on Loose Women last week, said she prefers to see younger people on television . As a showbusiness veteran herself, you might expect Cilla Black to stand up for older presenters. So it is something of a surprise to find she would rather not see them on TV at all. Miss Black, 70, said she prefers to see young and pretty faces on screen, and only thinks ageing stars should stay on TV if they are especially talented. She told the Observer magazine: ‘I don’t want to see older women on TV. I want to see young people on TV. Unless they’ve got talent. Then they should stay. ‘It’s all about the talent. [David] Dimbleby has talent.’ Best known for presenting Blind Date from 1985 to 2003, Miss Black has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances. She had been due to star in a BBC sitcom with chat show host Paul O’Grady but the project was axed amid concerns she would be unable to stand the long filming hours. Asked if she would like to replace former Strictly Come Dancing host Bruce Forsyth, 86, Miss Black said: ‘Ha, I couldn’t do that, I couldn’t dance down those stairs. ‘Anyway I’d get bored, I’d be saying, “Enough about you. It’s all about me.” 'But I’m so distressed Brucie’s going. He’s 86, of course. He probably wants more time to do what he wants to do.’ Miss Black began her career more than 50 years ago as a singer, and had a string of top ten hits in the Sixties and Seventies. After a brief time as a comedy actress, she became a TV presenter in the 1980s. Her husband Bobby Willis, who died in 1999 from cancer, was her manager for much of her career. Miss Black revealed she was only asked to host Blind Date because she was considered the ‘most sexless person on TV’, adding: ‘I was the mother hen’. She said: ‘I never thought I’d be on TV. For me as a kid in Liverpool it was a more realistic option to be a singer. You need a personality [to succeed on TV]. You need to be able to articulate and to join in. Miss Black said older presenters with talent such as David Dimbelby, right, could stay on television. She added she couldn't do Bruce Forsyth's, left, old job of presenting Strictly Come Dancing as she 'couldn't dance down those stairs' ‘Live TV can spot fakery a long way off so you have to be real. And you also need to not care what people say about you.’ Miss Black eventually quit Blind Date live on air in 2003. Explaining her decision to surprise her bosses with the announcement, she said: ‘I didn’t want them to talk me out of it. It was terribly unprofessional of me.’ Despite her age, Miss Black revealed she is a fan of reality TV shows aimed at much younger audiences. The ex-host of Surprise Surprise and Blind Date also admitted she was a big fan of reality television shows Britain's Got Talent and I'm A Celebrity . She said: ‘I love things like Britain’s Got talent and the I’m a Celeb...reality TV is here to stay.’ In 2010, Miss Black revealed she did not want to live beyond the age of 75. She said: ‘That would be a good point to bow out. I don’t want to go on for ever. I was reading about an age pill that has been developed which they claim will make you live longer. That is not for me.’ But she admitted she might reconsider her time limit if she approached her mid-70s feeling healthy. She said: ‘If I could still fit into my jeans, have fun and not be a burden to anyone, I might feel differently.’","TV veteran, 70, said she only wants to see young 'pretty' people on TV .

"There’s nothing like grabbing an ice-cream or lolly on a hot day. And now scientists have worked out the exact temperature it needs to be before holidaymakers fancy a frozen treat. As soon as the thermostat hits 18C, sales of lollies, choc ices and cornets increase, according to a study. Time for an ice cream! Ice lolly sales soar as soon as the temperature hits 18C, according to research . Jon Goldstone, vice-president of brand building in the UK and Ireland for Unilever, whose scientists carried out the research, said when summer days hit even higher temperatures than that demand soars. He said: ‘Eighteen degrees Celsius is the magic number - when the thermometer hits 18, this is when we start to see a spike in consumer demand. ‘After prolonged periods of 18-plus temperatures, we usually see a ten-fold increase in sales in the out-of-home market. ‘Ice cream is the most seasonal food for summer, and when the sun comes out it's not surprising that we see a direct correlation between the temperature and the number of ice creams eaten.’ The company, which owns a host of favourites including Wall's, Magnum, Solero, Twister and Viennetta, set out to discover the exact temperature the weather had to reach before sun-worshippers sought out an ice cream treat. Chilling out: More than 3,200 tonnes of ice cream were made every week throughout July . Thanks to the hot summer, sales have soared and the UK's biggest ice cream factory, in Gloucestershire, had to increase shifts on most of its production lines. It was churning out 3,243 tonnes of ice cream every week at the rate of 0.45 tonnes per minute. One of the brands made there, Magnum, is currently being produced at the rate of 1,125 per minute. For years Britons lagged behind their European counterparts in ice cream consumption, Unilever said, but sales are up 1.5 per cent since June last year. However, frozen yoghurt is rapidly out-pacing ice cream in terms of growth, with the total UK category now worth £13.2m, up 33.9 per cent in the last year, latest figures show. The figures were revealed as weather experts said the warm weather is on its way back - with forecasters predicting a scorching start to September. The cold, wet conditions of the last few weeks are to give way to a settled spell bringing back memories of the above-average temperatures of June and July. That was replaced by cooler weather this month - but it is all set to change again next week.","Warm UK summer has seen 3,400 tonnes of ice cream made a week .

"A Canadian pastry chef has come up with the next calorie-laden bakery must-have: the crookie. The cookie-croissant mix is made by stuffing croissant dough with crushed Double Stuf Oreos and icing sugar, then baking it with half an Oreo placed on top. The sweet invention, born in the ovens of Toronto's Clafouti Patisserie et Cafe, materialises into a delicious-looking cake, flaky and gooey all at once. Olivier's decided to attempt integrating Oreos with universally loved croissants . 'When you bite in, it's creamy and . sweet, with the cream wrapping itself in the croissant dough and a . crunchiness from the Oreo bits,' says Clafouti owner and baker Olivier Jansen-Reynaud according to Thrillist. Toronto-based publication The Grid TO challenged Jansen-Reynaud to create a new dessert using two classic but different ingredients. Oreos became French-born Olivier's favorite cookie when he arrived in Canada many years ago, and so he decided to attempt integrating them with universally loved croissants. It took several tries to get the shape correct so that the oozy Oreo cream stayed within the flaky pastry layers. The hybrid is made by stuffing croissant dough with crushed Double Stuf Oreos and icing sugar . And now Canadian customers are ordering the perfected dessert by the half-dozen, and Jansen-Reynaud says the looks forward to ramping up production to keep up with increasing demand. If they start making them in the USA, the . crookie poses a viable alternative for office workers who don't have . half an hour to spend queuing up for a trendy cronut - the famous croissant-donut hybrid. Manhattan bakery Dominique Ansel invented the cronut - half . croissant, half donut - in May and now attracts huge queues to form outside its premises, selling out within an hour. The cronut, which has already received interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Los Angeles, is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream. Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish. 'A cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant'. The cronut quietly unveiled . by New York's Dominique Ansel bakery now sells 200 an hour .","Clafouti Patisserie et Cafe in Toronto, Canada, have invented the crookie .

"It's rare enough to fall pregnant aged 64... for it to be twins is even rarer. And in China it is even rarer still to be allowed to keep your twins thanks to a one-child policy that's been in force since the 1970s. But Sheng Hailin managed to achieve all three when she became China's oldest mother four years ago giving birth to daughters Zhizhi and Huihui aged 60. Sheng and her husband decided that . she wanted to become a mother again after her daughter, 29, was killed . by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2009. Happy family: Sheng Hailin became China's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins Zhizhi and Huihui when she was 60. Four years on she says she couldn't be happier . Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from loneliness.' So, in a rare move for the country which enforces a one-child policy, a military hospital in Heifei agreed to give Mrs Hailin and her husband IVF treatment. And in 2010 she gave birth to Zhizhi and Huihui. They are now aged three. Following their birth, Sheng has returned to work as a medical worker giving health lectures and also spends more than 10,000 Yuan (£949) a month on two helpers because she is no longer able to undertake some physical tasks of looking after the children, such as bathing. Young at heart: Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from loneliness' Rare exception: In a rare move for the country which has enforced a one-child policy since the 1970s, a military hospital in Heifei agreed to give Mrs Hailin and her husband IVF treatment . She says: 'For the baby girls, I have given out all I have?' The mother, who works as a health lecturer, added: 'Some lectures may only last one day, but sometimes I have to stay three or four days in one place. 'I could only spend four or five days at home with my children in a month. I'm 64 now and my body is old.' In November last year, the Chinese government announced couples could have two children if one parent is an only child. An estimated one million families in the country have lost their sole descendant since the one child policy took effect in the late 1970s, and another four to seven million are expected to do so in the next 20 to 30 years. Such families face uncertain futures, with no one to help them through old age in a country which emphasises family life. Rajo Devi Lohan, from India, is currently the world's oldest mother after giving birth to a daughter through IVF in 2008 at the age of 69.","Sheng Hailin, 64, had twins Zhizhi and Huihui through IVF in 2010 .

"Robert Mugabe has announced that he will stand again for President of Zimbabwe - in order to rescue the country he has driven to near ruin. The frail leader, who has been in power for 31 years, claimed that as the country is in such as mess it would be 'an act of cowardice' for him to step down from power. Addressing supporters, the 87-year-old said: 'Luckily, God has given me this longer life than others to be with you and I will not let you down.' Long-standing: Robert Mugabe delivers a speech at the party's 12th National People's Conference yesterday saying he has no intention of retiring . Mugabe, who reportedly has prostate cancer, confirmed that he will stand as his Zanu PF party’s sole candidate in Presidential elections planned for sometime 'early next year.' Under Mr Mugabe’s rule, Zimbabwe has gone from being the breadbasket of Africa to one of the continent’s - and the world’s - poorest countries. Three-quarters of the population live on less than £1 a day and over half of the work force is unemployed. However, rather than acknowledge his own . role in the economic collapse, Mugabe this weekend blamed the West, . which has imposed economic sanctions in protest at his increasingly . autocratic rule. Determined: Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace, greet crowds gathered at the official opening of the five-day Zanu PF Congress in Bulawayo, which started last week . As such, Mugabe argued that he needs to stay in power, saying: 'I can’t leave you in such a mess. 'It would be completely wrong and a loss of confidence in myself.  When the party is moving ahead, then I’ll say it is in your own hands.' Mugabe was speaking on Saturday evening on the final day of his party’s annual conference in the country’s second city of Bulawayo. He saved his bitterest comments for his . political rival Morgan Tsvangirai, with whom he has shared power since . the disputed and violent elections of 2008. Celebration: Zimbabwe's Vice President Joice Mujuru dances upon the arrival of Mugabe and his wife at the official opening of the convention .

"Manuel Pellegrini will decide who he will axe from Manchester City's Champions League squad to make way for new man Wilfried Bony on Tuesday. Up until recently it was assumed that stand in right back Bacary Sagna would be the automatic choice to drop out as the club submit their 21-man squad to Uefa.

None of City's four 'homegrown' players, Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard or Gael Clichy will be considered along with 'club-trained' Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata as the Etihad side have to meet their quota. Dzeko has struggled this season and is unlikely to be amused with a lack of playing time. Other options for Pellegrini include dropping stand-in goalkeeper Willy Caballero although that is unlikely. If Sagna was to miss out, Milner could fill in as a back-up to Pablo Zabaleta. Outsiders for the chop include Jesus Navas and Aleksandar Kolarov but both are considered unlikely options along with the prospect of leaving Bony out himself as he finds his feet following his move from Swansea City.

"Princess Maxima, who will become Queen of Holland following her mother-in-law's abdication, looks eerily similar to pop sensation Britney Spears, according to internet observers.

"Internacional have confirmed the signing of Manchester United flop Anderson on a four-year contract. United have cancelled Anderson's contract to allow the midfielder to join his hometown club in a deal understood to be worth £25,000 per week after tax. Anderson ended up costing United £25.7million after Sir Alex Ferguson signed him from Porto in 2007, and made a total of 181 appearances for the club during his eight years at Old Trafford.

"The dramas of Whitney Houston's life seem to be continuing into her daughter's as Bobbi Kristina awaits the first $1.2 million installment of her inheritance. The only child of Houston and Bobby Brown will inherit Whitney's entire $12 million estate by the time she turns 30, but her grandmother Cissy is worried the 20-year old will dwindle the money away. This comes after the 80-year old branded Bobbi's marriage to 'adoptive brother' Nick Gordon, 24, as 'incestuous', after the two announced they had tied the knot on Twitter earlier this month. At war: Bobbi Kristina Brown is set to inherit the first $1.2m chunk of her mother's funeral, amid continued rows with her grandmother Cissy . As the second anniversary of Whitney's death approaches, a family friend told the Sun: 'It's a terrible thing, but maybe it is only to be expected. Whitney's lasting legacy has just been more drama, more trouble.' The celebrated singer, who was found unconsciousness in a hotel bathtub and declared dead on 11 February 2012, has a turbulent history with her only daughter. Aged 15, Bobbi Kristina reportedly tried to stab her mother in March 2008, before attempting to slit her own wrists, and, was subsequently admitted to a psychiatric ward. Frowned upon: Her family is reportedly unhappy with her marriage to 'adoptive brother' Nick Gordon, who she tied the knot with this year . On her 18th birthday, Bobbi was allegedly seen doing cocaine, which she vehemently denies, as well as after her mother's funeral and memorial service. She then moved in with Nick - who was taken in by her mother and father but never legally adopted - into Whitney's Atlanta apartment despite Cissy's protestations, and her father Bobby's attempts to persuade her to live with him and his new family in Los Angeles. Bobbi was six and Nick nine when he was brought into their family, and the two still reportedly use the nicknames 'Baby Sis' and 'Big Brudder' to affectionately call one another. Disapproving: Cissy Houston is said to be worried Bobbi will waste the inheritance, and has reportedly branded her marriage to Nick as 'incestuous' They originally denied dating . following Whitney's death, with Nick taking to Twitter to quash the . rumours: '@REALbkBrown and I are not engaged or dating. Just close like . we always have been.' However, Bobbi has been flooding her Twitter feed with statements of love for her 'hubby' and talk of her burgeoning music career as she tries to make it as a singer and actress like her mother. She is also reportedly hoping to start a family, as a source told Grazia magazine: 'They want to have a baby as soon as possible. After a tough few years, Bobbi wants a happy ending. But her grandmother is beside herself with worry.' But . now the newly-weds have been forced to find a new home, after being . evicted from Whitney's Atlanta property because of several noise . complaints from neighbours. Turbulent: Whitney and her daughter perform in Central Park in 2009, but a year earlier, Bobbi had allegedly attempted to stab her mother . Cissy . has reportedly outraged her granddaughter because of her reported . comments about Nick, as well as her plans to publish a tell-all book . about the tragic singer, called Remembering Whitney. But . Bobbi's seemingly rebellious behaviour is unsurprising, considering the . years of substance abuse and domestic violence she witnessed as a child . growing up in the home of Whitney and Bobby. The couple's former chauffeur, Al Bowman, claims he watched the distressing scenes of his employers doing crack cocaine in front of their young daughter. Unrelenting: Bobbi Kristina was witness to years of her parents, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's abuse of narcotics and violent rows . For years, the substance abuse and . irrational behaviour continued as Bobbi became a teenager, witnessed by . her ex-boyfriend Zach Jafarzadeh, who told the Sun: 'There were blow-ups . a lot. Krissi was the parent sometimes. She always looked out for her . mom.' Zach also says Whitney would buy Bobbi expensive gifts in order to keep her daughter in the house and close-by, even if that meant allowing her to consume alcohol: 'She'd rather have Krissi at the house drinking, then out partying and drinking, getting into trouble.' Now Bobby, Cissy, and Bobbi Kristina's family - including Whitney's cousin Dionne Warwick - are 'praying' she will find her way back to them and not follow in her mother's destructive footsteps.

"Stuart Lancaster has been urged to throw Danny Cipriani into the thick of the Six Nations action by picking him as England’s starting fly half. The England head coach will on Wednesday name his team to face Wales in Friday night’s hotly anticipated opening Six Nations clash with Cipriani expected to be named on the bench and Bath star George Ford starting in the pivotal fly-half position. But former team-mate Paul Sackey – a former England star who was part of Wasps 2007 European Cup winning team which included a teenage Cipriani – believes Lancaster should go one better and start the in-form No10. Danny Cipriani should be England's fly half during the Six Nations, according to former winger Paul Sackey . Sackey (left) believes there is nobody better than Cipriani in the England attack . Backs: Brown, Burrell, Cipriani, Ford, Joseph, May, Nowell, Twelvetrees, Watson, Wigglesworth, B.Youngs . Forwards: Attwood, Brookes, Cole, Croft, Easter, Hartley, Haskell, Kruis, Marler, Robshaw, Thomas, M.Vunipola, B.Vunipola, T.Youngs . ‘I’m a massive Cipriani fan,’ Sackey told Sportsmail. ‘Attacking-wise I don’t think there is anyone better than him in England. It would be good for him to get a chance to show what he can do and reignite his career again. ‘His pace and his passing accuracy were the two things that stood out about him as a youngster. His passing was unbelievable. If you’ve got a 10 who can pass the ball and is a threat himself it opens options up all over the field. ‘He looks back to his best with a good team around him and it’s paying dividends. Sale are doing so well now and that’s paying massive dividends. ‘The recent New Zealand create so many holes is because of the threat Dan Carter poses. There are threats all over field. Danny can do that for England. He is such a huge talent.’ Cipriani, 27, spent six years in the international wilderness after falling out with former boss Martin Johnson following a spectacular introduction in 2008. But his superb recent form for Sale has forced Lancaster to reconsider him, while Owen Farrell’s injury has opened the door further for a player Sackey recalls as one of the most exciting talents he ever played with. Cipriani spent six years in the wilderness but returned for England in the summer . The No 10 impressed this season with some fine form for club side Sale Sharks . Sackey goes over for a try for England during the Rugby World Cup match with Tonga in 2007 . ‘He was always amazing in training but that was a great Wasps team with some special players,’ he said. ‘The thing that made you think ‘wow, he is amazing’ was the fact he came into that team at such a young age and fitted in straight away. He’s a special talent who still has a lot to offer England.’ With Ford expected to start ahead of Cipriani, with Jonathan Joseph at outside centre and Luther Burrell or Billy Twelvetrees at inside centre, Sackey says England will go far if they get their midfield right. ‘The 10-12-13 combination needs to be sorted out quickly,’ he said. ‘I liked Ford in the autumn. I thought he brought something different in terms of his attacking style and he’s quite cultured player who can kick to the corners. He brings another element to Farrell. ‘Manu Tuilagi is being missed and England really need to identify who they want to play in that midfield and stick with it. If it’s Burrell and Jamie Joseph then that’s a combination that can really work. ‘The pack of forwards is as good as anyone’s and if England can get their midfield sorted then I think they’ll be really dangerous.’ Sackey says he likes George Ford in the autumn and he brings another element to Owen Farrell .

"It went to the tune of Black Lace's cheesy 80s pop tune Agadoo and proclaimed that Anderson, in not too polite terms, was better than Cesc Fabregas. Now, with the Brazilian on his way home and the Spaniard primed for the latest chapter of a glittering career at Chelsea, it defies logic. But back in 2007, when United fans belted out their latest terrace hit, they had reason to believe what they were singing was true. Brazilian midfielder Anderson (left) gives former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye (right) the run around . Manchester United striker Robin van Persie posts a farewell picture on Instagram with the midfielder . This was an exciting signing. Along with Nani, Sir Alex Ferguson appeared to have secured the services of two of Europe's hottest properties and Anderson announced his arrival in November of that year against Fabregas' Arsenal at the Emirates. The Gunners' playmaker may have scored but in an electric 75 minutes on the field the new boy was everywhere. Immediately the home crowd took a dislike. Always a good sign. Demanding yellow cards but playing with a smile on his face and a seemingly supreme confidence the new Brazil international seemed set to become a long-time adversary. Nani and Anderson leap for the ball during the games against Fulham leaving Bryan Ruiz in the middle . In February of the following year he was at it again in a thumping 4-0 victory which knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup at Old Trafford and he would go on to lift the Champions League trophy, scoring a penalty against Chelsea after coming on in the 120th minute to help turn Moscow red. So how did he go from Stretford End icon to a man famed more for his appetite off the field than on it? From a £20m 19-year-old tto a misshaped misfit he club could barely give away? In that second clash with Arsenal, Anderson again did not last the pace, this time withdrawn on 72 minutes. Nani celebrates with Wayne Rooney during the opening day defeat to Swansea at Old Trafford in August . The fitness issues were there from the start. At Porto he broke his leg in 2006. That luck followed him to these shores. At United he suffered a cruciate injury in 2010 and his knee went the following year. Both meant long periods on the sideline. Was motivation a factor? It may well have been. When the second injury struck he was still only 22 but had already achieved so much. Rumours that he had developed a taste for fast food abounded. In Manchester, with its abundance of restaurants and Curry Mile, he was not short of options. The joke even found its way inside the club. Patrice Evra was spotted telling Rio Ferdinand he brought him his burger at one o'clock. Van Persie and Anderson arrive at Old Trafford ahead of their Premier League Trophy Parade . At Carrington, they would ask where he was. 'Ando's at Nando's' was often the tongue-in-cheek remark. But it would be remiss and cruel to claim he got injured, got fat and that was that. Even when available there is an argument that he was never allowed to fully express himself. Perhaps Sir Alex Ferguson, whose brother and scout Martin famously described Anderson as 'better than Rooney' was guilty of trying to make him into a player he was not. Often he was cast in a holding role, a victim of his own versatility and a club well stocked with creative talent. When Ferguson went, the end appeared to be nigh. A loan spell at Fiorentina failed to yeild a permanent move to Italy. Moyes went but under Louis van Gaal he played only 90 minutes in THAT Capital One Cup thrashing at MK Dons and 20 in the 0-0 draw with Burnley. Anderson played just one full 90 minutes for Van Gaal and it came in the defeat to MK Dons in the cup . Both of those appearances were in August and things hit a new low when it emerged that despite United alerting others to his availability nobody came forward with an offer. Eventually it was Internacionale, in his homeland, who offered an escape route. Even in what would turn out to be Anderson's final match in a red shirt, glimpses of that talent remained. Picking up the ball in the Liverpool half during an Under 21s match at Leigh Sports Village last month, he spotted Nick Powell's run and dinked a lovely ball over the top of an unsuspecting defence. It was a brilliant and yet disappointing moment and left you feeling you were seeing a talent wasted. If nothing else, it was a somberly fitting end. On leaving United, the midfielder took to Instagram to say goodbye. 'Thank you so much to Manchester United It is truly the best club in the world, I love it so much and have enjoyed every year I have spent there,' he wrote. 'Thank you to all the team who work at United and especially all the boys, I have made some amazing friends, all of whom are great players and will continue to do great things. 'And one massive thank you to all of the fans, for your continuos love.. The best.' [sic] .","Brazilian Anderson ended his Manchester United horror with move away .

"When Sandra Bullock wanted tips on portraying an astronaut for upcoming space thriller Gravity she went to the highest possible authority – an astronaut floating over 200 miles above the Earth in the International Space Station. The Hollywood star’s tips came from veteran Nasa astronaut Cady Coleman, who’s logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia and the International Space Station. The astronaut is a fan of Bullock and had been watching her in The Blind Side while running on the station’s treadmill when she found out that the actress wanted a chat - but she doesn’t reveal if she was star-struck by her subsequent encounter. Scroll down for video . Veteran astronaut Catherine 'Cady' Coleman floated some ideas about how Bullock could portray an astronaut for blockbuster Gravity . Terrifying: Bullock plays a scientist in Gravity who experiences the horror of being detached from her tether during a spacewalk . ‘It was really ironic that I'd be watching this movie while running on the treadmill and the next day receive an email with her contact information,’ Coleman told collectSPACE. Coleman’s conversation with Bullock came about completely by chance as the astronaut was nearing the end of her five-month stay aboard the space station in 2011 and Bullock was about to begin filming. ‘It was through my younger brother who's in the innovative wine packaging business,’ Coleman told collectSPACE. ‘He met Sandra Bullock's sister, who is a chef.’ Bullock’s sister asked if Cady would dispense some expert advice and a phone call was eventually set up – but it had to come from the Space Station, as only officials are allowed to make calls from Earth. In Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and also starring George Clooney, Bullock plays scientist Dr Ryan Stone, whose spacewalk in the heavens turns hellish when debris from a Russian satellite smashes into the Shuttle and she’s sent spinning into the void, detached from her tether. Sandra Bullock speaks onstage at a Gravity press conference during the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival . In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Karen Nyberg used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the International Space Station (pictured) Coleman wouldn’t be qualified to talk about the terror of floating off into space, as luckily she’s never experienced it. But she was able to field Bullock’s questions about how it feels to be an astronaut. She told collectSPACE: ‘She wanted to know about what it is like to physically live up there and physically move around. “What would you do with your hands? With your feet? What would be a natural position to work? How often do you see your crewmates? Where do you meet each other?"" It was those kinds of things.’ Coleman has seen the trailer to Gravity and describes the scene where Dr Stone is sent spinning into the void as sensationalism, but admitted to collectSPACE that the film is valuable as it portrays 'real people, including women, doing a difficult job'.","The tips came from Cady Coleman, who's logged over 4,000 hours in space .

"For a deadline day which ranked as relatively low key in comparison to previous transfer windows, it still managed to throw up all manner of questions and puzzlers. Here, Sportsmail attempts to answer some of the complexities which emerged and managed to bamboozle us all amid the lack of transfer activity... Right, let’s start with the ‘deadline’ itself – when is it? It is still 11pm. Domestic transfers, however, can be granted an extension until 1am, and international transfers until midnight. So if you realise at 11.30pm you need a new striker then you can get on the phone? West Brom boss Tony Pulis managed to sign Darren Fletcher but was unable to bring in Carlton Cole . No – a ‘deal sheet’ must be submitted to the Premier League before 11pm. So, in effect, that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen. If the Premier League has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork. Juan Cuadrado completed his big-money move to Chelsea from Fiorentina on the transfer deadline day . What is a ‘deal sheet’? It is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm. After that documents such as the contract, the transfer agreement and permission to work in the UK must be submitted. Hull submitted a deal sheet in the case of Dame N’Doye, who they signed from Lokomotiv Moscow but only confirmed at midnight. Dame N'Doye (left) signed for Hull City from Lokomotiv Moscow but the Tigers needed the use of a deal sheet . This one is a bit of a head-scratcher - how many clubs can a player represent in one season? FIFA rules state that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs but can only play for two of those. Hatem Ben Arfa is the most high-profile example of a player who has fallen foul of this. He signed for Nice after being released from his contract at Newcastle but FIFA intervened and prevented him from playing for the Ligue 1 club. Why? Well, he had already appeared for Hull during a season-long stay – which was terminated in January – and for Newcastle’s Under-21s, which is classed as an official fixture by FIFA. Therefore, he was free to sign for Nice but not eligible to play. Hatem Ben Arfa signed for Nice from Newcastle but was banned because he was registered with three clubs . Is there a way around this for Ben Arfa? Yes. He could move to the MLS because their 2015 season starts in March and FIFA makes allowances for campaigns in different countries overlapping. Why then has Tom Ince signed for Derby after playing for Hull and Nottingham Forest already this season? In England we have the term ‘emergency loan’ which is classified as anything up to 93 days and is not subject to the above rules. For the record, ‘emergency loan’ is a Football League term and not one which is particularly endorsed by the Premier League. Anyway, Ince’s loan stay at Forest was a short-term deal and that is why he is free to sign for Derby until the end of the season. It also why, for example, Connor Wickham was able to play for Sunderland, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United last season. Tom Ince was able to sign for Derby because he only joined Nottingham Forest on an 'emergency loan' Newcastle have sent FIVE players on loan to Rangers! How? In Scotland (and the English Football League) you are allowed to loan a maximum of two players from one club. However, under SFA rules, there is no restriction on cross-border loans, hence Rangers being able to bring in five Newcastle players in one hit. As for the dual interest of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and his 8.9 per cent stake in Rangers, well that raises questions for another topic entirely. Gael Bigirimana was one of five players who Rangers loaned fom Newcastle United . What happened with Mauro Zarate and Matt Jarvis? Zarate signed for QPR on loan earlier this month from West Ham. Premier League rules state you can only loan one player from another top-flight club. QPR then decided that they didn’t need Zarate and instead wanted Jarvis from West Ham. No problem, they thought, swap Zarate for Jarvis. However, Premier League rules also state that a player cannot return to his parent club in the same transfer window in which he has left. The deal, therefore, collapsed and Zarate remained at QPR, Jarvis at West Ham. Harry Redknapp tried to swap the loan deals of West Ham's Mauro Zarate and Matt Jarvis but was denied . Finally, what happened with Danny Ings? For now he remains 100 per cent a Burnley player. A pre-contract agreement with Real Sociedad (which he was eligible to sign with a foreign club because his contract expires in the summer) never materialised. There was also a suggestion that he could sign for Liverpool and be loaned back immediately to the Clarets. However, Premier League rule V.7.1 states, ‘a temporary transfer to a club may not take place in the transfer window in which the transferor club acquired the player’s registration’. Note that this does not apply to deals between Premier League and Football League clubs, hence Spurs were able to loan back Dele Alli to MK Dons. But Ings could still sign what is known as a U8 agreement with Liverpool, which allows contract rights to be passed over at a future date and can be signed outside of the transfer window. Also, because Ings is under 23 and out of contract in June, a tribunal will set the compensation fee paid to Burnley unless the two clubs can reach an agreement.

"What is the price of being forced to raise a brown baby? It's an unusual question, arising from an unusual lawsuit prompted by an insemination gone wrong. And it has set off an extraordinary discussion touching on sensitive issues of race, motherhood, sexuality and justice, though the debate begins with one basic premise: You should get what you pay for. Jennifer Cramblett and her wife, Amanda Zinkon, wanted a white baby. They went to the Midwest Sperm Bank near Chicago and chose blond, blue-eyed donor No. 380, who looked like he could have been related to Zinkon. When Cramblett was five months pregnant, they found out that she had been inseminated by donor No. 330 — a black man. 'The couple did not get what they asked for, which was a particular donor. The company made a mistake, and it should have to pay for that,' says Jessica Barrow, an information technology professional in suburban Detroit. Mix-up: Jennifer Cramblett (right) has filed a lawsuit which cites the stress and anxiety of raising her daughter Payton, (pictured), in a predominantly white Ohio town, which she describes as intolerant . Mothers: Jennifer Cramblett (right) is seen with her wife Amanda Zinkon (left) Barrow is black and lesbian, with a white partner. They considered insemination of the white partner before choosing to adopt. When looking at donors, they wanted sperm from a black donor, to create a biracial baby that would have shared some physical characteristics with both of them. 'They're not saying anything racist, they're not saying we don't want a black baby,' Barrow said of Cramblett and Zinkon, who profess their love for their now 2-year-old daughter. 'They're saying, we asked for something, you gave us something different, and now we have to adjust to that.' That 'adjustment' is a major justification for Cramblett's lawsuit. It cites the stress and anxiety of raising a brown girl in predominantly white Uniontown, Ohio, which Cramblett describes as intolerant. Some of her own family members have unconscious racial biases, the lawsuit says. That leads some to believe that Cramblett is asking to be paid for the difficulties that many black folks — and white parents of adopted black children — deal with for free. 'I don't think I deserve anything more being the white parent of a black child than any parent of a black child does,' says Rory Mullen, who adopted her daughter. Strangers have asked Mullen why she didn't adopt a white baby. One remarked in front of her white then-husband that Mullen must have cheated with a black man. Too many white people to count have pawed her daughter's hair. 'It's hard, but being a parent is hard,' says Mullen, who lives in Southern California and is author of 'Chocolate Hair Vanilla Care: A Parent's Guide to Beginning Natural Hair Styling.' 'Being a parent is going to throw things at you that you never expected, and we make a decision that we're going to roll with it, because we love our kids and they deserve it,' she says. Mullen agrees that a company should be held liable for promising one thing and doing another. But she thinks the fact Cramblett waited more than two years to sue indicates that the experience of raising a black child is her real problem. Mistake:  When Cramblett was five months pregnant, they found out that she had been inseminated by a black man . 'When you say this is too hard, I didn't deserve this, this is too much for me to handle, then the child internalizes it and it affects their self-esteem,' she says. 'It's my job to pour self-esteem into my daughter, not tear it down.' From the days of American slavery through the 1960s, white men fathering children with black women was commonplace and tacitly accepted — yet there were few things as scandalous as a white woman with a brown baby. That history makes Denene Millner, author of the MyBrownBaby.com blog, say that the lawsuit is 'rooted in fear . stuck in the muck and mire of racism and the purity of white lineage.' 'She simply cannot fathom dealing with what it means to, in essence, be a Black mom, having to navigate and negotiate a racist world on behalf of a human she bore, in an environment of which she is a product,' Millner wrote. Darron Smith, co-author of 'White Parents, Black Children: Experiencing Transracial Adoption,' says that the lawsuit reflects America's unexamined racist attitudes and Cramblett's angst over having a biracial child. He notes that due to supply and demand, it costs about half as much to adopt a black child as a white one, and many black boys in foster care are never adopted. 'This lawsuit demonstrates quite nicely the value of skin color,' says Smith, a professor at Wichita State University. Yet Cramblett's defenders say she should not be held responsible for being unprepared. Trouble: Some of Jennifer Cramblett's own family members have unconscious racial biases, her lawsuit says . Parenthood: Cramblett's defenders say she should not be held responsible for being unprepared to raise her daughter Payton . 'White people who aren't affiliated with black people don't necessarily understand the challenges that black people face in all facets of their life. This couple wasn't expecting that, and now they have to deal with it,' says Rachel Dube, who owns a youth sports business in New York. 'She didn't ask for a biracial baby. She was given one, she loves it, she adores it, now she's facing challenges and admits it. That doesn't make her a racist,' Dube says. 'You can't fault her for what she was not exposed to,' she says. 'Her only obligation is to love and raise her child in the best environment possible. And if the money will help her do that, then good for her.'","Jennifer Cramblett and her wife, Amanda Zinkon, wanted a white baby and chose a blond, blue-eyed donor from a Chicago sperm bank .

"The number of wild animals, fish and birds in the world has plummeted by almost a third in 40 years because of man’s plundering of natural resources, conservationists have warned. The tracking of the fate of more than 2,500 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish reveals a planet in peril. Those in crisis range from tigers – whose numbers are at an all-time low – to river dolphins, some which may already have been driven out of existence. The World Wildlife Fund claims that the Earth’s capacity for supporting life is being outstripped at such a rate that we will need the equivalent of a second planet to meet our needs by 2030. By 2050, close to three planets would be needed to maintain man’s current standard of living. The stark picture is painted by the WWF in its two-yearly survey of the Earth’s health. Working with London Zoo, it has calculated the world’s wildlife population fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2008 – the latest year for which data is available. Declines are even more dramatic in some regions, with numbers of tropical species falling by 60 per cent over four decades. And populations of birds, animals and fish that make their home in freshwater have tumbled by 70 per cent in the same time frame, the Living Planet report warns. Freshwater creatures sliding towards extinction include river-dwelling dolphins and porpoises. As residents of some of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Yangtze, Mekong and Amazon, they face a daily danger from dams, fishing nets, boats and pollution. Oblivion: The Yangtze River dolphin, which experts fear may already be extinct, is among the series of species that are on the brink, according to new research . One species, the Yangtze river dolphin, may already be extinct. The tiger’s future is also in jeopardy, with numbers across Asia down 70 per cent since 1980. Forced to compete for space in densely-populated regions, it roams just 7 per cent of the area it once did. In sub-Saharan Africa, populations of hippos have been hit by the expansion of agriculture, abstraction of water and hunting for meat and ivory. Numbers in the Democratic Republic of Congo fell by 95 per cent between 1960 and 2003. Under threat: The Hippopotamus population in the Democratic Republic of Congo is down by 95 per cent and is among the species that experts warn face oblivion . Closer to home, overfishing is blamed for populations of Atlantic cod falling by 74 per cent in the past 50 years. The report warns that people, and particularly rich nations, are exploiting resources such as water, forests and fisheries at a much higher rate than they can be replenished. David Nussbaum, of the British arm of the WWF, said: ‘If we continue to use up our planet’s resources faster than it can replace them, soon we’ll have exploited every available corner of the Earth.’ Jonathan Baillie, the Zoological Society of London’s conservation programme director, added: ‘We can restore the planet’s health but only through addressing the root causes – population growth and over-consumption of resources.’ On the brink: Overfishing is blamed for populations of Atlantic cod falling by 74 per cent in the past 50 years .","World Wildlife Fund and London Zoo say the Earth's wildlife population fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2008 .

"Swaddled in a baby blanket just 15 days old, Kate Middleton peeps out at the world cradled in her mother Carole’s arms. Like any proud parent, Mrs Middleton, then 26, is smiling as she sits in her comfortable middle-class home and must have been full of dreams for her first-born child. But as she gazed at her precious bundle with a mop of dark hair, could she ever have imagined on that winter’s day in January 1982 that her daughter’s destiny lay with an heir to the throne, the still unborn Prince William? Scroll down for video . Intimate snapshot: Carole Middleton tenderly cradles her first child Kate, just 15 days old . Princely surroundings: A joyous Diana plays with eight-month-old William at Kensington Palace . Indeed, Kate’s future husband arrived five months later, to the joy of Princess Diana, his father Prince Charles and millions of well-wishers. In one of the baby prince’s early photographs, his clearly delighted mother laughs as she lifts him giggling in a powder blue smock amid the beautifully appointed surroundings of Kensington Palace. It was just nine days before Diana’s 21st birthday and the two babies could scarcely have enjoyed more contrasting starts to life. Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on January 9, 1982, the eldest of three children to British Airways stewardess Carole and her trainee pilot husband Michael Middleton, who had been married for two years. Warm welcome: Grandparents Dorothy and Ronald Goldsmith with baby Catherine Elizabeth . Formal gathering: William wails as the Queen, Queen Mother, and his parents pose for the camera . The future Queen’s ancestors had been working-class labourers and miners in the North-East, many of them lucky to  survive a cholera epidemic and numerous mining disasters. The christening of Catherine took place on June 20, 1982 — the day before her future husband was born — at her local church, St Andrew’s, in Bradfield on the banks of the River Pang, Berkshire. Her father Michael sported a traditional dark suit with striped tie for the occasion and posed proudly with Kate and Carole, who wore a Laura Ashley floral dress for the down-to-earth family event. Another family snap from the day shows Kate with her doting grandparents Ronald and Dorothy Goldsmith, Carole’s parents. Parents Carole and Michael pictured at Kate Middleton's christening at their local church in Berkshire in 1982 . Worlds apart: Charles and Diana with William at Buckingham Palace at William's christening in 1982 . The very next day, June 21, William was born, and thousands of people gathered outside Buckingham Palace to wait for the birth to be formally announced. He was the first future British king to be born in a hospital rather than at home — delivered at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington,  West London. The newborn Prince — William Arthur Philip Louis — arrived just under a year after his parents’ marriage. His birth was celebrated with a fanfare Royal Salute of 41 guns. Family album: Kate Middleton aged three and half on holiday in the Lake District . He was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on August 4 (the 82nd birthday of the Queen Mother) by the then Archbishop of Canterbury,  Robert Runcie. Among William’s godparents were the former King Constantine II of Greece. Kate, her sister Pippa and brother James grew up in a spacious — but far from grand — house in the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire. Prince Charles leaving St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, with his baby son William . The Middletons’ business acumen, rather than inherited wealth, saw them build a comfortable life for their family, enabling them to send Kate to exclusive Marlborough College in Wiltshire. William went to Eton. Their lives dovetailed at St Andrew’s University in Fife in 2001, where they later shared a student house and began a romance that culminated in the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Now the couple will be looking forward to adding a third photograph — starring Kate and her own tiny bundle — to the family album next year. Speculation: Rumours abounded in September that the Duchess might have been expecting when the royal couple visited Singapore as part of an official tour and chinked glasses of iced water at a gala reception . Prince William leaves the King Edward VII Hospital last night after being by the side of his wife . Like any new grandparents, they will no doubt be thrilled at the news their daughter is expecting a baby. But the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents also stand to benefit financially from the new arrival. Carole and Michael Middleton’s Party Pieces online business features party kits for baby showers, baby naming ceremonies and christenings, several of which appear to have been added recently. ‘New’ suggestions include party kits for a baby’s first birthday — the ‘First Birthday Princess’ set costs £24.62 for 18 plates, cups, straws, napkins, a banner and balloons. Similar products are available for ‘Little Prince’ parties, while ‘The Tiny Feet’ and ‘Rock a Bye Baby Shower’ and naming party kits are also labelled ‘new’. The Middletons are said to be desperate to avoid being seen to cash in on their royal connections. But their firm has inevitably seen business boosted by the publicity surrounding Kate. They previously risked the ire of Buckingham Palace when they released a range of products for people planning traditional celebrations to mark the Royal Wedding and the Jubilee. The couple also stand to profit from later baby milestones.","Catherine Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, in 1982 .

"The crowded season of sports awards is one ceremony lighter this year with a glittering FA event quietly kicked into the long grass. The FA England Awards were launched with much ballyhoo at St George’s Park two years ago, with gongs for all age groups and Steven Gerrard voted player of the year. There was even a prize for the best England newspaper reporter in honour of the late Brian Woolnough. However, there was no such function last February because England were fully focused on their World Cup preparation. And the woeful performance by Roy Hodgson’s side in Brazil is the primary reason why a big England bash is not considered appropriate for 2014. England manager Roy Hodgson endured a torrid World Cup with his side in Brazil in the summer . The FA say the first awards night was part of the FA’s 150th anniversary celebrations and they did not commit to an annual event — although that was the strong impression given at the time. The England men’s and women’s 2014 player of the year plus the Under 21 choice are collecting votes on the FA website. Meanwhile, the Sports Journalists’ Association British Sports Awards, held yesterday at the Connaught Rooms in London, has a long tradition. But the ever-declining number of current sports stars who attend makes it debatable whether the lunch is worth sustaining in its current guise. The nadir came when interviewer Sybil Ruscoe, charged with chatting to the ‘great names of sport’ in the room, started with the England Rugby 2015 spokeswoman. James Taylor has been in superb form, hitting 68 on Wednesday as England beat Sri Lanka in an ODI . England's in-form one-day batsman James Taylor has the strength of character to survive Kevin Pietersen saying he would be better off as a jockey. But Taylor does have to make one allowance for his 5ft 6in stature. He cuts an inch-and-a-half off the top of his short-handle bats to stop them catching on the ground when he drives the ball. British rugby already looks to be in danger of missing out on a proper challenge for the Olympic rugby sevens in Rio, which would be a major lost opportunity to grow the format. RFU chairman Bill Beaumont needs to decide how to take Rugby Sevens forward for the 2016 Rio Olympics . England, charged with qualifying, are struggling to get into the top four of the world group while coached by the low-profile Simon Amor, with the formation of a GB side still at the paperwork stage. So a combined GB team will have neither enough preparation time nor competitive games to mount a realistic challenge. Ben Ryan, regarded as a top sevens brain, has been lost to Fiji, while the word inside Twickenham is that RFU chairman Bill Beaumont is lukewarm on sevens since losing the last IRB chairmanship election to France’s Bernard Lapasset, who champions the format and led the successful bid for an Olympic place. The RFU say forming a GB team is a complex process and Beaumont is a fan of sevens. Sergey Bubka was supposed to be challenging Lord Coe for the IAAF presidency next year . Sergey Bubka looks to be holed below the waterline before he has even officially declared himself a challenger to Lord Coe for the IAAF presidency. Bubka has had close links for years with Russian federation chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, who stepped down from the IAAF board yesterday after being heavily implicated in covering up a serial Russian doping scandal. That, and other explosive revelations in a German TV documentary, are being investigated by the IAAF ethics committee. England coach Peter Moores (left) takes his Test side to the West Indies next April at the same time of the IPL . Sky Sports already promoting the Indian Premier League, which starts in April, helps demonstrate why Test cricket is in crisis. England’s series in the West Indies that same month looks like it will be contested by a second-XI home side, with their best players wanting to maximise IPL earnings. And if England do well in the World Cup, they will have to go straight from that tournament to the Caribbean — such is the crazy scheduling — and some mainstays of the side will have to be rested. A series in the West Indies always attracts a lot of England fans, so the ECB have an obligation to ensure the travelling supporters are not short-changed by substandard Test line-ups. Coincidentally, new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison comes from IMG — agents for the IPL.","England exited the World Cup this summer at the group stages .

'I don't know where he's gone and I don't know what the club intends to do,' Mihajlovic told Gazzetta dello Sport following the incident.

"Louis van Gaal tipped Manchester United to lift the FA Cup after seeing his team cruise into the fifth round with a comfortable victory over Cambridge United at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. The Premier League side won 3-0 to book an away tie against Preston North End and now have a great opportunity of reaching the quarter-finals. ‘We have a real chance now,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Why? We are the highest qualified team in the FA Cup so people are maybe betting on us. I am not allowed to (bet), I am not a casino man – but I give you a tip. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal revealed that the club's main aim for the season is to win the FA Cup . Manchester United breezed past Cambridge United in their FA Cup fourth round replay at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . ‘Of course, I think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams. But Arsenal is still in the cup and Liverpool will fight tomorrow (Wednesday). ‘For me, personally, I have always won a title in my first year everywhere I have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the FA Cup than the Premier League.’ However, Van Gaal refused to get carried away at the prospect of facing League One Preston at Deepdale on February 16. ‘Preston is not a piece of cake,’ he added. ‘They won away against a cup fighter like Sheffield United, so it will be difficult for us to win there. Tom Elliott had an excellent opportunity to give Cambridge United the lead in the first minute but hit the post . Cambridge United manager Richard Money warms up with his team before the game at Old Trafford .

The biggest chance is the FA Cup, but we still have to win four games to do that.’ United scored through Juan Mata, Marcos Rojo and James Wilson after surviving an early scare when Tom Elliot hit the post for Cambridge. Van Gaal added: ‘We gave them a chance in the first minute – it was shaky moment. I’m happy the first chance for Cambridge was on the post.’ Cambridge boss Richard Money was proud of his team’s effort which followed a goalless draw at the Abbey Stadium last month.

"As we all sat eagerly awaiting the Premier League’s big-hitters to make their moves on Deadline Day there was a flurry of activity in the Football League, as is always the case. For all 72 clubs January is anxious time as managers wait to see whether their star names will be plucked by the big boys in the top flight - every player has their price. The roles will reverse next month when sides in the Championship, League One and League Two will do battle to feed off the scraps of Premier League squads. With the 25-man squad ruling in place dozens of quality players will be available on loan and managers and chairmen know that to acquire their services on a temporary basis could be the difference between mid-table and promotion, relegation and safety. Jordon Ibe (right) is taken under the wing of Daniel Sturridge (left) after Liverpool recalled him from Derby . Sturridge (left) larks around with Ibe after the 19-year-old winger was brought back to Anfield . But as focus switches abruptly away from the transfer market and to this weekend's fixtures, who were the major winners and losers during the January window? It is increasingly looking like a four-horse race for the two automatic promotion places in the Championship and, despite Jordon Ibe’s recall by Liverpool early last month, Derby have stolen a march on Bournemouth, Middlesbrough and Ipswich during the transfer window. Steve McClaren has added experience and depth to his squad in the form of England internationals Darren Bent and Stephen Warnock while the Deadline Day loan additions of wingers Tom Ince and Jesse Lingard should more than cover for the loss of Ibe. Despite losing Ibe for the rest of the season, Derby boss Steve McClaren has added quality to his squad . McClaren's brought in Manchester United's Jesse Lingard (left) and Hull City's Tom Ince on loan . League leaders Bournemouth failed in their month-long chase of Birmingham’s highly-rated winger Demarai Gray, with a final £5million bid turned down on Monday, but manager Eddie Howe will be pleased to have not lost any of his talented young squad to Premier League poachers and has extended the loan deal of Southampton goalkeeper Artur Boruc to the end of the season. Boro boss Aitor Karanka, Jose Mourinho's former No 2 at Real Madrid, used his strong relationship with the Chelsea boss to his club's advantage again by bringing in Czech international defender Tomas Kalas on loan. Kalas makes it three Stamford Bridge loanees at the Riverside, with forward Patrick Bamford and defender Kenneth Omeruo having joined on season-long deals in the summer. Adam Forshaw has also arrived from Wigan and will link up with Lee Tomlin in Karanka's midfield - Tomlin remaining on Teesside despite teasing Boro fans on Deadline Day on Twitter by suggesting he was off to Leicester, before revealing it was all a joke. It was a quiet month for Ipswich but again Mick McCarthy will be pleased to have kept his promotion-chasing squad together, while improving it with the relatively low-key additions of veteran goalkeeper Paddy Kenny and former West Ham forward Freddie Sears. Wolves, seventh in the Championship, deserve a special mention. Just 18 months after inheriting a bloated and disillusioned squad in utter disarray, Kenny Jackett has managed to move on several more of his outcasts while continuing to develop a talented young squad with the addition of Benik Afobe. They will be quietly confident of reaching the play-offs. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe will be pleased to have not lost any of his talented young squad . Among Middlesborogh boss Aitor Karanka's additions is Adam Forshaw from Wigan . With the likes of Benik Afobe, Wolves boss Kenny Jackett will be quietly confident of making the play-offs . In League One, it looks like three will go in to two for the automatic promotion places with Bristol City leading the way from MK Dons and Swindon. MK Dons had a mixed window with Dele Alli's £5m move to Tottenham and subsequent loaning back for the rest of the season summing it up rather nicely. They lost Afobe, who had been on loan from Arsenal, to Wolves, but Devante Cole's two goals in the 5-0 over Crewe last weekend suggest the Manchester City loanee, son of former Manchester United striker Andrew, can fill the void. Jonson Clarke-Harris also boosts their striking options while Keith Andrews returns to stadium:MK to add some experience for their promotion chase. Swindon, one of the stories of the season, will be delighted to have had none of their youngsters poached by bigger clubs. There was little activity coming in at the County Ground in January but a squad whose oldest player (by a long way) is only 28 can only get better. MK Dons sold Dele Alli to Tottenham for £5m but have got him back on loan until the end of the season . Bristol City have made a few shrewd loan signings but will lose striker Matt Smith back to Fulham in March. They will be hoping his goals will have promotion all but sewn up by then. In League Two, leaders Shrewsbury have made a statement of intent by bringing in Tyrone Barnett on a two-and-a-half year deal from Peterborough, while Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink has used his European contacts to improve second-placed Burton's squad. You can expect those two to continue to set the pace but all that can change, as in the Championship and League One too, when loans are allowed again next month. Window open or closed, the transfer market never sleeps. Talent scout: Sheyi Ojo (Wigan, on loan from Liverpool) With so many youngsters making temporary moves from the Premier League to the Football League it really is a case of ‘take your pick’, but it will be interesting to follow Ojo’s progress over the next few months. The England youth winger made headlines in 2011 after a protracted transfer saga saw him move to Anfield from MK Dons, whose academy have also produced new Spurs signing Delle Alli. Chelsea were also said to be interested in Ojo before that move and it looks as though the 17-year-old will be given his chance to shine by Latics manager Malky Mackay, who has waxed lyrical about the latest addition to his squad.

"David Cameron has come under pressure to follow Spain's example tighten border controls . Ministers were last night under pressure to tighten border controls for EU citizens after Spain demanded ‘proof of income’ from expats  hoping to live in the country. The move – taken in response to the country’s economic crisis – was said by one Tory MP to have ‘driven a coach and horses’ through the EU’s cherished principle of the free movement of peoples, and immediately triggered calls for David Cameron to adopt tougher measures. Madrid hopes to save more than €1 billion euros (£780 million) a year by clamping down on ‘economic migrants’ from other EU countries, including the UK. A new ministerial order, slipped out by the Spanish government on July 9, states that any EU citizen living in Spain for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the State by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves. If they are jobless, they must also show they are covered by health insurance. The decree, which potentially affects thousands of Britons seeking a new life in the country, declares that Spain will now adopt  a stricter interpretation of the ‘free movement’ principle. The Spanish government has justified the measures by pointing to Article 7 of the 2004 EU directive on free movement, which gives EU member states the power to define it ‘without prejudice to national border controls’ – in other words, entry conditions can be imposed on other EU citizens by member governments. The UK has also enacted the provision – and the Home Office insists that it does demand that EU citizens should not be ‘an unreasonable  burden on public funds’ before allowing them to stay in the UK. However, Phil Woolas, who served as Immigration Minister between 2008 and 2010, told The Mail on  Sunday last night that the powers were almost never used. He said: ‘We do have the powers  to deport EU citizens – but they are ignored by the British authorities. We should heed the Spanish example and change our approach. It is only fair that we enforce the laws available to us and stop turning a blind eye to abuses by EU citizens.’ Mr Woolas revealed that when he was a Minister he tried to deport a group of Polish rough-sleepers who had set up camp  in Peterborough town centre – but was repeatedly told by officials that he had no powers to do so. ‘The idea that we check bank statements to ensure these people are not a burden is just nonsense,’ he said. ‘Freedom of movement is still the prevailing doctrine.’ The Spanish government admits in a . preamble to the legislation that it has failed in the past to regulate . immigration from within the EU. This, . it says, ‘has implied  a serious economic loss to Spain, especially . because of the impossibility of guaranteeing the refund of expenditure . caused by the provision of health  and social services to European . citizens’. Tough times: Spanish demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country's austerity measures . Since 2007, EU citizens living in Spain for more than three months have had to register with the authorities, but there have been no checks on their financial situation. British diplomats in Madrid are trying to establish how the rule change will affect the 400,000 Britons who have homes in Spain. One Foreign Office source said: ‘We . don’t yet know how much money a British citizen would be expected to . have in their bank in order to qualify. It is all a bit unclear. Frankly, we think the Spanish could have handled this a little better.’ Last . night Tory MP Douglas Carswell said he had written to Immigration . Minister Damian Green to ask if the UK Government had the power to . impose similar measures. ‘Spain’s decision to insist on medical . insurance is a key idea – and if  introduced by us could reduce the . burden on our services,’ he said. ‘The fact that the Home Office says . these powers are already available to us suggests our failure to enforce . them should be taken as an indictment of the mandarin class.’ Another . Tory MP, James Clappison, said: ‘This move drives a coach and horses . through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration . from it.’ Spain is in the grip of its worst  economic crisis since the Forties and is almost certain to require a bailout in the coming weeks. Official figures released on Friday show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering 24.6 per cent of the workforce. The centre-right government of prime minister Mariano Rajoy has introduced the new controls in an attempt to cut expenditure on health and social services. Health minister Ana Mato said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to Spain just to obtain free health care. The country has become a favourite destination for ‘health tourists’ from other EU countries, attracted by short waiting lists, cheap treatment and excellent hospitals. Under EU law, citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country. But Spanish authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement, with local media claiming Britons are the worst offenders. In contrast to the Spanish regulations, EU citizens coming to live in Britain do not need to register or take out health insurance. And the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘unreasonable burden’ on public funds. A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy in London said: ‘You either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the Spanish state. ‘Those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in Spain, and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families. Pensioners do not need medical insurance.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘This change simply brings Spain in line with many other EU countries. The British Embassy has issued guidance in English for British expatriates in Spain via its website. We understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates.’ A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘EU nationals who want to stay in the UK for more than three months must have proof they are working, studying or are self-sufficient. ‘Wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules, we will take steps to remove them.’ British holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the Government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro, under new plans. The move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis- management teams in No 10, the Foreign Office and the Treasury following advice that Greece’s exit from the single currency is ‘near inevitable’ – and could come before the end of the summer-holiday season. The deepening economic malaise on the Continent has led to the conclusion at the top of the Government that there will soon be an ‘orderly ejection’ of Greece from the euro – probably with only a few days’ notice. If this ‘Grexit’ occurred in the height of the summer season, hundreds of thousands of British tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender. Cash machines could freeze and credit-card companies are unlikely to process transactions. The UK Government’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing British tourists to remain in Greece until the end of their holiday. Proposed measures include offering taxpayer-backed guarantees  to credit-card companies, enabling tourists to use the cards without  borrowing limits. The companies would then be compensated for any losses. Euros could also be exchanged for Sterling on their return, with the British taxpayer again bearing the burden. A Foreign Office source said: ‘We will have a key role to play in making sense of a confusing situation.’","Madrid hopes to save more than €1 billion euros a year .

"Tricks considered harmful or degrading to dogs are to be banned from competitions after a boom in extreme routines following Pudsey's success on Britain's Got Talent. The dog and handler Ashleigh Butler’s victory prompted a 20 per cent rise in interest in competitive dog-dancing events. But the Kennel Club – which governs all such events in the UK – is set to introduce rule changes banning certain techniques, to come into effect next year. Scroll down for video . Inspiration: Pudsey pictured performing a 'heel walk'  in the final of Britain's Got Talent in April this year. The Kennel Club say owners should not allow dogs to do the move for more than ten seconds . Off limits: The Kennel Club are worried that dogs could slip when attempting the foot stand, made popular by  Pudsey and handler Ashleigh Butler, pictured . Pudsey impressed viewers by walking on his hind legs - but dogs will now only be allowed to perform this move for ten seconds. He also jumped on to 17-year-old Ashleigh's shoulders to the Mission Impossible theme tune - a crowd-pleasing move that will also now be forbidden because it could could a strain. The BGT star's jumps and pirouettes brought a smile to armchair TV fans across the country, but 'extreme' or 'unnatural' positions have been deemed potentially dangerous and liable to cause injury. The Kennel Club labelled other aspects of some routines - including dressing dogs up - degrading to the animals. It fears that with the rise in popularity of the pastime, owners will attempt riskier moves. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko explained: 'We know that the more people we get into the sport, the more they are going to have to look to other types of moves in order to make an impact.' ‘We are trying to pre-empt that. The priority is the dog’s safety. 'We have used Ashleigh and Pudsey as an opportunity to encourage young people to get into it.’ She said the success of Pudsey - a border collie, bichon frise and Chinese crested cross - had been good for encouraging owners to be more active with the dogs, but she wants to ensure they don't go too far. In future competitions any pair completing a performance considered unnatural, degrading or extreme will be banned. She added that dogs wearing fancy dress costumes would definitely not be tolerated. 'We are trying to stop what we would see as demeaning for the dog,' she said. 'They are allowed to wear a certain amount - perhaps the equivalent of a dog coat. But we would absolutely not expect the dog to turn up in a full Santa Claus kit, for instance.' Nationally, there are just under a hundred clubs that offer dog dancing activities. Health and safety: Move including the shoulder jump, right, and walking on hind legs, right, will be banned . Popular: Pudsey leans against Ashleigh with his front paws during the final of Britain's Got Talent in front of judges David Walliams, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell . Britain's Got Talent winner Ashleigh, who became the first dog owner to win the competition when her dog Pudsey scooped first prize, is a member of the Kennel Club. At club events, dogs perform routines to music in sets of up to four minutes duration. Most shows feature two categories - heelwork and freestyle. The latter gives owners the opportunity to try out more innovative tricks. Each discipline is scored on content, accuracy and musical interpretation. The new rules formally come into effect next year, but the Kennel Club has asked owners to observe the new laws in spirit from now. Victory leap: However, dogs will still be allowed to perform jumps like this one . Dog owners breaking the new rules face being disqualified. RSPCA spokeswoman Katy Geary said: 'If anything leads to the animal's discomfort then this should of course be stopped. 'Learning tricks and obedience (provided it is done in the right way) can be positive for a dog. 'We think that this is a distraction from the main welfare concerns associated with the improper breeding of pedigree dogs. 'We'd like to see the Kennel Club concentrate its efforts in helping to bring an end to breathing difficulties, epilepsy, spinal problems and other serious health issues associated with pedigree dogs.'

"Ten-man Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich battled to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday as they struggled to bounce back from last week's heavy defeat at VfL Wolfsburg. Arjen Robben headed the hosts in front after 67 minutes as Bayern, who suffered their first league setback with a 4-1 loss at second-placed Wolfsburg on Friday, dug deep after Jerome Boateng gave away a penalty and was sent off in the 17th minute. Schalke failed to score from the spot kick with Manuel Neuer saving Eric-Maxim Choupo's weak effort but after Robben's goal Benedikt Hoewedes levelled with a glancing header in the 72nd to rescue a point and keep his team in fourth place on 31.

"At some point on Wednesday in all probability, Rory McIlroy will walk away from Dublin’s High Court with his bank balance badly dented but with a weight off his mind. Best of all, he will be free to concentrate on his preparations for the Masters. What was supposed to be a day setting out the issues at stake in his bitter dispute with his former management company Horizon Sports Management turned into one where his senior counsel Paul Gallagher spoke for a total of less than two minutes. Three times he asked for adjournments, arguing they were making progress towards a settlement of a case that is due to last for eight weeks. Three times the judge, Mr Justice Brian Cregan, quickly granted his request, with the sides due back in court at 11am on Wednesday. In all, Mr Justice Cregan spent less time in court than Jim Furyk spends over the ball. Rory McIlroy arrives at the Irish High Court in Dublin ahead of the case involving his former agents . McIlroy has sued Horizon Sports over a bitter row over the fees he was charged while he was with them . World No 1 McIlroy returned to Ireland after winning the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday . Only those well versed in legal ways could possibly explain why an acrimonious struggle that has gone back and forth for 18 months could possibly be settled in 24 hours. One thing for sure is that a swift settlement will suit McIlroy, even if it does cost him a not-so-small fortune. Florida, here he comes. The world No 1 arrived in the Round Hall reception area that serves four small courts wearing a dark suit and glasses. He was relaxed enough to acknowledge the gathering of golf correspondents with a broad smile that could be interpreted as: fancy meeting you here. McIlroy (left) seen here with Horizon Sports Managing Director Conor Ridge is suing the firm for £4.2million . McIlroy was in impressive form in Dubai but now has another challenge to face at the High Court in Dublin . Inside the intimate courtroom there were barely 50 feet separating those sitting in the back benches from the presiding judge. There was a genuine sense of drama as the room fell silent two minutes before the appointed starting hour, followed by the arrival of Mr Justice Cregan. Mr Gallagher SC rose to his feet. ‘The case is listed for eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides,’ he said, referring to the fact McIlroy was suing for being locked into an ‘unconscionable’ contract until 2017, and Horizon’s owner Conor Ridge was countersuing for unpaid fees. The sports management firm are also counter-suing McIlroy for £1.65m for severing his contract early . McIlroy gets a kiss from his mother Rose after winning the Desert Classic for a second time . ‘Along with Mr Paul Sreenan (senior counsel for Ridge), we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm.’ Couldn’t they have done all this on Monday and spared everyone having to turn up? By the time of the final adjournment and a day as tedious as a rain delay, Ridge was looking noticeably more relaxed. Given he’s already turned down the offer of a €10million (£7.57m) settlement, he’s surely going to be a very wealthy man by the end of play. And, as McIlroy said last week in Dubai: ‘Then we can all get on with the rest of our lives.’","Rory McIlroy involved in Irish High Court over battle with Horizon Sports .

"Stalker: Fund manager Shumsheer Ghumman has been sentenced to nine years in prison . A former City fund manager tried to arrange for a hitman to murder the father of a PR executive with whom he was infatuated, a court  has heard. Shumsheer Ghumman offered to pay a gangster £850 to kill Philip Rhind, a wealthy oil company executive, whom Ghumman saw as an obstacle to his desire. But the ‘hitman’ pulled out of the deal, prompting Ghumman to try to complete the job himself by throwing Molotov cocktails at the Rhind family’s imposing sea-front villa in Cape Town. The disgraced banker’s ‘brutal, cruel and cowardly’ plot was detailed during his trial in the city for fraud, incitement to commit murder, attempted murder and malicious injury to property. Yesterday he was jailed for nine years. The court heard how 33-year-old Ghumman, an India-born Australian citizen, developed an obsession with Hannah Rhind, 30, when she was working as a PR executive for the Roche pharmaceutical company  in London. After they were introduced at a dinner party in 2009, Ghumman, who was then working for Japanese firm Daiwa Asset Management, bombarded Miss Rhind with emails, telephone calls and text messages. She was polite and friendly as she batted off his unwanted advances, the court heard. Even after two months of calls and . emails, she included him among those of her Facebook contacts able to . view details of a South African wine tasting event she planned to attend . at Harrods. But she was  horrified when Ghumman was the only one of her . Facebook ‘friends’ to turn up. Over the following months his harassment campaign intensified. He became so obsessed that in October 2010 he was convicted of harassment at Westminster magistrates’ court. Stalked: Ghumman developed an obsession with Hannah Rhind (pictured) when she was working as a PR executive in London . Four days after his conviction he sent an email to Hannah’s father Philip, whom he blamed for coming between himself and the object of his obsession, threatening that ‘whatever is done to me . . . will be repaid with interest’. Three months later, in January 2011, Ghumman travelled to Cape Town where Mr Rhind lives with his wife Deborah. On . arrival, he posed as a freelance photo-journalist called Michael . Kirkham and claimed to be researching an article on gangsters. He . trawled the city’s underworld to find someone prepared to kill Mr . Rhind, using the ‘honeymoon hijacking’ murder of Anni Dewani to . illustrate the type of cold-blooded killer he was looking for. Targeted: Oil boss Philip Rhind and his daughter Hannah . Target: The Rhind family home in Cape Town, which was attacked by Mr Ghumman . ‘I . want to meet someone who has absolutely no compunction about behaving . with appalling violence,’ Ghumman emailed an unwitting middleman. ‘The type of individuals who carjacked Anni and Shrien Dewani . . . would be ideal.’ Hannah . Rhind was not in court, but outside her father described his ordeal as a . ‘nightmare’. He said: ‘I absolutely believe that Mr Ghumman is a real . threat, even now.’","When the hitman pulled out, Shumsheer Ghumman, 33, tried to carry out the murder plot himself ."
"The harsh cruelty of the FA Cup befell Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli as his mistake proved crucial in their fourth-round replay defeat by Sunderland. He had been immense for an hour, pulling off save after save as the home side took the lead against the run of play through Hugo Rodallega. But on 61 minutes, Sunderland full back Patrick van Aanholt swung in a cross from the left that took a huge deflection, and though Bettinelli caught the ball under his crossbar he proceeded to drop it over the line.

Subs not used: Pantilimon, Brown, Graham, Coates, Agnew. Booked: Bridcutt, Giaccherini, Alvarez . Referee: Paul Tierney 7 . To compound his misery, Ricardo Alvarez then smashed home with 15 minutes remaining and the game was over when Jordi Gomez scored a stoppage-time penalty to set Sunderland up with a fifth-round tie against Bradford City. ‘It was the turning point of the game,’ Sunderland manager Gus Poyet said of Bettinelli’s error. ‘I was thinking how unfair football is. We were the better team.’ Bradford, hosting the game at their Valley Parade ground, may consider Sunderland small fry after dumping Chelsea out of the last round. But they should be worried if they saw Sunderland’s onslaught at Craven Cottage. Before Rodallega smashed in Ross McCormack’s low corner from the left on 28 minutes it was all Sunderland. On 14 minutes Gomez hit a rasping drive from the left-hand side but Bettinelli was equal to it and saved with an outstretched arm. A minute later, Emanuele Giaccherini played Steven Fletcher in and he took a touch before shooting, but Bettinelli managed to divert the ball inches wide of the right post. The Sunderland pair almost combined again in the 23rd minute when Giaccherini played a pass into Fletcher’s path, but Bettinelli sped from his line and narrowly made it to the ball first. But then Fulham hit them on the break and it seemed to lift the inferiority complex they had been displaying. Five minutes after they went ahead McCormack had a strong case for a penalty when he devilishly dribbled into the box and was tripped.

The second half began almost identically to the first; with utter Sunderland dominance. Only this time it proved too much. On 52 minutes Van Aanholt ran in at the back post, completely free, but he curled the ball wide of the post. The Sunderland full back then had a huge hand in their equaliser 10 minutes later, swinging in the left-wing cross which Bettinelli somehow dropped over the line.

One mistake like that won’t affect him too badly. He was a bit upset but he’ll dust himself down and get on with it.’ The game was firmly in Sunderland’s favour when Alvarez ran with the ball at pace towards goal, turned inside two players and belted it in.

"Brazil defender David Luiz says he is having sleepless nights worrying about the World Cup, while his team mate Dani Alves describes the intense pressure of being tournament hosts as 'delicious'. 'We are anxious, I wish it was starting tomorrow,' Luiz said at a commercial event in Sao Paulo on Tuesday. 'Some nights we don't sleep. But that's all part and parcel. It is a great chance and we are privileged to play a World Cup in front of our own fans. I can't wait for it to start.'

The articulate Chelsea defender said the atmosphere in the Brazil squad was the best he has experienced in more than a decade as a professional player. He added that their unity of purpose would help them to cope with the pressure of playing a home World Cup. 'We have to find a balance,' the 27-year-old Luiz told reporters. 'Up to a certain point (anxiety) is good, it gets you thinking about the game. But too much is harmful so we'll have to work on that and that is easier to do as a group. 'This group is very open, everyone has the right to give their opinion, and everyone is going to help each other.' He added: 'We really want this, our group is true in all we do, there is a great atmosphere. 'We are happy, anxious and we have two more games in which we'll make last-minute adjustments and be ready to start with maximum force.' Bring it on: Luiz said that he loved to live with pressure and can't wait for the World Cup to start . Brazil kick off the World Cup against Croatia on June 12 in Sao Paulo and then face Mexico and Cameroon in their other Group A games. They play two warm-up matches against Panama in Goiania on June 3 and then Serbia in Sao Paulo on June 6. The host nation are favourites to lift a record-extending sixth World Cup, but they will come under pressure from their often fickle fans. Dress rehearsal: Luiz was part of the Brazil team that won the Confederations Cup on home soil . Barcelona's Alves said that although Brazil's 23-man squad might not have much World Cup experience they have all played at the highest levels and will not be fazed. 'It's a delicious pressure, it's pressure we like to feel,' he told reporters. 'I think that you conquer things when you are challenged, if you are not challenged then it is hard to really crave anything. So we look at it positively.' Luiz said he was used to playing big games at Chelsea and, with three weeks to go until the tournament gets underway, he is feeling confident. 'I play for a big, big club and when you play for big clubs you play many big games and that helped me prepare for the World Cup,' he said. 'This will be the best teams in the world and best players in the world and I am ready for that. I love to live with the pressure, that's my life, I chose my job. So, let's do it.'

"George Best and Bobby Charlton were in opposition the last time Preston faced Manchester United – but thanks to a second-half comeback inspired by Paul Gallagher they will now take on Wayne Rooney and Co in the fifth round. It was in 1972 that Alan Ball’s North End were beaten by a double from Alan Gowling in the fourth round of this competition. Preston boss Simon Grayson, however, has some recent FA Cup history of his own against United having been in charge of the Leeds side which won 1-0 at Old Trafford in 2010. Paul Gallagher struck twice as Preston North End beat Sheffield United in their FA Cup fourth round replay . Preston North End players celebrate as they secured their passage to the fifth round of the FA Cup . Sheff Utd (4-4-1-1): Howard 7; Flynn 6.5, Basham 6, McEveley 6, Harris 6; Campbell-Ryce 6.5, Doyle 7 (De Girolamo 80), Scougall 7 (Reed 64, 5.5), Murphy 7.5; Baxter 6.5; McNulty 6 .

And he cannot wait to welcome Louis van Gaal’s men to Deepdale some 43 years on from their last visit. ‘It was a fantastic occasion when we (Leeds) won that day, but this is a different club and one which deserves this game (against United), they haven’t had enough like it in recent years,’ said Grayson. His side recovered from a goal down to set up the lucrative, televised tie. Trailing to Jamie Murphy’s first-half opener, former Blade Gallagher levelled from a sublime free-kick and scored the tie-clinching third after Paul Huntington headed the visitors in front. But the game should have been out of sight way before then. Preston bossed the opening half but were thwarted at each advance by goalkeeper Mark Howard. Murphy scored against the run of play when he shot through the weak grasp of Thorsten Stuckmann on 38 minutes and the lead was undeserved. But Leicester loanee Gallagher – as he had done in the original fixture – lashed in from a deadball before Huntington stole in from a corner. Gallagher then got his second from the penalty spot after Jay McEveley tripped Chris Humphrey. And Grayson reflected: ‘It was everything that we deserved. Their goal rocked us a little bit but I told the players to keep believing when we got in at half-time. ‘It took a lot of character to come back and Paul Gallagher controlled the game. He was excellent and could have scored three or four. ‘We knew what was at stake and this will give us a massive boost.’ Blades boss Nigel Clough rested 10 players at the weekend in anticipation of this game against their League One rivals. But Murphy’s goal apart they rarely threatened and Clough, whose side were beaten by Spurs in the semi-final of the League Cup last week, had no complaints.

"A mother has spoken of her devastation after the NHS withdrew funding for an operation which could help her daughter walk for the first time. Sophie Sharman, 10, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was just eight weeks old and has never been able to walk unaided. She was due to undergo a potentially life-changing procedure called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Sophie Sharman (pictured with her mother, Natalie), 10, has cerebral palsy and needs surgery to allow her to walk. She was offered the operation on the NHS but the offer was withdrawn because of budget cuts . The idea of the operation is to loosen the muscles to help patients walk independently. But the NHS has now withdrawn its offer of funding the operation due to budget cuts. The hospital announced it would only fund the operation for those children who had completed all the preliminary tests and had a date set for the operation. Sophie had just one more test to undergo but in a cruel twist of fate, she was unable to attend because her mother, Natalie Rider, was rushed to hospital to have her gall bladder removed. Had she made the appointment she would have had a date set for surgery and the NHS would not have withdrawn their offer of funding. Ms Rider, 33, said she was devastated by the NHS decision. She said: ‘I do blame myself in a way but I’m angry that Sophie is not being offered the surgery any more. Sophie's mother is appealing the NHS decision but if this fails, she will have to try and raise the money herself . ‘It seems unfair because she missed her second test through a legitimate reason and we’re being penalised. ‘It’s devastating. We were so close and because I fell ill and was unable to attend the final appointment, Sophie’s chance to walk has been cruelly snatched away.’ Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Ms Rider said she couldn’t understand . how the NHS could fund gastric band and breast enlargement operations . but were refusing to fund a procedure which could give children the . opportunity to walk. She . is challenging the NHS decision but if she is unsuccessful, she will try . to raise the money to fund the procedure herself which could cost up to . £30,000. She said: ‘The NHS has said there’s not enough proof the operation works, but if there’s even a small chance it could help her walk we want to take it. ‘Sophie’s school friend had the operation and is now learning to walk, so we’re hoping someone within the NHS will change their mind. ‘We’re in a horrible position at the moment and I’m trying to make as many people aware of what has happened.’ The operation is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. It involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. During the procedure, electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Ms Rider said she couldn't understand how the NHS could fund gastric band and breast enlargement operations but were refusing to fund a procedure which could give children the opportunity to walk . Ms Rider has set up a Facebook group and launched a petition calling for the NHS to fund the potentially life-changing operation. To sign the petition click here. James Hunter, clinical director for the musculoskeletal and neurosciences directorate at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘We have been in contact with parents of children referred to NUH but where SDR surgery had not been agreed to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests in light of the changes to funding arrangements for this treatment. ‘It would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery. 'We’ve begun discussing treatment and funding options with each individual family.’","Sophie Sharman has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk unaided .

"CNN’s new chief wants Erin Burnett to front a revised morning show in his first major shake-up of the TV network, according to reports. Jeff Zucker supposedly thinks that Burnett is a ‘real talent,' despite her failure to gain much traction in prime time with her 7 pm show, and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by HLN. The plan would be to try and recreate some of the magic which Zucker did at NBC in the 1990s when he started Today on its 16-year run as the number one morning show. Shakeup: Jeff Zucker supposedly thinks that . Burnett is a ‘real talent’ and that she could be the one to end the . ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by HLN . Bad times: In April CNN posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year . Should Zucker make such a move it could be a slap in the face to Soledad O’Brien, who only in January was made anchor of CNN’s ‘Starting Point’, which runs from 7am to 9am. According to reports, when Zucker was revealed as the new network boss, O’Brien said: ‘He’s an incredible news executive....I’m thrilled.’ The New York Post claimed that the new plan would be to move Burnett from her 7pm to 8pm slot to the new morning show. The 7pm show, which started in October 2011, has not made a mark in the ratings. CNN's primetime lineup has been plagued by problems in recent years. In 2010 Campbell Brown left her program due to poor ratings. Her replacements Rick Sanchez and Parker & Spitzer both failed, and Anderson Cooper was been give a second hour. Burnett getting shoved off primetime would further add to CNN's graveyard of primetime show, but a source insists ‘Zucker thinks she’s a real talent' who could help their mornings. ‘He’ll team her up with a guy, and they’ll go after the audience watching Today and Good Morning America. ‘One thing Zucker knows how to do is a morning show.’ Burnett, 36, a former financial analyst, got her big break on CNBC hosting business show Street Signs and Squawk on the Street before joining CNN in 2011. Her Erin Burnett OutFront show regularly gets twice as many viewers as she did on CNBC, but CNN is more widely available than CNBC and does broader interest news. New talent: Should Zucker make move Burnett, left, to the morning slot, it could . be a slap in the face to Soledad O’Brien, right, who only in January was made . anchor of CNN’s Starting Point, which runs from 7am to 9am . Should Zucker appoint her to a morning show it would have a certain irony to it - she only joined CNN after NBC did not give her a job on the Today show, which instead went to Savannah Guthrie. O’Brien also worked under Zucker when he was at NBC and founded Today. CNN sources have told Mediabistro that her time at CNN has not been as charmed and that the network has done little to help her. One insider said it had given ‘very little thought, resources, creativity or marketing’ into Starting Point. O’Brien herself has said: ‘Morning TV is about habits. What you really need is for viewers to find you, get comfortable with you, make you part of their mornings. ‘If you can make news, deliver things they value, you can be successful.’ Burnett left NBC and its sister cable networks in 2011, when she was passed over for the Today show co-hosting gig in favor of Ann Curry. Ratings plummeted, Curry was dumped from the program this summer, and NBC replaced Curry with Savannah Guthrie, center left in purple. The Today show has fallen behind ABC since Guthrie joined . O’Brien, 46, has moved out of the morning slot before and it did not hinder her career at all. When she was reportedly fired from CNN’s American Morning in 2007 she spent five years making award-winning documentaries instead. Should Burnett be moved to the morning slot it would also present a potential nightmare for NBC - three women it spurned going up against it. First would be Burnett on CNN, second is former Today presenter Amy Robach, who is now with ABC, and third is Norah O'Donnell from the CBS morning show. The potential reshuffle comes after CNN has experienced some of its worst ratings ever. In April the network posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers, a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year. The slump was even higher among the coveted 25-54 age bracket where 29 per cent fewer people tuned in. Recent viewing figures from Nielsen also illustrate the scale of the problem CNN is facing with regards its morning show. Last Thursday Starting Point got 301,000 viewers on average compared to 537,000 for MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’, which is a more even comparison than GMA or Today. Fox & Friends drew in 1.1 million, more than any other cable TV network.",Soledad O'Brien could be booted off air entirely after just starting in January .
"Everton youngster Ryan Ledson has has praised first team boss Roberto Martinez for giving youth a chance to shine at Goodison Park. Ledson, who joined Everton's academy at the age of five, made his senior professional debut earlier this season when he started the Toffees' Europa League defeat against Krasnodar in a game which saw Martinez blood several youngsters. Despite suffering defeat, the 17-year-old revealed he'll never forget his debut for his boyhood club. Ryan Ledson (right) has praised Roberto Martinez for giving young players a chance at Everton . Ledson told Bleacher Report: 'It was brilliant; being a Scouser, and going to the games all the time, and then getting onto the pitch … you just want more of it. 'The gaffer [Martinez], he gives the young lad a chance - he did it at Wigan and he has definitely done it here up until now. 'That’s what he wants, he wants us progressing, and maybe a few of us get brought up to the first-team.' Ledson made his Everton debut in the 1-0 Europa League defeat against Krasnodar in December . The midfielder, who also captained the England Under-17s to European Championship success last year, also revealed that he plans to work his way into the Toffees first team within the next five years.

"More than a year after David Beckham swooped into Miami, the retired English soccer star still can't find a home for his planned Major League Soccer team. 'The Miami Beckham United team is actively looking at four or five sites,' Tadd Schwartz wrote in an emailed statement. Beckham's group has remained mostly quiet since local officials last year rebuffed two attempts to secure land for a 25,000-seat bayfront arena in the city's downtown. Scroll down for video . Still looking: David Beckham has not yet secured a spot for his planned Major League Soccer team, a spokesman said (January 2015 file photo) A first push last year to build the stadium on an empty tract on a small island mostly occupied by the port of Miami was fought by a maritime group led by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd . A second effort to tuck it in between the NBA Miami Heat's basketball arena and the city's art museum also failed. 'You can't build a stadium overnight, so finding the right site, finding the right place in Miami is important for us. But it will all start coming together pretty quickly and everything will start happening pretty soon,' Beckham told E! Online last month. Miami-Dade County lawmakers voted on Tuesday to allow the county to open negotiations with Florida International University for use of its stadium as a temporary home for Beckham's team in south Miami. According to The Miami Herald, at the Tuesday vote District 11 Commissioner Juan Zapata said of a temporary stadium, 'It'd just be a wonderful thing for this community.' Florida International University is inside District 11, the newspaper noted. Potential home: Florida International University's stadium (seen here in a file photo) could soon be the temporary home of Beckham's MLS team . 'We’re pleased that members of the commission want to encourage movement,' a real estate adviser for Beckham named John Alschuler told The Miami Herald. 'We view that as a positive step.' 'Right now, our focus is on identifying the location for a purpose-built stadium that will be the team's permanent home,' Schwartz wrote. MLS Commissioner Don Garber has long emphasized the need for the club to have its own facility near downtown Miami. 'If we can't get the right stadium, we can't go to Miami,' Garber told Reuters in October.","David Beckham has not yet secured a spot for his planned Major League Soccer team .

"Wigan manager Malky Mackay is attempting to sign South Korea winger Kim Bo-kyung, who was released by Cardiff last month. Kim worked with Mackay at the South Wales club before the manager was sacked by Malaysian owner Vincent Tan in December 2013 amid a storm of racist, sexist, anti-semitic and homophobic text messages in which he was implicated. The Football Association are still investigating the messages retrieved when files were seized from Iain Moody, Cardiff’s former sporting director, who resigned from his position at Crystal Palace when Sportsmail revealed the scandal in April 2014. Wigan manager Malky Mackay is attempting to sign South Korea winger Kim Bo-kyung . Kim worked with Mackay at the South Wales club before the manager was sacked by owner Vincent Tan . Among them were the use of the term ‘chinkys’ — in direct reference to the arrival of Kim — and a joke about Koreans eating dogs. The situation got worse when Wigan chairman Dave Whelan spoke about ‘chingalings’ as he defended his decision to appoint Mackay back in November. Whelan, 78, was banned from football for six weeks and fined £50,000 by the FA after accepting a misconduct charge over his comments about Chinese and Jewish people, but did not carry out his threat to quit the game after the disciplinary commission were satisfied that he was not a racist. Mackay came in for heavy criticism last year when the League Managers’ Association issued a statement describing the text messages as ‘friendly banter’, but the 42-year-old Scot later issued a full and unreserved apology. It was reported last week that he is likely to be cleared by the FA, who are believed to have a policy of not being able to act on communications sent privately between two individuals. Kim in action for Cardiff City during their Capital One Cup clash against Coventry City . Dave Whelan (left) and Mackay during the manager's unveiling at Wigan Athletic . Wigan, deep in the Championship’s relegation zone, sold Ben Watson, Shaun Maloney, Adam Forshaw and Callum McManaman during the January transfer window, which closed on Monday night. Mackay signed Leon Clarke on loan from Wolves and Sheyi Ojo on loan from Liverpool, and also snapped up the Cameroon defender Gaeten Bong on a short-term deal. Kim, though, is available as a free agent. He joined Cardiff in 2012 from Cerezo Osaka in Japan and quickly established himself under Mackay as the Bluebirds won promotion to the Premier League at the end of his first season. Kim scored his first top-flight goal in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United in November 2013, but has appeared only twice in the Championship this season and had his contract cancelled by mutual consent on January 24. The 25-year-old has won 30 caps for his country and was handed the No 7 shirt following the retirement of South Korea legend Park Ji-sung, but missed out on a place in the squad for the recent Asia Cup, in which they lost a thrilling final 2-1 to Australia in Sydney. Brighton boss Chris Hughton has appointed Colin Calderwood as his assistant. The 50-year-old former Scotland defender was previously assistant to Hughton at Newcastle, Birmingham and Norwich. ‘We wanted to bring someone in of Colin’s experience,’ said Hughton.

"It was 40 years ago that society photographer Richard Young got his first major break. Since then, he has snapped photos of the most famous stars in the celebrity pantheon. Billed as one of the most important photographers of the 20th century, Young's diverse portfolio includes Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales, Joan Collins, Kate Moss, Angelina Jolie, Andy Warhol, Marvin Gaye, Mick Jagger and Stevie Wonder, to name just a few. Iconic: A selection of Richard Young's photographs, capturing everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Kate Moss, is on display at the Richard Young Gallery's Pret-a-Photo exhibition . Power couple: Jerry Hall 'always looked glamorous' and Mick Jagger, with his 'mobile mouth, was a wonderful subject' To celebrate his four decades in the business, the Richard Young Gallery is displaying his most iconic pictures in an exhibition of 'ready-to-buy' photography. Pret-a-Photo displays Young's knack for capturing his subjects in unexpected, often tender moments. There's the diptych of a grinning David . Bowie turning the lens back on Young, and the picture of a young Kate . Moss being made-up backstage. Young's first really famous picture, The Kiss, shows an enraptured Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton locked in embrace. Playful: David Bowie turns the lens back on Richard Young in this 1984 diptych . Rock aristocracy: Young got up-close-and-personal to music legends like Bowie and Blondie . Speaking to The Telegraph in 2011, Young said 'This is one of the most passionate pictures I have taken. 'It positively bristles with it. There was no doubt among those in the room that night that this was a couple deeply in love. It’s a beautifully warm photograph. It was 1974, and the actors had recently wed for the second time after their first marriage ended in divorce. 'Liz organised a 50th birthday party for her husband at the Dorchester hotel. 'It was strictly no press, but I had a tip-off, so I gatecrashed. Once the dinner was over, a massive birthday cake was wheeled into the room and I started shooting. Liz and Richard cut the cake and kissed in a wonderfully tender moment. Wonderfully tender: Young gatecrashed the 50th birthday party Elizabeth Taylor threw in Richard Burton's honour and managed to capture their passionate embrace . 'Because I got the only picture, I ended up being practically kidnapped by another photographer who wanted it,' Young said. Another famous photograph has Mick Jagger playfully brushing Jerry Hall's wavy blonde hair. 'She always looked glamorous, and managed to look classy as well,"" he told the Telegraph. 'Mick, of course, with his mobile mouth, was a wonderful subject. 'In this 1987 photograph, they had just left San Lorenzo restaurant in London and were in merry form. 'I've been photographing Mick for 35 years. He's always been a gentleman about it.' Candid: 'I always got the access I required,' Young has said, as this photo of Johnny Depp and Kate Moss at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, 1995, shows . Nineties glam: Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell at London Fashion Week in 1993, and Spice Girl Mel B on the Julien Macdonald catwalk in 1999 . This wasn't a given - especially these days, given the modern paparazzo's pugnacious tactics. But Young was able to snap such candid photographs because his gentle demeanour often gave him the in he needed. 'In the early days I was always very lucky,' Young told The Independent in 2010. 'It had to do with charm and being nice to people. 'I always got the access I required or requested, always in the nicest possible way.' And the results speak for themselves. Pret-a-Photo is open until January 31st. Gentle approach: Young relied on charm and luck to get him past the velvet rope .

"Manchester United progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 win at home to Cambridge on Tuesday night. Goals from Juan Mata, Marcos Rojo and James Wilson saw the Red Devils progress comfortably, after an initial scare in the opening stages of the match.

Jonny Evans - 6 . Same as Smalling, dealt with Cambridge's threat well. Marcos Rojo - 6.5 . Scored his first goal for United since joining the club from Sporting Lisbon with a close range header to double their lead. Made several useful forays going forward too. Marcos Rojo scored United's second of the match heading home from close range on 32 minutes . Daley Blind - 6 . Made a woeful backpass that allowed Elliott to go through on goal in the opening stages of the match. Recovered soon after though as United dominated possession. Wayne Rooney - 7 . Deployed on the right of a diamond formation and stuck to his role diligently. Came close with a couple of efforts. Angel Di Maria - 7 . Played in his natural left midfield role and constantly had the beating of his opposite full back, Richard Tait. Set up a chance for Rooney in the first half after a quick counter-attack. Juan Mata - 7 . Scored the opening goal to settle United nerves and kept play ticking over neatly. Juan Mata celebrates after giving United the lead on 25 minutes against Cambridge in their FA Cup replay . Marouane Fellaini - 7.5 - STAR MAN . Played up front in a role that was more akin to his Everton days. Provided the assist for Mata's opener and had a key role in Rojo's strike too. Impressed in the first half but faded in the second. Robin van Persie - 6.5 . Failed to get on the scoresheet and was replaced just after the hour mark by James Wilson, but provided the assist for Rojo's goal with a neat cross. Maraoune Fellaini (right) played well in a forward role for United against Cambridge on Tuesday night . Subs . James Wilson - 7 (replaced Van Persie on 66 mins) Came on in place of Van Persie and grabbed the third goal of the match with a well-executed shot. His cameo would have pleased boss Louis van Gaal. Ander Herrera - 6.5 (replaced Di Maria on 71 mins) Was introduced towards the latter part of the second half but played the pass from which Wilson scored. Ashley Young - 5 (replaced Young 81 mins) Had little time to make an impact as a late substitute but whipped in some testing crosses into the Cambridge box.

Among those also called is Aguirre who was manager of Levante when the match in question took place. Japan coach Aguirre was fired on Tuesday over concerns that allegations of his involvement in match-fixing will interfere with qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. Aguirre agreed it was unavoidable, Japan Football Association president Kuniya Daini said at a news conference. Both Aguirre and Herrera deny any wrongdoing. Herrera left home-town club Zaragoza to join Athletic Bilbao in August 2011 and moved to United last summer . Zaragoza's former coach Javier Aguirre, now in charge of Japan, is also caught up in the allegations .","Ander Herrera is among 41 players, coaches and directors named in a match-fixing investigation ongoing in Spain .

"That Whitney Houston's untimely passing left her family reeling, goes without saying, but their decision to deal with this shock by making a reality TV show has caused eyebrows to raise. While it may be cathartic on some level; the sorry sight of a bereaved family acting out horrible moments against a background of Kardashian-style suspenseful and worse still - quirky - incidental music feels grossly inappropriate. Scroll down to watch video... Too much, too soon: Bobbi Kristina is comforted by Nick Gordon as she sits by her mother Whitney's grave, cameras followed her for her first visit . Place her teenage daughter's relationship with the boy Whitney took into her home at the centre of it amidst a raft of staged showdowns and hokey face pulling, and you have a carcrash. Worse still, the opening episode features intrusive scenes of 19-year-old Bobbi Kristina, Whitney's daughter with Bobby Brown, visiting her mother's grave for the first time. If that doesn't pull at your heart strings enough, it's also Mother's Day... and the hideous voyeurism goes further, underage Bobbi Kristina is seen drinking. 'She's not at drinking age,' her aunt complains. Intrusive: The decision to include this painful visit is dubious at best, Oat Houston stands to the left as Whitney's mother Cissy hugs Bobbi Kristina and Nick sits by the grave . 'Please visit me more': Cissys asks her granddaughter to spend more time with her in the future . Hard to watch: This scene was filmed in May... just three months after Whitney's untimely death . Family time: The whole clan went to Whitney's grave for the first time . Bobbi Kristina is seen sipping an alcoholic beverage and turning to her unofficially adopted brother-turned-fiancé, Nick Gordon. T . The horribly intrusive scene also includes Whitney’s mother, Cissy, and brother, Gary, and yet still manages to feel forced and contrived. At least at this point, Whitney's beautiful, haunting vocal takes over... rendering the scene some awful poignancy. Though it's hard to look at Bobbi Kristina with her head in her hands next to the headstone, despite the positivity that Whitney's sister-in-law Pat tries to channel into the occasion. 'It tastes like apple juice': Kristina's Aunty Pat doesn't want her niece drinking . 'Not on my watch': Pat says she won't let Krissy fall by the wayside 'np way, no how' Driving a wedge: Bobbi Kristina only wants to be with Nick, but Pat feels that he's taking her down the wrong path . Cissy is seen sadly telling her her granddaughter to stay in touch. 'She was just my mother,' sad Bobbi tells Nick. 'I don't care about anything else.' Earlier in the episode, she had shown off her mother's ring which she told her shocked family represented an engagement token between the pair. Nick told the camera: 'Everyone gets it wrong, I was never officially... it's not incest.' There may be trouble ahead: Whitney's brother Gary is worried about his niece and his own daughter . Goofing off: Pat set up a meeting with an acting coach for Bobbi Kristina but she choose to spend time with Nick in an arcade . Promise rings: Bobbi Kristina and Nick are engaged, the former says that together with her late mother they were 'the three Musketeers' Pat feels that Bobbi needs to focus on work to help with grieving, instead of her close relationship with Nick. She encourages her to see an acting coach, after admitting to camera that Bobbi was happy working with Tyler Perry on For Better or Worse. 'Acting is a refuge for me,' Bobbi admits. Tentative: Cissy and Bobbi Kristina have a fractious relationship but Pat is working on that . 'I just want you to look after her': Uncle Gary offers to give Nick some advice . In pain: Bobbi Kristina is understandably suffering in the footage, with her mother not long gone . Response on Twitter was almost unanimously negative; with many commentators horrified at the state of Bobbi Kristina and the fact she was being film just three months after her mother's death. Kommidity summed up the general consensus by writing: 'Bobbi Kristina needs prayers for strength and clarity, not a reality show! #TheHoustons.' Shalonda No'Elle wrote: 'Wow, they started this reality show just 3 months after she died!! Why are they really doing this? #TheHoustons.' A teaser preview at the end of the show hinted that Bobbi's relationship with her father Bobby Brown - who was arrested today in LA for DUI - will be fully explored.","Filming started just three months after star's untimely death .

"Gareth Southgate has given a clear indication that Harry Kane’s scintillating form will be rewarded with a senior call up for England’s internationals in March. The Tottenham striker has enjoyed an outstanding season, scoring 20 goals, securing a new five-and-a-half-year contract and the final gloss would be for Roy Hodgson to name him in his party for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy next month. Southgate, England’s Under-21 head coach, will have no qualms if Hodgson does take Kane from his group rather than leave Kane to be selected for the Under-21s key friendlies against the Czech Republic and Germany. Harry Kane has been tipped prosper for England at both levels this year by Gareth Southgate . The Under 21 coach says that Kane could still join up with his side in the summer . Kane has been an integral part of the Under-21 team in the last 12 months and is expected to be a key figure at the forthcoming European Championships and Southgate believes it is possible for him to go up to the seniors before dropping back down in June. ‘There is no reason he wouldn’t come with us in the summer,’ said Southgate. ‘It is easy for him to do both. He falls into that category that he has been with us right the way through. I think he would want to come and be on that stage really. ‘It is still a terrific stage when you look at some of the players in the last couple of tournaments; all of the Spanish group, including Thiago Alcantara and Isco. Marco Veratti (Italy), some of the French boys at the Under-20 World Cup, (Paul) Pogba. ‘Clearly someone like Harry, going as well as he is, might get the nod (in March). That’s Roy’s call. It depends how others are doing and if he is still delivering when we get nearer that time, which is still a few weeks. ‘But it has been brilliant how he has kept his form for quite a sustained period so let’s hope he can continue that. He’s in a great place at the moment, as is Danny Ings. Danny is going to improve and improve. He has the right mentality and is at a club where the ethic is good, to work and learn.’ Kane has been in sparkling form for Tottenham this season and has scored 20 goals in all competitions . Roy Hodgson has admitted he is impressed by Kane's form and is considering calling the striker up . Kane won his first Under-21 cap when Hodgson took temporary charge for the friendly against Scotland in August 2013 and has gone on to make nine more appearances, scoring eight times. But this season he has looked a different player and Southgate puts that down to his club manager’s influence. ‘I know the way Mauricio Pochettino works and I am sure the sessions they are doing on and off the training ground will have helped that,’ said Southgate. ‘We saw with Mauricio last year at Southampton he is not afraid to give people a chance if they are doing well. He has given Harry an opportunity and he is keeping some outstanding players out of the team.’ Kane strokes home a penalty against West Brom in a Premier League clash on Saturday .","Harry Kane has scored 20 goals in all competitions this season .

"'Rant': Justine Greening lost her role as Transport Secretary in David Cameron's reshuffle of his cabinet . Sacked Transport Secretary Justine Greening shouted at David Cameron, ‘I didn’t come into politics to distribute money to people in the Third World!’ when he put her in charge of overseas aid, it was claimed last night. And she warned him the move would make a mockery of his promise at the last Election not to build a third runway at Heathrow. The feisty Minister told the PM: ‘If you remove me from transport it will be obvious to everyone  that you are changing your policy on the third runway.’ Details of the angry exchange between high-flying Ms Greening and Mr Cameron emerged days after her surprise removal as Transport Secretary, less than  a year after she was promoted  to the Cabinet. Officials vehemently denied reports circulating among MPs that Ms Greening used much  more colourful language during  the acrimonious exchange  in Downing Street. According to one account, she told Mr Cameron: ‘I did not bloody well come into politics to distribute money to people in poor countries!’ Officials said that this was completely untrue. 'Fury': Prime Minister David Cameron reshuffled his cabinet last week . Mr Cameron’s decision to force Ms Greening to move to the Department for International Development could undermine his controversial pledge to increase the overseas aid budget to a record £11.5 billion by 2014 – at the same time as squeezing spending on schools and hospitals in the UK. Former accountant Ms Greening is seen as being far less committed to his policy of using aid to boost Britain’s reputation abroad than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell. A Tory ally of Ms Greening said: ‘Justine has never really been interested in overseas aid. But you can be sure she will go through every project to make sure not  a single penny of the billions of pounds we dole out to the Third World is wasted.’ Ms Greening’s fury at being ousted from transport stemmed partly from her anti-third runway stance on behalf of her constituents in Putney, South-West London, which is under the Heathrow flightpath.","Justine Greening was shifted to the Department for International Development in the Cabinet reshuffle .

"Ministers are being urged to take ‘urgent action’ after cancer patients in Scotland were given access to another drug not available in England and Wales. Axitinib, aimed at kidney cancer patients who have stopped responding to other treatments, is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life. The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year, but has so far been deemed not cost effective by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use on the NHS in England and Wales. The body is currently considering an appeal against its decision. Price of life: At a cost of £3,000 a month Axitimib is expensive but it has been shown to prolong life in cancer sufferers who have stopped responding to other treatments . Experts have expressed dismay at the latest example of ‘health apartheid’ between patients north and south of the border. The decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to give the go-ahead for the drug in Scotland means taxpayers in England and Wales will have to contribute to the funding of the drug north of the border, but not benefit from it. Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. This year alone, the body has given only one positive recommendation for a new cancer medicine for NHS use, from the 12 ‘single technology’ appraisals on which it has made final or preliminary decisions. At the Conservative Party’s annual conference last month, David Cameron was forced to announce a two year extension to the £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund – an emergency fund which funds treatments denied by NICE. But there are growing calls for more sweeping reforms. Professor Tom Powles, a consultant oncologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London, said: ‘Whilst the SMC decision is good news for patients in Scotland, it’s important that all patients across the UK have routine access to innovative treatments. There is a clear need for kidney cancer treatments and it’s therefore very important that patients can have access to treatment options at all stages of the disease.’ Jonathan Emms, the UK Managing Director of Pfizer, which manufactures Axitinib, said: ‘Government needs to play its part in fixing age-old problems to ensure that innovative new medicines are used by the NHS and get to the patients that need them. ‘By continuing to focus on medicines as a cost not an investment, Government will not solve these issues. Instead it sends a clear message that innovation is not valued in the UK and it is not prepared to invest in life-saving and life-changing discoveries. Outdated: Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming . ‘Decisions like today’s, where a vital cancer medicine is denied to patients in England and Wales by NICE, but at the same time approved for Scottish patients, further highlights the fundamental problems. We cannot allow this to become the norm. ‘The Prime Minister must take urgent action. A new pro-innovation mandate for NICE is needed to get patients the new medicines they need and prove that the UK is open for business.’ Ben Osborn, the firm’s oncology business unit head, added: ‘Whilst we welcome this decision for patients in Scotland, yet again we find ourselves in a situation where two health bodies, which have assessed similar information, reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of a medicine.’ Axitinib, which is marketed under the tradename Inlyta, is designed to treat adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with other drugs - sunitinib or a cytokine. One trial suggested it extended life by two months on average, with some patients surviving significantly longer. Patients in England will have to appeal to the Cancer Drugs Fund, though funding is not guaranteed. Patients in Wales have no access to any second line advanced treatment for kidney cancer and have to prove ‘exceptional circumstances’ in order to even be considered. Public Health England has warned that more people are being diagnosed with and dying from kidney cancer in England today, compared to ten years ago. Around 30 per cent currently present with late stage disease. Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 3,850 people dying from the disease each year. Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Axitinib is currently being looked at for NICE by an independent appraisal committee. Earlier this year a draft decision to say no to Axitinib was appealed and the drug is being considered again. ‘Decisions on which drugs to approve are often finely balanced. Health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price. If we are not sure, we have to say so, in the interests of all those of us who expect the NHS to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it. ‘NICE is, quite properly, scrutinised closely on its decisions and the methods we use to arrive at them. 'We regularly review our methods to ensure they are consistent with the ambitions set for the NHS and we are currently considering ways to make sure that we take full account of the impact of the severity of different diseases and conditions, together with the wider benefits to society of new treatments. 'We have always relied on feedback to draft the very best processes and guidance. We have asked patients’ groups, industry and our other stakeholders to help us develop this new value assessment approach. Drugs, especially those for cancer, which extend life for terminally ill people, have been given special weight by NICE since January 2009.’","Axitinib, aimed at kidney cancer .

"The TSA was today under huge pressure to follow Europe in banning airport 'strip-searches' over fears the X-ray technology could cause cancer. The controversial scanners emit low radiation doses and the European Union has told members not to install them until the potential risks are assessed. Millions of people have passed through the scanners, but research suggests up to 100 U.S. airline passengers a year could get cancer from them. Controversial: A demonstration of the scanners that European bosses have failed to give the green light for. A full body scan is shown, left, and a screen showing the results of the scan, right . American use: More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S . If the TSA continue to use the devices . then air travellers could go through them when leaving the U.S., but . not when returning from Europe. The first X-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by Steven W. Smith. He sold the technology and rights to Rapiscan Systems, who now manufacture and distribute the device. Fears about the health risks were raised in the U.S. as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the Secure 1000 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the Food and Drug Administration. They all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be X-rayed unless there is a medical purpose. The machine’s inventor told panelists that machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come. Now there are hundreds in airports across the U.S. with millions of airline passengers walking through them. Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007, shortly after the technology was rolled out across the world. In 2010, study group Electronic Privacy Information Center then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at U.S. airports pending an independent review. In February 2011, a trial of new 'non-intrusive' body scanners started at Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C. before they were rolled out permanently in July. New York's Newark Liberty International airport followed in September, where more than 8 million passengers boarded planes last year. Also in September, BAA, which owns London's Heathrow airport, said it will trial the new 'privacy-friendly' scanners. But the TSA has continually defended . their safety, saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two . minutes on a flying plane. It also claims more than 300 dangerous or illegal items have been found on air passengers since 2010 thanks to X-ray scanners, reported Forbes. Britain’s Manchester Airport, which . has 16 of the $125,000 'backscatter' machines, has been told it can . continue using them for another year. But no new machines will be allowed . there. They were once used at London Heathrow but scrapped amid . complaints over privacy invasion. They have also been tested in Germany, . France, Italy, Finland and Holland but will be completely banned in . April if experts rule they are dangerous. The body scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted 'underwear bomb' plot in 2009. But Britain’s Health Protection Agency . said the radiation dose from two or three scans is ‘less than that from . ‘two minutes flying at cruising altitude’. Around 250 X-ray scanners and 264-milimeter-wave scanners are currently used in America’s airports, reported ProPublica. The millimetre-wave scanners use . ‘nonionizing’ radiation, which is less damaging to DNA that X-ray . radiation, reported the International Business Times. The TSA body scanners sparked a heated . debate in the U.S. over security concerns versus travellers' privacy . when they were first brought in last autumn. In response, New Jersey's legislature issued a resolution urging Congress to review the programme. In November 2010 a female passenger . claimed she was made to feel like a terrorist for bringing breast milk . she had pumped earlier through security at Phoenix airport. Stacey Armato had 12 ounces of breast . milk with her and as per TSA guidelines, she requested the milk not be . passed through the X-ray scanner because of possible radiation. Last month, a TSA agent faced . dismissal after finding sex toy in woman's bag and leaving her a note . saying: 'Get your freak on girl'.","Safety experts first warned of danger back in 1998 and fears have remained .

"The leader of the UK Independence Party offered the Tories a deal over Europe yesterday – and made it clear he wants to do business with Boris Johnson not David Cameron. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Eurosceptic Mayor of London was the kind of Conservative his party can support, saying: ‘He’s the only leading Conservative who stands up and says things many UKIP members agree with.’ Mr Farage told his party’s annual conference in Birmingham a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the European Union is now ‘inevitable’. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is seeking to capitalise on one in four Tory voters saying they could twitch to back his party . And he said his party, which wants to . withdraw from the EU, would be prepared to enter negotiations over . electoral tactics with any Tory leader who offered the public an  in-out . nationwide vote. He indicated UKIP may not challenge . parties that made a promise ‘in blood’ to hold a referendum on Britain’s . withdrawal from Brussels. Mr Farage told delegates: ‘If an . opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking . through a door marked “UK independence”, it would be silly not at least . to consider it.’ UKIP has enjoyed a surge in the polls to around 10 per cent, which has seen them pushing the Lib Dems into fourth place. There are fears among the Tories UKIP . is successfully leeching away supporters. MP Nigel Mills said . Conservative MPs were ‘concerned’ about defections, claiming the . realities of coalition government were ‘not something that goes down . well with some people’. Mr Farage continued: ‘All this talk of a deal with the Conservatives hasn’t come from me. ‘It has come from members of the . Conservative Party saying to David Cameron “Look, the Lib Dems will look . to do a deal with Labour, and if UKIP are on 10 per cent or more in the . polls, you must look to do a deal with UKIP”.’ He denied reports he was offering a . deal under which UKIP would give Conservative candidates a clear run at . the 2015 election in return for a referendum pledge, promising he would . not ‘sell short’ the party. He may not even be willing to accept . the promise of a referendum, he added, recalling Mr Cameron’s ‘cast-iron . guarantee’ of a national vote on the Lisbon Treaty before the 2010 . election. ‘There are one or two people in . politics who make promises and then break them, so I don’t think a . cast-iron guarantee would satisfy UKIP. At a minimum, it would have to . be written in blood,’ Mr Farage said. The Prime Minister has indicated . he would give voters a say on a new relationship with Brussels after the . next election. But Mr Farage said this would produce . ‘the wrong referendum’, because it would not include the option of the . UK leaving altogether. He said: ‘The only way we would even . consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if an absolute . promise was made to give this country a full, free and fair referendum, . so we could decide whether we remain members of the EU or not.’ While . UKIP does not have any MPs at Westminster most experts believe they will . perform strongly at the European elections in 2014 and could even . threaten up to 50 Tory seats in 2015. Arriving in Birmingham, I saw my first Ukipper near the railway station. He had plum-coloured trews, a blue blazer, a pound brooch on his lapel and balding suede shoes. Oh, and a splendid pot tummy. As the bulldog in Tom and Jerry used to say, ‘that’s mah boy!’ Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage would later, in an energetic if brief speech, talk about how he had not endured ‘20 years of hard work, sacrifice and much mockery’ only to ‘sell the party short’ in a possible deal with the Conservatives. Mr Farage spoke without autocue. His speech was funny, fiery, commendably free of the usual guff from politicians. One of life’s unbridled tonkers, is our Nigel. But his bruised mention of being mocked was interesting. Why is this party teased? Is it simply because its activists have sometimes tended – if they will permit the gross caricature – to have flapping trousers, wall eyes and a problem keeping their breakfast egg on the fork? Or is it because Ukip questions the Establishment consensus? Prophets are always scorned. There were no metal detectors on the door. European Council president Hermann van Rompuy missed a chance. He could easily have swanned in with a giant stinkbomb. Attendance was pretty good but there were none of the normal, smart-suited lobbyists you find at other party conferences, although the Campaign for Real Ale had set up a trestle table. A Ukip merchandise stall was flogging not terribly special jubilee mugs for £19 a go. Blimey! Nor was there the usual flotsam of protest groups and single-issue campaigners outside the door of the conference, shoutily dispensing leaflets. Perhaps that’s because Ukip is, at heart, still a single-issue campaign itself. The day began with a welcome from a West Midlands Ukip chap who had trouble with the sound system. A ‘wheeeee!’ went up from the stalls. Hearing aids. Party president Jeffrey Titford went next. His delivery was so comically wooden, I wondered if it was Harry Enfield under that oiled hairdo. Mr Titford, who referred to the Prime Minister simply as ‘Cameron’, said that the Lord Mayor of Birmingham had been asked to open the conference but the fella hadn’t turned up. We heard from ‘the young people’ – they are cherished like fresh conkers. A larky lad with sideburns so long they could have been drainpipes. Two beaudelicious belles: a blonde who could have been starring in a shampoo ad, and an Indian in an amazingly tight skirt. Well, hel-low. An old gent near me smacked his gums. Former Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read did a turn, as did Lord Hesketh. He gave us a history lesson and spoke in such a drawl one might have been excused for suspecting he had been at the whisky decanter. Most unfair, I am sure. Mind you, when pugnacious Godfrey Bloom spoke he said it was the first conference speech he had given when he had not been hungover. Mr Bloom, who is standing against Lord Prescott for the Humberside police commissionership, proposed giving police the right to debag anyone who in future behaved like Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Snortingly unPC, Mr Bloom said that some of the current rules faced by the police were plainly ‘drafted by a committee of the retarded’. Whoaa. He said coppers should stop driving top-of-the-range BMWs and start driving humble Hyundais. Under him there would be no more traffic cameras, and any officer who arrested a householder for defending his home against burglars would be immediately put on disciplinary procedure. The Tories should come to a deal and give Mr Bloom a free run against Lord Prescott. A straight contest between those two would be tremendous entertainment. Average age in the audience was probably a good 65 and most of them were blokes. I saw a skull cap, a few tattoos, walking sticks, Union Jack ties, a tartan flat cap and parmesan tinfuls of dandruff. Mr Farage’s warm-up man was Former TV newsreader Kenneth Kendall. Oh no, hang on, it was former newspaper proprietor Lord Stevens, who has just defected to Ukip from the Tories. Golly, he was dull. He had been introduced as ‘a giant of Fleet Street’  but ‘crashing bore with too much to say for himself’ might have been more accurate. The crowd wanted Mr Farage, and when he finally wrenched the lectern out of Lord Stevens’s hands, he went off like a rocket. Smaller government, no to Brussels, no to Trident, off with the Human Rights Act’s head – a Ukip conference is in some ways a rightwinger’s political erotic dream. They certainly cement David Cameron in the centre ground. The problem is that the activists radiate a quite different culture from that of 21st century’s media commisars. The speeches yesterday were unremittingly, almost exuberantly negative. In their logic and drive they have been impressively correct about Europe, and possibly much else. It’s just hard to see how voting Ukip will bring about anything but an Ed Miliband government of crazed lefties.","UK Independence Party Nigel Farage sets out terms for an electoral pact with the Conservatives .

This is because higher-end brands will taste better in a broader glass, according to wine connoisseurs. Frederico Lleonart, a global wine ambassador for drinks company Pernod Ricard, says a simple wine glass emphasises the aroma and fizz in better and more complex champagnes. 'When the sparkling wine or champagne has complexity, depth and autolytic notes, such as the best cavas or champagnes, then the best option is actually to use a white wine glass in order to let the aromas express themselves better,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. But simple sparkling wines should still be served in flutes as it keeps the drink colder for longer and shows off the bubbles better. 'Both the flute and the saucer help the aromas diffuse in different ways: the flute concentrates carbon dioxide at the top of the glass, whereas the saucer's wide mouth means the bubbles evaporate more quickly,' he added. And Richard Geoffroy, Dom Pérignon's Chef de Cave has long sworn by white wine glasses for serving his champagnes because flutes can stifle the flavour of older wines. A champagne flute, left, concentrates carbon dioxide at the top of the glass where the wider mouth of an ordinary wine glass, right, means the bubbles evaporate more quickly . He said: 'I tend to use any glass which is ample enough to allow the wine to express itself, improving the mouthfeel, but not that large a glass that it would be detrimental to the whole experience by stretching the substance of the wine too thin. 'Such a glass will also provide enough space for the wine to breathe and develop, which is typically critical for all Dom Pérignon wines.' But studies have suggested flutes are better choice for champagne because they provide more of a 'nose-tingle' than if served in wide and shallow 'coupe'. A study by the University of Reims in France found that champagne tastes different depending on the glass you drink it from. And bubbly poured into a long narrow flute gives more of a nose-tingle due to high levels of carbon dioxide at the top of the glass. Another study by the same university said champagne should be served at room temperature because it has more bubbles. The study found champagne keeps its fizz for longer if served slightly warmer at around 18°C.","Normal white wine glass emphasises aroma and fizz in more complex wines, says Frederico Lleonart, global ambassador for Pernod Ricard .

"US President Barack Obama walks to 18th green as he plays golf at Mid-Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii, during his winter holiday in January . Barack Obama has reportedly already ‘checked out’ of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in January 2017. The US President is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term – and has holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics. He is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on Capitol Hill and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms. But come the mid-term elections in November, he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take the Senate. In the meantime, commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over – and has begun enjoying himself. US reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a £2.5million mansion in Rancho Mirage, California – dubbed the ‘playground of the presidents’. Mr Obama was also recently due to appear on a late night talk show hosted by comedian Jimmy Kimmel, but cancelled after being savaged by the US media and Republicans. They claim that he has not responded strongly enough to the downing of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 and needs to take a tougher line with Russia. On the day of the crash Mr Obama attended two fundraisers in Manhattan and went golfing three days later. An analysis by the New York Post revealed that in the 628 days since re-election in 2012, Mr Obama has already matched the 81 days he spent playing golf in his entire first term. He has also attended 75 political fund raisers as the New York Times claimed that he prefers to host public figures at the White House late into the night rather than engage with the minutiae of politics on Capitol Hill. A report in the newspaper this month said that on a trip to Italy earlier this year, the US Ambassador in Rome had to scramble together a host of intellectual figures at the last minute to attend a dinner party requested by the president. Last week the Los Angeles Times gave a potential glimpse into Mr Obama’s life post-presidency with a report which claimed he and First Lady Michelle Obama had bought a home in Rancho Mirage in the California desert. The property is in a gated community where entertainers Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby once maintained estates. The four-bedroom custom-built home also has a rock lagoon, two spas and 3.2 acres of land. A view of the home reportedly bought by the Obamas in Rancho Mirage in the California desert . Mr Obama has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day-to-day business of Congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour on Capitol Hill which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year. If the Republicans did take the Senate they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform, the President’s signature piece of domestic legislation. Mr Obama will leave office in January 2017 and will be replaced by the winner of the 2016 Presidential election, which could be Hillary Clinton if she runs as the Democrat candidate.","Deadlock on Capitol Hill has already made Obama all but a lame duck .

"Two Norwegian MPs have nominated NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize 2014. Bård Vegar Solhjell and Snorre Valen, both parliamentary representatives of Sosialistisk Venstreparti, the Socialist Left Party, argue that Snowden’s release of classified documents has made the world a safer place. In their nomination, both Solhjell and Valen say that Snowden damaged international security interests, but that this was just for the short term. Prized man: National Security Agency whistle blower Edward Snowden has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by two Norwegian politicians . 'Modern information technology brings new opportunities for democratisation, openness and freedom of speech,’ Mr Valen wrote on Manifest Tidskrift. 'But is also introduces new tools for oppression, surveillance and espionage. ‘Of course I don't support all of Snowden's revelations, but I have no doubt that the public debate and the political changes that has followed in the wake of the Snowden issue has contributed to a more peaceful and better world.’ Mr Solhjell, a former education and environment minister for the Socialist Left party, said Snowden's revelations deepened the public's understanding of the extent to which states spy on their own citizens. Publishing their nomination in full on Manifest Tidskrift, Solhjell and Valen acknowledge that Snowden ‘may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term.’ ‘We are, however, convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden’s whistleblowing has contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order.' Snowden-men: Bård Vegar Solhjell, left,  and Snorre Valen, right, both MPs for the Socialist Left Party, argue that Edward Snowden’s release of classified documents has made the world a safer place . Still hiding: Edward Snowden, 30, who is living protected by temporary asylum in Russia, has revealed he has received threats against his life in the wake of his intelligence leaking scandal . ‘His actions have in effect led to the reintroduction of trust and transparency as a leading principle in global security policies. Its value can’t be overestimated. ‘A country’s legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security, must always be balanced against the people’s individual freedoms – and the global need for trust – as an integral condition for stability and peace. Edward Snowden has made a critical contribution to restoring this balance. Snowden, living in temporary asylum in Russia after disclosing U.S. government secrets on surveillance programmes and other activities, faces criminal charges in the United States after fleeing last year first to Hong Kong and then Russia. Thousands of people around the world are eligible to nominate candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, including any member of any national assembly. There were 259 nominees for last year's prize, which was won by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for its efforts to eliminate Syria's chemical arsenal. The Norwegian Nobel Committee will collect nominations for the 2014 prize until Saturday, and the list will be finalised when the committee holds its first meeting of the year in March where members also submit their own nominations. The winner is announced in October.","Norwegian members of parliament nominate Snowden for Peace Price .

"Campaign: Nigel Farage's Ukip has opened a new headquarters in London ahead of upcoming European elections . Ukip's new London headquarters is a chaotic environment where workers are sex-obsessed and volunteers frequently leave work early to go to the pub, it was claimed today. Former employees say that the office in Mayfair is often full of workers' pets, while staff regularly take their clothes off and compile lists of people they would like to have sex with. Nigel Farage's wife, who works as a secretary for Ukip, has reportedly described the office - which the party moved in to last year as part of its push to become a major political force - as a 'freakshow'. The revelations about the bizarre atmosphere inside the headquarters were revealed after The Times spoke to a number of people who have worked in the building, which is located behind Claridge's hotel. The office, which was lent to Ukip by wealthy backer Andrew Reid, is the centre of the party's push to beat the mainstream parties in this year's European elections, and to win its first MPs in the general election of 2015. However, the insider accounts suggest that the new headquarters have failed to bring about a more professional approach, with one worker describing the atmosphere as 'Carry On politics' where staff are accustomed to ending work early and going to the pub instead. One employee said: 'They are utterly chaotic. I was horrified by them. There's an element of the 70s golf club.' Another added: 'You see the most extraordinary things. Everybody has been out with everybody else. There are animals in the office, people taking their clothes off... there are no sanctions. People are used to doing their own thing.' Chaos: The office, located behind Claridge's, is said to be full of animals and half-naked employees . At one point, workers wrote a list of 'people we want to s**g' on the office whiteboard - including the name of Mr Farage, the party leader who is Ukip's only household name. His wife Kirsten reportedly has to send emails on Mr Farage's behalf, because he does not know how to use a computer and prefers to receive faxes. She has admitted that the office 'takes some getting used to' and privately described the atmosphere as a 'freakshow', according to The Times. A number of figures from the world of business have tried and failed to inject a more professional attitude into the party over the past few years. Chief executive Will Gilpin resigned . last year after just eight months in charge, saying he could not change . Ukip's 'individualistic DNA'. And . millionaire backer Paul Sykes, who is funding the party's election . campaign this year, has set up a parallel operation to avoid giving any . money directly to headquarters. Cheery: Mr Farage has a reputation as a likeable figure but is now trying to professionalise the party . The insider reports come in the wake of a number of embarrassing incidents involving Ukip candidates, most famously when MEP Godfrey Bloom referred to foreign aid recipients as 'bongo bongo land' and described women who fail to clean their homes properly as 'sluts'. It was claimed today . that the party's MEPs were being encouraged to pay a 'tithe' of £10,000 . a year to the party thanks to their 'generous expenses'. Parliamentarians were . allegedly told they had a duty to support Ukip financially, because the . party spends around £125,000 for each successful election. It . was also reported that Ukip MEPs gather for a lavish dinner in . Strasbourg once a month, with staff at the restaurant Pierre Bois et Feu . instructed to produce a special English-themed menu. Ukip director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: 'I have been in post since the start of February and I have been hugely impressed with the professionalism and dedication of staff at Brooks Mews. 'The Times clearly would prefer Ukip to do very badly at the forthcoming local and European elections. But everyone at Brooks Mews is working flat out to ensure that the opposite occurs. Given the positive response Ukip is getting from the British public, we are very hopeful of achieving an excellent result.'","Party moved in to office behind Claridge's last year ahead of election push .

"All 20million families with internet connections are to be forced within months to say whether they want access to online pornography. Hundreds of thousands are already signing up to have it blocked. A scheme to combat the tide of web sleaze that is corroding childhood has been dramatically accelerated, David Cameron told the Daily Mail last night. Speaking ahead of a Downing Street summit with online giants next week, the Prime Minister revealed that huge numbers of households have already opted for family-friendly filters. Blocks: Internet service providers will ask families to make a yes or no choice on access to pornography over the next few months (posed by model) Two of the major internet service providers, TalkTalk and Sky, are now telling all new customers they have an unavoidable choice on whether the filters, which block all pornographic sites, should be switched on or off. Virgin and BT will confirm on Monday that they are to follow suit in January. Over the next few months, existing internet users will also be contacted by service providers and told they must make a similar choice. New customers who set up a broadband account or switch providers are to have the filters automatically selected unless they opt to disable them. Customers who do not click on either option – accepting or declining – will have filters activated by default. The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and across any public network, such as those that can be accessed from shops and public spaces, wherever children are likely to be present. Adult content filters are also expected to be fitted to all new mobile phones automatically. Action: Prime Minister David Cameron  has said web firms have a 'moral duty' to take action over porn . Only an adult will be able to change the filter settings and the account holder will receive a confirmation email. Some providers are also offering text alerts, in case children hack into the account. The UK’s biggest internet service providers, which are responsible for internet connections in about 95 per cent of homes, have agreed to sign up to the scheme after months of discussion with the Government. The Daily Mail has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to help protect a generation of children. There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old. Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web. Mr Cameron has argued that web firms have a ‘moral duty’ to act but have not been ‘doing enough to take responsibility’. He said: ‘I made a promise in July that I would take action to help parents protect their children when online at home and we are now delivering on that promise. ‘In the weeks and months ahead, millions of hardworking families will only need one click to protect their whole home and to keep their children safe. ‘And when someone sets up a new broadband account, the settings to install family-friendly filters will be automatically selected and it will only be switched off if a parent chooses to do so. ‘As a dad, it is very simple: I want to know my children are protected when they go onto the internet. A family-friendly filter gives me the tool to do that and so this is a really important step forward by the internet service providers. ‘We all need to work together, both to prevent children from accessing pornography and educate them about keeping safe online, and I will continue to ensure this happens.’ Mr Cameron said he will install   filters in his own home to protect his three children, adding: ‘You’re always a few clicks away from something you shouldn’t see.’ Concerns: Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web (posed by a model) On Monday, it will also be announced that BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media are funding a £25million campaign aimed at advising parents how to tackle issues including cyber-bullying and access to adult content online. The six largest providers of public wi-fi – Arqiva, BT, Sky, Nomad, Virgin Media and 02 – will confirm they have switched on family friendly filters in all areas where children might access the internet. An updated Brownie badge on computer skills and safety to keep pace with technology and help young girls with the challenges they face online will also be announced. TalkTalk is working with Girlguiding UK to teach girls about how to make the most of the internet and how best to stay safe online. Dido Harding, of TalkTalk, said: ‘We are now contacting our existing customers to ask them if they want to use [the family-friendly filter] HomeSafe, and we will be pre-ticking HomeSafe as on for new customers from the end of the year. ‘One in three customers are choosing to turn on parental controls, and this equates to 30,000 more homes a week keeping their families safer online as a result.’ Campaigners will welcome the progress, but there is still deep concern about the phenomenon of ‘sexting’ – where children use mobile devices to exchange sexual pictures of each other – which will not be curbed by internet filters. Critics have also argued that ‘default on’ filters risk giving parents the impression that they can install them and then consider their work is done. They say faults or loopholes in existing internet service provider filters have been reported and warn that they can unintentionally block important sites related to sexual health and sex education. A Government source said further work was necessary, but insisted: ‘We’ve acted quickly and decisively to help families with this problem. This is not about censorship or moralising but helping parents make an informed choice.’ ÷ Almost a quarter of 11 and 12-year-olds had been distressed by an experience online in the past year, the NSPCC found. It said that, of these, 18 per cent felt upset or scared for weeks afterwards. Its poll of more than 1,000 youngsters also found that a fifth who had been upset by an online incident such as trolling or being sent inappropriate sexual messages, experienced this every day or almost every day.","Scheme to combat internet porn has been accelerated, says Prime Minister .

"Solitary polar bears have become the poster boys of global warming. Standing on melting glaciers, their saddened faces are often plastered over posters, adverts and brochures warning of the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions. But some scientists say polar bears, are far from endangered. Instead, they claim, the creatures are being used as political weapons in the heated debate on climate change. Scroll down for interactive map and video . Some scientists say polar bears, are far from endangered. Instead, they claim, the creatures are being used as political weapons in the heated debate on climate change . 'Canadian Inuit say that now is the ""time with the most bears"",' Mitchell Taylor, a biologist who has been researching polar bears in Canada and around the Arctic Circle for 30 years, told MailOnline. 'In spite of claims to the contrary, there is no reliable scientific evidence that polar bear numbers have declined in any subpopulation so far.' There are an estimated 25,000 bears in the whole of the Arctic and around 60 per cent of those are in Canada, according to the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG). The PBSG estimates that we could lose two-thirds of the world's polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change. But the same group earlier this year admitted to polar bear specialist Susan Crockford that the estimate was 'simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand.' Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta and past PBSG chair, has spent 30 years studying polar bears. 'In spite of claims to the contrary, there is no reliable scientific evidence that polar bear numbers have declined in any subpopulation so far,' Mitchell Taylor, a polar bear scientist with 30 years experience, told MailOnline . A new tool allows people to watch polar bears as they pad across the ice of Hudson Bay, Canada, from the comfort of their homes. The Bear Tracker (interactive map below) shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area. By clicking on a bear in the interactive map, you can see what date it was collared, how many cubs it has, its weight and the distance it has travelled. There is also an option to sponsor the bear. The map, created by Winnipeg-based Polar Bears International, can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years, as water temperature are believed to have risen. Despite the controversy over numbers, he is adamant that polar bear groups will start going extinct by mid-century as a direct result of climate change. 'It is an international standard to consider conservation of a species using the ""three generation rule"" looking forward in time,' he told MailOnline. 'For polar bears, three generations is somewhere in the 36 to 45 year timeframe. In this timeframe, sea ice scientists, predict significant changes in the amount of the Arctic covered in sea ice.' According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ice levels are 'likely' to fall below one million square kilometres by 2050 due to man-made global warming. 'Polar bears are a habitat specialist: they are not found anywhere that sea ice does not persist. If the sea ice disappears, the bears will too.' But Dr Taylor takes issue with both Dr Derocher's and the IPCC's predictions on climate change. 'Climate models have actually done a poor job of predicting climate warming and sea ice decline,' he said. The Bear Tracker, created by Polar Bears International, shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area. Click on a polar bear to view its details... 'Polar bears are a habitat specialist: they are not found anywhere that sea ice does not persist. If the sea ice disappears, the bears will too,' said Andrew Derocher, a professor at the University of Alberta . 'My crystal ball says that suggestions of 4.5-5°C warming is unlikely given the warming so far and given the limitations on fossil fuel.' In 2008, Dr Taylor signed the Manhattan Declaration on climate change, which argued that there was no conclusive evidence that emissions from industrial activity was causing climate change. He said that if CO2 is really driving the current warming trend, then we could see maybe another degree of warming, which would not be a threat to polar bears. 'It is not a crisis, just a change that is within the range of historical variation,' he added. And even if polar bears did suffer a loss of ice, Dr Taylor points out that, as a species, polar bears have survived for four million years and have 'behavioural plasticity'. 'That means they evolved even before the Pleistocene glacial cycles, even before there was perennial sea ice in the Arctic Ocean,' he said. And he points out that polar bears can live on stored fat to live for long periods. Pregnant females, for instance, can go eight months without eating. There are an estimated 25,000 bears in the whole Arctic and around 60 per cent of those are in Canada . Dr Taylor said that since he made his views known, he has been ostracised by the polar bear scientific community. Indeed, Dr Derocher is outspoken in his views on scientists who don't believe that polar bears are threatened by climate change. 'Some of the scientists that are claiming resilience in polar bears are being paid by right-wing climate change denier groups,' he said. 'These individuals are paid to obfuscate the scientific data. 'If polar bears could garner the resources they need on land, why do they lose about 0.8-0.9 kg of body mass per day? 'Why do some polar bears starve while on land waiting for the sea ice to reform?' But Dr Taylor claims the figures just don't add up. 'I think it is a bit crazy to speculate about a climate future 50 or 100 years in advance, then guess about how polar bears might respond to this hypothetical climate future, then declare a crisis because the guess was they won't do very well,' said Dr Taylor. 'Especially when the current models don't seem to be able to predict either temperature or sea ice very well so far.' According to the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), we could lose two-thirds of polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change. But Dr Taylor claims the figures just don't add up .","Estimates say we could lose two-thirds of polar bears by mid-century .

The report also found the use of tablets has tripled among five to 15-year-olds, up from 14 per cent to 42 per cent since 2012. More than a quarter of three and four-year-olds now use a tablet computer at home. Tablet usage is also rising rapidly among five to seven-year-olds, up from 11 per cent last year to 39 per cent, and eight to 11-year-olds, up from 13 per cent last year to 44 per cent. The age groups are five times more likely than last year to use mostly a tablet when accessing the internet at home. The proportion of children mainly using a laptop, netbook or desktop computer to use the internet has fallen from 85 per cent last year to 68 per cent. The statistics support the Daily .

"Yesterday, the usually sedate world of bridge was in turmoil over the news that two world champions have been found guilty of cheating. Cheating? At bridge? The complex, classy card game for sophisticates, much loved by maiden aunts with high morals and retired military men in the shires? Surely not. On the face of it, the two cheats — Germans, as it happens, who play together as a pair — couldn’t have been more respectable. Michael Elinescu, 61, and Entscho Wladow, 71, are both eminent medical doctors — known, somewhat unimaginatively, as ‘The German Doctors’ in the bridge world. Entscho Wladow, 71 (left) and Michael Elinescu, 61 (right), were caught cheating by coughing to each other during bridge matches, giving themselves an unfair advantage . Last September, they spearheaded Germany’s triumph in the world bridge championships, held in the luxury resort of Bali. But now an official report into the victory by the game’s governing body — the World Bridge Federation — has been published, revealing that the German Doctors apparently used a complex series of coughs to indicate to each other what cards they had been dealt. As a result, pending a possible appeal, the Germans will be stripped of their gold medals, and the world championship will be awarded to the runners-up, the American team. The case has striking similarities to that  of the ‘Coughing Major’ — Major Charles Ingram who, in 2003, was found guilty of cheating in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? by communicating with his wife and another accomplice in the studio audience. All three were convicted of deception, and Ingram was forced to leave the Army. One expects a certain amount of bad  behaviour among players of other card games, such as poker, with its rather raffish image. But bridge has impeccable credentials. It has its origins in a 16th-century game called Trump. As it evolved over the centuries, it has become ever more upmarket, perhaps because it tends to be the leisured and monied classes who have the spare time necessary to master it. It is a game played in the elegant drawing rooms of grand country houses or in smart flats in  Mayfair. A game played in one’s club — and we are not talking about a Working Men’s Club. Famous bridge players include Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Omar Sharif. Cheating is all but unknown. The pair were caught cheating during both phases of bridge, giving away their weakest suit during the initial bidding phase, then announcing their best card during the playing phase . I have been playing the game for 30 years, and have never seen anyone cheat. And, of all the deceptions scoundrels might try to pull off, the ones allegedly perpetrated by the German Doctors hit a new, horrendous low. Bridge is a fiendishly complicated game but, in essence, there are two halves to it. First, you ‘bid’ — that is, the two pairs of players examine the cards they’ve been dealt and they predict how many ‘tricks’, or rounds of cards, they think they’re going to win. They then play their cards and see if they achieve their predictions. That’s why the official name of the game is Contract Bridge — you bid a contract, and then you see if you can make it. The Germans apparently cheated during both phases. They allegedly coughed during the bidding phase to reveal which suit they were weak in, giving them an unfair advantage. It’s claimed they then coughed again during the second phase of the game, indicating the best card to play. They might have got away with it, but for an eagle-eyed opponent — one with pretty acute hearing, too, it seems. One of the American players, Eddie Wold, noticed the unusual amount of coughing and started writing down the frequency of coughs and what bids and cards they coincided with. His evidence was then passed to the referee, who allowed video and audio recording of the rest of the game. Subsequent computer analysis of the recordings apparently revealed the deception. As Law 73B in the official rules of the game solemnly states: ‘The gravest possible offence is for a partnership to exchange information through prearranged methods of communication.’ Given the gravity of the offence, it is no wonder the World Bridge Federation is throwing the rulebook — and what a hefty  rulebook it is — at the German Doctors. They have been banned for life from playing together in a Federation game. They also face individual playing bans of ten years each. If they are guilty, these bans are wholly appropriate. For bridge to work properly as the extremely enjoyable game it is, an exceptional degree of trust is required between opponents. Because so much of the art of bridge depends on signalling to your partner what’s in your hand through legitimate means during the bidding phase of the game, any illegitimate shortcut is particularly effective — and is just simply not done. The last time anything so scandalous rocked the bridge world was in 1965, when the British pair, Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro, were accused of cheating in the World Open Final in Buenos Aires. They were cleared, but the allegations were similar to the current ones. They, too, were accused of indicating what was in their hands, although they were accused of using finger signals. By a strange coincidence, a Radio 4 play, recreating the story, is being broadcast this Wednesday. One of the reasons amateur bridge is largely free of cheating — aside from the fact that it is played by upstanding pillars of the community — is the fact that it tends not to be played for money or, if it is, it’s played for pennies, not pounds. Only at the top end of the game do they play for a fortune or, as in this latest case, for high-level competitive glory. As with any human endeavour, when big money is involved, big crooks often are, too. The greatest bridge scene in literature revolves around huge amounts of money staked at the green baize table. During Ian Fleming's Moonraker novel, Bond cheats villain Sir Hugo Drax out of £15,000 by signalling to boss M during the game by wiping his brow with a handkerchief . In Ian Fleming’s Moonraker, the villain Sir Hugo Drax has been found to have been cheating, and making big money, at Blades, the St James’s Club of James Bond’s boss, M. Bond spots that Drax is using the old ‘Shiner’ cheating routine — Drax places his gleaming, silver cigarette case on the table while he’s dealing, so he can see the other players’ cards in its reflection. Bond gets his own back on Drax by cheating in an even more sophisticated way. He fiddles the hand so that Drax apparently has very good cards, and he, Bond, has terrible ones. Bond then makes what looks like a wildly stupid, over-confident bid. Drax gambles a fortune,  reckoning that Bond is drunk — during the evening, Bond drinks a dry vodka Martini, a straight Wolfschmidt vodka from Riga, nearly two bottles of Dom Perignon ’46 and a fat measure of pale brandy from the Rothschild estates in Cognac. But Bond keeps his wits about him by slipping a stimulant, Benzedrine, into his champagne. Like the German Doctors allegedly did, Bond signals what he has in his hand to his partner, M — this time, by wiping his face with his handkerchief. And then he proceeds to win every single round of cards — and fleece Drax of £15,000, around £330,000 today. Ian Fleming, no mean bridge-player himself, borrowed Bond’s fiddled hand of cards from a famous con played on the Duke of Cumberland, George III’s son, two centuries ago, which cost the Duke £20,000. It’s been known as the Duke of Cumberland Hand ever since. So, cheating in bridge is  nothing new. But, usually, it’s only in fictional accounts of  the game that anything  crooked happens. In Agatha Christie’s 1936 Hercule Poirot novel, Cards On The Table, the villainous Dr Roberts even uses bridge to commit murder. Under the strange rules of bridge, at any one time one player is the ‘dummy’ who doesn’t take part in the game. This is usually an opportunity for the dummy to organise the gin and tonics and whisky and sodas, but when Dr Roberts is dummy, he uses his break to kill his host. As I said, I’ve never witnessed cheating. Nor have I ever witnessed murder. Some bridge aficionados might argue over which offence is the greater crime.","Michael Elinescu, 61, and Entscho Wladow, 71, found cheating at bridge .

"Alex writes open letter to Kieran, urging him to never buy the model 'cheap necklaces' and 'grow a thick skin' Leandro claims he never proposed, only agreed a ring he had bought the model was 'engagement ring' to stop her crying . They've remained unusually quiet since their ex-love Katie Price wed Kieran Hayler two weeks ago after only a month of dating. However, the glamour model's ex-husband Alex Reid and ex-fiance Leandro Penna have both broken their silence with their opinions on her shock marriage. Argentine model Leandro, who only ended his engagement with Katie in October 2012, believes his ex-fiancee is 'insecure' and claims she rushes into relationships in a bid to make her feel settled. Whirlwind: Katie Price and her new husband Kieran Hayler at London's Heathrow airport on January 20 . Like Alex, Leandro was unaware of Katie's marriage to Kieran on January 16 in the Bahamas until he read about it in the newspapers. Leandro, 27, told this week's Now magazine: 'I wasn't upset. But I was, I think the world is, flabbergasted. 'Katie's a very insecure person. I think she feels more secure and safe in a marriage.' Meanwhile, Alex, 37, has written an open letter to Kieran in the same magazine, urging him to not get too used to his newfound fame and to keep his old friends. Moving on: Katie and ex-fiance Leandro in August 2012 - two months before they split . The cagefighter claims his 11-month marriage to Katie left his confidence destroyed, alleging she regularly belittled him and tried to tell him how to dress. He writes: 'We had a fight and then she said: ""It isn't all about you. You'll never be as famous as me."" 'She didn't like my clothes... Katie can switch things on and off. Being with Katie is like Jekyll and Hyde.' Alex also urged Kieran to 'grow a thick skin' and 'don't trust anyone at all'. But after the two page letter, the father-of-one insisted he 'genuinely' wished Kieran, 25, and Katie, 34, all the best in their marriage. 'Don't trust anyone at all': Katie left Alex Reid in January 2011 after 11 months of marriage . Meanwhile, Leandro claims he never properly proposed to Katie, insisting he only said they could get engaged after she grew emotional. He claimed he bought Katie a £10,000 promise ring from Harrods and when she accepted it, she asked if it was an engagement. He said: 'I said it wasn't and she asked again. She had tears in her eyes... I didn't want to upset her, so I agreed.' But I never got down on one knee or asked her: ""Will you marry me?""' Katie and Kieran only went public as a couple on December 18 when the part-time stripper published a photo of the couple kissing at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent on his Twitter page. Although Katie claims she knew Kieran for a year before they started dating two months ago, Leandro says he had never heard or seen him during his 20 month on/off romance with the ex-Page 3 girl.","Alex writes open letter to Kieran, urging him to never buy the model 'cheap necklaces' and 'grow a thick skin'

"Recors revealed on Monday show that President Obama racked up another $2.5 million in hotel and rental car costs when he visited Brussels, Belgium for this month's G7 summit – and spent just one night in Belgium's capital. Two government contract award documents show that the money was allocated to cover 141 rental vehicles and a total of 399 lodging, meeting and conference rooms. The expenses covered Obama's June 4-5 stay in Brussels, along with costs related to 15 days of 'advance' work work by his advance team before the president participated in a G7 conference in between one-night stays in Poland and France. A requisition for lodging in Brussels at a hotel called 'The Hotel' shows an estimated cost of $1.51 million. An additional $1.01 million was set aside just for 'vehicle rentals.' SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS . 'The best view over Brussels ... even from the sauna': Obama was in the lap of luxury for one night, and taxpayers chipped in for millions . No generic lodging: 'The Hotel' is the creme-de-la-creme of Belgium's four-star hotels . Champagne? Even the ordinary rooms at 'The Hotel' include bubbly and walk-in 'rain' showers; imagine what the presidential suite is like! It was during the G7 meeting that Obama insisted, during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, that he would make 'absolutely no apologies' for his prisoner swap with the Taliban, trading five of their most prized leaders for a single captive U.S. soldier now accused of deserting his unit in Afghanistan. The Brussels trip was planned with less advance notice than the White House is accustomed to having, because the G7 summit was originally a 'G8' meeting scheduled for Sochi, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin was summarily uninvited, however, and the location was moved out of Russia, after he annexed parts of the Ukraine. But the hurried nature of the travel reservations can't be responsible for the cost. Records from a similar one-night stay in March show that the State Department shelled out $2.9 million for the same expenses in Brussels three months ago. That's 16 per cent more. The difference appears to be that during the March visit, Secret Service planners  spent more than $396,000 at a second hotel. This time, 'The Hotel' had enough room for the entire White House entourage. The government purchase order called for 'Rental of 399 Lodging rooms, Office rooms and Conference rooms ... in support of Senior High Level USG Principal traveling with a delegation.' Obama was last in Brussels in March, for an EU-U.S. Summit at the Council of the European Union, and to visit the Flanders . Field Cemetery for a wreath-laying. The rental cars during both the March and June trips were requisitioned from Modern Car, a Brussels company that specializes in luxury limousines. 'Gee, only $2.5 million?' a Republican Senate aide snarked when MailOnline told him the on-the-ground cost for Obama's latest Brussels stay. 'I suddenly feel all warm and fuzzy about the president having respect for taxpayers.' That same congressional staffer said in March that it was hard to believe 'nearly 1,000 people' had to travel with the president for a routine diplomatic meeting. 'Are there really that many Secret Service agents and clipboard-holders?' he asked then. A search Monday on Expedia.com found . that rooms at 'The Hotel' in Brussels can be had for £122, or about . $207, per night on upcoming Wednesdays, the same weekday Obama spent the . night there. The presidential suite presumably costs far more. Knights of the round table: Obama, Cameron, Hollande, Merkel and company gathered for a confab in Brussels . Airfare not included: The $2.5 million travel tab for Brussels doesn't figure in the $228,000 HOURLY cost of operating Air Force One, seen here Friday in North Dakota . The Hotel's superior rooms for ordinary travelers feature 46-inch LED TVs, private fridges with complimentary champagne and wine, and walk-in rain showers. Modern Car features mostly Mercedez-Benz, BMW and Audi sedans. According to the U.S. Air Force, it now costs $228,288 per hour to fly the president's customized Boeing 747. That hourly expense is up 27 per cent since Obama took office. The Guardian reported that Belgium's cost for providing security and planning surrounding the president's March visit was at least $10.4 million at the time. The State Department did not respond to a request for an estimate on the Belgian people's portion of the expenses for the more recent trip.

"Book-sharing: Wilbur Smith, pictured with his wife Mokhiniso Rakhimova, signed the £15million deal . Best-selling novelist Wilbur Smith has signed a £15million agreement to produce six more books. And the twist in the tale is that he doesn’t even have to write them  himself. The 79-year-old author, whose books have sold more than 122million copies since 1964, has promised to produce  up to two titles a year for three years with the help of ‘carefully selected co-authors’. Smith will reportedly sketch plot outlines and characters, leaving his appointed writers to flesh the skeletons out into full books. The new arrangement means his output of novels will dramatically rise, delighting his fans and adding to his fortune, already estimated at £100million-plus. But it will dismay literary purists – and appears to have been too much of a step for his previous publishers of 45 years, Pan Macmillan, whom he has just left to join HarperCollins. The Sunday Times suggested yesterday that a key figure in advocating the new scheme was Smith’s fourth wife, Tajikistan-born Mokhiniso Rakhimova, who is 39 years his junior. Smith’s first hint at his plans to take more of a back seat in the novel writing process came last month, when he said on his website: ‘I have plenty more books in my head clamouring to be written.' Now HarperCollins has announced that it is to publish six Wilbur Smith books – the first being a sequel to his 1993 novel River God, set in ancient Egypt, and due to come out for Christmas 2014, marking his half century as an author. Team: It has been suggested Mokhiniso Rakhimova, pictured with her husband at their London home has been a key figure in the new scheme . Smith said: ‘For the past few years my fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my  family of characters faster than I can write them. ‘For them, I am willing to make a change to my working methods so the stories in my head can reach the page more frequently.’ Smith married for the fourth time in 2000, five months after the death of his third wife. He had spotted ‘Niso’, as the former Miss Rakhimova is known, in London, and decided to approach her. Fortuitously, she seems to have found the multi-millionaire instantly attractive. Smith recalled: ‘I saw this nubile little Asian thing going down Sloane Street and I joined her in the bookstore.’ A lunch invitation was soon followed by a successful proposal of marriage. The Zambia-born author has said: ‘With Mokhiniso beside me I look forward eagerly to each day. She has banished loneliness. She is the perfect lover and companion.’ Smith is not the only blockbuster writer to share the creative load with others. Thriller writer Tom Clancy has used a stable of co-authors to help produce some of his best-sellers, as have James  Patterson and Clive Cussler.","The best-selling author will produce six books over the next three years .

"Britain’s booming Mini marked a big new production milestone today as German parent-company BMW celebrated the three-millionth model built during its ownership – but announced that more would have to built abroad. The UK factory is bursting at the seams so additional production will take place in Holland. But Britain will remain the ‘heart’ of production, they insisted as car number 3 million – a brand new brand new five-door Hatch Cooper S – rolled off the production line complete with patriotic Union Jack paintwork and Transport Minister Baroness Kramer in the front seat. To celebrate the moment, Mini published a fascinating time-lapse film showing how the car is built from scratch.

BMW revived the iconic British brand in 2001 by launching a ‘new Mini’ which was somewhat larger than the original 10ft square box created by design genius Sir Alec Issigonis and launched in 1959 to worldwide acclaim, becoming emblematic of the Swinging Sixties and a world-beating rally and race-car.

But extra capacity is needed and production was needed abroad. BMW recently took over a former Mitsubishi and Volvo factory in Born, Holland, which will take up any additional capacity as the Oxford factory approaches peak production at 260,000 vehicles a year. Production at Oxford, which employs 4,000 people, has been around the 170,000 a year mark over the last couple of years as older Mini models have been phased out and new ones ramped up. Herr Kruger said that capacity could be reached next year or by 2016. The Oxford factory, which has been producing Minis since the first ever one rolled out in 1959, will then hit the buffers with no more room for expansion. Herr Kruger said: ‘The factory in Holland will then take up additional assembly, but Oxford will remain number one. It will always remain at full capacity and we have no plans to build Mini anywhere else. The heart of Mini is in the UK.’ The Oxford factory, which has been producing Minis since the first ever one rolled out in 1959, will then hit the buffers with no more room for expansion .

"The team formerly known as Marussia have taken a step closer to appearing on the Formula One grid this season. Marussia went into administration towards the end of last season, missing the final three grands prix of the campaign in the United States, Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Behind the scenes talks have continually taken place in the hope the team, down on the FIA entry list for this year as Manor, would emerge from the ashes of its demise. Marussia could emerge as a side named Manor and compete in the new Formula One season . Marussia did not compete in the final three races last season due to their financial difficulties . Last month those hopes were raised slightly when a planned auction of Marussia's assets was cancelled to allow for discussions to continue with a third party. Those discussions remain ongoing and appear to be drawing towards a fruitful conclusion that would see the team compete this year, albeit using the 2014 car. Crucially, it is planned for Marussia to exit administration on February 19 via a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which is a key positive move towards salvation. From there the team could then plan for the opening race of the year on March 15 in Australia. Geoff Rowley, joint administrator, and partner at FRP Advisory, said: 'Since the appointment of administrators negotiations have taken place with a number of parties to try and secure a long-term solution for the team. 'We can confirm that negotiations continue towards a longer term viable solution for the business and participation of a team in the 2015 season.

The emergence of Manor in place of Marussia means a side could race in the new Formula One season . 'A CVA is a restructuring process agreed with the company's creditors which allows for a turnaround of the business and the creation of a longer term viable solution for the team.

"We've all sat in our armchairs or in the pub listening to pundits give their supposedly expert opinion on the day's football and thought 'I could do better than that.' But these days it seems you need to be an ex-player to make your voice heard on the television or radio - upon retirement, they're pretty much whisked out of their boots and sat straight in front of a camera or microphone. Jeff Stelling, the man who brings joys and despair to millions in equal measure each weekend as the host of Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday, is the glorious exception to this punditry rule. Jeff Stelling is fronting the Carlsberg Fan Squad campaign to find 'The People's Pundit' where the prize on offer for a lucky fan is their big break on radio station talkSPORT . Stelling is not an ex-pro, he's a fan and a student of the game. His career is built on and continues to be fuelled by an obsession with football's minutiae - searching out that elusive statistic that leaves the viewer astounded. On the face of it, following a rolling list of football results should not be appointment viewing. Indeed, even for the most ardent football fan, it should be something of a turn off. After all, most of us truly care about only one team - our team. But for over two decades now, Stelling has illuminated every Saturday afternoon from August until May with his rare mix of warmth, charm, passion and inexhaustible knowledge. There simply isn’t anyone better to front the Carlsberg Fan Squad’s nationwide search to find The People’s Pundit, a competition that will end with one armchair fan given their big break on the talkSPORT radio station. And of course Stelling, taking time out from his busy schedule of research and recording, is only too happy to pass on a few tips to the hopefuls. Jeff Stelling chats to Sportsmail's Adam Shergold ahead of the launch of the Carlsberg 'People's Pundit' Stelling, 59, has been presenting Sky's Soccer Saturday programme every week for over two decades . ‘I was about six when I was taken to my first game - Hartlepool of course, against Workington,’ he says. ‘I think they won 2-0 and I thought it was glorious. Then they didn’t win for the next 20 or so games I went to. ‘But by that point I was hooked. I read everything I could get my hands on - newspaper, books, programmes. In this job, I have spent hours searching for those elusive stats. ‘I used to get all the local newspapers delivered to my house and, when the kids were younger, would even have to escape for a few hours to Winchester Services on the M3 to prep for the show.’ Most of the copious notes Stelling makes - and he does 90 per cent of the show’s stats - are never used but, as we’ve seen week-in, week-out for years now, when that obscure third division left-back does finally break his goal duck after 146 attempts, we will definitely know about it first. The beauty of Soccer Saturday is that every team is treated with equal importance when Stelling is treating us to the fruits of his week buried away amid the record books. Stelling pictured on the Soccer Saturday set during a Sportsmail feature on the show back in 2012 . With Rachel Riley on the set of Channel 4's Countdown, which he presented between 2008 and 2011 . This comes perhaps from his love for perennial-underachievers Hartlepool - 92nd of the 92 League clubs as we speak - and the circuitous route through local newspapers and radio stations that delivered Stelling to where he is today. As well as Soccer Saturday, the 59-year-old fronts Sky’s Champions League coverage and was  the host of Channel 4’s iconic Countdown show between 2008 and 2011. But however glamorous the gig, the one constant over the years has been his insatiable passion for the greatest sport. ‘Many pundits these days are ex-pros of course and I might not be able to tell you what’s going on inside the dressing room,’ he says. ‘But if you just have that passion and knowledge for the game, you can be just as insightful.’ 'If Carlsberg did pundits….

"Italian giants AC Milan have released initial plans for a new 48,000 capacity stadium with the club set to move away from the ground share with rivals Inter. The club revealed earlier this week that they had made a bid for the land in the urban area of Portello and hope to open the ground in 2018-19. It is estimated that the project, that will involve redevelopment of the area including a hotel, a sports college and surrounding restaurants, will cost up to £240million. AC Milan unveil plans for a new 48,000-seater stadium in the urban area of Portello . The club hope the ground could be open in time for the 2018-19 season . The stadium has been designed to blend seamlessly in with the surroundings . Seven-time European Cup winners Milan have played in their current home, the San Siro, since the 1920s and, after selling the ground to the city of Milan, began sharing with local rivals Inter in 1947. The San Siro, which holds more than 80,000 spectators, was officially renamed the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium after the famous Italian striker that played for both Inter and AC Milan in the 1920, 30s and 40s. The new stadium - by architects Arup, who  also designed Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing - would be located just two-and-a-half miles from the San Siro. Jeremy Menez celebrates after netting during Milan's 3-1 win against Parma in Serie A on Sunday . It is estimated that the stadium will cost up to £240million to construct . The AC Milan stadium plans were the lead story in Wednesday's edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport . The club say the team behind the project studied more than 70 stadiums across the world and will share similarities with the English model in terms of access and security, while architect Emilio Faroldi says the stadium plan was inspired by Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. Milan announced that they are dedicated to providing an environmentally friendly stadium, that will be accessible by public transport in an attempt to reduce traffic flow and would be surrounded by green areas  open to the public all year round. The new venue will be made to look more like a building than a football ground and will be designed in a way that blends seamlessly into the architecture of the surrounding buildings. AC Milan have played at the San Siro, which has a capacity of more than 80,000, since 1926 . Milan have shared the stadium, which was officially renamed Giuseppe Meazza, with city rivals Inter . The height of the new stadium will not exceed 30m, in contrast to the San Siro which stands at 60m, and will even sit 10m below ground level to reduce the visual impact on the city. The very latest technology and soundproof materials will be used in a bid to keep noise from within the stadium on match days to a minimum to those on the outside. Final approval of the plans is expected in March.","AC Milan have shared the San Siro with rivals Inter since the 1940s .

"West Brom striker Saido Berahino hopes to move 'on to bigger things' in the future but insists his No 1 priority is helping the Baggies avoid relegation this season. The 21-year-old has scored 14 goals for his side so far this term - with four of them coming in the 7-0 thrashing of Conference outfit Gateshead in the FA Cup last month - and his goalscoring form has seen him linked with move away from The Hawthorns. The Burundi-born forward, who has made 13 appearances for England Under-21s since making his debut in 2013 and scored 10 goals, is committed to West Brom until 2017, but is confident he can continue to get the goals that will see him eventually move to a bigger club. Saido Berahino has found the net 14 times for West Bromwich Albion so far this season . Berahino  has his eyes firmly on making sure West Brom remain in the Premier League . Berahino told Sky Sports News: 'I'm taking care of my short-terms right now and if I keep scoring the goals and if I keep doing well for West Bromwich Albion, I know the future will be bright for me and I know that I'll go a long way. 'I need to stay focused on what I'm doing right now which is scoring the goals and keeping West Bromwich in the Premier League. 'If I can keep them in the Premier League and score as much goals as I can, I'm pretty sure the fans wouldn't mind me pushing on and moving on to bigger things. So I want to ensure that I keep them first in the Premier League and score as much goals as I can for them.' Liverpool and Tottenham have both been linked with Berahino, with reports of both sides lining up an offer of £25million. He admitted he was pleased to be linked with other teams, but reiterated that that his main focus was West Brom, who have won just one of their last seven league matches. But Berahino (left) has not ruled out moving on to 'bigger things' at some point in his career . West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be keen to keep hold of his star striker for as long as possible .

Radamel Falcao also scored in the United victory over Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday . Staff who worked in the kiosk were then searched and when one was found in possession of cash police were called and the arrest was made. A United source said: 'It wasn't exactly a criminal mastermind. You'd think whoever was going to do it would take the odd £20 but you can't take over £400 and think nobody will notice.' They added: 'Staff in the kiosks are forbidden from having cash on them when they go to work. When they have done the cashing up after they have closed they've realised that they were £400 down. 'They've then searched each person who was working in the kiosk and when they have found money on one of them they have called the police.'

"England look certain to lose their bowling coach as David Saker weighs up numerous offers to return to his native Australia. Saker, highly regarded for his role with the fast bowlers over the last five years, could even head for home ahead of the end of his contract in September. Sportsmail understands Saker has been offered three of the glut of coaching vacancies that have appeared in Australian cricket at the same time as he was considering ending his time in England. David Saker (left), seen here with England coach Peter Moores, is set to return to his native Australia . It is believed Saker has various offers on the table across the various forms of the game in Australia . That means he will choose between his two options in the Big Bash Twenty20 competition or a job in state cricket, either with Queensland or South Australia, rather than extend his role with England beyond this summer’s Ashes. The latest of the many vacancies emerged on Wednesday when Melbourne Stars did not renew the contract of coach Greg Shipperd, a job that would appeal to Saker. Saker, 48, has unquestionably played a big role in England’s successes after succeeding Ottis Gibson ahead of the World Twenty20 triumph in 2010. He has developed a strong relationship with bowlers like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad with his emphasis on man-management and the psychology of bowling rather than any obsession with technique or bio-mechanics. Saker keeps a close eye on England fast bowler Steven Finn during the 2014 series with India . Saker with former England coach Andy Flower during a match in Chelmsford in July 2013 . Yet it has not all been plain sailing for the former Victoria fast bowler and he accepted his share of the blame for the flawed strategy of concentrating on the height of Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steven Finn for the last Ashes. Finn’s technique collapsed under Saker’s watch but it would be extremely harsh to blame the Australian for all Finn’s problems when they appeared to stem from his habit of knocking the stumps with his right knee. It seems certain that Saker will remain with England for the World Cup but whether he stays beyond it is now doubtful even though his family are settled in the Midlands. Who comes in next for England is intriguing. Middlesex’s Richard Johnson has his supporters but it is more likely that Gibson, who was back working with the fast bowlers at their pre-tour training camp in South Africa, will be asked to return to the post having left his job with the West Indies. Meanwhile, Australia coach Darren Lehmann said today he is ‘sick’ of the speculation about the fitness and leadership of injured captain Michael Clarke. But Lehmann suggested that Clarke is on course to make Australia’s deadline of their second World Cup match, against Bangladesh, to prove his fitness and may even feature in their first one against England in Melbourne. Australia coach Darren Lehmann says he was 'sick' of the speculation surrounding captain Michael Clarke . Michael Clarke is on course to return for Australia's second World Cup match, against Bangladesh . ‘I’m sick of it and I’m looking forward to him coming back,’ said Lehmann as Clarke stepped up his campaign to prove his fitness. ‘He’s captain of Australia, the second most important position here after the Prime Minister, and we need our captain back and playing well.’ There have been strong suggestions here that Clarke is at loggerheads with chief selector Rod Marsh and has even fallen out with a team who now prefer the methods of stand-in Test captain Steve Smith. Clarke played for his club side Western Suburbs against Gordon as he continued his recovery from injury . But Lehmann said: ‘We all get on, that’s the great thing. From our point of view we want our captain fit for the most important tournament in four years. We’ve got the World Cup, a tour of West Indies and then the Ashes and we want him back because he captains this team very well.’ It seems certain that George Bailey, captain of the one-day team in Clarke’s absence, would be axed from the World Cup if Clarke proves his fitness in time.","England bowling coach David Saker expected to return to Australia .

"Prince Philip has never been one to mince his words. Though he has often managed to make mincemeat of certain situations through his choice of them. Now his best gaffes, blunders, linguistic faux pas and eyebrow-raisers have been chronicled in a new book, entitled (helpfully) Prince Philip: Wise Words And Golden Gaffes. Prince Philip - about whom a new book of his best gaffes has been written - with the Queen at Royal Ascot this year . So we are reminded of how the Duke told a one-legged man he could 'smuggle a bottle of gin out of the country in that artificial foot'; asked the Samaritans volunteer if he had ever attempted suicide; and said an exhibition of Ethiopian art looked like 'the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from school art lessons''. Composed by two royal correspondents, Phil Dampier - who has been writing about The Family for 26 years - and Ashley Walton - formerly of the Daily Express - the book also features illustrations by Richard Jolley, a cartoonist whose work appears in the Mail On Sunday, Private Eye and The Spectator. Blunderbuss: Prince Philip, left, is the subject of a new book, right, about his knack for saying the most controversial and inappropriate thing possible at any given moment . Of the Queen's husband, now 91, the writers say: 'He can be controversial, irascible, and sometimes downright rude. But would we have it any other way?'

There is no way she could possibly retaliate. During horse driving trials in Cumbria: 'Come on, you bl**dy idiots!' To an animal rights protestor shouting slogans at Cambridge University: .

"Lance Armstrong hit two parked cars after a night of partying in the US city of Aspen but agreed to let his longtime girlfriend take the blame to avoid national attention, police reports show. Aspen police cited the disgraced cyclist with failing to report an accident and speeding on January 12 after the December 28 accident, but only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, admitted to lying for him. Armstrong declined immediate comment, and his attorney, Pamela Mackey, didn't immediately return a call. Lance Armstrong agreed to let his girlfriend take the blame for a car accident, according to police reports . Hansen (left) eventually admitted that Armstrong was driving when the accident took place . Hansen initially told police she had been driving home from an Aspen Art Museum party when she lost control of Armstrong's GMC Yukon on the icy roads, hitting the cars. She said she drove because 'Lance had a little bit to drink,' according to the reports. A man who had been renting one of the damaged cars told a police detective that Hansen came running up to his house in high heels, apologising and promising to pay for the repairs. 'She said, ""I'm Anna, we're the Armstrongs, my husband's Lance, he was just driving maybe too fast around the corner or something,''' the man told police, according to the reports. He called the emergency services to report a hit-and-run. Hansen and Armstrong left the scene before police arrived. Detectives later interviewed Hansen, who eventually told them Armstrong was driving, but they had both decided to let her take the blame. 'We've had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and honestly, I've got teenagers, I just wanted to protect my family,' Hansen told police.

"We should stop washing chicken before cooking because doing so can spread potentially fatal  bacteria, health experts warn. Nearly half of Britons rinse their raw chicken and the practice could be behind thousands of cases of food poisoning, according to the Food Standards Agency. Research conducted by the FSA revealed that many cooks believe that rinsing cleaned the meat. The campylobacter bacteria, pictured, is responsible for 20,000 people being hospitalised a year resulting in 500 deaths . In fact, harmful campylobacter bacteria were often splashed on to kitchen surfaces and cooking equipment in the process. And any bacteria left on the chicken were killed off during the cooking process anyway. Campylobacter is responsible for most cases of food poisoning in Britain every year, affecting around 280,000 people. And contaminated chicken is behind an astonishing four out of five cases. Some studies even suggest that the bug can be picked up simply by handling a packet of chicken at the supermarket. The FSA said the bacteria costs the economy hundreds of millions of pounds in sick leave and NHS treatment. Research conducted by the FSA found that 44 per cent of cooks always washed their chicken before cooking. More than a third of people surveyed said they did this to get rid of germs, with another third saying they thought that washing helped remove dirt. But the agency warned that washing could spread illness among those who came into contact with campylobacter. Washing a chicken, pictured, can cause the campylobacter bacteria to spread in the region of three feet . The most common symptoms in those who develop illness are abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and vomiting. But it can have more severe consequences, particularly for children and adults over 60. They are most at risk of developing food poisoning due to their weaker immune systems. Symptoms for food poisoning caused by campylobacter bacteria will set in between two and five days after coming into contact with the germs. In the most extreme cases, dehydration can prove fatal if not treated quickly, and can also lead to the onset of reactive arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious illness affecting the nervous system.Despite fears about bacteria on meat, most harmful germs are killed by cooking thoroughly. Studies have estimated that food poisoning is behind 20,000 hospitalisations and 500 deaths every year in the UK. Research by consumer watchdog Which? previously found that washing raw chicken under a tap could spread bacteria up to 3ft from the sink. While chicken is behind most cases of campylobacter food poisoning, the bacteria is also found in untreated water, unpasteurised milk, undercooked chicken liver and liver paté. FSA chief executive Catherine Brown said: ‘Campylobacter is a serious issue. Not only can it cause severe illness and death, but it costs the economy hundreds of millions a year as a result of sickness absence and the burden on the NHS. ‘Although people tend to follow recommended practice when handling poultry, such as washing hands after touching raw chicken and ensuring it is thoroughly cooked, our research found washing raw chicken is also common practice.’ Ann Edwards contracted food poisoning from campylobacter bacteria in 1997 and still suffers significant health problems. The 67-year-old, from Hertfordshire, was admitted to hospital with bladder failure and lost two stone. She then developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, which left her paralysed from the chest down. She said: ‘I was in hospital for seven weeks and even now – 17 years later – I have no movement in my toes and rely on a walking stick. Physically, it has been the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I urge anyone who is handling chicken to take care.’","Campylobacter causes 280,000 cases of food poisoning in Britain a year .

"One of the UK’s biggest internet firms has admitted there is no ‘social or moral framework’ on the internet, putting children at risk. Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, told MPs that the online world was a ‘double-edged sword’ for youngsters and that ‘internet safety is the road safety of our generation’. Charities have warned that rising numbers of children are falling victim to ‘cyberbullying’ and being exposed to online pornography. Miss Harding said the dangers that youngsters encounter online are just as disturbing as being bullied in the playground . Miss Harding said the dangers that youngsters encounter online are just as disturbing as being bullied in the playground but the risks are far ‘less visible’. TalkTalk, which has 4million UK subscribers, was the first provider to allow parents to impose anti-pornography filters for all internet access in their home. But speaking to the Commons Culture Select Committee yesterday, Miss Harding admitted that more could be done by internet firms. ‘The number of things that can happen to a child online are just as many as can happen to a child in the playground – only it’s more immediate and they’ve got the whole world at their fingertips,’ she said. ‘On bullying I don’t think that the fundamental issues are any different from being in the playground. ‘The adult supervising the playground has a role to play, the children have a role to play as do their parents and there’s a big public awareness challenge … because it’s so much less visible than your child being physically bullied in the playground.’ Some 1.2million TalkTalk customers are signed up to its filters, but Miss Harding warned that no filter could block everything, and that education in schools was vitally important . Miss Harding added: ‘The social and moral framework for the digital world doesn’t exist yet, so I do think there is an important role for legislators to play in thinking through … absolute black and white rules that we need to put in place. ‘There is a clear role for the owners or builders of the playgrounds, whether that’s the social networking sites or the internet service providers to think through how to provide children, parents, teachers with the tools to keep the environment safe.’ The Daily Mail has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn, with adults only able to access it after an age verification check. In the summer David Cameron announced that, for the first time, all homes would be asked if they want to impose an anti-porn filter. Some 1.2million TalkTalk customers are signed up to its filters, but Miss Harding warned that no filter could block everything, and that education in schools was vitally important. ‘Internet safety is the road safety of our generation,’ she said. ‘When I was a child there was Clunk Click, we had the Green Cross Code, seat belts were just being rolled out into cars, the airbag hadn’t yet been invented. ‘There was a whole load of public awareness and education in schools.’ Miss Harding added: ‘We at TalkTalk have lobbied to see internet safety on the primary curriculum and we’re delighted to see that it will be coming in.’ Nicholas Lansman, secretary general of the Internet Service Providers’ Association, said: ‘Technology alone is not the only solution and education and awareness is fundamental to the process.’ Last night Labour peer Lord Sugar called for Ofcom’s remit to be widened. The star of BBC show The Apprentice said the watchdog should be a ‘full-blown regulator’ for the internet, protecting children from harmful material online. ÷THE former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre warned that ‘sexualised’ pop stars such as Miley Cyrus have more effect on children than porn. Jim Gamble said that unlike online porn there was no filter to control youngsters watching such celebrities. He said the behaviour of Miley Cyrus and other stars ‘has a far greater and much more easily accessible influence on young people today than actually seeing adult, or hardcore pornography’.","Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, told MPs that the online world was a 'double-edged sword'

"Facebook has come under heavy criticism for refusing to remove extremely graphic pictures of a war veterans suicide posted to the social media giant on Sunday . Despite the pleas of his family and friends, grisly images of former Marine Daniel Rey Wolfe remained online until Wednesday, after he took his own life in a Tulsa, Oklahoma squat. Facebook initially told his loved ones that the gruesome pictures of deep puncture wounds on his legs captioned with heartbreaking goodbye messages did not violate their community standards, outraging them and veteran's organizations. Tragedy: Daniel Rey Wolfe took his own life on Sunday night or Monday morning and updated Facebook with pictures of his suicide . Despite repeated calls over two days to remove the photographs, Facebook at first refused to budge on the issue. According to an investigation by Gawker, Facebook justified not removing the photographs because they make a distinction between cases of someone who is documenting their own self-harm as opposed to someone promoting others self-harm. A spokesperson for Facebook told Gawker they 'have been advised by experts in that space that removing content could be detrimental' in the case of those committing self-harm. In essence, if they removed cries for help, then family and friends would not know to intervene. 'Facebook has long relied on guidance from suicide prevention and other mental health experts to equip friends and others to take action when they notice a friend in distress,' said a spokesman for Facebook to MailOnline. 'As part of this approach, we’ve been advised of the importance of allowing images of self-harm to remain on Facebook since they are legitimate cries for help and will increase the likelihood a friend reaches them in time. 'We of course remove content reported to us for encouraging or promoting self-harm.' Indeed, Wolfe's friends and family did . respond to his horrifying pictures almost immediately, desperately . trying to reach him and find him. Strength: Daniel Wolfe was known by his comrades as a good friend and soldier who found re-adjusting to civilian life difficult . Warning: Daniel Wolfe posted this to his Facebook page on Sunday evening - heralding his suicide . Requests: Wolfe began to worry his friends and family when messages like this started to appear . Heartbreaking: The mental anguish that Wolfe was going through was clear in this message . Definite: Daniel Wolfe re-iterated his desire for a funeral fit for a warrior . The father-of-one was reportedly suffering from deep depression brought on by money problems and an undiagnosed case of PTSD. He had become known as a drifter in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, 'going from place to place' and police thought of him not as a trouble maker, but as someone 'down on his luck.' On Sunday night, his troubled state of mind became clear when he posted a series of messages that increased in morbidity with each subsequent update. 'The only fight I ever lost was the one to myself,' wrote Wolfe on Sunday night, followed by 'When my body moves no more give me a vikings funeral.' Directly after that Wolfe uploaded four pictures - one of a half-empty bottle of vodka, with the caption, 'Byee b****s' - and the other three showing where he had cut himself. This caused his friends to launch into full-on panic stations as they pleaded with him to snap out of it and to contact the Veterans Association. Reaching out: Daniel Wolfe's friends and family tried their best to help the stricken soldier . Gruesome: This is the worst picture (heavily blurred by MailOnline) that Wolfe posted to Facebook with the caption, 'I'm leaking good now' In the final, awful picture of his mutilated leg, Wolfe comments, 'I'm leaking good now.' Broken Arrow police found Wolfe dead in an 'unoccupied dwelling' on Tuesday evening and informed his family. However, the tragic last pictures he posted were still on Facebook and so his family asked the social media site to remove them. Gawker was contacted by the family after their attempts to report the images of Wolfe's suicide were rebuffed. 'We reviewed the photo you reported for containing graphic violence and found it doesn't violate our community standards,' was Facebook's initial reply. The Veteran's Association asked Facebook to remove them, but they too were met with a brick wall. 'It hurt and outraged me,' said Wolfe's former comrade Douglas Tripp to Gawker. Standards: This was the message that Facebook provided when asked to remove the photographs . 'When we would report the pictures they would tell us thank you for trying to make Facebook a safer place, but the images didn't violate their terms and conditions. 'When it clearly says images of self harm and mutilation are against their policy. How does leaving those pictures up make Facebook safer?' Despite accepting Facebook's justification that images posted by those in distress can be extremely important, Wolfe's friends and family wanted to know why the pictures of a dead man couldn't be removed. Facebook replied that in these cases the family is contacted and asked if they want their deceased relative's page to stay up in memorial or to be deleted. In this case however, Wolfe's family were more concerned with the length of time the images were still online for. Eventually, even though the photographs apparently did not violate Facebook's standards, they were only removed because the family asked. In response to the tragedy and controversy a Facebook spokesman said, 'We’re saddened by this tragedy and offer our deepest sympathies to Mr. Wolfe’s friends and family, particularly those who worked so quickly to reach him during his time of need, . 'As soon as people reported these posts and photos to Facebook, we immediately suggested a crisis hotline and attempted to connect Mr. Wolfe with specific suicide prevention resources. 'His friends took action and notified police as well as the Veterans Crisis Line. Despite their swift response, we were notified of Mr. Wolfe’s death and unpublished his profile.'","Former Marine Daniel Rey Wolfe posted disturbing pictures documenting his suicide on Sunday .

"'Menace': 60 per cent of children polled said they have been asked for explicit photos (posed by model) More than half of teenagers have been asked to take an explicit self-portrait on their mobiles, according to a survey that reveals the full extent of the ‘sexting’ menace in schools. The practice of swapping sexual images is now seen as ‘pretty normal’ by youngsters, with more than half saying they had received an intimate photo or video, and 40 per cent having taken one of themselves. Worryingly, many of the children polled by the charity ChildLine were happy to send revealing photos of themselves to strangers. As well as being shared on teens’ smart phones, the pictures are also posted online on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat – putting them at risk of being stolen. ChildLine said young people were taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images, and warned that some were being driven to the brink of suicide after the photos became widely shared. The survey of almost 500 children aged between 13 and 18 shows that 60 per cent have been asked for a sexual image or video – an indication of the huge pressures faced by youngsters to participate. Of those who say they have sent a picture of themselves, a third said it had gone to someone they knew online but had never met, while 15 per cent admitted they had sent pictures to a total stranger. Peter Liver, director of ChildLine Services, said the rise of classroom sexting was linked, in part, to the widespread availability of porn online. ‘The sharing of these images do not necessarily happen in isolation - it can be related to other online issues such as cyber-bullying and draw from influences such as celebrity and easy access of online pornography,’ he said. ‘With the constant rise in smart technology being made available to young people, the self-generating and sharing of sexually-explicit images is not a fad that will go away. ‘We know that threatening young people with the consequences of their actions is not the most impactful way to engage them, in a similar way as telling them not to drink or smoke.’ The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect youngsters, with over-18s only being able to see adult sites after a strict age verification check. Earlier this week we revealed that tens of thousands of these intimate photos and videos are stolen and end up on paedophile websites. To deal with the problem, ChildLine is now teaming up with the Internet Watch Foundation so that children have a point of contact to ensure that pictures of them are taken offline. And they have launched a new mobile phone app, Zipit, to which offers witty images to send instead of explicit ones, advice for how to engage in safe chat, what to do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. The ChildLine survey showed that 60.1 per cent of the youngsters had been asked to send a ‘sext’, while 38.3 per cent had created one. Most sent them to boyfriends and girlfriends, but others shared them with close friends. Some 32.3 per cent said it had gone to someone they knew online but not in real life, while 15.3 per cent said they had sent a picture to a total stranger. Of those who had sent a picture, 20 per cent said it had been shared with others, while 28.3 per cent said they did not know. James, the 17-year-old interviewed by ChildLine, said he still engaged in the practice of sexting despite the dangers. ‘There are definitely risks involved,’ he said. ‘Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. ‘They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal.’ Danger: A third of people who sent 'sexts' said they went to people they had met only online, while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers (posed by model) He added: ‘I’ve never pressured anyone into sexting, and when any girl I’ve been seeing hasn’t been interested I’ve been fine with that. There are some people though who will put pressure on you. ‘You do sometimes get a negative reaction to something you send, like people saying they’ve “seen bigger”.’ James - his name has been changed to protect his identity - said that he often swaps photos with complete strangers. ‘I do worry about who is behind the phones of the people I sext with - obviously if you don’t know the person in real life there’s no guarantee they are who they say they are,’ he said. ‘There is also a big risk around the ages of the girls you contact. Of course you can ask, but there’s no proof that they’re telling the truth.’ Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said: ‘We have sadly tracked a marked rise in self-generated sexual content featuring young people. ‘A snapshot study conducted by IWF analysts over a 47-hour period found well over 12,000 self-generated images and videos of young people online. Most recently, we see images and videos being gathered together and sold for commercial gain. ‘The IWF works strictly within UK law; we have to be certain that the image features someone under the age of 18 which is why this partnership with ChildLine is all the more important to ensure we can receive the information to remove explicit content as soon as possible.’","ChildLine poll of 500 children showed the extent of sexting culture in schools .

"The number of children who own a mobile phone has fallen for the first time as they turn to tablet computers to access the internet. The overall number of children aged five . to 15 owning a mobile fell from 49 per cent last year to 43 per cent this year, the . first decrease since Ofcom began compiling the figures in 2005. This was mainly because the proportion . of eight to 11-year-olds who own a basic mobile phone - as opposed to a . smartphone - fell steeply to 15 per cent from 28 per cent last year. Ofcom has revealed that tablet use in five to 15-year-olds has risen sharply from 14 per cent to 42 per cent . Among this age group, 18 per cent now own a smartphone and the same proportion own a tablet computer. While the smartphone figure is largely stable year-on-year, tablet ownership has grown four-fold among eight to 11-year-olds since last year's figure of 4 per cent. Smartphones remain more widely used among older children aged 12 to 15, with 62 per cent owning one, but 26 per cent now own a tablet computer, up from just 7 per cent last year. Smartphones remain more widely used among older children aged 12 to 15, with 62 per cent owning one . Tablet computers are becoming a must-have device for children of all ages, according to Ofcom's figures. The use of tablets has tripled among five to 15-year-olds, up from 14 per cent to 42 per cent since 2012, and more than a quarter of three and four-year-olds now use a tablet computer at home. Tablet usage is also rising rapidly among five to seven-year-olds, up from 11 per cent last year to 39 per cent, and eight to 11-year-olds, up from 13 per cent last year to 44 per cent. The age groups are five times more likely than last year to use mostly a tablet when accessing the internet at home. The proportion of children mainly using a laptop, netbook or desktop computer to use the internet has fallen from 85 per cent last year to 68 per cent. Children with smartphones send an estimated 184 instant messages (IM) in a typical week, while those aged 12 to 15 send an average of 255 text messages per week, up from 193 last year. Around one in five eight to 11-year-olds now say they mostly use the internet in their bedroom, up from 12 per cent last year. Conversely, the proportion with a TV in the bedroom has fallen to 52 per cent from 59 per cent last year, while 47 per cent of five to 15-year-olds have a games console in their bedroom compared with 56 per cent last year. More than four in 10 parents of five to 15-year-olds who use a home PC, laptop or netbook to go online say they have some kind of parental controls in place. In a similar study, lifestyle website goodtoknow.co.uk found 94 per cent of parents use their own technology devices in a similar way to dummies; to pacify the children and act as a distraction tool. In total, 80 per cent of goodtoknow.co.uk readers said they personalise their mobile phone devices specifically for their kids by downloading up to ten apps. The research also found that 77 per cent of children under the age of ten use their parents' devices on a daily basis, with 91.2 per cent using it to play games and browse the web. Some 8.8 per cent use it for their homework. More than two thirds of (71 per cent) of parents think that devices should automatically come with stricter parental controls. Although 18 per cent of internet users aged 12 to 15 say they know how to change online filters or controls, just six per cent say they have done so in the past year. A quarter of parents of five to 15-year-old internet users are concerned about cyberbullying, while one in seven said they were concerned about their child cyberbullying somebody else.

"Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has insinuated that rivals Real Madrid had a part to play in the Neymar transfer court case in which he has been called to give evidence. 'We have done nothing wrong and we will keep saying the truth. The signing of Neymar took place using the most prestigious lawyers,' Bartomeu told Spanish television. 'Other clubs wanted to sign Neymar paying more money but they didn't manage it and they didn't like that. Someone now has overstepped the line. Barcelona are being investigated over the transfer of Neymar (right) from Santos in 2013 . Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu has suggested that Real Madrid are partly to blame for the court case . 'I'm not saying Madrid are behind this but Neymar's father told me that there were two offers: Barca and Madrid. Madrid wanted to buy him and were ready to pay more for him. 'A year ago Neymar was playing well and then all this fuss suddenly came up. Maybe somebody doesn't like him. Now again he is playing well and there is another judicial process.' Bartomeu also suggested that there is a political campaign against the club over its prominent role in Catalan nationalism. 'A year ago we allowed the Camp Nou to be used for the Liberty Concert, we play with the colours of the Senyera (the Catalan flag)... maybe that isn't liked,' he said. 'I can see a sport and politics issue but we are going to keep going as we are and reach the end which is my role. We are paying a political price.' Bartomeu will be questioned on February 13 over whether Barcelona and their directors defrauded the Spanish tax office of £2.1million (2.8m euros) during the 2014 tax year. Neymar celebrates scoring his side's opening goal against Villarreal at the Nou Camp on Sunday . It is claimed that Barcelona defrauded the Spanish tax office of around £2.1m when they signed Neymar . Barcelona initially claimed that the cost of the Neymar transfer from Santos ahead of last season was £43m (57.1m euros) but the case was taken to court by a fan seeking transparency over the deal. Former president Sandro Rosell resigned in January, 2014, after a judge decided to investigate and call him to testify. Bartomeu, having replaced Rosell, gave a breakdown of the cost of the Neymar transfer which revealed that it amounted to £64.9m (86.2m euros) with the inclusion of payments to the player and his family. Judge Pablo Ruz feels there is sufficient argument to investigate a claim that tax was not paid on an outstanding installment of the transfer that took place at the start of Bartomeu's presidency in January last year. Bartomeu's pending court appearance is the latest incident in a troubled year for him at the helm of the club. The boardroom crisis in the aftermath of a transfer ban for two windows over the signing of foreign under 18 players led him to bring forward presidential elections to the end of this season.

"Arsene Wenger may have closed his transfer window early this winter, but the Arsenal boss can be safe in the knowledge that with Mathieu Debuchy sidelined whilst he recovers from a dislocated shoulder and Calum Chambers returning from illness, he has more than enough depth in the right-back position, according to Gary Neville. After a relatively quiet January at the Emirates - with Wenger bringing in Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista and 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik - Neville was full of praise for 19-year-old defender Hector Bellerin, who he believes is going from strength to strength. Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, the former Manchester United and England right-back admitted how impressed he was with the young defender's improvement this season since being thrust into the side against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in September. Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin celebrates with team-mates after his goal against Aston Villa on Sunday . Bellerin impressed in The Gunners' convincing victory and scored a delightful placed effort from distance . Since being thrust into the limelight against Borussia Dortmund in September Bellerin has hugely improved . With Wenger short on options thanks to injuries to Debuchy, Chambers and Nacho Monreal, Bellerin - who made his Arsenal debut against West Brom in the 2013 League Cup before a short loan spell with Watford -  was thrown in at the deep end at the Westfalenstadion earlier this season when his side fell 2-0 to the Bundesliga strugglers. Age: 19 . Youth career . (2003-2011) - Barcelona . (2011-2013) - Arsenal . Senior career (league) (2013-2014) - Watford (loan) - 8 appearances . (2013-) - Arsenal - 7 appearances, 1 goal . However, despite admitting he was not impressed with Bellerin's maiden Champions League performance in Germany, Neville thinks the Arsenal defender is finding his feet after solid performances against Manchester City and Aston VIlla. 'The one that stood out most for me having watched him come back into the team against Manchester City and see him at close hand [against Villa] was Bellerin the full back,' Neville said. 'He was thrust into the team in September [at Borussia Dortmund] and he really struggled. He looked like it was too early for him. The Spaniard's long-range strike against Aston Villa topped off a great afternoon for the Gunners . 'He got put back into another big game against Manchester City and he was massively impressive. 'The first thing is - has he got speed? I was told he beat not only Walcott's record but Henry's record for over 40 metres. 'He's lightning quick. That gives you a great chance as a full back.' The Gunners are in a great run of form, winning five games on the bounce after their 5-0 dismantling of Villa. Pundit Gary Neville said that the 19-year-old is maturing into a fine full back since his Gunners introduction . Up next are local rivals Tottenham who, like Arsenal, are hoping to work their way into a Champions League spot with a win at White Hart Lane. However, Neville expects Arsenal's short trip across north London to be a completely different kettle of fish for the youngster, with the likes of Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen in the form of their lives. '[Bellerin is] going to get tested by Christian Eriksen at the weekend, who's going to give him a different type of problem,' Neville added. 'But he's come into the team and its great for a young player to see them develop and mature.'","Gary Neville has been impressed by the progress shown by Hector Bellerin .

"Manchester United's fanbase is regarded as one of, if not the biggest, in the world and their new goalkeeper Victor Valdes has swiftly gained an insight into how many people support the club across the globe. The former Barcelona stopper has gained an incredible 145,000 extra Twitter followers upon arriving at Old Trafford on an 18-month contract, taking his overall following up to 3.92 million. Of all the January transfer moves, Valdes comfortably enjoyed the biggest spike in activity according to Twitter statistics, although Juan Cuadrado's following on the social media sight has already grown by 100,000 to 1.56 million after his transfer was confirmed on Monday. Victor Valdes has gained an extra 145,000 followers on Twitter after he signed for Manchester United . But Arsenal were the most discussed Premier League team throughout the transfer window . Arsenal, who signed Gabriel Paulista, were the most discussed team throughout the January window . Lukas Podolski's loan move from Arsenal to Inter Milan saw the World Cup winner's number of followers swell to 2.44 million, the third highest increase during the January window. It was almost twice as many as new team-mate Xherdan Shaqiri, who joined Inter on loan from Bayern Munich but had an increase of 52,000. Real Madrid's new attacking midfielder Lucas Silva, who signed from Cruzeiro, had a spike of 55,000. But while United's considerable fanbase flexed its power to get behind Valdes, the club were not the most discussed Premier League side throughout January. Instead, it was Arsenal who sparked the most Twitter talk, despite tying up their business with the arrival of defender Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal on January 28, five days before the window was closed. United were second with Chelsea third. Liverpool passed up the opportunity to sign any reinforcements but were still the fourth most talked about English side, ahead of Premier League champions Manchester City who purchased Wilfried Bony from Swansea for a reported £28million. The month-long speculation surrounding Colombia international Cuadrado's switch to Stamford Bridge made the transfer the most discussed on Twitter while the window was open. The midfielder's move received a bigger volume of tweets than Martin Odegaard choosing to join Real Madrid, Valdes signing for United and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard signing an agreement to join LA Galaxy once his contract expires at Anfield.

"Ten minutes or so into the second half of Manchester United's FA Cup game against Cambridge on Tuesday night, the home team were winning 2-0 and progress to the next round was all but assured. United's captain, however, was found 20 yards inside his own half executing a sliding tackle on breaking opponent Cameron McGheean. This, in essence, is the new life of Wayne Rooney. England's captain and most reliable centre forward is no longer a striker for his own football club. Louis van Gaal's team formation all but confirmed what Rooney has known for a while and as national coach Roy Hodgson attempts to move his own team forward he is going to have to accept it, too. Manchester United's Wayne Rooney is no longer a striker at his own club as he is pushed back in midfield . Rooney sat back away from the action up front against Cambridge in his new role under Louis van Gaal . Rooney applauds the fans at Old Trafford after Manchester United ran out comfortable winners on Tuesday . United's average positions against Cambridge on Tuesday night with Rooney (No 10) and Fellaini (31) Rooney has always liked to tackle, has always liked to roam the field in search of the ball. This is different, though. Van Gaal does not want to play Rooney as a central striker anymore, a fact confirmed when he sent his team out with Marouane Fellaini in a position further advanced than United's third-placed record goalscorer on Tuesday. 'I think he's a bit lost,' was the opinion of former United forward Lou Macari, now an in-house TV analyst. 'He's there to score goals. 'Can he play in midfield? He can because he's good but is it his best position? In last six or seven games, it's apparent that it's where he is going to play. 'He's the most natural goalscorer at the club and always has been. His goals tell you that. He knows whether to bend it, place it or drive it or take a touch. There is an art in that and he has got it. 'At the moment he is wasted in midfield. He was at the far post in front of how own goal with ten minutes to go, challenging as the Cambridge defender came in. United were 3-0 up. 'Why is he there? Is that really the best place for him?' Rooney has long since been a victim of his own versatility and energy at Old Trafford. He tackles, passes and anticipates more than well enough to play in the middle of the field. Contrary to what Macari said, he does not look lost there but whether that is his best position is something that can only fuel debate. Sir Alex Ferguson admitted six years ago that he had played Rooney out of position too often in order to accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo. He vowed to change that and never did. David Moyes, meanwhile, spoke earnestly about restoring Rooney to his 'best position' last season but by that stage Robin van Persie was the club's automatic choice at 'number nine'. Rooney shoots against Cambridge but the England centre forward finds it hard to push forward these days . Rooney is living a new life under Van Gaal as the Manchester United manager avoids using him up front . Rooney averaged a position further back than Marouane Fellaini (left) and Juan Mata (right) on Tuesday night . Rooney's average position on the pitch this season . There is a difference, though, between Rooney playing in and around a central striker and being transformed in to a much deeper player, a midfield player. Rooney always knew the change would come one day but – as he said in an interview last September – he did not expect it to come for a couple of years or more. 'The manager goes into so much detail about the opposition and there'll be times I'll be needed to play deeper or wider, which I've no problem doing,' Rooney told the Sunday Times. 'But in the main I feel I've still got at least two or three years up front. I know I've the qualities to play in midfield. I've done it comfortably. 'There'll come a time when I move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week, it could be in a couple of years. It's down to the manager and I'll accept it.' Van Gaal has accelerated that process now. The United manager's centre forwards are now Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and young James Wilson. It's a decent line up, certainly, but the fact that Rooney is no longer on the list maybe says more about the lack of quality midfield options available to Van Gaal than anything else. What Hodgson makes of it is anybody's guess. Van Gaal will not concern himself with this and nor should he. United's supporters – notoriously ambivalent about the national team – will not lose sleep either. The England head coach, though, will be concerned. This season has seen Hodgson's options in the centre forward department expand significantly. Van Gaal has taken over at Manchester United and given the club's English captain an entirely new role . Van Gaal has moved Rooney back although the Manchester United star still has eight goals this season . England manager Roy Hodgson has decisions to make for who to use up front next month . Rooney may partner Daniel Sturridge (right) up front but his new position could make Hodgson reconsider . At least one happy striker on Tuesday night was James Wilson, who scored as United beat Cambridge 3-0 at Old Trafford. Click here for Ian Ladyman's match report . A Barclays Premier League season that has seen Harry Kane, Charlie Austin and Danny Ings blossom, for example, will surely be reflected in the squad when England gather for their next mind-numbing Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next month. What is certain, though, is that Hodgson started this campaign with the image on an attacking partnership of Daniel Sturridge and Rooney in mind for next summer's finals in France and will not have expected to consider deviating very much from that in the intervening months. Currently Rooney has eight goals for his club this season and has scored in just one United game since the middle of December. Austin, meanwhile, has 13, Kane 20 and Ings – who didn't get going until the end of October – seven. These are statistics that very much reflect the direction of Rooney's career at United. Asked about it on Tuesday night, Van Gaal gave little away, preferring to talk about Fellaini's height – 'he is a very long player' – than the actual matter in hand. That is the United manager's prerogative. He will do what he thinks is best for his club and currently he is managing to nudge his peculiar and inconsistent team vaguely along in the right direction. They are third in the Premier League and now in round five of the FA Cup. Rooney, though, must adjust to a drastic change in his circumstances. Had been deployed much further back on Tuesday night, he would have been untangling his studs from his own goal net. Rooney's stats show that he is adapting to his new life in midfield away from acting as a striker . Rooney must adjust to his new role under Van Gaal and he was playing in that position against Cambridge .","Wayne Rooney averaged a position behind Marouane Fellaini on Tuesday night as Manchester United beat Cambridge at Old Trafford .

Floyd Mayweather posted this video on his Instagram of him receiving a fish pedicure . The fighter (centre) was thought to have agreed a deal to fight Manny Pacquaio but talks have stalled . He posted: 'While they continue to lie about making the fight... I'm just going to continue to travel and explore the world on my private jet. #FightNotMadeYet #Jamaica.' Pacquiao and Mayweather came face-to-face for the first time when they both attended the game between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks. The two of them swapped phone numbers before meeting up again at a hotel to discuss the details of the fight. Pacquiao had been calling out the undefeated champion for a number of years and thought he had finally got his wish - until the deal stalled and it's unclear if it's going to be resolved.

"Being a dentist is not always an easy job. Performing painful surgery on grumpy patients can test the patience - and nerves - of even the most experienced. But when that patient is a six-tonne elephant needing root canal or a lion with toothache, it makes the task all the more trickier. However, for Dr. Gerhard Steenkamp, it is all in a days work.

'There's been plenty of carnivores too - lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs. 'But the most hair raising experiences have been with the hippos and elephants.

"Dyslexia is a meaningless label sought out by middle-class parents who fear their children being branded stupid or lazy, an academic has claimed. Professor Julian Elliott, an educational psychologist and former special needs teacher, said it is clear that some children do have genuine, complex reading problems. However, the definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is impossible to make any meaningful separation from other poor readers. And trying to do so is a ‘pointless’ waste of resources – because the same techniques help both groups of children improve their reading. Scroll down for video . Professor Julian Elliot of Durham University has claimed dyslexia is a meaningless label sought out by middle-class parents who fear their child being branded stupid . The . Durham University professor described dyslexia as a ‘useless term’ that . should be abandoned. Rather than putting children though expensive and . lengthy diagnostic tests, schools should focus on identifying early on . those who struggle to read and treat all of those with problems equally. However, . charities disputed his claims and said a diagnosis of dyslexia has . scientific and educational value. The British Dyslexia Association . estimates that 10 per cent of Britons have dyslexia, or word blindness, . and have trouble learning to spell, read and write. The professor says the definition of dyslexia is so broad it does not allow for the separation between suffering from the condition and just being a poor reader . While children . diagnosed with the condition can get more individual teaching help and . extra time on exams, Professor Elliott claims that their parents also . benefit from the ‘pseudo-medical’ label. Diagnoses tend to be found . in more affluent areas and he argues that some middle-class parents seek . it out because they fear their children will be judged slow or lazy. ‘Most . parents are delighted with the label,’ said the professor. ‘Professionals have said to me that they agree but they still use the . term because they make people happy.’ He also argues that the . definition of dyslexia is so broad that it is meaningless. ‘You have a . long list of symptoms, things like anxiety when reading out loud, but . any kid that is learning to read might be expected to show some . anxiety,’ says Professor Elliott. ‘You show a parent this list and they . say, “You are right, I didn’t realise my kid was dyslexic.” ‘It is like showing someone a horoscope, they look at it and see bits of themselves in it.’ Professor . Elliott added that while parents may only want the best for their . children, they are being ‘woefully misled about the value of a dyslexia . diagnosis’. View the full video HERE . What is dyslexia? - Kelli Sandman-Hurley . In 2009, the Commons Science and Technology Committee . inquiry into literacy concluded that the definition of dyslexia was too . broad to be meaningful. The influential committee of MPs also accused . the Government of ‘bowing to pressure from the dyslexia lobby’ when . formulating its educational policy. Professor Elliott said: 'Diagnoses tend to be found in more affluent areas, it is quite clear that it isn't found a much in disadvantaged areas. Most parents are delighted with the diagnosis' But Dr John Rack, of the charity Dyslexia Action, said that the term ‘has value both scientifically and educationally’. ‘We . don’t accept the argument that it is wasteful to try to understand the . different reasons why different people struggle,’ he said. ‘And for very . many, those reasons fall into a consistent and recognisable pattern . that it is helpful to call dyslexia. ‘Helpful for individuals because . it makes sense out of past struggles and helpful for teachers who can . plan the way they teach, to overcome or find ways around the particular . blocks that are there.’","Durham University's Professor Julian Elliot says the definition is so broad it is impossible to separate sufferers from those who are poor readers .

"These heartbreaking pictures show the scarred faces of the children who have become the innocent victims of war as conflict in the Middle East escalates. Three-year-old Rahaf and four-year-old Kamar were asleep at home with their family in Homs, Syria, when the government shelled the house. Rahaf's face and hands were badly burned as the building caught fire, while Kamar's legs and hands and most of her face were similarly injured. They are now being cared for in Jordan by Medicins Sans Frontieres, where they play quietly with children like 13-year-old Kheta, who has to wear a special mask after most of her face was burnt in a car explosion at Fallujah, Iraq. Young suffering: Syrian girls Rahaf and Kamar show a picture of themselves before they were injured during the violence in their country, as they attend a psychological therapy session in Amman . The way we were: The girls have had multiple reconstructive surgeries and now attend daily therapy sessions run by Medicins Sans Frontieres alongside dozens of other refugees . Brutal treatment: The two girls play with Khetam from Iraq, who has also fled violence in her country and is being cared for in Amman . Stateless: The school in these youngsters' countries have been bombed or have become temporary shelters for refugees . Their wide, soulful eyes stare out . from their ravaged faces following the traumatic experience of having . multiple reconstructive operations on their faces after their escape . from their homelands. Like thousands of others, Rahaf and Kamar fled widespread violence in Syria, where many children have been tortured or sexually abused and schools have become battlegrounds or precarious refugee camps. There are also reports of the opposition . Free Syrian Army using children in its forces, according to UN . representative Leila Zerrougui. Almost 30,000 people have been killed over the past 18 months following the Syrian government's crackdown on pro-democracy activists. Anti-Assad Syrian groups claim that close to 2,000 children have died in the conflict so far. In July, a British-based group called War Child said the Syrian conflict is 'disturbingly unique' in the deliberate targeting of children, citing reports of hundreds of children being detained by the regime. Widespread unrest: The French's charity's project has extended to treat Yemenis, Palestinians, Libyans and now Syrians . Traumatising experience: The aid centre was first set up in 2006 for victims of the war in Iraq, but has now been forced to expand . Shell-shocked: A boy injured by a Syrian Army sniper slumps in a chair at Dar al Shifa hospital in Aleppo, Syria . Painful experience: An injured child cries out as he is treated on a table while adults receive first aid on the floor . Brutality: Doctors administer first aid to two injured men at the hospital as Free Syrian Army fighters and troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad clash in the city of Aleppo outside the hospital doors . 'Not one of [Syria’s] two million children and young people can now be considered safe,' it said. An official report in August to the UN Human Rights Council found the Assad government responsible for 49 children killed last May in a massacre in the village of Houla. This has laid the groundwork for possible prosecution of Syrian leaders in the International Criminal Court. Ms Zerrougui said the situation for children in Syria was now 'dire', during a Security Council session devoted to naming and shaming governments and armed groups that recruit, attack, or kill children. The council voted 11 to 0 to cite 52 such governments and groups, including Syria. The MSF clinic in Jordan's capital, Amman, was set up in 2006 to provide reconstructive surgery to Iraqis - many of them children - injured by bomb blasts and bullets. Since last year's political convulsions in the Arab world and the continuing unrest across the region, the project has expanded to treat Yemenis, Palestinians, Libyans and now Syrians. Shocking sight: A wounded father and his son, who has lost part of one leg in a Syrian Army artillery shelling, are carried home in a truck after been treated by doctors in Aleppo . Desperate attempts: A Syrian youth holds a child wounded by Syrian Army shelling near Dar El Shifa hospital in Aleppo, Syria . Under attack: Doctors treat the wounds of a boy hit by artillery shelling as civilians become daily targets for Syrian Army snipers . Appalling: About 90 per cent of the wounded and the dead are civilians . Serious fears: A Syrian boy helps his father sell birds at a street stall in Aleppo, where violent clashes are causing numerous casualties . There are 70 Syrians currently receiving medical care for bullet wounds and torture injuries at the free hospital in Amman, and so many are arriving that a specialised trauma unit reserved for Syrians is about to be opened. Antoine Foucher, MSF director in Jordan, said: 'The conflict in Syria is intensifying and working inside the country is extremely difficult, which is why MSF is providing treatment to wounded Syrians who have managed to cross the border into Jordan.' The sharp rise in casualties and refugees indicates the growing intensity of the conflict, which developed from peaceful protests against Assad in March 2011 into a full-scale civil war. Civilians have become daily targets for Syrian Army snipers and artillery shelling, and most of those fleeing are taking refuge in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In chaos: A Free Syrian Army fighter looks for cover after firing against government forces in Aleppo, Syria, where many civilians are still trapped . Death and fear: A Syrian woman walks past a body in front of Dar El Shifa Hospital, Aleppo, with rebels claiming to have completely cut off the highway link to Damascus to drive out government troops . To close: A wounded Syrian man in Aleppo. Doctors from Jordan are unable to reach people until they are a reasonable distance from the conflict, but many are going at camps en route . Some however, remain trapped in the country, often because their wounds are too severe to move. Mune, a 55-year-old woman who crossed the river to Hacipasa in Turkey, said: 'The firing started getting intense last night. Some people have been killed, some are lying wounded on the road. 'People want to escape but they can't. Many have settled in a field outside the town and are trying to come,' she said. Syrian rebels now claim to have completely cut off the highway linking Damascus with Aleppo, preventing government troops to reach the city. Fleeing their homes: Syrian families, many wounded, travel on foot after crossing to Turkey by boat on the Orontes river of the Turkish-Syrian border . Grave fears: Thousands have fled the Syrian civil war, which now threatens to spread to Turkey . Terrified mothers: An estimated 30,000 people have been killed as main cities such as Aleppo, Homs and the capital Damascus are savagely contested . The U.S. has responded to the escalating . violence between Syria and Turkey by sending a 150 strong specialist . task force to its ally Jordan, after concerns that the violence might . spread across the southern border as well as in the north. The UNHCR said last month that up to 700,000 refugees may flee the violence in Syria by the end of the year, four times higher than its June prediction. The number of refugees registered with the United Nations has drastically increased, reaching 335,000. However the real figure could be as high as 500,000, a U.N. refugee agency official said yesterday. The UN has been working hard over the past decade to protect children in conflict zones. Since 1999, it has passed eight resolutions on the issue, with positive effects in a few countries, such as Nepal and Afghanistan. Former African warlords Thomas Lubanga and Charles Taylor have recently been convicted by the ICC for using child soldiers.","Children have been tortured, sexually abused in their homeland .

"A doctor with terminal cancer plans to tweet from her deathbed so people can understand what the experience is like. Dr Kate Granger, 31, went through five rounds of chemotherapy after her diagnosis in July 2011 and was told she was unlikely to live longer than five years. But the sessions left her so ill she decided to stop receiving treatment and concentrate on enjoying a good quality of life with her family and friends. Last week, the elderly care specialist asked her 3,200 Twitter followers: 'Any suggestions for an appropriate # for me to use when eventually I am actively popping my clogs & live tweeting the experience?' Kate Granger and her husband Chris Pointon pictured on their wedding day in 2005. Dr Kate Granger plans to tweet until her last so that people can understand what the experience is like . Since her diagnosis, Dr Granger, from Wakefield, found that dark humour helped her and husband Chris Pointon to cope with their situation. Suggestions from her followers included: '#deathbedlive, #finalcountdown, #exfactor, #onedieseveryminute, #goinggoinggone' and '#toinfinityandbeyond'. Some asked her if she was serious about her tweeting plans, to which she said she was 'deadly' so. 'I thought it would be quite interesting for everyone to understand more about what the experience is like for me,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'If my tweets about my death and what I’m going through make one person talk to their loved one about what they would do that’s a good thing. 'Positivity and humour help me get through the day and deal with what I’m going through.' Dr Granger hopes that tweeting from her deathbed will help people understand what the experience is like . After her tweets, she published a blogpost entitled 'Dying - can it ever be a laughing matter?' She . wrote: 'Don’t get me wrong, I definitely wasn’t making jokes on day one . but soon after I started to use humour to help me get through the day. 'Some . people around me were shocked by this attitude and language at first, . but it’s amazing how infectious it is and how it normalises this huge . life event that is approaching for me.' Dr . Granger, who returned to work at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield . after treatment, has written a book about her illness, which was . serialised in the Daily Mail last year. She was diagnosed in August 2011 after she began suffering pains on the right side of her back while on holiday in the U.S. Kate on holiday with husband Chris. She hopes tweeting help other people talk to their loved ones about their dying wishes . When . she returned, her husband took her to A&E where tests revealed a . huge mass in her abdomen and pelvis, some of which encased her ureters — . the tubes connecting the kidneys and bladder. She was diagnosed with a desmoplastic . small round cell tumour - an aggressive and rare tumor that primarily . occurs as masses in the abdomen. In one extract from The Other Side, the proceeds of which go to the Yorkshire Cancer Centre, she said her illness had made her a better doctor. She wrote: 'It’s made . me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient’s . hand, sitting down with them and not standing over them, communicating . news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their . families.' Dr Kate Granger says that black humour helps her cope with her illness . In January, she wrote again in the Mail how she had decided not to have any more treatment. She described the misery of spending New Year's Eve in hospital with an infection and decided the 'burdens' of treatment outweighed the benefits. She wrote: 'Although upset, I feel quite peaceful. I’ve got much further with the treatment than I ever expected to. Chris accepts my decision. A few friends and family have said they think I’m giving up too soon — but I’m choosing to take control of how I live. I just want my old life back, even for a couple of months.' She also described how, 'as a control freak', she had planned every detail of her funeral such as the music, poems, prayers and dress code. 'I’ve written letters and cards to Chris up to his 70th birthday. I am now writing letters to other close family.' She also returned to work, saying: 'I am in pain but so pleased to be at work. If patients ask, I tell them I have cancer, otherwise I never mention it. 'Having cancer has changed me. It’s made me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient’s hand, sitting down with them and not standing over them, communicating news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their families. 'I wrote this diary in the dark hours of my hospital stays. I want it to be in every medical school and hope my colleagues read it and think about how they practise medicine. 'Meanwhile, Chris and I are working through my bucket list — experiences I want to have while there’s still time. We renewed our wedding vows in April, had tea at The Savoy, have been to Paris and we’re going to Barcelona. 'I am blessed with my life — I have a job, husband and close family who I love very much, and I hope I’ve made a difference. Yes, I’m going to die but I’ve had time to prepare for this — I’m luckier than most.'","Dr Kate Granger was diagnosed with terminal cancer aged 29 .

"We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, scientists have claimed. Two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. Shrinking habitat: The disappearance of Arctic sea ice could lead to the extinction of animals like the polar bear - but scientists now claim it could be stopped, and fairly cheaply . The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. The amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all time low in September, with the total area covered now half what it was in the Eighties. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. 'The really hard questions here aren’t mostly technical. They’re questions about what kind of planet we want and who we are,' he told Canadian newspaper The Windsor Star. Melting: These images from Nasa show reveal the full extent of Arctic ice shrinkage, showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years (in yellow) In a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world, the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all time low this summer. The shocking new figures revealed in September showed how the ice has halved in size since the Eighties. 'We are now in uncharted territory,' said snow and ice data centre director Mark Serreze. 'While we’ve long known that as the planet warms up, changes would be seen first and be most pronounced in the Arctic, few of us were prepared for how rapidly the changes would actually occur.' The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32million square miles, according to the new data released in September. Scientists say this is 18 per cent smaller than the previous record of 1.61million square miles set in 2007, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado. Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking. Professor Keith used climate models to suggest that injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. 'Decisions involving (solar radiation management) do not need to be reduced to a single ""global thermostat"",' the paper says. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest. Open-air and large-scale geoengineering of the kind Professor Keith has suggested has been ruled out by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Such drastic geoengineering could have disastrous unintended effects but could be a viable response to a 'climate emergency' such as the sudden collapse of ice sheets or a killing drought, Professor Keith suggested.","Harvard physicist suggests we could inject reflective particles into the atmosphere to reflect back to light and heat from the Sun .
He estimates the whole operation could be done with just a few jets and would cost just $8billion a year ."
"At an age when most kids are starting high school, Texas teen Rosalio Reta, now 24, was carrying out bloody murders for one of Mexico's most sadistic and violent drug cartels. He grew up one of nine siblings on ramshackle Lincoln St, just blocks away from the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas. A close friend, Gabriel Cardona, now 26, lived nearby. Both Reta and Cardona were born to a families with relatives on both sides of the U.S.-Texas border. It was the ease with which the boys could cross back and forth across the border that made them valuable to the Mexican Zetas drug cartel. Regret: Reta expresses his anguish over his killing career that began at 13 years old . Baby-faced killers: Cardona was barely in his 20s and Reta was still a teenager when they were sent to jail for the rest of their lives . River to hell: The international bridge over the Rio Grande that links Laredo, Texas to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico . Crossing: The border post at Laredo, Texas is one of the most important drug routes in the U.S. for Mexican drug cartels . Reta's first kill was at 13 years old. By 19, he was locked in a Texas prison in solitary confinement, facing 70 years jail for murder. His friend Cardona is serving a sentence of 80 years. The question remains: How did two American teenagers become killers-for-hire for a Mexican drug cartel? Reta has spoken about his past at various times over the seven years since his arrest. His feelings about his bloody work have changed over the years, from chilling braggadocio as a 19-year-old in police interviews, to softly spoken, wet-eyed pleas for understanding in his latest interviews. Whatever Reta's true feelings about his past are, the facts have remained consistent. Remorseless: Cardona appears unrepentant for his nightmarish crimes. 'I'm really a good person,"" he told CNN recently. 'It just happened,' he said, showing off the tattoos he had inked on his eyelids in prison . Write caption here . Teen killers: When this photo of Reta (center) and Cardona (right) was taken, they were well into their bloody careers . As a 13-year-old, Reta was at school. He was a good student, but he was more interested in what was happening across the river from his town, in the cantinas and barrios of Nuevo Laredo. Born to a hairstylist mother and father who worked construction, Reta told Fox News he had a good childhood and grew up playing soccer and baseball, and loved skateboarding earning him the nickname 'Bart', as in Simpson. But the kind of mischief Reta would get up to in his young life couldn't be more different from the cartoon kid's boyish pranks. River to hell: The international bridge over the Rio Grande that links Laredo, Texas to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico . For Reta, the Mexican border town of . Nuevo Laredo, with its nightlife, its danger and its glamor, intrigued . the restless teen, and one fateful night, his curiosity was to be sated. In an interview with CNN, Reta describes a night when friends took him across the river to Nuevo Laredo. They brought him to a ranch where, according to Reta, 'They were torturing people and getting information from them. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. People getting tortured, killed, decapitated. It was kind of hard to believe.' An argument broke out: A man wanted to know what Reta, a stranger, was doing there. He stood over the 13-year-old and handed him a gun. In that moment, even though it was another man he was instructed to kill, Reta's life was over. 'I shot him,' Reta said. 'I had to.' Reta was trained in a secret camp where he learned how to be a sicario, a hitman. 'It was like regular military training, like what they do here in the United States,' he told CNN. Top dog: Miguel Ángel Treviño was at the head of the most vicious, violent and depraved of Mexico's drug cartels until his arrest last month . Last month, Zetas leader Miguel Ángel Treviño, widely believed to be responsible for escalating the depraved and sadistic wave of narco-terror occurring along the borderlands, was arrested. It was this man who had stood over Reta that night, and it has at his behest that Reta carried out more than 30 bloody murders. Cardona estimates he killed between 20 and 30 people. Police say that one of the crimes for which Cardona is serving time is the kidnap and murder of two American teenagers, during which he slashed them with a bottle, collected their blood in a glass and toasted the La Santa Muerte, the personification of death. According to a New York Times article from 2009, most of the American youths were recruited in a Nuevo Laredo disco called Eclipse, situated in the main square just across one of two bridges that connect the two Laredos. Teenagers go there to drink and dance, but cartel members lurk there, keeping an eye out for possible recruits. Detective Roberto Garcia of the Laredo Police Department told the New York Times, 'The cartels - they just seduce you. They wave that power, that cash, the cars, the easy money. And these kids all have that romantic notion they are going to live forever.' Solitary: Before he was even at the legal drinking age, Reta was locked up forever in solitary confinement . Marked man: Reta, like Cardona, received prison tattoos after his arrest, the only outward indication of what occurred in his past . Teenage dream: Cardona and Reta were living like regular teenagers before being drawn into a world of murder, drugs and cash . Reta and Cardona were paid a $500 retainer each week. They lived in a large house in a nice part of Laredo and drove expensive cars. For each killing, they were paid between $10,000 and $50,000 and pounds of cocaine. Forever: This photo taken the year before their arrests reads 'parejas por siempre' - partners forever . Reta dropped out of school in sixth grade, Cardona left in the ninth. Their short but bloody careers came crashing down swiftly, one after the other. In 2009 Cardona was arrested and pleaded guilty to killing seven men and to conspiracy to kidnap and kill in a foreign country. He was sentenced to more than 80 years in prison. Not long after, Reta botched an assassination attempt in Mexico, missing the victim and killing innocent people. He knew he'd pay for the mistake with his life. The teenager turned himself in to Mexican police, then called Detective Garcia to ask to be extradited to the U.S., fearing reprisal for his error, or from rival gang member. He is only in his 20s, but he's facing a lifetime of monotony in solitary confinement. For him, there is no future. Once he bragged to police, 'If I cannot hit you in the forehead from a distance, I will kneel down in front of you and put my forehead against the muzzle of your gun. I will look you in the eyes while you kill me.' Now, he tells only of sorrow. 'I've come to regret everything I've done. I couldn't take it anymore. It was real hard for me. I wasn't living my life,' he told CNN. 'It gets to a point where I can't even stand myself. It's eating me inside little by little, and there's nothing I can do or say to justify my actions.'","Teens living in Texas border towns are being targeted by Mexican drug cartels .

"Wesley Warren Jr finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Formerly known as 'the man with the 132lb scrotum', Warren, from Las Vegas, made headlines around the world last year when the rare medical condition - known as scrotal lymphedema - was featured on a TV special. Fortunately, a California doctor took pity on the 49-year-old and agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation to remove it for free. But Warren was still not happy. He complained the surgery made his life a misery because it left him with a one-inch penis. He said he would never be able to have a relationship with a woman. But finally, Warren is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more surgery later this month. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . After: Wesley Warren Jr, left, is shown with Dr Joel Gelman, who led a team of surgeons and nurses in correcting the abnormality that Warren endured for five years . Miserable: Warren's story will be told in Monday night's one-hour TLC special, The Man With The 132lb Scrotum which recounts his journey, from discovering his condition to where he is today . Before: Wesley Warren spent the past five years of his life with a freakishly huge scrotum - the result of a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema . Home help: His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months . His story will be told on Monday night's TLC special, The Man With The 132lb Scrotum, which documents his journey from when he first realized he had the condition to where he is today - 200lbs lighter and no longer a 'freak'. (Warren weighed himself after the surgery and this was what he had dropped) His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months. 'It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,' he told the New York Post. 'It got so bad one day that I stood in . my living room and cried. There was a fresh breakage of skin...and it stung to no end. Warren adapted by turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants. His . penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to . urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman. Unhappy: Wesley Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but the surgery has left him 'disfigured' Surgery: Wesley Warren Jr., pictured before surgery, is recovering after his giant scrotum was removed . I was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you’re a freak,' he said. 'I would only get upset when, every . once-in-a-while, some person with no manners would stare at me and start . laughing and give me that ""freak passing by"" look. 'That caused me . in the past to say a ""word"" or two with regards to rudeness. 'Besides, I was OK with the stares. That’s what I was . expecting.' At . one stage Warren was so desperate he considered selling his testicles on eBay to . pay for an operation to remove them before Dr Joel Gelman offered his . services. Though he initially complained that he was 'still disfigured', he has since become more optimistic about his future. 'I can see a light at the end of the . tunnel, but I’m still in the tunnel.' He . will return to Howard Stern's Sirius/XM radio show on Monday. After he . previously called in, he received an outpouring of affection from . listeners in the form of donations and supportive e-mails, which he says . he’ll never forget. 'If not for the generosity of those people who have helped me, I’d be . out on the street and disabled. 'I want to . give the biggest thank you in the world to these people — as big as . the Big Apple.' Discomfort: Warren could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals . Video courtesy of Las Vegas Review Journal . Talking about his life before the . operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that . the growth ruled his life.

"A controversial satanic 'black mass' coming to Oklahoma City has sold out of tickets, reveals a group co-founder. The event, to be held on Sept. 21, will also feature a satanic exorcism and has sold all of the available 88 tickets. The exorcism will be 'toned down' to keep from violating state health laws. A controversial satanic 'black mass' coming to Oklahoma City has sold out of tickets, reveals a group co-founder. Dakhma of Angra Mainyu's Adam Daniels said the group would substitute vinegar for the ritual's prescribed urine. Another concession to state laws will be a woman on an altar wearing lingerie instead of being completely nude. 'One of the dictates of the church is not only to educate the members but to educate the public, and to debunk the Hollywood-projected image of our beliefs,' he told ABC News. The event, to be held at the city's civic center, will also feature a performance from band 'God in a Machine' and readings that renounce God. At the end of the night, they will step on and spit upon an unconsecrated host. Audience members are encouraged to wear black, hooded, full-length robes or evening wear. The parks and recreation department rented the space for $420 and front row tickets sold for $17.50. The Christian Post writes that the satanic exorcism is meant to be an inversion of a christian exorcism by inciting rites and incantations to force the holy spirit out of a person's body. The event had drawn intense criticism from Christians, with Gov. Mary Fallin, Catholic Archbiship Paul Coakley, and over 80,000 others signing an online petition to condemn the gathering. The group is separate from New York's Satanic Temple which has long battled to have a statue of the devil put up in the state capital . Fallin called it a 'disgusting mockery of the Catholic faith' and something that should be 'equally repellent to Catholics and non-Catholics alike.' 'It may be protected by the First Amendment, but that doesn't mean we can't condemn it in the strongest terms possible for the moral outrage which it is,' she said. 'It is shocking and disgusting that a group of New York City 'satanists' would travel all the way to Oklahoma to peddle their filth here. I pray they realize how hurtful their actions are and cancel this event.' The group is separate from New York's Satanic Temple which has long battled to have a statue of the devil put up in the state capital. The city officials said the group is protected by the U.S. Constitution. 'Mr. Daniels must abide by our local ordinances, our fire codes and all of . our state laws,' said Parks and Recreation spokeswoman Jennifer . Lindsey-McClintock.

"Victim: Officers were told there was now a 'heightened risk' to their 'personal safety', a warning that is thought to relate to the danger of an attack similar to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, pictured . Police have been told they could be at risk from an extremist plot to behead them on the streets of Britain, it emerged yesterday. Officers were told there was now a ‘heightened risk’ to their ‘personal safety’, a warning that is thought to relate to the danger of an attack similar to the murder of British Army Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year. Sources indicated that it had been issued in response to intercepted terrorist ‘chatter’. The shocking development coincided with the arrest of five men in West London on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack – although Scotland Yard denied any connection between the two events. The internal ‘force threat level’ has now been raised from moderate to substantial, the third of five levels of severity, meaning the chance that a terrorist will target an officer is regarded as a ‘strong possibility’. Staff have been told to make sure that they cannot be identified as members of the police when they are off duty. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘We are informing our officers and staff of the heightened risk and reminding them to remain vigilant and alert to any possible dangers.’ He added: ‘All police forces constantly review their security and safety procedures and this will, of course, continue. You will see no major changes in the way we continue to police the UK and engage with our communities – our emphasis is on vigilance.’ Scotland Yard is still searching houses in West London as part of the investigation into the five men, aged between 20 and 21 who are being held under the Terrorism Act. The men have been in custody since Tuesday after counter-terror officers mounted dawn raids to disrupt what they believe to have been the early stages of a ‘significant plot’. The Met’s counter-terrorism command has examined items seized from their homes, including computer equipment, and is continuing to interview the men, at least one of whom is thought to have travelled to Syria recently. The officers are trying to establish links between the men – all of whom are thought to have attended London’s Westminster City School – and Islamic State, the extremist group behind the beheading of Alan Henning and other Western hostages. The move follows the arrest of 15 people in Australia last month after security services received intelligence that supporters of Islamic State were planning a public execution in the streets. And the warning comes five weeks after the UK’s terror threat level was raised from substantial to severe – meaning a terrorist attack is ‘highly likely’. Police arrested five suspects in connection to Tuesday's terror raids in central and west London, pictured .

The Germany international was unsurprisingly the centre of attention as he arrived at Wolfsburg . But as he was unveiled as a Wolfsburg player on Wednesday, the 24-year-old, who has signed with the German club until 2019, said he matured at Chelsea. He said: 'I wanted to stay but the last weeks or last month I tended towards changing something because I wanted to do what is fun for me and that is to play football. 'I could only do it briefly at Chelsea in the past week. I will never regret this [playing for Chelsea]. 'I still love this club, the staff are amazing. I developed my game. I improved myself there.

Schurrle arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2013 from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee in the region of £18m. Taking the No 14 shirt, he played 43 matches duuring his first season and scored nine goals, though Chelsea missed out on any silverware. But despite returning from the World Cup in Brazil with a winners' medal, Schurrle found opportunities harder to come by this season. When it became clear Chelsea wanted to sign the Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina, Schurrle had to be moved on to ensure the club's January dealings fell within Financial Fair Play regulations.

The 24-year-old Rochdale-born centre-back is keen to link up with Sean Dyche as he believes he will get a regular run in the side and has asked to leave.

Dawson signed for the Baggies in 2010, but has made only 21 league appearances for the club since, spending time on loan at former club Rochdale and Bolton in recent seasons. Chalobah, meanwhile, is one of Chelsea's most promising youngsters, but has yet to make a senior appearance for the club. He spent the 2012-13 season on loan at Watford, when they made it all the way to the play-off final, and had spells last term and Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough.","Burnley offer £3m to West Brom for Craig Dawson .

"Another weekend, another blank for Aston Villa in the Premier League. The Birmingham side's long-suffering fans were looking forward to Christmas when they last saw their side score with league points at stake - Christian Benteke putting them in front at home to Manchester United on December 20. Rather depressingly, it was just their 11th league goal of the season and, little did they know, that tally would still be the same in early February. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke cuts a dejected figure during their 5-0 loss at Arsenal on Sunday . Kieran Richardson reacts after Villa's thrashing by Arsenal, extending their goal drought to over 10 hours . Manager Paul Lambert is under increasing pressure to turn around Villa's season . Villa currently find themselves just three points above the Premier League drop zone . Since that 1-1 draw with United, Villa have failed to find the target against Swansea, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal. Sunday's 5-0 thumping at the Emirates represented a fresh nadir for Paul Lambert's team and it is hardly going to get any easier - league leaders Chelsea await on Saturday. Their paltry 'Goals For' tally is made to look all the more meagre by the fact there are no fewer than 14 players in Europe's leading five divisions that have scored more on their own this season than the entire Villa team. In the Premier League, Chelsea's Diego Costa (17), Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (14), QPR's Charlie Austin (13) and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (12) have all surpassed Villa's league goals tally. Chelsea striker Diego Costa has six more goals in league competition than the entire Villa side . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has scored 14 goals in league competition so far this season . Out in Spain, Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo (28), Barcelona duo Lionel Messi (22) and Neymar (15), and Sevilla's Carlos Bacca (12) all have more. In Italy's Serie A, Carlos Tevez of Juventus (13), Jeremy Menez of AC Milan (12) and Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli (12) have each outscored Lambert's team. In the Bundesliga, Alexander Meier of Eintracht Frankfurt has scored 13 goals to Villa's 11. And in the French Ligue 1, Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon (21) and Andre-Pierre Gignac of Marseille (14) have both been more prolific than the Villains. Ronaldo has scored 28 goals for Real Madrid in La Liga this season, 17 more than Villa's league total . Barcelona's Lionel Messi has double Villa's total by himself in just La Liga matches this campaign . Carlos Tevez of Juventus (left) has scored 13 league goals so far this campaign . There are also a further six players in those leagues that have 11 goals, the same as Villa. The aforementioned goal drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes ahead of Saturday's Chelsea visit and the infamously poor Derby side that played in the Premier League in 2007-08 managed a superior goals-per-game ratio than Lambert's men are currently trundling along at. Given all this, it is miraculous Villa aren't in the relegation zone. But, with a safety margin of just three points at the moment, it may only be a matter of time unless they can find their shooting boots.","Aston Villa have scored just 11 Premier League goals in miserable season .

"Swiss scientists said they plan to launch a ‘janitor . satellite’ designed to 'clean' the space near Earth of space junk. The satellite will 'grab' lumps of orbiting debris and throw them back into Earth's atmosphere, where they will burn up on re-entry. The 10-million-franc - $11-million satellite - called CleanSpace . One is being built by the . Swiss Space Center at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Lausanne. CleanSpace One closes in on a discarded 'Cubesat' satellite in an illustration released this week . EPFL said Wednesday its launch would come within three to five . years - its first tasks are to grab two Swiss satellites launched in 2009 and . 2010. The U.S. space agency Nasa says over 500,000 pieces of spent . rocket stages, broken satellites and other debris are being tracked as they . orbit Earth. The debris travels at speeds approaching 17,500 miles per hour, fast enough to destroy or inflict costly and . time-draining damage on a satellite or spacecraft. Collisions, in turn, . generate more fragments floating in space. ‘It has become essential to be aware of the existence of this . debris and the risks that are run by its proliferation,’ said Claude Nicollier, . an astronaut and EPFL professor. CleanSpace one 'grabs on' to its prey: The scientists aim to launch the satellite within three to five years . CleanSpace will hurl 'used up' satellites back into the atmosphere where they will burn up on reentry . Building the satellite means developing new technology to . address three big problems, scientists say. The first hurdle has to do with trajectory: The satellite has . to be able to adjust its path to match that of its target. EPFL said its labs . are looking into a new ultra-compact motor that can do this. Next, the satellite has to be grab hold of and stabilize the . debris at high speeds. Scientists are studying how plants and animals grip . things as a model for what would be used. And, finally, CleanSpace One has to be able to take the debris, . or unwanted satellites, back into Earth’s atmosphere, where they will burn on . re-entry. Swiss Space Center’s director, Volker Gass, said it hopes to . someday ‘offer and sell a whole family of ready-made systems, designed as . sustainably as possible, that are able to de-orbit several different kinds of . satellites.’","Satellite will launch within three to five years .

"Bradford City are refusing to be drawn into a war of words with Sunderland after Gus Poyet labelled the Valley Parade pitch as 'one of the worst in the country' and even invited them to switch their FA Cup tie to the Stadium of Light. The Black Cats face the Bantams in the fifth round a week on Sunday and Poyet has expressed serious concern over the state of the playing surface. Bradford – whose own manager Phil Parkinson has also slammed the boggy pitch – would not comment on Poyet's remarks, but the Premier League club could ask their League One opponents for assurances over the pitch before their meeting on February 15.

Ricardo Alvarez sent Sunderland past Fulham with this strike in their 3-1 replay win on Tuesday . Referee Kevin Johnson was close to postponing Bradford's 1-1 draw with Colchester on Saturday amid concerns over the players' safety, and they still have a home fixture with MK Dons before the visit of Sunderland. And Poyet said: 'I'll invite them to come to the Stadium of Light. Our pitch is great. We can ask them to change the venue, but I don't think they'll accept that. 'Maybe we'll have to play a little more direct. Maybe I'm going to ask the groundsman at our training ground to mash one of the pitches and train on it the week before.

'Three months ago after we played Gillingham I told the directors that the pitch is giving way when they're turning and I asked if they could do everything they could to make the pitch better,' he said. 'I think at the time they thought I was making excuses because the home form was poor but I don't make excuses.

"Vladamir Putin has launched an astonishing attack against U.S. Senator John McCain claiming the former Navy pilot has 'blood on his hands' and that his ordeal as a Vietnam PoW had driven him 'nuts'. As protests continue across Russia over allegations of vote-rigging, Prime Minister Putin gave an incendiary television interview in which he described McCain as a war criminal and accused America of masterminding the killing of Colonel Gaddafi. McCain had earlier goaded the former KGB officer with a Twitter . post saying 'Dear Vlad, the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you'. Attack : Russian Prime Minister Vladamir Putin accused U.S. Senator John McCain of having gone 'nuts' after his years as Vietnam PoW . In response, a fired-up Putin, well known for his dislike of Washington, hit back saying: 'Mr McCain fought in Vietnam. I think that he has enough blood of peaceful citizens on his hands. 'It must be impossible for him to live without these disgusting scenes anymore. 'Mr McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit for several years. 'Anyone (in his place) would go nuts.' Ordeal: John McCain is treated in a Vietnam hospital as a prisoner of war in 1967. He spent 20 years in the Navy, a quarter of it in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp after his jet was shot down over Hanoi during a bombing mission . Putin also alleged that America had masterminded the death of former Libyan Leader Colonel Gaddafi's. Describing the event he said: 'Who did this? Drones, including American ones. 'They attacked his column. Then using the radio - through the Special Forces, who should not have been there - they brought in the so-called opposition and fighters, and killed him without court or investigation.' The beleaguered Russian accused organisers of the protests currently gripping the country of working to weaken the county on orders from the West. He insisted that the 4 December parliamentary election which triggered Russia's biggest protests for 20 years was a genuine reflection of the people's will. Under pressure: Putin appeared live on TV amid public anger over alleged vote fixing in Russia's parliamentary elections . He added: 'That's a well-organized pattern of destabilizing society.' Putin even sought to put a good spin on the protests by saying they reflected a rise in public activity that he welcomes. Last week, he dismissed criticism of the vote by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of American efforts to weaken Russia. Russian . billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov plans to challenge Vladimir Putin in . Russia's spring presidential election. He has said his first move if . elected would be to pardon jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has . been in prison since 2003 on tax evasion and fraud charges seen as a . punishment for defying Putin's power. Prokhorov said he would also allow . free registration of opposition parties and restore elections for . provincial governors. He is 46 years old, and worth an estimated $18 billion, having made his fortune in metals, banking and media. On Thursday he alleged that the . organisers of Saturday's Moscow demonstration had paid some of its . participants and called them sheep. He . also unleashed his occasional penchant for barbed and crude remarks by . dismissing the white ribbons that many demonstrators wore. 'When I saw them on TV I thought it was . part of campaigning for HIV prophylactics, and they put some . contraceptives on,' he said. The ribbons have become a widely adopted . symbol of the protests.His dismissive comments and . insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further . anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this . month. Putin . said the results of Russia's parliamentary election reflected popular . opinion, and that the opposition had alleged vote fraud purely to . strengthen its position. 'The . results of this election undoubtedly reflect the real balance  of power . in the country,' he said. 'It's very good that United Russia has . preserved its leading position. His dismissive comments and . insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further . anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this . month. 'The opposition's goal is to fight for power, and it's looking for every chance to advance.' The unprecedented wave of protest . currently sweeping Russia poses a significant challenge to Putin less . than three months before presidential elections in which he will be . seeking to return to the Kremlin. On Thursday he sought to counter . public discontent by proposing to place web cameras at each of Russia's . more than 90,000 polling stations before the 4 March presidential vote.

"West Ham have been fined £71,000 and reprimanded by FIFA after they played Diafra Sakho in an FA Cup win 18 days after he withdrew from Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations squad. Sakho scored in the 1-0 victory at Ashton Gate and the governing body opened an investigation to see if they had breached rules over international duty. The Hammers vigorously denied any wrongdoing but could have faced expulsion from the FA Cup if they were found guilty. Diafra Sakho celebrates scoring the goal that sent West Ham into the fifth round of the FA Cup at Bristol City . West Ham have been fined  by FIFA after playing Sakho following his withdrawal from Senegal's squad . West Ham say Sakho was suffering with a back injury and was unable to fly to the Africa Cup of Nations . West Ham were paid £90,000 by the FA for winning their fourth round tie against Bristol City. The Hammers also earned a live broadcast fee of £247,500 after their game was shown live on BBC One. They will receive the same amount again for their fifth round clash with West Brom, which has been chosen for live coverage by BT Sport. If Sam Allardyce's men manage to win at the Hawthorns - or in a replay - the club will pocket another £180,000 from the FA's prize fund. Earned in fourth round: £337,500 . Guaranteed fifth round earnings: £247,500 . Potential fifth round earnings: £427,500 . FIFA rules say a player cannot appear for a club if he was meant to be on international duty and they released a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming the fine. It stated: 'The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has found the club and the player to have violated art. 5 of Annexe 1 of the Regulations in relation to the match played by Sakho on 25 January 2015. The club has been fined CHF 100,000 in accordance with art. 10 c) and art. 15 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC) and issued with a reprimand, while the player has been sanctioned with a reprimand in accordance with art. 10 b) and art. 14 of the FDC.' Senegal were furious that Sakho played for West Ham 48 hours after they were knocked out of the competition. The Hammers insisted the player had a back injury that prevented him from flying and claim he was driven to Ashton Gate in a limousine for the FA Cup tie. They requested FIFA dismiss the case. West Ham issued a brief statement following FIFA's decision.

'The club is disappointed with the penalty handed down by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee and is considering its options.' Hammers co-chairman David Sullivan told Sportsmail last week: 'A top back surgeon said Sakho can't fly and he still can't fly. He went by car to Bristol. 'We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred while playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.' Manager Sam Allardyce, who left Sakho out of the Premier League trip to Liverpool on Saturday, said: 'I'm not worried that he will face a ban. We have stuck by every rule and regulation in the book.' FIFA can today confirm the decisions of its Disciplinary Committee in the case involving the English club West Ham United and the player Diafra Sakho. Diafra Sakho was called up by the Senegalese Football Association on 18 December 2014 to play for Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations 2015 taking place in Equatorial Guinea between 17 January and 8 February 2015, as well as to attend the training camp of the said representative team from 5-16 January 2015 in Morocco. The Senegalese FA was informed by West Ham United that Sakho was prevented from playing and travelling by plane due to injury and thus he did not join the Senegal team.

"Whether tearing off his gillet or kicking water bottles in a rage, spoiling for a fight or trading salutes with Emmanuel Adebayor, the most vivid memories of Tim Sherwood's five-month reign at Tottenham do him few favours. He seemed too wound-up for a long life on the touchline, destined for self-combustion had Daniel Levy not intervened as he does to press eject. But perhaps the biggest mistake Sherwood made at Spurs was to allow this theatre to disguise his real intent. Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job . 67-year-old Redknapp has left QPR, citing forthcoming knee surgery as the reason behind his decision . He is passionate, committed and ambitious. He is forthright with his opinions and he demands the same in return from those who surround him. It gets him into trouble and will continue to do so, because he is unlikely to change on this front. If there is one lesson from his time at White Hart Lane, one thing that might change, he may be more controlled on the touchline . His emotional bond is not so deep at QPR and he will feel more relaxed, less anxious to prove his value since he will have the unconditional backing from above, with Les Ferdinand in the role of director of football. They know each other well and share an outlook on the game: a vital starting point in such a relationship. At White Hart Lane, Sherwood's antics were exaggerated by the pressure of a ticking clock. He wanted to make an impression on the players and the board and on those looking on like fans, media and prospective employers. He certainly did that. Sherwood worked with QPR director of football Les Ferdinand (left) while the pair were at Spurs together . There was one notable clash in the technical area with Jorge Jesus as Benfica won 3-1 at White Hart Lane in the first leg of a Europa League tie. Jesus became annoyed by Sherwood's hyper-activity and there were tetchy words exchanged before the Benfica boss marked his team's third goal by raising three fingers and waving bye-bye to his opposite number. Sherwood exiled himself to the stands for the second leg to avoid becoming a side-show. He had always been outspoken, with a sharp tongue and a quick put-down. He branded Chelsea coach Steve Holland 'patronising' and had a pop at Glenn Hoddle, so there was no surprise to see him leave QPR with Harry Redknapp on Tuesday. Sherwood laid into his own players in private and public in a bid to shake them from their comfort zones. He accused them of lacking guts and not caring. He was not convinced of their commitment and warned they were playing for their futures. The view seems to have been shared by his successor Mauricio Pochettino, given the new man has frozen out plenty of well-paid 'stars' and launched a concerted bid to get rid of as many as possible in January. Sherwood was able to get the best out of maverick players such as Emmanuel Adebayor while at Tottenham . Unusually for a Premier League manager, Sherwood was also prepared to publicly criticise his own board for their lack of support. 'The silence is deafening, isn't it?' he said, when asked about his future following a heavy defeat at Chelsea. He later compared his role to that of a 'supply teacher' as he wondered aloud why it was difficult to impose his authority on players who enjoyed far greater job security than he did. Sherwood won his argument for 18-month contract when he replaced Andre Villas-Boas, but it did not keep him in the job any longer. His straight-talking style is rooted in his confidence and faith in his own football philosophy. Sherwood is intrinsically 'Old School' in that he believes in British players and coaches. He refuses to accept they are simply inferior to those produced abroad but that they are simply not given the same care and attention. His contribution to Tottenham's very healthy Academy was greatly admired and he learned to trust young players in his original role at the head of their development system as technical coordinator. Behind the fury of the flying-water bottles and Full Monty costume changes was his patient work with Andros Townsend, Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Danny Rose and Nabil Bentaleb. Long after Sherwood has left the club, Spurs are enjoying the rewards. Sherwood's patient work with academy players like Danny Rose have benefited Spurs long after his departure . Striker Harry Kane has scored 20 goals in 33 games in all competitions for Tottenham so far this season . Together with Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey, he will provide joined up thinking about how young talent from the Academy is nurtured through the ranks and into the first team, and how that dovetails with the club's transfer policy which clearly requires serious attention. This ought to be good for QPR, a club which has to learn to live within its means and make more from its local talent, as they did in Ferdinand's playing days. At the same time, of course, he has to keep them up. Can he inspire the squad left by Redknapp to better things? Can he find a balanced from an imbalanced squad? Can he cajole something special from the enigmatic Adel Taarabt as he did from Adebayor? This is the great unknown with Sherwood. He is a deep football thinker, confident and passionate. He has success in youth football but can he translate it? Does he have the tactical ability to operate in the Barclays Premier League, where the standards are so high? After 23 games QPR are 19th in the Premier League table with 19 points and facing a tough relegation battle . The Hoops' 3-1 loss to Stoke City was the club's 11th consecutive away defeat in the Premier League . He has yet to complete his UEFA Pro Licence, the elite coaching qualification, but he is midway through the course with the FA of Wales, and this will satisfy the mandatory requirements of Premier League, who let him through a loophole last season. His experience in the field amounts to 28 games at Tottenham. He won 14 and lost 10. His teams played with adventure and risk; they scored goals and entertained but they leaked plenty too, especially against the best teams, and some tittered when he frowned at the emerging role of the defensive midfielder. Some claimed that once the initial impact of a different voice had faded at Spurs that he had little else to offer, but there is more to Sherwood. He is ruthless and energetic and he is not short on ideas or ambition. This is what QPR can bank on. Passionate and committed, Sherwood's high maintenance approach could be the tonic to QPR's woes .","Tim Sherwood is the front-runner to replace Harry Redknapp at QPR .

"Yeovil Town have sacked manager Gary Johnson after three years in charge. The former Bristol City boss, who also managed the Glovers between 2001 and 2005, led the Somerset side into the Championship for the first time in their history but after relegation last season they now sit four points adrift of safety at the foot of Sky Bet League One. A club statement confirmed that assistant Terry Skiverton, who managed the Huish Park side for three years between 2009 and 2012, will take over as acting manager with Darren Way as his assistant. Gary Johnson has been sacked by League One Yeovil with the club in the relegation zone . 'The decision to relieve Gary of his management duties is the hardest I have been involved in during my 23 years at Huish Park,' chairman John Fry told the club's official website. 'I cannot speak too highly of the man who in the past brought so much success to our club. We part company on good terms and I would like personally to wish him well for the future. 'Gary took the Glovers from the Conference to the Championship and is regarded as one of the best managers in the Football League'.

"Paul Pogba's elder brother Mathias has signed for Crawley Town. Former Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra striker Mathias was a free agent after leaving Serie B side Pescara and has joined on a deal until the end of the season. The 24-year-old Guinea international, whose brother Paul is starring for Juventus, also has a twin, Florentin, playing for St Etienne . Mathias Pogba has signed a short-term deal at Crawley Town after leaving Serie B side Pescara . Mathias' brother Paul, pictured playing for current side Juventus, is one of the world's best midfielders . Paul (Juventus and France) - Serie A: 2012–13, 2013–14, Italian Super Cup: 2012, 2013 . Mathias (Crawley and Guinea) - No major honours . 'Mathias can play anywhere across the front or out wide so he gives us options,' interim boss Dean Saunders told Crawley Town's website. 'He’s got all the attributes and he has proved before he can score goals at this level. I think he could make a big contribution for us over the next few months.' Pogba is in contention to make his Crawley debut at Yeovil Town's Huish Park on Saturday while his brother takes on Italian giants AC Milan just hours later - and the forward has been given the club's No 28 shirt. Mathias has decided to keep it in the family by joining Crawley as the League One outfit share the same nickname as Paul's former side Manchester United. Paul joined Juventus in 2012 after failing to break into then manager Sir Alex Ferguson's first team plans . Paul left United for Juventus in 2012 after failing to hold down a first team spot at Old Trafford. Crawley themselves were extremely active on their own Twitter account on deadline day. One tweet, accompanied with a photo of the chairman's car-parking space and a taped-on 'SERGIO AGUERO' name badge, read: 'Close to getting our man! Hopefully the Chairman's car parking space seals it... #DeadlineDay.'","Mathias Pogba has joined Crawley on a deal until the end of the season .

"It was the culmination of a series of risky spacewalks where little had gone according to plan. But after being forced to improvise a toothbrush into a bolt cleaning device to remove a broken power supply unit in a previous spacewalk, Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams could not hide her delight as full power was finally restored to the International Space Station. The Expedition 32 flight engineer, appeared to touch the bright sun during the mission’s third spacewalk on Sept. 5, 2012 in the amazing new images released today by the space agency. Scroll down for video . Touching the sun: Sunita Williams waves to the camera and appears to touch the sun in a Spacewalk which saw two astronauts replace a faulty power unit that had threatened to cripple the station . During the six-hour, 28-minute . spacewalk, Williams and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Aki . Hoshide (visible in the reflections of Williams’ helmet visor), flight . engineer, completed the installation of a Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) that was hampered by a possible misalignment and damaged threads where a . bolt must be placed. They also installed a camera on the International . Space Station’s robotic arm, Canadarm2. Earlier in the spacewalk, the two astronauts resorted to MacGyver like moves to save the $100 billion International Space Station with a $3 toothbrush. Astronauts Sunita Williams and . Akihido Hoshide were able to construct a makeshift tool . Saving the day: The toothbrush was used to repair the International Space Station . Their ingenuity allowed for the installation of a much needed part on the space station, needed to relay power. Trouble on the spacecraft started last week, when Williams and Hoshide were trying to replace a malfunctioning electrical unit, called a main bus switching unit (MBSU), on the space station. There are four 220-pound MBSUs on the International Space Station that are able to harness power from the outpost's solar arrays. But with one of the electrical units not operating, there had been limited power use in the space station and astronauts were called on to replace it with a new one. Williams and Hoshide had been working to install a new MBSU back on August 30 but encountered difficulty in bolting the new unit down to the spacecraft. It appeared that there was significant debris, described as metal shavings, that had amassed inside the bolts and was preventing them from attaching it to the space craft and securing the MBSU. Hoshide was able to maneuver a wire . cleaner around one of the bolt holders, that loosed a lot of metal . shavings but it just wasn't enough, he told the NASA team back in Houston. Space walk: NASA astronaut Sunita Williams and Japanese astronaut Aki Hoshide at the International Space Station . Their repeated attempts to clean out the bolts drew out their space walk to a daunting 8 hours. 'Over 10 hours in the suit. No bathroom and no lunch,' Williams wrote in her blog about the grueling ordeal, about the total time she was suited up for space. With the debris around the bolts, there was little chance of a successful MBSU installation. So the space team, along with their . colleagues at NASA back on earth put their heads together to figure out a . way to fix the problem. They decided the outer space team . needed to do some deep cleaning and the idea for the toothbrush tool was born - fastening a simple toothbrush to a metal pole. Cleaning house: The astronauts prepared for cleaning the International Space Station (ISS) on September 5, with their toothbrush . Mission possible: Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide perform a spacewalk to complete an equipment installation outside the International Space Station . On Wednesday, Williams and Hoshide took to cleaning the bolts. After about four hours of intense scrubbing, the bolts were pristine and the pair were able to successfully attach the MBSU. 'Looks like you guys just fixed the station,' astronaut Jack Fischer radioed from Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The International Space Station is currently home to six astronauts: Williams and Joe Acaba of NASA, Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka, Yuri Malenchenko and Sergei Revin.","Spacewalk installed critical power unit that threatened to cripple the International Space Station's ability to carry out experiments .

"Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has given an incendiary TV interview accusing protest organisers of working to weaken Russia on orders from the West. Putin, whose authority has been rocked by recent demonstrations against alleged vote fraud, told a call-in TV show: 'That's a well-organized pattern of destabilizing society.' The strongman insisted that the 4 December parliamentary election which triggered Russia's biggest protests for 20 years was a genuine reflection of the people's will. Blame: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said protest organisers were acting at the West's urging . He even sought to put a good spin on the protests by saying they reflected a rise in public activity that he welcomes. Last week, Putin dismissed criticism of the vote by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of American efforts to weaken Russia. Under pressure: Putin appeared live on TV amid public anger over alleged vote fixing in Russia's parliamentary elections . On Thursday he alleged that the organisers of Saturday's Moscow demonstration had paid some of its participants and called them sheep. He also unleashed his occasional penchant for barbed and crude remarks by dismissing the white ribbons that many demonstrators wore. Abuse: Putin implied Senator John McCain's time as a prisoner-of-war in Vietnam had addled his mind . 'When I saw them on TV I thought it was . part of campaigning for HIV prophylactics, and they put some . contraceptives on,' he said. The ribbons have become a widely adopted . symbol of the protests. His dismissive comments and . insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further . anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this . month. Putin later lashed out at U.S. Senator John McCain, calling him mad and describing the killing of . Colonel Gaddafi as 'repulsive'. McCain had goaded him with a Twitter . post saying 'the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you', . prompting former KGB-agent Putin to attack his past as a combat pilot . and prisoner of war in Vietnam. 'He . has the blood of peaceful civilians on his hands, and he can't live . without the kind of disgusting, repulsive scenes like the killing of . Gaddafi,' Putin said. Russian . billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov plans to challenge Vladimir Putin in . Russia's spring presidential election. He has said his first move if . elected would be to pardon jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has . been in prison since 2003 on tax evasion and fraud charges seen as a . punishment for defying Putin's power. Prokhorov said he would also allow . free registration of opposition parties and restore elections for . provincial governors. He is 46 years old, and worth an estimated $18 billion, having made his fortune in metals, banking and media. 'Mr. McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit . for several years,' he said. 'Anyone (in his place) would go nuts.' Putin . said the results of Russia's parliamentary election reflected popular . opinion, and that the opposition had alleged vote fraud purely to . strengthen its position. 'The . results of this election undoubtedly reflect the real balance  of power . in the country,' he said. 'It's very good that United Russia has . preserved its leading position. His dismissive comments and . insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further . anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this . month. 'The opposition's goal is to fight for power, and it's looking for every chance to advance.' The unprecedented wave of protest . currently sweeping Russia poses a significant challenge to Putin less . than three months before presidential elections in which he will be . seeking to return to the Kremlin. On Thursday he sought to counter . public discontent by proposing to place web cameras at each of Russia's . more than 90,000 polling stations before the 4 March presidential vote. 'Let them be there next to every ballot box to avoid any falsifications,' he said.","Mocks U.S. Senator John McCain, saying he has 'blood of innocent civilians' on his hands .

"The Queen’s former deputy property manager has been charged with taking more than £100,000 in kickbacks for royal contracts funded by the taxpayer. Ronald Harper, 61, one of the most senior members of the Royal Household staff, is accused of taking bribes from directors of building, heating and energy firms. In return, he is said to have handed out huge contracts for mechanical and electrical work at Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and Kensington Palace. The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace: The Queen's former deputy property manager has been charged with taking more than £100,000 in kickbacks to award contracts ultimately funded by taxpayers . Harper, who was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen in 2004, is alleged to have corruptly accepted gifts of tens of thousands of pounds over nearly six years in return for favouring a number of firms supplying air conditioning, boilers and other electrical services at ‘inflated prices’. It is a hugely embarrassing development for the Queen as the Royal Household has been criticised for leaving palaces to crumble after years of complacency. The multi-million pound works were for the London homes of Prince Harry, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. They were paid for out of the public purse through a government grant that covers the upkeep of royal palaces. Harper – who was suspended by the Royal Household in 2012 – was arrested by Leicestershire Police after it uncovered an alleged scam involving nine men and a woman. They included the directors of three companies awarded the large contracts. Two of these firms later received prestigious Royal Warrants. One energy company is even said to have provided Harper with an oil tank and boiler system for his home free of charge. Luke Bulpitt, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said it had ‘authorised charges against nine men and a woman in connection with alleged fraudulent activity concerning property management at the royal palaces’. He added: ‘It is alleged that between 2006 and 2011, a number of company directors bribed Ron Harper ... in return for him awarding them large contracts.’ Harper and nine co-defendants are due to appear before Westminster magistrates today. He is charged with four counts of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments. A relative of Harper, Alan Rollinson, is also charged with one count of converting or transferring criminal property. Corruption in the Royal Household: Ronald Harper, 61, is said to have handed out huge contracts for mechanical and electrical work at Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and Kensington Palace, pictured . In an article on the Royal Family’s website, Harper boasted of keeping down high electric bills at Buckingham Palace. He said: ‘Every five years, issues relating to the efficient running of the household’s heat and power supplies are reviewed by the team here at Buckingham Palace, meaning that energy efficiency within the Royal Household is constantly under a process of scrutiny and improvement.’ A computerised building management system controls heating and power, even regulating the fans in the palace kitchen. Ahead of the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harper also bragged of the benefits of Buckingham Palace’s combined heat and power units for energy and the LED technology it was installing in candelabras. He claimed that a boiler firm he had selected had reduced the palace’s annual energy bill by eight per cent. But police believe a number of the contracts he handed out to firms promising to use renewable energy involved corrupt payments. Buckingham Palace declined to comment last night. A Member of the Royal Victorian Order is given by the Queen to people who have served her or the Monarchy in a personal way.

Paul Downton said: 'Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates. 'However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy. 'England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill.

Gonzalo Higuain pounced in stoppage time to send the holders into a the semi-finalas and add to the misery for Mancini's team.

But, with only seconds remaining, a quickly taken throw-in caught Inter defender Andrea Ranocchia off his guard and Higuain got away to side-foot the ball past fellow Argentine Juan Pablo Carrizo into the far corner. Higuain missed two early chances for Napoli before Inter forward Mauro Icardi struck the bar in a lively opening. Carrizo also made good saves from Higuain and Marek Hamsik, before Inter enjoyed a let-off when Kalidou Koulibaly volleyed wide from close range. The game looked to be heading for extra-time until Higuain's goal which came out of the blue to earn Napoli victory. The finish left Mancini, who returned for a second stint at the club in November, completely exasperated. 'We just keep giving away goals, all the time,' he told reporters. 'We played well, but then we did something silly, we are too weak. To concede goals like that one is absurd, it's shocking. 'It was over, there were 30 seconds left,' he added. 'It was a fine performance until then, but you have to score goals and not concede them. 'I can't remember the last time I lost three matches in a row, it was probably 10 years ago.' However, Mancini did not single out Ranocchia for criticism. 'Higuain is a player who is too experienced, too cunning,' he said .

"The man who owns a quarter of Derby County is talking at length about his plans for a comedy tour with Ricky Gervais, why he turned down the BBC’s request to appear on Dragons’ Den and the technicoloured poncho he wears while sitting with fans at matches. He is responding to the suggestion that he may be something of a maverick. ‘It was actually the original working name of my book,’ says Canadian businessman W Brett Wilson. Top-flight time? Derby County investor W Brett Wilson owns a quarter of the club . ‘The whole thought of being a maverick is trying to do things differently from the way they were done before.’ That extends to his dress code, which is usually on the casual side. ‘Early on at Derby, on one trip to Old Trafford, the pressure was put on me to smarten up so we went into a store near the stadium to buy a tie. Since then I’ve been a little less concerned. I throw on the jumper and have some fun.’ Wilson (the W stands for William) is a well-known figure in his homeland for his television appearances and charity work and he may be about to earn fame in England, with Derby one win away from the Barclays Premier League. He will be at Wembley on Saturday and is promising to bring the pink-blue-red hoodie as he divides 90 minutes or more between fellow owners in the directors’ box and friends and fans in the stands. ‘I come over to one or two matches a year and I’ve always worn that sweater,’ he says. ‘I bought it for $22 in a market in rural Ecuador when I was  backpacking a few years ago with my daughter. It is distinguishing.’ In charge: Wilson (left) in his lucky poncho with chairman Andy Appleby . That was his attire while sitting next to a 92-year-old supporter during the 4-1 victory over Brighton which booked a play-off final place for Steve McClaren’s side. ‘He had been coming since he was eight,’ says Wilson, 56. ‘It’s staggering we would have that kind of fan. He was sharp and lucid and gave me very specific advice.’ Wilson, said by Forbes to be worth $1.5billion, is one of a clutch of investors from north America who bought Derby for around £50million in January 2008. His shareholding stands at 25 per cent, a similar level to Tom Ricketts, who also owns the Chicago Cubs, and slightly more than Jeff Mallett, a Yahoo! founder with shares in the San Francisco Giants. Together they leave the running of the club to chief  executive Sam Rush. Wilson, who made his fortune in investment banking, remembers when the group took over with Paul Jewell at the helm and the team ‘getting kicked unceremoniously out of the Premier League with the worst record ever’. He admits to making mistakes as the club struggled in the Championship — leading to supporters staging a protest over a perceived lack of investment. But he insists the error was in wasting money on the wrong players. Suited and booted: Wilson (right) pictured at a David Foster Foundation fundraiser in Toronto in 2010 . ‘As a group we’ve invested over $100m,’ explains Wilson. ‘We ended up writing cheques that were triple our original investment to keep the team floating. Over the years we did nothing but buy high and sell low with the players. ‘The number of mistakes we made was almost universal. Sometimes people have thrown mud at the wall, accusing the American owners of not caring. I smile and say, “I’m Canadian”. And I care.’ Nigel Clough’s sacking led to McClaren’s arrival last September and his impact has Derby entering a match worth more than £120m in television money alone. ‘It wasn’t until a few days ago that I saw the numbers and went, “What?”’ admits Wilson. ‘I had no idea. It was double what I was expecting. It’s probably the  richest game in sport in the world. It certainly doesn’t happen in the NFL, the NHL, the NBA. There is never so much on one game.’ Queens Park Rangers provide the opposition. Derby’s £7.1m losses are within the league’s Financial Fair Play regulations but QPR face a fine of around £50m if they gain promotion after losing £65.4m last season. On the training pitch: Derby manager Steve McClaren prepares his side for the play-off final at Wembley . ‘We’re out-walleted in payroll but the Football League has proven that money doesn’t necessarily buy you wins,’ says Wilson. ‘We think FFP is right for the league, the fans, the players, we think it’s good long-term, so we adhere to it. Others that haven’t should be  willing to pay the price.’ His colourful character as much as his business acumen led to a three-season stint on Canada’s version of Dragons’ Den and he was offered a job by the Beeb. ‘But they wanted me to spend four or five days in Manchester at a week’s notice.

"A man has been arrested after he allegedly tried to hire a teenager for $600 a week and an iPhone. 'Sugar babies' are women who date rich older men and receive money and gifts in exchange, something the Miami New Times has reported on. But this girl was only 15 and a Miami man was arrested after he traveled to a park in Pembroke Pines to meet the teenager with an iPhone, some gift cards and cannabis. Scroll down for video . Accused: Raul Torres (right) is accused of arranging to meet the fictitious 15-year-old girl after they chatted on the internet . Instead of meeting the schoolgirl, he was caught by police after they arranged a sting operation. Raul Alejandro Torres, 34, allegedly posted an online ad called 'Sugahdaddi 4Sugahbaybe 34(FLL).' Though its not clear that that Torres was specifically looking for an underaged girl, a Pembroke Pines detective responded to the ad in the guise of a 15-year-old girl. Police say that Torres was made well aware that his imaginary chat partner was underage. 'Age is just a number,' he reportedly told the undercover detective. The detective made arrangements with Torres to meet at a park. iPhone: Torres allegedly agreed to buy an iPhone for the girl as well as give her hundreds of dollars . Torres agreed to buy an iPhone 5 for the girl and give her $400 up front, and then paying her an allowance of $600 a week for her continued services and companionship. He also promised to bring cannabis to the meeting. When Torres arrived he was met by police. They found the phone, four gift cards worth $100, and a small amount of pot. He was charged with using a computer and traveling to meet a minor for unlawful sexual conduct, possession of cannabis under 20 grams and violation of probation. He was not offered bond due to his probation violation. Snared: Police posed as a 15-year-old girl to respond to the advert (file picture)","Police posed as 15-year-old to snare suspect .

"Ships could be sailing right across the North Pole by the middle of the century, US experts predict. By around 2050 the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a straight path between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it is claimed. ‘Nobody's ever talked about shipping over the top of the North Pole,’ said lead researcher Professor Laurence Smith, from the University of California in Los Angeles. ‘This is an entirely unexpected possibility.’ Meanwhile, cargo ships and tankers could routinely be making voyages through Arctic Ocean channels that are currently impossible for them to navigate on their own. Ships could be sailing right across the North Pole by the middle of the century, US experts predict . The scientists studied seven well-established climate simulations for the years 2040 to 2059 to estimate the future thickness of sea ice in the Arctic. They then used a computer programme to look for potential new shipping routes opening up in September, the Arctic's most navigable month of the year. By mid-century most common open-water ships will be able, without the help of icebreakers, to cross the Northern Sea Route hugging the coast of Russia, the forecast shows. The route is about 40 per cent shorter than plotting a course through the Suez Canal. Sailing directly over the North Pole would provide a passage for icebreakers between the world's two greatest oceans which is 20 per cent shorter than the Northern Sea Route. Even the fabled and notoriously treacherous Northwest Passage, which traces Canada's coastline, could be opened up to ordinary shipping, say the researchers. It is expected to become navigable for vessels which are strengthened against ice, and even some ships with unreinforced hulls. Today, the Northwest Passage can only be crossed in one of every seven years on average, making it too unreliable for commercial shipping. But by 2050 the September sea ice is expected to melt to the point that it is accessible every other year. For centuries the Arctic Ocean has captured the imagination of explorers because of the possibility of travelling between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through the Bering Strait. By 2050 the Arctic ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a path between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans . Until recently, thick ice has blocked this inviting short cut linking Asia with North America and Europe. But in the past two years, the ice has started to melt in late summer sufficiently to allow ordinary vessels escorted by icebreakers to venture into the Arctic. Last summer, a total of 46 voyages were successfully completed along the Northern Sea Route. The new research is published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Scenarios assuming low-to-medium and relatively high increases in temperature both had the same dramatic impact on Arctic sea ice, the scientists found. ‘No matter what carbon emission scenario is considered, by mid-century we will have passed a crucial tipping point - sufficiently thin sea ice - enabling moderately capable icebreakers to go where they please,’ said Professor Smith. The predictions have major implications for commercial shipping, the exploitation of natural resources and the jurisdiction of shipping lanes. A more accessible Arctic could also fuel international disagreements, say the researchers. For instance, Canada has long maintained that the Northwest Passage falls under its sovereignty while the US maintains it is an international stretch of water. While the passage is essentially un-navigable, the issue is moot. But increasing accessibility could bring the US into a dispute with its northern neighbour. The prospect of open-water ships entering the Arctic Ocean in late summer also heightens the need for international regulations protecting the environment and ensuring the safety of sailors, the researchers added.","Ships could be sailing across the North Pole by 2050, US experts predict .

"Six summers ago Jake Buxton was without a club and told by his wife Danielle to make a career from football within one season or abandon the sport for a steady 9-5 job instead. Shifts spray-painting cars or working on building sites beckoned before Nigel Clough offered Buxton a chance at Burton Albion in the Conference. They won the title together, Buxton was named player of the season, and then both moved to Derby County – where the central defender is now one win away from the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Steve McClaren's view on the Wembley showdown with QPR . From rags to riches: Former Conference player Jake Buxton (right) is 90 minutes away from the Premier League . Committed to the cause: Buxton believes Derby's youth gives them the edge over QPR . It has been quite a climb up the Football League ladder but such is Buxton’s standing in the squad he will deliver the pre-match rallying call when the players assemble in a huddle on the Wembley pitch, drawing on his own experiences to find the right emotive trigger for team-mates. Buxton, who was released by Mansfield Town in 2008 after relegation, said: ‘I took it to heart. 'That summer, you wait for the phone to ring, then it’s the end of June, players were starting pre-season and I didn’t have a club. ‘I had mortgages and bills to play like every normal person. The only call came from Nigel Clough. It was either get a job, or take the opportunity of playing at Burton Albion part-time. ‘My missus gave me an ultimatum of one season or I had to get a trade. 'I was spray painting cars for an insurance company, I did a bit of building work, labouring. Heartbreak: Buxton was part of the Mansfield side that were relegated out of the Football League . ‘Burton were training at the FA centre which was just being built. I was very lucky that season was the final piece of the jigsaw that got us out of the Conference.’ Buxton admits he was ‘hurt’ when Clough was sacked last September but says Steve McClaren has improved the team. ‘Nigel’s been in touch and wished the lads all the best,’ adds Buxton. Wembley will be a new experience for McClaren’s young team, who give away plenty of top-flight experience to Harry Redknapp’s high-earning side. Derby’s wages top out at £12,000 per week while the likes of Joey Barton and Bobby Zamora have £60,000 per week deals at Queens Park Rangers. Lifeline: Nigel Clough took Buxton to Burton and then to Pride Park . Buxton’s career has been a world away from such mega contracts and even though riches will follow in the Premier League his pre-match address will steer away from money as a motivation. ‘The huddles have all been quite emotional, I’ve tried to hit home, talk about things which might mean a lot to the players,’ he says. ‘We talk about your family, your kids or maybe the haters - people who’ve doubted you over the course of your career. ‘The drive is to play in the Premier League, to play at Stamford Bridge, Emirates, Old Trafford. It’s not about money and never has been. It’s about playing in the highest league as a player.’ The 29-year-old, who became a father in the last year to 11-month-old Beau, believes Derby’s youth can prove decisive. ‘QPR have the name players and they’ve all played in the division above. We’ve got a lot of young players with energy. If they want to stand toe to toe with us and we perform as we have done over 48 games then there’ll only be one outcome.’","Defender admits he was 12 months from walking away from the game .

"The £4billion battle for live TV coverage of the Premier League is set to be a three-way contest. The current dominance of Sky and BT Sport is likely to be challenged by Discovery Communications, the American documentary channel, when bidding for the 2016-19 seasons closes Friday. The fierce competition for the seven packages of matches up for grabs, which total of 168 live games a season, could see the price of a single live game rise to an amazing £8m. Sky and BT Sport are set to battle Discovery Communications as well for 2016-19 Premier League rights . Such a bonanza would bring in more than £4bn over three years from the domestic TV market alone with another healthy increase on the current £2bn from overseas deals to come later. This is as well as the £204m already agreed with the BBC for Match of the Day highlights. The biggest winners from this windfall will, as ever, be the Premier League players with £200,000-a-week contracts for the elite stars likely to become more commonplace. Sky are expected to pour all their resources into retaining at least four of their prime first pick packages while BT will want an increase on their 38 live games per season. And Discovery Comunications, who own Eurosport, are also keen on a slice of the live PL action. There are seven packages of matches up for grabs, which total of 168 live games a season . And there’s still speculation in a tender, in which all those involved have had to sign strict confidentiality agreements, over whether Qatar-based beIN Sport, the richest TV network in the world, will make a bid. Meanwhile, broadcast regulators Ofcom have, as expected, turned down Virgin Media’s fanciful appeal to postpone the rights auction until their complaint about the sales process is fully investigated.

"Kevin Pietersen fired another shot . in his verbal battle with Matt Prior on Friday when he hit back over . the wicketkeeper’s claim that the England dressing room will be a . better place without him. Prior, . whose relationship with Pietersen deteriorated badly towards the end of . the Ashes, became the first player to publicly express his feelings . over the maverick’s sacking when he spoke at a question-and-answer . session in Dubai about the need to ‘rediscover the honour and pride of . playing for England’. Hitting back: Kevin Pietersen told Matt Prior to spend more time in the nets and less doing 'Q&As' Bitter tweet: Pietersen had some advice for Prior and taunted him by naming his possible successor . Out of favour: Kevin Pietersen was axed by England after the ill-fated Ashes tour Down Under . A better place: Prior says the England dressing room will benefit from not having Pietersen in it . Maverick: Prior says Pietersen could have been 'the best England player to ever walk this planet' Pietersen responded on Twitter when he referred to Prior as the ‘Big Cheese’, a nickname given to him in his early days at Sussex, and mocked the Ashes vice-captain’s demotion from the team for the last two Tests in Australia. ‘Fewer Q&As, more Sussex nets methinks,’ said Pietersen, who had earlier revealed details of Prior’s leading role in a team meeting after the Melbourne Test through his mouthpiece Piers Morgan. Then Pietersen, who name-checked Jos Buttler, Prior’s rival for a Test place this summer, responded to a follower’s tweet which said, ‘This is why KP isn’t in the England team any more’, by saying, ‘Neither is the Big Cheese Prior’. It is a tiresome extension of a row that does little credit to anyone but it is further evidence Pietersen will be lurking in the background to provide a distraction to England’s attempts to move on without him. Re-integrated: Prior was instrumental in getting Pietersen back in the England team following the 'textgate' scandal - revealed by Sportsmail - in 2012 . Happier times: Pietersen and Prior celebrate retaining the Ashes in Melbourne in 2010 . The Buttler can do it: Pietersen referenced Jos Buttler in his tweet to Prior - the Lancashire keeper is one of the contenders for the gloves this summer . That new era continued without Pietersen . here with a slightly shambolic start to the first of three . one-day internationals when Paul Collingwood was promoted from his role . as temporary coach to be 12th man. England had been hit by  injuries . to Eoin Morgan and Alex Hales, bringing one-day international debuts for . Moeen Ali and Michael Lumb and also the  need for an extra substitute . to complete the complement of four demanded by the ICC. Collingwood, . who retired from international cricket three years ago, is still active . with Durham and was considered a better bet than fast bowlers Jade . Dernbach and Harry Gurney should a second sub, in addition to Steven . Parry, have been required. Yet the ICC, never short of a petty rule, . would not let him take the field wearing another player’s shirt so Phil . Neale, the England operations manager, was deputed to head into the . stands to borrow one from a fan, Dave Whelan from Devon. Whelan was . wearing the shirt, a Christmas present from his wife, for the first time . but said he was happy to help out England while Neale promised he would . get it signed by the team once Collingwood had finished with it. Back . on the pitch, where Collingwood was not required, there was early . encouragement for an England side who are using this series to prepare . for the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. The low, slow pitch at a stadium . where an unfit outfield forced the abandonment of a Test in 2009 . encouraged stand-in captain Stuart Broad to use three off-spinners in . the first 15 overs of the West Indies innings. Replacing Graeme . Swann, who was sitting in the stands in his new role as a BBC radio . summariser and calling Pietersen’s response to Prior ‘fairly childish’, . is arguably England’s most pressing need.So Broad gave the new ball . to Joe Root after England had won the toss and he took the first West . Indian wicket, thanks to a stunning, one-handed catch from Barbados-born . Chris Jordan. There was a tidy contribution from James Tredwell, who . conceded only 23 runs from his 10 overs, and an encouraging start from . Moeen, principally a batsman with Worcestershire but clearly no mean . spinner, too. Moeen trapped Darren Bravo lbw and held the catch in . an improved England fielding  performance which ended the resistance of . Lendl Simmons, who initially held a stuttering West Indies together with . 65. Yet Broad’s faith in spin backfired when he gave Root the 47th . over and saw it go for 23 as Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo gave the home . side late impetus with some spectacular hitting to take them to a . competitive 269 for six. The last 10 overs brought 116. That gave . England food for thought during an interval when the Antiguan government . honoured the island’s glorious cricketing past by knighting Richie .

"Emmanuel Adebayor has lifted the lid on his collapsed deadline day move to West Ham, admitting that Daniel Levy blocked the deal because of Tottenham's rivalry with the Hammers. The Togolese striker had been set for a temporary move away from White Hart Lane, with West Ham and QPR two of the front-runners for his signature, but all deals fell through at the last minute. 'The club decided to send me out on loan, which I was pleased with,' Adebayor told Sky Sports News on Wednesday. 'I was lucky enough to have five good clubs in my hand, and I decided to go for three... and then I chose the one I wanted to go to. Luckily Mr Levy was against this because they're kind of like rivals. Emmanuel Adebayor was set to leave Tottenham on loan on deadline day, but the move was blocked . Adebayor has made just 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham so far this season . 'The club decided I should stay, and I'm very happy to stay at the club and I'm here to do my job.' Adebayor has had a difficult season at White Hart Lane, making only 11 Premier League appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side. After a 2-1 home defeat to Stoke City on November 9, Adebayor travelled home to Togo to deal with personal issues, leaving north London amid a chorus of boos. 'I'm very sad about that,' Adebayor continued. 'We lost the game against Stoke at home, which I was not very pleased about obviously. If you play for Tottenham, it's a team that wants to finish in the top four, you're supposed to be beating Stoke City at home. Daniel Levy stopped Adebayor leaving for West Ham on Monday because of the two clubs' rivalry . Adebayor went back to Togo for personal reasons after Spurs' loss to Stoke, where he was booed by fans . 'Straight away after the game I was not happy. I was a little bit upset about the way we played, and obviously some journalists asked me questions. I gave them the answer and they twisted it. Most of the fans believed what they read, and I came out clearly and said ""I didn't mean to hurt anyone."" At the end of the day, I know how much they pay to come and watch us. 'I'm Togolese, if I'm not part of my Togolese national team and if I see them playing and they are not playing well, if I have to insult them or boo them, I would do the same thing so I can understand their feelings.' Despite the problems Adebayor experienced with the supporters at White Hart Lane, he returned to action on January 17, before captaining the side against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup. The Togolese striker says he was sad about the boos, but wants to forget about it and move on . Adebayor said celebrating with fans after scoring is the most beautiful moments in a footballer's life . He looked set for a temporary stint away from the club after further boos as he left the field, but will now stay at Spurs and fight for his place in the team. For Adebayor, the problems are firmly behind him. 'If anyone thinks I am not happy with [Tottenham's] support it is a lie,' he said. 'At the end of the day, they are the ones that make me run more, they are the ones that make me score goals. Otherwise what is the point of scoring goals? 'If you score goals, you run in front of the fans and salute them, they are the most beautiful moments in a footballer's life. For me, I think they have a bad interpretation of what the journalists [said]. We have to forget those things and move on.'","Emmanuel Adebayor was set for a loan move away from Tottenham .

"Yaya Toure scored his first goal of this Africa Cup of Nations to help Ivory Coast reach the final for the second time in three years, despite an unconvincing display. Neither Toure nor his new Manchester City team-mate Wilfried Bony were at their best, against a Democratic Republic of Congo side that few teams expected to get even this far, but Toure’s strike was still the highlight of an entertaining match. This has not been a great tournament for City’s midfield powerhouse. Sullen both on and off the pitch, rarely able to make an impression from a deeper role than he is used to, and possibly even carrying an injury, Toure had been a shadow of the player we know he can be. Yaya Toure (right) celebrates with team-mate Serge Aurier after rifling home to put Ivory Coast 1-0 up . Toure (pictured wearing 19) runs along the side of the pitch with his team-mates in tow . Gervinho restored Ivory Coast's lead to 2-1 five minutes before the half-time break in Bata, Equatorial Guinea .

Goal: Mbokani 24 . Booked: Kasusula 67, Kabananga 71 . Ivory Coast (3-4-3): Gbohouo, Bailly, K Toure, Kanon, Aurier, Y Toure, Die, Tiene (Diarrassouba 72), Gradel (Kalou 62), Bony (Traore 90+2), Gervinho . Subs not used: Barry, Assale, Doukoure, Doumbia, Gadji-Celi Carmel Junior, Akpa-Akpro, Diomande, Mande . Goals: Y Toure 20, Gervinho 41, Kanon 68 . Booked: Kanon 26, Y Toure 28, Die 70, Aurier 76 . Referee: Neant Alioum . The frustration he showed to pick up a needless yellow card after just half an hour, by haranguing the referee over a throw-in decision, was typical of his tournament so far. On this occassion he was outshone by the excellent Chancel Mbemba of Anderlecht, and while he was not exactly poor, he was nowhere near the all-action hero he should be for this team. Unable to influence games as he might like, he has been reduced to merely a forceful personality, vociferously encouraging his team-mates, rather than a forceful performer, leading by example. But, in the 20th minute, he showed that he can still produce moments of magic. After Bony had been dispossessed in the box, the ball broke to Toure on the edge of the box. As it bounced across his body, the ball sat up perfectly for the 31-year-old, and he seemed to let out three weeks of tension in the strike, which flew past veteran keeper Robert Kidiaba before he could do more than flap at it. The shot was not far from the 38-year-old keeper, but it is hard to fault him for failing to save it. Had he been able to react quickly enough to get a hand on it, it would have needed to be made of steel to divert the thunder-strike off target. Gervinho (centre) watches on as his shot flies past Muteba Kidiaba and into the back of the DR Congo net . Gervinho slides on his knees near the corner flag after helping his team to the Africa Cup of Nations final . Dieudonne Mbokani (centre) gave his side some hope after he equalised from the penalty spot to make it 1-1 . The lead lasted just a few seconds. As has been their way all the way through this competition, the Congolese forwards reacted to going behind – although in truth they had a helping hand from both Eric Bailly and referee Neant Alioum. A hopeful ball into the box drifted over the head of Jeremy Bokila, and struck Bailly on the hand, but quite how he was supposed to have deliberately handled from behind the striker is anyone’s guess. Nonetheless, Alioum pointed to the spot and Dieumercie Mbokani calmly side-footed into the corner. But, once again, when finding themselves on level terms, DR Congo went back into their shell. Eventually they were punished when Yannick Bolasie gifted the ball to Wilfried Bony deep in his own half, the new City striker feeding Gervinho who finished with aplomb.

An Ivory Coast fan waves his country's flag while he watches the semi-final match in Bata, Equatorial Guinea . It had been coming. Moments earlier Gervinho had a header cleared brilliantly off the line by Peterbrough’s Gabriel Zakuani, who managed to turn the goal-bound effort up onto the underside of the crossbar and away. It was a feat the defender had to repeat in the second half, when Kibiati deflected a Gervinho cross towards his own goal. Soon after the former Arsenal forward had another chance, running at goal from the right wing before being denied by a brilliant recovery tackle from Jean Kasusula. The third goal, which killed the game off, came from a corner, Serge Aurier’s header parried into the path of Serge Kanon, who steered it home with a knee. It was harsh on DR Congo, who had dominated for much of the game. Gabriel Zakuani (right) takes hold of the ball as Gervinho watches on during the Africa Cup of Nations match . Bolasie (left) looks up as goalscorer Serge Kanon bears down on him during their semi-final clash . Mbokani (right), scorer of DR Congo's goal, challenges Kanon with a high foot in Bata . Despite the quality of the attacking players at his disposal, Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard was once again content to allow the opposition possession for long periods, sitting his two defensive lines deep and utilizing the pace of Gervinho and Gradel on the break. The Ivorians showed a little more ambition than in their quarter-final, with wing-backs Serge Aurier and Siaka Tiene playing higher up the field than they had for large periods against Algeria, but for the most part they were solid rather than spectacular. In fact, aside from Gervinho, Aurier was the Ivorians best attacking outlet for much of the game from right wing-back, forcing Bolasie to do rather more tracking back than he is used to. But the Palace man still managed to find some time to attack, as Congo maintained plenty of possession and, once they had conceded the first goal, began to create some chances.

The Ivory Coast starting XI line up and link arms as their national anthem plays in the build-up to the match . DR Congo's starting XI pose for a photo before their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final match . Bolasie provided first half chances for both Mbokani and Bokila, the former seeing his deflected shot turned away by Sylvain Gbohouo, the latter stopped only by a brilliant challenge from Liverpool’s Kolo Toure. The winger continued to threaten in the second period, forcing Gbohouo into two good saves early in the second half. The first came after Bolasie had controlled a cross and smashed it at goal, the second followed a brilliant jinking run, which, had he been able to finish, would have been goal of the tournament. But with Kannon’s goal the Leopards’ play went from merely attacking to suicidal, as multiple substitutions robbed them of any structure they had possessed in the final third. More than ever the Ivorians were able to sit deep, and their solidity told, the Leopards scarcely able to muster a shot in the closing stages, while Gervinho should have added a fourth on the break. They will go into the final, against either Ghana or hosts Equatorial Guinea, as strong favourites. Rather like their captain’s performance, this is not a vintage side, but it might well prove to be enough. Despite the ‘golden generation’ seemingly being well past their best, they are on the verge of finally winning a major tournament.","Yaya Toure opened the scoring for Ivory Coast with a long-range effort .

On Wednesday it was revealed that the Barcelona defender is already looking for his next club after the Catalan giants failed to offer him a new contract. The Brazilian's current deal finishes at the end of this season, which means he is free to negotiate with clubs outside of Spain ahead of a free transfer this summer. Alves' agent, Dinorah Santana, believes Barca's failure to offer a new contract means the 31-year-old's time at the Nou Camp is up. 'They haven't contacted us,' Santana told Spanish radio station Cadena SER. Barcelona defender Dani Alves looks set to leave the club this summer after not being offered a new contract . 'I interpret that silence to mean they don't want Dani Alves, so we will begin searching for a new club.' 'We won't wait for Barcelona, they have to take the plunge,' added Santana. 'Alves has spent seven years here and he has behaved like a professional at all times. 'Barcelona have not had a sporting director for a month and Alves is free to negotiate with any club. (Former director of football) Andoni Zubizarreta didn't tell us anything.' Alves, who joined the club for £32million from Sevilla in 2008, has made 16 appearances in La Liga this season and another five in the Champions League but still appears surplus to requirements under boss Enrique. Alves, pictured in action against Villarreal, can begin negotiations with clubs outside of Spain already .","Attacking trio are joined by Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta in film .

"Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and defender Mats Hummels attempted to placate angry fans after Jurgen Klopp's side slumped to another defeat on Wednesday night. Last season's Bundesliga runners-up were booed off after the a 1-0 home defeat by 10-man Augsburg which left Dortmund firmly anchored to the foot of the Bundesliga table. After the final whistle Weidenfeller climbed on top of the crowd barrier to talk to angry supporters, while Hummels also faced up to the frustrations of the club's famous 'yellow wall'.

One fan voices his frustration at Hummels after Dortmund slumped to their 11th league defeat of the season . Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller also tried to placate angy supporters after final whistle . Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was bewildered by 11th defeat in 19 Bundesliga games . Dortmund completely lacked ideas in front of a sold-out 80,000 crowd and were easily outmuscled by European hopefuls Augsburg for whom Raul Bobadilla netted the winner in the 50th minute to seal his club's first ever win over Dortmund. Surprise packages Augsburg, who had Christoph Janker sent off midway through the second half, shut out Dortmund in the last half hour and climbed into fourth place on 33 points courtesy of their third successive league win. Dortmund, who take on Juventus in the Champions League round of 16 this month, are 18th in the Bundesliga on 16 points after their 11th league defeat. Coach Jurgen Klopp was left speechless after the game while goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and defender Mats Hummels went straight to speak to their furious fans. 'We can be accused of anything tonight and it is all justified,' Klopp said. 'Battling also means having the courage to take the right decision. We were missing that tonight.' 'It hurts, no doubt. We are doing everything wrong at the moment. We are not making anything of our chances.' Augsburg's Raul Bobadilla, right, scores past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .

Hamburg SV, also former Bundesliga champions, eased their relegation fears by beating Paderborn 3-0, ending a league goal drought that had lasted 398 minutes. Rafael van der Vaart converted a penalty after Hamburg were awarded the fastest Bundesliga spot-kick since timings were introduced in 2004-05 just eight seconds into the game.

"Six teenagers who launched a violent and frenzied attack on passengers on a tram have walked free from court. A judge said that the youths acted 'like a pack of dogs' when they cornered their victims, three young Afghan men, and beat them with sticks, poles, and socks filled with ballast in what was a mistaken revenge attack. But despite the teenagers all pleading guilty to violent disorder after the attack, which was captured on the tram's CCTV, they were spared jail at Croydon Crown Court this week. Scroll down for video . Kieran Hawker, 18 . Robert Elsey, 19 . Aaron Henery, 18 . Dean Riley, 19, left, and Anthony Patton, 27, right, were sentenced for their parts in the vicious tram attack . The court heard that before the attack, the group had chased a number of men into a petrol station in New Addington, Croydon, and assaulted one of them before fleeing as police arrived. While the officers tended to the victim inside the petrol station, the group - armed with sticks and poles - turned on three other men, wrongly believing them to have attacked their friend earlier, chasing them as they tried to escape onto a Croydon-bound tram at King Henry's Drive tram stop. As the victims boarded the tram, one . of the group pulled the emergency door release, preventing the tram from . leaving the stop and causing all the doors to stay open, according to a British Transport Police statement. Over a ten-minute period, the statement said, the tram was . repeatedly bombarded with ballast thrown by the 20-strong group, . smashing several windows and damaging the tram, while one ran . aboard and threw ballast at the victims. It said that the group then surged onto the tram . and began a violent and frenzied assault on the three victims, kicking . and punching them and striking them with sticks and socks filled with . ballast. A spokesman for British Transport Police said : 'The group swarmed in and out of the . tram, taking turns to attack the victims. One of the victims was kicked . so hard against an internal, glass door that it smashed. 'Like a pack of dogs': The youths cornered their victims in a tram and pulled the emergency cord to stop it moving off . 'Hearing that police officers were on their way, the group fled after around two minutes, discarding their weapons as they fled.' The victims, a 19-year-old man from . Thornton Heath, an 18-year-old man from Streatham and a third . unidentified man, were given first aid by officers at . the scene. CCTV footage of the group was . circulated on police intelligence systems and they were arrested . after local officers recognised them. On Monday seven of the group, all of them from New Addington, were sentenced for their part in the attack, which took place in October 2011, after earlier guilty pleas. The court heard how they attacked the men because they wrongly believed they had earlier attacked their friend. The attack took place in October 2011 on a tram at King Henry's Drive stop in New Addington . The attackers ran off when they heard police were coming but local officers recognised them from CCTV footage . The youths caused £3,500 of damage to the tram in the ten-minute attack with sticks, poles, and socks filled with ballast . Judge Shani Barnes said: 'I am not exaggerating when I say that your behaviour on that night was like a pack of dogs'. Detective Constable Ostin Elkins, from . British Transport Police, said: 'This was a callous, brutal and . ultimately cowardly attack and we welcome the sentences handed down. 'The . victims stood absolutely no chance of defending themselves against a . pack of individuals who repeatedly took turns to attack, regain their . energy and then attack again. 'This . was also terrifying for the numerous other passengers aboard the tram, . who were present throughout the entire ordeal, while the tram itself . sustained over £3,400 worth of damage and had to be taken out of . service. 'Fortunately attacks of this nature – in terms of the violence and sheer numbers involved – are very rare on the rail network.'

"Whoever wins the Championship play-off final will hand over about £1.5million to the loser as part of an agreement between Derby County and Queens Park Rangers. The two clubs have decided that their entire share of the matchday revenue should be awarded to the one who misses out on promotion and Barclays Premier League riches.

According to the police report, the crash occurred in late December in Aspen, Colorado, with Armstrong and his girlfriend Anna Hansen then departing the scene before officers had arrived. The report said Hansen later told police she had been driving before changing her story. Lance Armstrong is to appear in court after allegedly crashing into two parked cars and fleeing the scene . Hansen (left) eventually admitted that Armstrong was driving when the accident took place . It said Hansen was initially cited, having told officers that, while driving the couple back home from an Aspen Art Museum party and going too fast for the snowy conditions, she lost control of her vehicle and struck two parked cars before speaking to the owner and offering to pay for the damage. One of the officers involved said due to suspicions over this story, he then spoke to a valet for the art museum party, who told him it had been Armstrong who had driven away from the event. The report added that Hansen subsequently admitted she had been the passenger and that Armstrong had been the driver. Hansen is quoted in the report as saying that her taking the blame had been ""a joint decision"" between her and Armstrong made in a bid to avoid negative headlines.

"Two military jets escorted an Alaska Airlines flight into Seattle last night after a caller told the FBI that a possible hijacker was aboard the flight from Hawaii, officials said. After the jet landed safely, authorities took the male passenger off the plane and questioned him for about two hours. FBI Seattle spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich said late Thursday night that the agency was 'not anticipating an arrest.' The man was not identified.

Law enforcement officers had been . waiting for the  passenger after Oregon Air National Guard F-15 jets . escorted the aircraft, which landed about 7pm PST, airline spokesman . Paul McElroy said. An unidentified caller told the Honolulu FBI office on Thursday afternoon that a man aboard Alaska Flight 819 from Kona to Seattle was a possible hijacker, said FBI spokesman Tom Simon in Honolulu. Officers boarded the jet through rear stairs in Seattle and removed the man from the plane, McElroy said. The passenger had been seated at the back of the aircraft and 'slept most of the flight,' he added. Seattle FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich described the man as cooperative and said agents were interviewing him Thursday night.

"Tim Sherwood fears his friendship with Harry Redknapp will be damaged if he accepts an offer to become the new QPR manager before Saturday’s clash with Southampton. Sherwood is mindful of a perception within the game that he had been lined up to replace Redknapp before his dramatic decision to quit Loftus Road just hours after the transfer window closed. After working for him at White Hart Lane, Sherwood is likely to speak with Redknapp — who insists he quit because he needs two knee operations — before accepting an offer to succeed him at Loftus Road. Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood has opened talks with QPR as the club seek a new manager . Sherwood fears his friendship with Harry Redknapp will be damaged if he accepts an offer from QPR . Harry Redknapp resigned on Tuesday, claiming that his decision was because he needs surgery on his knees . Queens Park Rangers have failed to pick up a single point in their 11 matches away from Loftus Road . 11 - No team had ever lost the first 11 PL away games before QPR this season. The last top-flight team to suffer that fate were Liverpool (1953-54). 8 - QPR’s home form is decent — W5, D4, L3 — but they have played all of the others in the bottom eight. They have away games at relegation rivals Hull, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Leicester, Burnley, West Brom and Crystal Palace. 128 - QPR have allowed more shots on target than any other team in the PL. They’re also the only team yet to score in the first 15 minutes. There is an added complication because Sherwood is still being paid by Tottenham after insisting on an 18-month contract when he was promoted to replace Andre Villas-Boas in December 2013. His £1m-a-year deal expires in May, but Sherwood will hope QPR and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy can agree terms. Sherwood has been linked with a number of jobs in recent months, including West Brom, Crystal Palace, Reading and Brighton, but QPR appears to be the perfect set-up for him. On Wednesday, his friend Les Ferdinand, who also had a role under Redknapp at Spurs and was Sherwood’s assistant at White Hart Lane, was promoted to the role of director of football. Ferdinand, who returned to Loftus Road at the request of chairman Tony Fernandes, is now responsible for the entire football department. He has already recommended Sherwood for the manager’s role, but Fernandes will have the final say. In a series of tweets, the chairman said: ‘We will hire someone who cares, thinks long term, wants to be involved in developing the academy, has coaching skills, will play young players and is a winner. The names fans are mentioning to me are names that we are going to consider.’ Sherwood, pictured leading Tottenham training last year, was sacked by the club at the end of last season .

Bond, who has worked with Redknapp for many years, will prepare QPR to face Southampton on Saturday . Coach Chris Ramsey, another friend of Sherwood, and Kevin Bond are in temporary charge of the team as they prepare for the clash with Southampton. Fernandes added: ‘I’ve been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here. This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy is changing. ‘The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here. We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us. ‘I can reassure all Rangers fans that we are putting the building blocks in place to move things in the right direction. ‘We’ve made a number of mistakes in the transfer market over the last few years and it’s something we want to change. We don’t want to be a buying club — we want to nurture young talent and build a young, ambitious team. ‘Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the academy upwards, to create a culture and philosophy within the club that QPR fans can be proud of.’ Former Spurs midfielder Sherwood worked as a coach under Redknapp at Tottenham before becoming boss .

"Alcohol is responsible for four per cent of all cancer deaths with the significant risk to drinkers 'hiding in plain sight', according to experts. A study warned that the preventable risk factor is under-emphasised by doctors and therefore poorly understood by the public. The American researchers found that alcohol . resulted in around 20,000 cancer deaths in the US every year - approximately 3.5 per cent of the total. Link: A study by the Department of Medicine at Boston University Medical Centre found that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths in the US every year - 3.5 per cent - are linked to alcohol . The study found that the form of the disease most commonly linked with alcohol consumption in women is breast cancer. The Department of Medicine at Boston University Medical Centre said that breast cancer linked to alcohol accounted for approximately 6,000 deaths every year in the US - 15 per cent of all breast cancer deaths. Cancers of the mouth, throat and esophagus were common causes of death in men who drank alcohol. The study, which will be published in the American Journal of Public Health in April, also found a correlation between reducing the amount of alcohol we drink and lowering the risk of developing cancer. Lack of attention: The study's authors warned that risks attached to alcohol are under-emphasised by doctors . Previous studies have consistently shown that drinking alcohol is a significant risk factor in developing cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and oesophagus. More recent research has shown that alcohol also increases the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum. Boston University's Dr Timothy Naimi led the study that examined recent data from the US on alcohol consumption and cancer mortality. Cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus were related to a total of about 6,000 annual deaths. Although higher levels of alcohol consumption caused an increased risk of developing cancer, consuming 1.5 drinks per day or less still accounted for 30 per cent of all alcohol-attributable cancer deaths. Dr Naimi said: 'The relationship between alcohol and cancer is strong, but is not widely appreciated by the public and remains under-emphasised even by physicians.

"England’s players were forced to train on Wednesday against a deafening back-drop of Welsh singing blaring from speakers, as they desperately strive to avoid a repeat of their 2013 calamity in Cardiff. The national team’s state-of-the-art headquarters in Surrey resounded to the sound of Welsh folk singer Max Boyce’s Hymns and Arias, which has been adopted by fans as one of their anthems, to replicate the fervent din they will face at the Millennium Stadium tomorrow night. Head coach Stuart Lancaster used the ploy to prepare his squad for the RBS Six Nations opener, as part of a drive to combat the partisan atmosphere which is likely to include a refusal to have the roof closed for the game. England's training session on Wednesday was against a deafening back-drop of Welsh singing from speakers . The idea was pioneered by head coach Stuart Lancaster to prepare them for Friday's match at Wales . Two years ago, England slumped to a record 30-3 defeat in the Welsh capital and they are on guard about the threat of another noisy ambush. ‘One of the bits of feedback we gave the players before the game two years ago was that the acoustics of the stadium are so loud that sometimes you can’t hear the communication on the field,’ said Lancaster. ‘Mike Catt kept repeatedly saying this and all the players nodded their heads, but until they had actually experienced it, they didn’t really know.’ Asked about the loud playing of Welsh songs, he added: ‘I didn’t want to leave it to chance this time around. It was only for 10 minutes but I wanted them to get the sense of what it feels like to play there. We did some phase play attack without the players being able to hear themselves think. We have eight players who haven’t played in the Millennium Stadium before, so it was preparation.’ George Ford, the England fly-half, understood the reasoning behind the musical accompaniment to training, saying: ‘We expect it to be loud and a good atmosphere, so it was important to practise under those situations, because we want the communication to be good.’ The Bath No 10 isn’t concerned if he is booed when he is lining up goal-kicks, adding: ‘It doesn’t make it easier or harder if it’s noisy. You’re in your own little bubble, concentrating on the kick.’ England fly-half George Ford says he won't be fazed if the Wales crowd booed him while he is goal-kicking . Ford (left) and (right) practiced their kicking ahead of England's Six Nations opener . Luther Burrell (left) and Billy Twelvetrees train ahead of England's clash with Wales at the Millenium Stadium . Wales have expressed a desire for the Millennium Stadium roof to be closed on Friday night, but England are destined to exercise their right to veto the move. Lancaster said: ‘It looks like it is set fair and if it is, then we will probably want it open. It’s forecast to be dry and part of the reason you’d have a roof is to keep the conditions dry. If it’s going to be dry, why do you need a roof?’ The head coach rejected the notion that having the roof open would dilute the atmosphere, adding: ‘It’s going to be pretty noisy anyway.’ Wales assistant coach Rob Howley reacted to news of England’s training soundtrack by arguing that it is evidence of their ‘meticulous’ approach. He also suggested that it is up to the home team to inspire the crowd to make a difference, saying: ‘We all talk about the cauldron, but that stadium is only as good as the players’ performance.’ However, Wales’ Lions full back, Leigh Halfpenny, has urged home fans to replicate the crescendo they produced in 2013. ‘That anthem two years ago was the loudest I’ve ever heard it,’ he said. ‘Running out into that packed Millennium Stadium is the best feeling ever and the crowd were just incredible. It gave us that buzz going into game. There is always that buzz about Wales v England and the history that goes with it.’ The roof at the Millenium Stadium in Cardiff will remain open for the Six Nations opener on Friday night .","Wales host England in the RBS 6 Nations opener on Friday night .

"The FA are in a stand-off with politicians over releasing sensitive information from secret files into the doomed 2018 England World Cup bid. Former Minister of Sport Gerry Sutcliffe revealed that the FA had ‘reluctantly’ agreed to show some members of the Department of Culture, Media, Sport select committee the dossier of documents which British intelligence services help to compile. And former FA chairman Lord Triesman said the MPs would be the ‘rightful judges’ of the hidden cache of material - much of it rumour, hearsay and innuendo rather than hard facts. Former FA chairman Lord Triesman failed to lead England to hosting either the 2018  World Cup . The FA want guarantees of confidentiality plus notice of what the select committee members intend to do with documents, containing mainly unsubstantiated information, before handing them over. They want to avoid costly legal action such as Lord Triesman still faces from abroad after making allegations about World Cup bid corruption under parliamentary privilege. Detail from those secret files that could be properly corroborated have already been handed over to FIFA investigator Michael Garcia. England head coach Stuart Lancaster wants the Millennium Stadium roof kept open for the titanic Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff on Friday night. In contrast, the roof will be closed for all eight Rugby World Cup games there in the autumn to ensure a level playing field for all teams. Trefor Lloyd Hughes, president of the Welsh FA, is adamant about a gentlemen’s agreement between the Home Nations, in place from 2011, that the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo should rotate and it is Wales’s turn after Jim Boyce, of Northern Ireland, steps down in May. However, Lloyd Hughes cannot count on the support of the FA of Wales on this issue. They, like the FA who have put up David Gill as a candidate, believe that any such verbal contract was dissolved when new UEFA statutes were introduced which have all 54 European countries voting on the next British representative rather than just the Home Nations.

BBC Sport can’t use the excuse of being strapped for cash after it emerged they put in a losing bid of £10million-a-year for the five-year Open golf contract.

Swann described Pietersen’s autobiography as ‘the biggest work of fiction since Jules Verne’. TMS producer Adam Mountford is known to have checked with Agnew before agreeing to the Pietersen offer. Agnew had resigned from Twitter temporarily last October after a social media row with Pietersen’s wife Jessica Taylor in the fall-out from the publication of KP’s life story.

"Italy have called off next week's training camp after getting a lukewarm reaction to a request for clubs to release their players. 'In view of the response we've had we've decided not to go ahead with the training camp which was at risk of not being useful to either the national team or the clubs,' said coach Antonio Conte in an Italian federation statement.

"Sampdoria striker Stefano Okaka looks set to leave the club after his agent Andrea Cattoli revealed the 25-year-old will be moving to 'a big team' in the summer. Okaka, a product of the Roma youth product, was linked with a move to AC Milan earlier in the January transfer window after the player was from first team training.

Agent Cattoli confirmed the link when interviewed by Italian publication Tuttosport and revealed the striker, who has scored three goals this season, is likely to leave the club. 'In the summer I'm hoping to bring Stefano to a big team,' Cattoli admitted. 'He was already in the eyes of other teams now, including Milan, but the operation was tied to the departure of other players.' Okaka has scored three goals for the Serie A side this summer and is expected to leave in the summer . Okaka's agency has also stressed that his client will still give his all for Sampdoria as they chase European football this season. 'Okaka is concentrated only on Sampdoria and his only thought is to play and score for these colours,' said Cattoli. 'He wants to haul the team as high up as he can.

"It has fired the imagination of historians and archaeologists for centuries, but the mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may finally have been solved - with a surprising twist. A leading Oxford-based historian says the fabled gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, were not built in Hillah by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. In fact they weren’t in Babylon at all. Dr Stephanie Dalley, of Oxford University’s Oriental Institute, says the gardens were actually located 300 miles to the north in Nineveh, Babylon's rival, by the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib. Glory of the ancients: A sixteenth century illustration of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which may not have been in Babylon at all. An Oxford historian claims they were actually built in the Assyrian city of Nineveh . She first put the proposal forward in 1992 and has spent 20 years piecing the mystery together, reports The Independent. There are four key components of Dr Dalley's theory, which will be outlined in a book released later this month. As she studied historical descriptions of the gardens, she discovered that a nineteenth century bas-relief from Sennacherib’s palace in Nineveh showed trees growing on a roofed colonnade exactly as described by early accounts. Secondly, Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, became known as 'New Babylon' when Assyria conquered Babylon in 689 BC - in fact, a number of places in the region were known by the name 'Babylon'. She also discovered that the gates of Nineveh were renamed for those traditionally used for Babylon’s city gates after the successful invasion. Thirdly, a geographical assessment found that the flat land surrounding Babylon would have made delivering water to the Hanging Gardens impossible. Hillah in modern-day Iraq was thought to be the site of the Hanging Gardens. Dr Dalley's research shows it may actually have been in Nineveh, 300 miles away . Finally, she believes that the original classical descriptions of the Hanging Gardens were written by historians who had actually visited the Nineveh area, including accounts from Alexander the Great, whose army camped near the city in 331BC, close to one of the great aqueducts that carried water to what Dr Dalley now believes to be the real site of the Hanging Gardens. She said: 'It’s taken many years to find the evidence to demonstrate that the gardens and associated system of aqueducts and canals were built by Sennacherib at Nineveh and not by Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. 'For the first time it can be shown that the Hanging Garden really did exist.' Incredibly, the revelations may mean that the Hanging Gardens were the first of the seven ‘wonders’ of the world to be described as such. Sennacherib referred to his palace gardens, as 'a wonder for all the peoples'. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the . Ancient World, and the only one that may have been pure . legend. Accounts state they were built in the ancient city-state of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The . gardens were attributed to the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, . who ruled between 605 and 562 BC. He is reported to have constructed the . gardens to please his wife Amytis of Media, who was said to pine for the plants of her homeland. It is not known what happened to the gardens. Some theorise it was levelled by an earthquake. The . Hanging Gardens of Babylon are documented by ancient Greek and Roman . writers, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Quintus Curtius Rufus. Romano-Jewish historian Josephus once described it. He said: 'In this palace he (Nebuchadnezzar) erected very high walks, supported by stone pillars; and by planting what was called a pensile paradise, and replenishing it with all sorts of trees, he rendered the prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country. 'This he did to gratify his queen, because she had been brought up in Media, and was fond of a mountainous situation.' However, no definitive archaeological evidence concerning their whereabouts has been found.","Prominent historian claims lost Ancient Wonder was not built in Babylon .

"There is little fanfare as Jamie Roberts poses patiently during a photoshoot in the Place du Trocadero, where crowds gather for the best views of the Eiffel Tower. In the Welshman’s adopted city, locals instead pine for the likes of Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who fill out the Parc des Princes for Paris Saint-Germain. An altogether more impassioned reception can be expected if Roberts braves the streets of Cardiff between now and Friday night. The 28-year-old is at the heart of head coach Warren Gatland’s plan for the RBS 6 Nations opener against England and Welsh expectations are high for the dress rehearsal for September’s World Cup Pool A match. Jamie Roberts poses for a photo in the Place du Trocadero, in front of Paris' Eiffel Tower . Roberts (centre) will be part of Wales' team to face England in the Six Nations opener on Friday night . Roberts (second right) dives desperately to stop England's Chris Ashton when the sides met in March 2013 . ‘It’s going to be a game of chess,’ says the Racing Metro centre. ‘It’s going to be really intriguing to see how we approach the game and find each other out. Ultimately, it’s 80 minutes of complete warfare. When you’ve played against England, it’s serious, car-crash stuff — hugely physical — and it’s a battle royal for us.’ Over a coffee and a pizza in Paris’s 16th arrondissement, Roberts talks up the buzz of a Test week back home, singling out the 30-3 victory over England in 2013 as his stand-out memory in a Wales jersey. He recalls the moment five minutes before full-time when he turned to winger Alex Cuthbert and said: ‘Mate, tonight’s going to be big,’ as well as the pride of playing in front of family members and childhood friends. ‘It was a magnificent day,’ says Roberts. ‘You grow up loving the rivalry between England and Wales, in whichever sport. It’s not hatred, that’s taking it a bit far, but there’s a certain loyalty to your Welsh mates. The history is there and that makes the occasion so special. You revel in it.’ Twelve of the starting XV who played in that Test against England have been named in the line-up for Friday’s kick-off. There is a feeling of familiarity when Roberts returns to camp in the Vale of Glamorgan, particularly when the squad is blessed with a clean bill of health as it is for this year’s competition. Wales and Racing Metro centre Roberts smiles as he poses during a photoshoot in the French capital . Wales trained at the Vale Hotel this week in preparation for Friday's showdown at the Millennium Stadium . Roberts puts in a tackle on England's Manu Tuilagi during 2013's RBS 6 Nations match in Cardiff, Wales . It is a stark contrast to the situation at Pennyhill Park, where a growing injury list has left the England camp scratching heads over a few new combinations. ‘Experience counts for more than a settled squad,’ says Roberts. ‘Having players with 30 or 40 caps is worth a lot in a World Cup year because these games are of big importance. It’s key that we don’t freeze, and Test experience counts for a lot. ‘It buys you an extra second on the ball and lets you read things a bit quicker in defence. If you’ve got 14 or 15 guys who have been through that together — experienced wins and losses together — it stands you in good stead. ‘Jonathan Davies and I have the record centre partnership for Wales and we know each other’s game inside out. That gives you confidence going into any game. ‘The fact that England maybe haven’t worked out their combination gives you a bit of a lift, but it can also prove to be dangerous. That uncertainty, players fighting for positions, can be a wonderful thing.’ Roberts described taking on England as like '80 minutes of warfare', calling it a 'Battle Royal' The Wales centre (left) shares a joke with team-mate Jake Ball during Wales' open training session . Both Roberts and Davies now play in France’s Top 14, although they struggled initially after making the switch. Large budgets in the French league mean bigger squads, and playing opportunities are subsequently limited. There were reports near the end of 2014 suggesting Roberts wanted to return to Cardiff Blues but he insists he wants to see out his contract and is looking forward to working alongside big-money signing Dan Carter next season. Roberts lives in an apartment on the Left Bank of the Seine with morning training a 25-minute scooter ride out of town. It is a cosmopolitan lifestyle for the qualified doctor, who admits he misses the mental challenge of the medical studies that he completed in 2013. Racing have been doing well domestically and in the Champions Cup, with the Parisians beating Northampton convincingly at Franklin’s Gardens last week. Roberts came out on top in his run-out against Luther Burrell, the Saints and England centre. As defensive captain for both club and country, he is responsible for setting the line-speed and ensuring his team-mates stick to pattern. Warren Gatland (centre) has been preparing his team for a huge Six Nations tie against England on Friday . Roberts laughs as he throws the ball during Wales Wednesday training session at the Vale Hotel . The rush defence takes a well-weighted pass or an elusive running line to undo — which England may find difficult with their new combinations. In attack, Roberts is at the heart of the physical ‘Warrenball’ approach. It is hard-hitting and often criticised for being belligerent, but it is becoming an increasingly common Test strategy. ‘It’s about balance,’ says Roberts. ‘Being able to play on the front foot is so valuable in international rugby. My role is to get defences back-pedalling, to give us more time in attack. ‘Rugby is about going forward and it will never change. With the space that is afforded to you, that’s normally through the heart of teams, rather than around them. ‘The game isn’t like it was in the Sixties when you passed the ball to the winger and he scored in the corner off first phase. ‘You have to go forward and look at weak spots, which a lot of the time are in the opposition 10 channel. That’s where we like to play the game.’ Roberts will be sent down the channel of England fly-half George Ford on Friday night; that much is no secret. It has all the makings of a happy homecoming.","Wales play England at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Friday night .

"Amid all the thunder in Cardiff on Friday night, England believe they can unleash a lightning bolt. Jonathan Joseph has been recalled to electrify the visitors’ attack in midfield. The Bath centre will provide Stuart Lancaster’s side with something different, of that there can be no doubt. Alongside him, Luther Burrell of Northampton will attempt to take on the Wales centres Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies at their own game of power-running and off-loading, but Joseph is the X-factor addition. Jonathan Joseph is pictured by Sportsmail ahead of England's Six Nations clash with Wales this Friday . Joseph was all smiles when he spoke to Sportsmail's Chris Foy earlier this week . The Bath centre will provide Stuart Lancaster's side with a real injection of pace on Friday . Friday will see England’s 11th centre combination since Stuart Lancaster took over the reins as head coach. Lancaster’s favourite pair is Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt, who is the most frequently selected centre (19). His selection for a first Test appearance since June 2013 is reward for consistently outstanding club performances this season. Last month, the 23-year-old demonstrated his match-winning credentials with a masterclass in Toulouse capped by a stunning act of sorcery to conjure a bonus-point try for his team. The slaloming break which followed a clever little kick into space was a vivid example of his ability to shred defences and it helped to propel him into England’s starting XV, confirmed on Thursday for their RBS 6 Nations opener at the Millennium Stadium. Lancaster will hope Joseph offers an alternative to the route-one approach. Roberts, Davies and Burrell will set out to batter the defensive ramparts, while the man in the white No 13 shirt will seek to circumvent them. George Ford, the man charged with igniting the English attack from fly-half, knows all about the qualities offered by his back-in-favour Bath colleague and he offered an emphatic endorsement. ‘He’s been brilliant, especially this year with his communication,’ said Ford. ‘In attack, he has been world-class and his defence has been brilliant as well; he leads that at the club. George Ford - speaking to the media on Wednesday - has heaped praise on Bath team-mate Joseph . The fly-half is pictured in training for England during a session at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday . Five things to know about England centre Joseph . 'JJ always has that ability to create something out of nothing with an outside break or he off-loads with one hand — and like you saw against Toulouse, his little kick through to create that try. ‘There aren’t many players who can create things like that. He offers something different with his speed, his agility and his outside break. It is our job to get him into the right positions to do that. ‘He always wants the ball in his hands in attack, but he is also good at things people don’t see, like his kick-chase and his communication about when to kick and so on. 'To get the opportunity to play with him on Friday is exciting.’ Ford played down the significance of Joseph’s tour de force in Toulouse, on the basis that he has been hitting such heights all season. ‘He was brilliant that day,’ said Ford, ‘but he has been playing like that all year. The try he created sticks out but he’s been making line-breaks all year. 'He has been defensively solid and making good hits all year, too. He has definitely earned his start on Friday.’ Joseph was reluctant to bang his own drum, but admitted that the performance in Toulouse ‘probably helped’ his claims for a Test return. He has been more satisfied with his improvements in less eye-catching aspects of the game. Defence has been one such area of development and communication another. ‘You just have to be loud. It is an area of my game that has got a load better. I think it does help the fly-halves if you have another voice outside them telling the right options and where the space is. I think that’s worked very well with me and George at Bath.’ In an interview with Sportsmail last month, the former London Irish player said he would always stay true to his instincts to seek space rather than try to be something he is not, a crash-ball carrier aiming to force his way over the gainline. Now that he is back in the England team he is optimistic that he will be given the licence to cut loose when the chance arises. Asked if the coaches will allow him to play to his strengths, he said: ‘I think they’ll have to...it’s a game of rugby and if the right decision is to run, we’ll run. ‘We have to be smart and do it in the right areas, but there’s no reason with turn-over ball, if there is the opportunity, that we can’t run the ball. It’ll be great if we can really attack it and take it to them.’ As a player who grew up idolising the likes of Brian O’Driscoll and Jason Robinson, there was never any doubt that Joseph would emerge as a free spirit and that attitude was apparent in his hopes for this high-stakes game. England attack coach Mike Catt (left), talks to England centre pairing Luther Burrell (middle) and Joseph . Burrell (left) passes the ball during England's training session on Thursday . ‘We have a mind-set to play,’ he said. ‘If we have a chance to play and it is on, we’ll play. We don’t want to waste opportunities. We are playing for a reason — we want to be challenging defences.’ England head coach Lancaster echoed Ford in extolling Joseph’s virtues as a back-line co-ordinator who can take some of the load off the primary playmaker. Lancaster has picked him as the form option at No 13 — in the absence of the injured Manu Tuilagi — and must hope that Burrell can return to the peaks of his early-season displays, before a mini-dip last month. Elsewhere, the case for the return of Tom Youngs, Nick Easter and Tom Croft among the replacements was made on the basis of their collective experience, which will be so vital amid the maelstrom of a Test in Cardiff. The same could be said for James Haskell, who is back in the starting back row at blindside flanker. England are much changed, but scarcely weakened.

"A new series of images provide food-for-thought when it comes to the future of some of America's most populated coastal towns.

San Francisco, becomes consumed by the very bay it is constructed next to. Venice Beach resembles scenes from Venice, Italy as the Pacific Ocean slowly deluges the trendy Los Angeles neighborhood.

It could take several centuries for sea . levels to rise to that level but artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm hopes his work will raise public . awareness about the very real threat of global warming today. Mr Lamm used data and methods from Climate Central, an independent organization of leading scientists and journalists researching and reporting the facts about the changing climate and its impact on the American public. Nickolay interpreted Climate Central's sea level rise maps and flood elevation formula to arrive at these images . 'Sea . level rise that makes cities uninhabitable is not going to happen in . our lifetime, but, it is going to happen sooner or later unless we cut . carbon emissions. Our first sea level rise project covered only East . Coast cities. I felt it would be fitting to bring attention to sea level . rise on the West Coast as well,' he says.

"A man's body has been found in his home after it lay undiscovered there for four years following his suicide. David Carter, who neighbours said was well-liked, told friends he was moving from his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to New Mexico in 2007. A real estate worker who went into his suburban home to repossess it last week - after bank officials finally realised he hadn't paid the bill for four years - and found his remains. He is believed to have shot himself with a handgun. The body of David Carter was found in his house and is thought to have killed himself in 2007 . The employee of the Milwaukee County treasury office- who entered his home in the West Allis neighborhood in order to start the repossession process- found Mr Carter's 'nearly skeletonized' remains on his stairway, a gunshot in his head, and a handgun on his chest. No bill or income tax has been paid by Mr Carter since late 2007, so that is the approximate date-of-death that officials have given him, but there is no way to be exact. 'We're trying to figure it out, too. How could it go this far?' said local government worker Michael Czaplewski. 'It's one of those things where it falls between the cracks, I guess,’ he told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel. Unexpected: The city of Milwaukee mowed his lawn and shovelled his snow since he went missing, and sent bills totalling $37,000 for the services that went unpaid . Though Mr Carter clearly did not maintain the house, the city took it upon themselves to shovel and mow his lawn through the years and then charged him for those services; his bill is now $37,000 for the years of maintenance. Mr Carter, whose 45th birthday would have been January 23 of this year, lived and studied in Milwaukee, and school records show him attending the local high school and earning a college degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As an only child raised by a single mother, Mr Carter had few close relatives after his mother died following a battle with cancer in 1997. Mr Carter's cousin, Kevin O'Neill, said that he became emotionally withdrawn and began drinking heavily after his mother's death. His remains were found last week when a city employee came to the house to start the foreclosure process . In spite of his grief, he moved on to work as a nuisance control officer for the city of Milwaukee from 1999 to 2007. He resigned from that job in September 2007 and said he was planning to move to Albequerque, and then he disappeared. 'The people closest to him knew he moved so nobody ever did bother to think that anything was wrong with him,' said his high school friend Teresa Bornheimer. Since his body was found, more details are being discovered as people try to understand how he could have been dead in his own house for four years without anyone noticing. Medical records show that he was listed as the father of a girl who is now 14 years old. He and the mother never married and the mother, whose name has not been released, said that the last time she saw him was in 2006. Certain: His 'nearly skeletonized' body was identified using dental records . Though he clearly was not a constant part of the girl's life, he did keep her in his thoughts as investigators found a note which had a list of his possessions that he bequeathed to her. 'My jaw just dropped when I found out. I told myself maybe it's a bum living at the house,' said Ms Bornheimer. The decomposed body was identified as Mr Carter using dental records. The profits from the sale of his house, which originally belonged to his mother, will go to the county but because of the discovery that he had a daughter, she could likely challenge the county for the profits.","David Carter, who would have been 45 this January, quit his job and told friends he was moving to New Mexico in late 2007 .

"Diversity: Malcolm Gillies, Vice Chancellor of London Metropolitan University, said students' values were changing . A university is considering ending the sale of alcohol on campus due to concerns from Muslim students. London Metropolitan University could take action because a ‘high percentage’ of its students thought drinking was ‘immoral’, according to its vice chancellor. Professor Malcolm Gillies raised the prospect of an alcohol-free campus after gauging the changing values from the influx of new students. He said it would be unwise to ‘cling’ to a ‘nostalgic' view where the vast majority wanted alcohol to be available and instead take account of diverging views. He told MailOnline: ‘I was raising the issue of changing values in student populations and the question of how a responsible university responds. ‘London Metropolitan University is a highly diverse university ethnically and in religious terms. ' 'Our students come from all over the world and they come with changing balance of values. ‘So the issue of how we cater for those values while still remaining true to being a British university is one of the constant issues any responsible university would be considering. ‘We do have a high percentage of Muslim students – we estimate it may be around 20 per cent for our university. 'And therefore as most Muslims do look on drink as something which isn’t an acceptable part of everyday life, seeing how do we provide an environment that can respect that, while also respecting values of people such as me who do drink, and who believe drink in moderation is acceptable part – in fact sometimes a good part - of a social community.’ Sensitivity: The Rocket Complex, one of London Metropolitan University's two bars, could be alcohol free as the institution attempts to respect the changing values of students . Professor Gillies first raised the subject during a speech to the Association of University Administrators' annual conference in Manchester on 3 April. London Metropolitan University was founded in 2002 - an amalgamation of two longstanding institutions, the University of North London and the London Guildhall University. It has around 30,000 students from 190 countries who attend campuses in north London, on Holloway Road, and the City near Aldgate East, Tower Hill and Liverpool Street tube stations. He added: ‘Here’s the problem for London. The majority of our students in London primary schools now have a home language other than English – in other words they come from a very diverse ethnic base. ‘As we go through the next 10 or 20 years in London, we are going to find these cultural values and their differences become more and more important in society.’ Professor Gillies said he would work with the student body to move towards having areas on campus where ‘one serves alcohol and others don't’, but could foresee a time when the university was an alcohol-free zone. He added: 'That's what education's actually about, modeling diverse behaviours so we create liberal students in a liberal intellectual environment.' He questioned whether the university should subsidise student bars, although it was not an issue he felt ‘too strongly’ about, adding: 'This is about how best you use limited resources to cater to the broadest range of students'.","University is trying to be sensitive to views of its 30,000 students - 20 per cent of whom are Muslim ."
"A University admin worker has been jailed for eight months after admitting stealing £50,000 and spending it on holidays and tea at the Ritz. Sophie O'Hara, 27, used her position in the science department at the University of East Anglia to sign fake student expenses slips which she then cashed into her own account. Over the course of 17 months O'Hara stole a total of £50,504 which she spent on trips to Egypt, Florida and Madrid as well as an afternoon tea at the Ritz with her mother. Sarah O'Hara used her job as an admin worker in the science department at the University of East Anglia to steal £50,000 by writing out false student expenses claims and cashing them herself . As part of her job O'Hara, who was paid £16,000  year, was charged with signing off expense forms for students. Chris Youell, prosecuting, said O'Hara wasn't a qualified accountant but was in a position of great trust and was authorised to sign for large sums of money. When university staff discovered O'Hara had been paying funds into her own account, Mr Youell said she admitted what she'd done. He added: 'She was, however, somewhat surprised and upset as to how much money she had stolen.' O'Hara admitted one charge of theft of cash from the UEA between March 2012 and October 2013 and was jailed for eight months. O'Hara then spent the money on holiday to Egypt, Florida, and Madrid as well as  tea at the Ritz with her mother . Today at Norwich Crown Court (pictured) she was jailed for eight years after admitting one charge of theft of cash between March 2012 and October 2013 . Michael Clare, defending, said she suffered from a form of bipolar disorder but added: 'She does not want to use her difficulties as an excuse. 'She is very sorry indeed. She is unlikely to offend again.' Jailing her at Norwich Crown Court today, Judge Anthony Bate said: 'It went undiscovered for some considerable time. 'You appear to have spent the money on luxuries and foreign holidays and the like.' The judge accepted O'Hara had 'mental health issues' but said they didn't excuse he conduct and said he would be failing in his public duty if he did not jail her.","Sophie O'Hara worked as an admin assistant at University of East Anglia .

"Heartless: Australian, Ryan Jake Lambourn has created a furious reaction from families of those killed in the Sandy Hook massacre by creating a video game in which the player can reenact the shooting and also made a Virginia Tech game in 2007 . The Australian man who sparked international fury after he developed a game in which players can reenact the Sandy Hook massacre in which 20 children were slaughtered was also behind a sick Virginia Tech simulation in 2007. Ryan Jake Lambourn, caused a similar level of disgust when he built the game, V-Tech Rampage, which allowed players to re-create the mass campus shooting carried out by Cho Seung-hui which killed 32 students. That game caused anger worldwide too, and in an outrageous interview given at the time clearly designed to shock, Lambourn described himself as a 'heartless b*****d', who was 'perfectly content laughing at the (sic) hypocracy of everyone and taking my title as troll of the year'. In the interview, published on video-game website destructoid.com, a remorseless Lambourn, then aged 21, admitted that he meant the game to be offensive 'so me and my friends and people like me and my friends could have a laugh.' Showing a shocking lack of awareness towards the feelings of the families who lost loved ones that day in Virginia, Lambourn claimed he enjoyed laughing at those upset at V-Tech Rampage, even appearing proud of that fact. Defending the appalling timing of the game so soon after the massacre, Lambourn said that he didn't care if the families were not ready to see it, saying that 'i don't see that as my need to wait for them to build up a tolerance to pain.' Appearing to only want to get a reaction from his interviewer, Lambourn makes the galling claim that his video simulation of a mass murder is in fact art - claiming that attacking people online, or trolling, 'is an art in itself.' V-Tech Rampage is a controversial amateur action computer game that re-creates the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. The game was created by  Ryan Lambourn . Asked finally if he has anything to say to those who hated his game, Lambourn simply tells them to 'Do a barrel roll'. This past week, Lambourn has attempted to defend his Sandy Hook game, entitled 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary', to the mother of one of the victims. Ryan Jake Lambourn, 27, told Donna Soto, whose daughter Victoria, 27, died shielding her students from Adam Lanza's bullets that the game was to highlight the importance of gun control. Asking Lambourn on Twitter why he had created the game, Donna Soto was gifted withering answers, including one sarcastic reply in which he told her he would 'crib note' the point, which was 'gun control'. Lambourn's game has caused an eruption of rage from the families of those involved in the massacre, who have said the game has caused them 'deep anger and fury'. Police officers gather in front of McBryde Hall on the campus of Virginia Tech University after a shooting left at least 32 dead April 16, 2007 in Blacksburg, Virginia . The simulation allows players to re-enact the terrible day of the shooting on December 15 last year where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut. The game, which has already been taken down by one website where it was posted, allows users to 'shoot mother', collect ammunition and move through the school firing weapons. Six years after his Virginia Tech game, the Australian posted a justification on his website for the Sandy Hook simulation, claiming that the game is designed to highlight the difference between Australian gun culture and American - which he says has spiraled out of control. 'I grew up in Houston, Texas, where I remember guns and ammunition being available in unmanned sections of Wal-Mart and it being commonplace to hear gunshots in the distance as I tried to go to sleep, which is a stark contrast to Sydney, Australia, where I moved to in 2001,' Lambourn says in an audio message in the credits to the game. A video game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused pain and outrage among families of victims and survivors . 'Australia had sweeping gun control put into place after the 1996 Port Arthur Massacre in which 35 people died, and the result of that sweeping regulation is that guns are no longer a noticeable part of Australian culture. Guns are practically non-existent here. 'Back in America … all these massacres don’t seem to have had any similar effect on regulation. Instead, gun control and enforcement have steadily loosened,' he said in his message. 'And here we are, nearly a year after the Sandy Hook shootings … and absolutely nothing positive has come out of it.' This explanation has not been sufficient for the families of those who lost their lives in Sandy Hook. Donna Soto asked Lambourn on Monday, 'how playing a game that recreates how Vicki died would be beneficial? Please tell us,' the family's tweet read. Withering: The official Twitter account for the family of victim Vicki Soto got shirt thrift from Lambourn when they asked him to clarify why he had created such a controversial game . Lambourn, who claims to be based in Sydney, Australia, replied: 'sure, but you'd learn more by 'playing it.' 'It’s absolutely disgusting that somebody thinks this is funny,' said Donna Soto, whose late daughter, Victoria, 27, was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal for shielding her students from the gunfire during the rampage. 'We’re all suffering. All the families are suffering. We’re coming up on December. My daughter’s birthday just passed. It just adds insult to the suffering that we’re dealing with. It’s just incomprehensible that someone would think this kind of thing is wanted.' But it is not just the families that Lambourn claims have attacked him. On his Twitter page, the game designer said that he has faced the fury of almost everyone. Gone but not forgotten: An aerial photo showing demolition work near completion at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut last week. The decision was taken to raze the building after the shooting massacre last December . 'The liberals don't like me because I've disrespected the dead. The conservatives don't like me because of the gun-control message. The conspiracy theorists don't like me because it risks informing people of what happened. And the trolls don't like me because it wasn't edgy enough,' he wrote on Twitter. Lambourn also tweeted a screen grab of an email he claims to be from NRA Assistant General Counsel Michael Blaz which demands that he remove a link to the NRA site on the info page of his 'vile' game. Lambourn responded by saying, 'I regret to inform the NRA, it’s impossible to undo what’s been done,' along with a profane remark. U.S. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) told the Hartford Courant the game was 'absolutely sickening' and called its creator 'very disturbed.'","Ryan Jake Lambourn has caused fury with his Sandy Hook video game in which players can reenact the massacre in which 20 children and six teachers died .

"A young British woman travelling alone in India has been stabbed to death in an apparent drug-fuelled frenzy. A fellow tourist has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The body of Sarah Groves, 24, was found in a pool of blood inside her cabin on a houseboat on Lake Dal, in the picturesque town of Srinagar in Kashmir. Sarah Groves was found stabbed to death on a boathouse in Kashmir. Her boyfriend confronted her alleged killer, who has reportedly confessed to the crime . Discovered: Police have said the 24-year-old was found inside the boat this morning on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir . Arrested: Dutch national Richard de Wit, was arrested about 45 miles from the scene of the suspected murder . Scene: The houseboat where the body of Sarah Groves was found in Srinagar today . Police said her body was discovered with multiple stab wounds and with a knife lying beside her in the early hours of yesterday. A 43-year-old Dutch tourist is being questioned by police. The man, named locally as Richard De Wit, is reported to have fled the scene in a small boat which capsized in the lake, forcing him to swim to the shore. He was arrested in the town of Qazigund, 45 miles south of Srinagar, in wet clothes and without shoes. He was carrying his passport. It is believed that Miss Groves travelled to Srinagar two months ago, intending to stay there for just four days. But she decided to remain longer, renting a cabin at the New Beauty houseboat. De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three days ago, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves. They were the only two tourists staying on the boat. Miss Groves, left, was staying in the cabin next to Richard de Wit, pictured in a Facebook photo (right) Inside: A pair of shoes (left) belonging to the 24-year-old woman from Guernsey are pictured on the houseboat in Srinagar . It is believed that Miss Groves travelled to Srinagar two months ago, intending to stay there for just four days . A policeman stands outside the houseboat, New Beauty. Sarah, a qualified fitness instructor had gone travelling in Africa and Asia after attending Chelsea College of Art and Design . A Kashmir police source claimed that on Friday night De Wit smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned to his cabin after midnight. He reportedly became paranoid that Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife. The houseboat's owner, Abdul Rahim Shoda, said that he and his son discovered Miss Groves's body at about 2.30am yesterday. ""I informed the local police station about the incident. Later, I rushed to the tourist police. When I was coming out of the tourist police station, I asked an auto driver whether he has seen any foreigner. ""He told me that he has seen a 7-feet tall foreigner, who was without shoes and in wet clothes, boarding a Jammu-bound vehicle. I took the number of the vehicle from him and handed it over to the police,"" Shoda said. He said that his son, Samir, heard screams from the houseboat and went to investigate. He is said to have seen De Wit flee in the boat. Senior police officer Abdul Ghani Mir said: 'The Dutch national had fled from the houseboat in the night, leaving behind his belongings. He was trying to flee from the valley.' Sarah Groves was allegedly stabbed to death on Dal Lake, a popular tourist destination . Owner: One of the sons of the boathouse owner Abdul Rahim Shoda (pictured) is also helping police with the inquiries, although he has not been arrested, according to reports . Shoes: An Indian policeman stands guard on a houseboat near a pair of shoes (left) belonging to Sarah Groves . It was reported that police also detained Samir Shoda as they suspect that he might have supplied De Wit with cannabis. Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered. Last month, tougher sentences for sexual offences were introduced in India following a national outcry over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi last year. Anyone convicted of rape or murder now faces the death penalty. Since then, two foreign tourists have been attacked. Tribute: Messages of respect have been paid to Sarah on sites including Twitter . Family: The son of the houseboat owner said Sarah had been enjoying her time with the family . Location: Houseboat owner Abdul Rahim Shoda speaks on his mobile phone near the house boat where the body was found . 'Wonderful girl': One of the sons of the owner of the houseboat owner described her as 'a wonderful girl' who had stayed on the boat for the last two months . A Swiss woman was gang-raped last month as she and her husband camped overnight on a cycling holiday in central India. Days later, a British woman jumped two floors from her hotel room south of Delhi to flee an alleged sexual assault. Miss Groves is believed to have been born in Manchester and was living in Guernsey. Her father, Victor, 70, is a retired businessman who ran a string of IT companies in Cheshire before his retirement. On her Facebook page, she has posted photos and messages showing she had been travelling around the world. It is understood that she was due to fly out to Nepal in three days' time from Kashmir. Shocked friends have left messages for Miss Groves on social networking sites. James Blower, a businessman in Guernsey, tweeted: 'Can't believe Sarah Groves is dead. Such a little ray of sunshine and not a bad bone in her body. Taken far too young.' The Foreign Office has confirmed that a British woman has been killed in Srinagar and that it is providing consular assistance to her family.","Sarah Groves, 24, was found dead inside boat on Dal Lake in Srinagar .

"Five men, at lease three of them self-described anarchists, have been arrested in an alleged plot to blow up a bridge near Cleveland, the FBI said today. A member of Occupy Cleveland revealed that . at least some of the suspects had attended the . group's events, sparking concerns that some supporters of the anti-capitalist movement could turn to violence. But there was no danger to the public in the bridge-bombing plot because the . explosive devices were inoperable and were controlled by an undercover . FBI employee, the agency said. Scroll down for video . Charged: Brandon Baxter, Douglas Wright, Anthony Hayne, (from left to right) were arrested on charges of conspiracy and trying to use explosives to damage property affecting interstate commerce . Plotted: Charges were pending against Connor C. Stevens, 20, (left) and Joshua S. Stafford, 23, (right) who were also involved . The target of the plot was Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge, which carries a four-lane highway over part of the Cuyahoga Valley National . Park in the Brecksville area, about 15 miles south of downtown . Cleveland, the FBI said. Authorities said three of the men were arrested Monday and are self-described anarchists, not tied to international terrorism. It was not immediately clear whether the men had attorneys. All of the suspects, ranging in age from 20 to 35, were expected to appear in federal court this afternoon. The FBI said three were arrested on charges of conspiracy and trying to use explosives to damage property affecting interstate commerce. They were identified as Brandon L. Baxter, 20; Douglas L. Wright, 26; and Anthony Hayne, 35. Their hometowns were not provided. Foiled: U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach, left, and FBI special agent in charge Stephen Anthony walk past a map showing the location of a bridge on Ohio Rt. 82 south of Cleveland on Tuesday, May 1, 2012 . Targeted: The target of the plot was the Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge, which carries a four-lane highway over part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in the Brecksville area, about 15 miles south of downtown Cleveland . Charges were pending against the other two men, who have been identified as Connor C. Stevens, 20, and Joshua S. Stafford, 23. Occupy Cleveland media coordinator Jacob Wagner said some group members knew the suspects, but added that the protest group had no knowledge of the alleged plan to blow up the bridge and would denounce such actions. 'Occupy Cleveland has, from the very start, espoused peaceful, nonviolent, direct action,' he said. 'These alleged actions taken by these people were completely autonomous.' The announcement of the arrests came as Occupy demonstrators in other states joined protests marking International Workers Day, or May Day, today. Baxter, Wright and . Hayne allegedly considered different plots over several months, including . distracting law enforcement with smoke grenades while trying to bring . down financial institution signs in downtown Cleveland. They even considered setting off a car bomb outside the Federal Reserve Bank there, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed on Tuesday. Location: The group allegedly conspired to use explosives to destroy the four-lane Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge that crosses a national park, near Cleveland . They also plotted an attack on a center where federal, state and . local authorities coordinate operations and resources, known as a fusion . center. The group . initially came under scrutiny by authorities in October 2011 when the . FBI learned that some self-described anarchists planned to attend a . protest in Cleveland. An . FBI informant saw four of the men going through the crowd expressing . displeasure at demonstrators' unwillingness to engage in violent acts. The men wore masks and carried walkie-talkies, according to the . affidavit. Over . the next several months, the group considered a variety of targets for . attacks including the Group of 8 leaders meeting in Chicago and the . Republican National Convention in Tampa, according to the FBI affidavit. Late last month, the defendants finally settled on blowing up the . bridge, authorities said. Wright told a . confidential source working with the FBI that 'as long as stuff ""gets . f--ked up"" he'll be happy with the action,' the FBI said in its . affidavit filed with the court. Making noise: Activists from Occupy Wall Street gather in New York today to take part in the May Day protests . At one point, Wright expressed concern that the undercover FBI agent who sold them what they believed was powerful C-4 explosives for $900 was a police officer, but he continued with the plot. 'The individuals . charged in this plot were intent on using violence to express their . ideological views,' Special Agent Stephen D. Anthony, who oversees the . FBI's Cleveland division, said in a statement. 'The Joint . Terrorism Task Force will continue to be vigilant in its efforts to . detect and disrupt any terrorism threat, domestic or international.' The group had no ties to foreign . terrorist organizations and the plot was not connected to the . anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was . killed in a raid by U.S. forces a year ago, a U.S. Justice Department . official said today. The undercover operation is the latest of a number of sting operations undertaken by the FBI and Justice Department in an effort to thwart attacks by domestic and foreign militants.

"Dylan Farrow's brother has broken his silence to dismiss claims that his father Woody Allen sexually assaulted her - instead saying that their mother Mia Farrow poisoned their minds against him. 'Of course Woody did not molest my sister,' Moses Farrow, who is estranged from Dylan and Mia Farrow but remains close to his father, told People magazine. Moses, 36, spoke out on Wednesday - four days after Dylan, 28, penned an open letter in the New York Times claiming Allen sexually assaulted her at age seven, reigniting a firestorm of speculation about the nature of the award-winning director's relationships with his children. Dylan has angrily responded to Moses' new claims - including that Mia Farrow hit them - lambasting him for turning against the family, and saying: 'My brother is dead to me.' Speaking out: Moses Farrow, pictured left, dismissed claims made by his sister Dylan, pictured right with her husband, that she was molested by their father Woody Allen when she was seven years old . Former family: Moses is pictured front with baby Dylan in 1986. They are with, from left, their father Woody Allen, brother Fletcher Farrow, Mia Farrow and Mia's daughter Soon-Yi, who Allen went on to marry . Moses, like Dylan, was adopted by . Allen and Farrow, but unlike his sister, he remains close to his father . and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and . another partner. He has not spoken to his mother in years - and blames her for Dylan's claims about sexual assault. 'My . mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the . family and sexually molesting my sister,' he told People magazine. 'And I hated him for her for years. I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.' Moses, . a family therapist, claimed that his sister was also exited to see . Allen when he visited, and only started hiding from him when Mia Farrow . successfully began turning her children against him. He added that, on the day Dylan claims she was sexually assaulted by Woody, no one went into separate rooms and 'my mother was conveniently out shopping'. Former family: Dylan Farrow, left, as a child with Woody Allen and her mother, Mia Farrow . Close: Dylan Farrow, who now lives in Florida under a different name, remains close with her mother, Mia Farrow. They are pictured together in New York City in 2003, when Dylan was 17 . 'I don't know if my sister really . believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,' he added. 'Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her . wrong side was horrible.' He . said that although Mia - who has a total of 14 biological and adopted . children - was portrayed as a caring mother, the reality was quite the . opposite. 'I was often hit as a child,' he claimed, saying her rages were 'intimidating' and 'often horrifying'. Family split: Moses Farrow, in 1992, was adopted in 1980 and he remains close to Allen . Dylan . told People magazine that she was shocked by her brother's claims. She . denied that their mother hit them or coached her to make accusations . against her father. 'This . is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,' she said. 'My memories . are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest . of my life.' She added: 'I will not see my family dragged down like this. I can't stay silent when my family needs me and I will not abandon them like Soon-Yi and Moses. My brother is dead to me.' in response to the firestorm, Mia Farrow, tweeted: 'I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it's about her truth.' The continued swipes on Wednesday came as TMZ unearthed a 1976 interview with People magazine in which Allen described a hypothetical orgy involving him and 15 12-year-old girls. Then 41, Allen said: 'I'm open-minded about sex. I'm not above reproach; if anything, I'm below reproach. I mean, if I was caught in a love nest with fifteen 12-year-old girls tomorrow, people would think, yeah, I always knew that about him.' He added: 'Nothing I could come up with would surprise anyone ... I admit to it all.' Dylan Farrow's gut-wrenching . first-person account, which was published online on Saturday, marked the . first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse. She . explained how, at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led . her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house. Denial: Allen, pictured Monday, has denied the accusations, which he found 'overwhelmingly sad' Defense: In a tweet on Tuesday, Mia Farrow said the issue was not about her relationship with Woody Allen . 'He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow wrote. 'Then . he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering . that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go . to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' Farrow went on to describe how the . award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' would always find . a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like, including . sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her to get into bed with him . and placing his head in her naked lap. 'Anger': Farrow, pictured, and Allen split after she found naked photos he took of another daughter . 'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said. What . followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from . one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again . to see if she was lying. In . the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a . Connecticut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there . was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he . was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state. Farrow and Allen separated after Farrow . found nude photographs that Allen had taken of Farrow's adopted daughter . from a previous relationship, Soon-Yi Previn, when she was 20. Allen, 78, has always denied the . allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan. He was never charged with, or . convicted of, a crime in this case. Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, said the director read the article 'and found it untrue and disgraceful'. Allen, who has stayed largely silent throughout the recent allegations, performed at a jazz concert on Monday in Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel - where he raised eyebrows with his choice of song. He played 'When You're Smiling' - which features in the final credits of 'Mighty Aphrodite', a film with incestuous themes, RadarOnline reported. As he left, one guest told him to 'hang in there', to which he responded: 'I intend to. Thank you.' New life: Allen, 78, is pictured with his wife - and Mia's daughter - Soon-Yi Previn, 43, in 2012 . Denial: Woody Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz told the Today show the filmmaker's adopted daughter only accused him of sexual assault because the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow . On Tuesday, his attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, blamed Mia Farrow for planting stories in Dylan's head. 'I think it's part of Mia Farrow's desire to hurt Woody Allen,' Abramowitz told the Today show. 'His . reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to . Dylan. She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia years ago. The idea that she was molested was implanted in her mind by her mother. '[Dylan]'s not lying, she truly . believes this happened. That's what the vice of this is - when you . implant a story in the mind of a fragile seven-year-old... it never goes . away.' Abramowitz added . that the accusations were resurfacing now, 20 years on, because Allen's . Golden Globe lifetime achievement award had 'revived the anger [Mia . Farrow] has towards him'. Despite Allen's vehement denial, the . accusations have caused outrage and division among Hollywood including . Lena Dunham, who urged her 1.3 million Twitter followers to read . Farrow's letter. 'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Dunham wrote . Spirited: The women of The View talked about the story - with Barbara Walters, right, defending Allen . Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have also been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes . ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's . alleged assault in a scathing tweet. 'Missed . the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly . confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?' the . newly hired MSNBC host wrote. But on Monday, Barbara Walters came to Allen's support on The View. The . 84-year-old co-creator of The View opened the discussion after Whoopi . Goldberg introduced the topic. Walters, a friend of Allen's, pointed out that the statute of . limitations had run out. 'I have rarely seen a father as . sensitive, as loving and as caring as Woody is and Soon-Yi to these two . girls. I don't know about Dylan. I can only tell you what I have seen . now,' Walters said.","Moses Farrow has broken his long silence to lambast his estranged mother for 'poisoning' her children against Woody Allen .

"Britain was yesterday threatened with having to quit the European Union if it refuses to 'kowtow' to Strasbourg's human rights judges. The warning was delivered by the new head of the European Court of Human Rights, amid an increasing determination among Tory Cabinet ministers to leave its jurisdiction. Judge Dean Spielmann, from Luxemburg, also insisted that ministers had a duty to grant the vote to prisoners. Threat: The warning was delivered by Judge Dean Spielmann, from Luxemburg, amid an increasing determination among Tory Cabinet ministers to leave its jurisdiction . His intervention once again puts the unelected court on a collision course with Westminster. Technically, the EU and the European Court of Human Rights are separate institutions, with the ECHR overseen by the 47-member Council of Europe. But Mr Spielmann opted to combine two of the most explosive issues in British politics by saying that, if we want to leave the court, we may also have to exit the EU. His logic was that quitting the court would mean also exiting the Council of Europe. He added no state had ever been a member of the EU without first joining the council. Mr Spielmann said: 'That would plainly be a political disaster. 'Any member state who would leave the Council of Europe, who would denounce the convention, would lose its credibility when it comes to promoting human rights also in different parts of the world.' Last night, MPs said they would not give in to threats - particularly where they involved Britain's membership of the EU. Different: Technically, the EU and the European Court of Human Rights (pictured, in Strasbourg, France) are separate institutions, with the ECHR overseen by the 47-member Council of Europe . Tory backbencher Dominic Raab said: 'Mr Spielmann had no previous judicial experience before ascending to the heights of this European ivory tower, and it shows. 'The only thing undermining the . credibility of the Strasbourg court are the Mickey Mouse judgments it . spews out. He and the other judges should take a long hard look in the . mirror before complaining about British democracy.' 'If Mr Spielmann thinks threatening to kick us out of the EU is going to persuade anyone in Britain to kowtow to the perverse rulings of the Strasbourg court, he's got another thing coming' Dominic Raab, Tory backbencher . He added: 'If Mr Spielmann thinks threatening to kick us out of the EU is going to persuade anyone in Britain to kowtow to the perverse rulings of the Strasbourg court, he's got another thing coming.' Home Secretary Theresa May has said the UK should consider its relationship with the European court after a string of adverse judgments. These include blocking the deportation of Al Qaeda hate-preacher Abu Qatada and the long-running battle over whether convicts must be allowed to vote. Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, has also discussed walking away from the court. This would allow the final say to rest with Britain's better qualified Supreme Court. Judge Spielmann told BBC Radio Four that all decisions reached by his court must be respected - including prisoner votes. Suggestion: Home Secretary Theresa May has said the UK should consider its relationship with the European court after a string of adverse judgments . This is despite the fact that the democratically-elected Westminster parliament has voted overwhelmingly to keep the ban in place. He claimed: 'A decision of a court must be executed. If a decision is not executed this is a violation of the rule of law which is a basic principle of any democracy'. Quoting a long-standing argument of the . human rights lobby, he said there was a risk that such an attitude would . set a bad example to other member states. He added: 'They might say . ""Well if the UK doesn't comply with our judgments, why should we . comply?"" 'A decision of a court must be executed. If a decision is not executed this is a violation of the rule of law which is a basic principle of any democracy' Judge Dean Spielmann . 'Such an attitude causes real damage to the UK's international reputation, because it undermines the whole system and it causes great damage to the credibility of the UK when it comes to promoting human rights in other parts of the world. The European court has 47 members, many of whom have no prior judicial experience. The court's 'one country, one judge' rule means Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra each have a seat despite their combined populations being smaller than that of the London borough of Islington. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are clear in the view that prisoner voting is a matter for national parliaments to decide.

"'Honeytrap': British professor Paul Frampton . A British scientist is being held in an Argentine jail on suspicion of smuggling cocaine. Professor Paul Frampton, an Oxford graduate, was stopped at an airport in Buenos Aires as he tried to board a plane after police discovered two kilos of the drug in a suitcase. Last night the professor, a former member of the UK Institute of Physics, was facing the nightmare prospect of a 16-year jail sentence if convicted. The scientist, who is 68 and divorced, is said to have told investigators the drugs were planted in the suitcase without his knowledge in a honeytrap sting involving a model he met on the internet. Reports say he claims he flew to Argentina to see his online girlfriend but ended up not meeting her. Instead, a woman purporting to be her agent persuaded him to take the suitcase with him on the understanding that it belonged to the model. He was arrested on January 23 at Ezieza International Airport moments before he boarded a plane to Peru for a second flight to the States. The drugs were in the lining of the suitcase. He has spent the past two months in Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires, scene of the worst jail riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead. Professor Frampton, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, now lives in the United States and teaches physics at the University of North Carolina. Professor Frampton, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, now lives in the United States and teaches physics at the University of North Carolina (pictured) Special scanner: Airport security in Buenos Aires used a device to detect material density and found two kilograms of cocaine found his luggage . He has protested his innocence, saying: ‘I will not be convicted. There is easily enough evidence that I didn’t know there were drugs in the bag, and that will come out.’ But investigators say it is ‘improbable’ that a 68-year-old man ‘with a solid university education’ would agree to carry a suitcase for someone he had not met.

"A breakthrough medication derived from Norwegian seaweed may be an effective treatment for killer genetic disease cystic fibrosis, adding to an armoury of drugs that experts hope will help patients live far beyond their current life expectancy of 40. The active ingredient in the new treatment is a highly purified type of alginate, a carbohydrate found in the walls of sea plants. Research suggests it helps to break down the thick, sticky mucus that characterises cystic fibrosis (CF). Untreated, the mucus leads to problems with digestion and makes the lungs prone to severe bacterial infections – which are ultimately what kill most patients. New hope: The active ingredient in the new treatment is a highly purified type of alginate, a carbohydrate found in the walls of sea plants . Alginate is already used in overthe-counter heartburn remedies like Gaviscon, and as a food thickener. However, in the new drug, OligoG, it undergoes further processing. The drug is inhaled in a similar way to some asthma drugs. A British trial of 26 CF patients found it was safe and caused no side effects. Further study is needed but if it proves positive, the drug could be available within three years. ‘This discovery promises hope to the thousands of families desperate for an effective treatment for CF,’ says Ed Owen, chief executive of UK charity Cystic Fibrosis Trust. ‘Life expectancy has improved in recent years but it’s unacceptable that half of patients still won’t see their 40th birthday.’ The research was revealed last week by manufacturers AlgiPharma, at the European Cystic Fibrosis Society conference in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was carried out in conjunction with hospitals in the UK and Ireland, and was welcomed by doctors. More than 10,000 Britons live with CF, of whom 70 per cent are adults. Currently, their average life expectancy is 41, although 60 years ago, 90 per cent of patients did not live beyond the age of ten. Help for patients: The cystic fibrosis medicine will be ingested using and inhaler . Since then, advances in drugs, improvement in care and, more recently, routine infant screening that picks up the disease within weeks of birth, have transformed life expectancy. Broadly speaking, the disease is caused by a fault in the gene responsible for making specific channels in cell membranes that regulate the transport of fluid in and out of them. This fault leads to blockages in these transport channels – affecting the cells lining mucous membranes in the lungs, digestive system and other organs. Patients rely on an array of treatments to control its complications. OligoG works by binding to calcium found in the mucus of CF patients, which is partly responsible for its abnormal density. This action thins it, meaning it can be brought up. The hope is this will further reduce lung damage and mean fewer infections. It could also mean less dependence on antibiotics, in an age where drug-resistant bacteria is a growing concern. OligoG is ‘a unique drug and the first that works in this way’, says Anna Ermund, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg involved in its development. In 2012 another drug, Kalydeco, heralded a new era of treatment, tackling the disease on a genetic level rather than fire-fighting complications such as infections as they arise. It was said to be one of the most expensive drugs ever, costing each US patient around £180,000 a year, although the NHS has made a deal with US manufacturer Vertex to pay an undisclosed, lower sum for those British patients currently eligible. Kalydeco dramatically improves lung function but only works in patients with a rare form of CF – fewer than ten per cent of all sufferers. It is also not currently available for those under six. Since the success of Kalydeco there has been a race to find similar drugs that will prove effective in the majority of sufferers. There are six potential medicines currently being trialled with CF patients, and the result of one major trial of Kalydeco used in combination with another drug is anticipated this summer. It is not currently known how much OligoG will cost, but there is hope it may prove especially useful as part of a regime that includes other drugs. Dr Janet Allen, director of research for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, adds: ‘We aren’t talking about a cure, but there is a very real possibility it will soon become a manageable illness, on a par with type 1 diabetes.’","New drug could extend life expectancy for CF patients .

"The NSA is now building a facility that will make it more than seven times the size of the Pentagon, making the secretive compounds the biggest in the country. In addition to building a $1.9billion data center in Utah, crews also started construction on a computing center that is expected to cost $792million near Baltimore. Together, the two facilities total 228 acres, much of which is dedicated to the collection of emails and phone calls that it was recently revealed the NSA stores without an individual knowledge. Information overload: A report in July showed the NSA is doing a lot more than spying on Americans with terrorist connections, perhaps with the help of its $1.7 billion Utah Data Center . More convenient: As opposed to the remote Salt Lake facility, there is also a 28-acre facility owned by the NSA that in outside of Baltimore, Maryland . Outnumbered: The two NSA sites are now more than seven times the size of the Pentagon . Much attention has been paid to the secretive practices of the NSA since consultant Edward Snowden leaked classified documents proving that the intelligence agency had free reign to the electronic footprint of people, both in and out of the country, who used certain phone carriers. NSA official Harvey Davis told Defense One that the Utah facility is 'only brick and mortar' but they need the space because 'it's required to be big' as a result of their growing surveillance. 'I think we're crossing into content,' he told the site. Mike Baker, a former cover field operations officer for the CIA, told Fox News that the paranoia surrounding the billion dollar project was understandable yet exaggerated, adding that the main problem was the size of the data collection warehouse. More:The Utah Data Center, near Bluffdale, was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the NSA was stored . Storage: An aerial photograph shows the center . 'The fact that they’re building a new data center isn’t news,' Baker told Fox News. 'They’ve got several other [similar] facilities. The size of this is what is creating the stir.' Once built, the million square foot centre will be more than five times the size of the US Capitol, and will use an estimated $40m of electricity every year, according to one estimate. NSA public information officer Vanee' Vines added: 'Many allegations have been made about the planned activities of the Utah Data Center . 'What it will be is a state-of-the-art facility designed to support the Intelligence Community’s efforts to further strengthen and protect the nation. NSA is the executive agent for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will be the lead agency at the center.' Mystery: A close-up section of NSA's Utah Data Center is shown in Bluffdale in July . Powerhouse: These images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers, as well as data from companies including Facebook and Google . The Utah Data Center which is being constructed on Camp Williams on the Salt Lake-Utah County line will be completed in October - but officials have been tight-lipped about what will be stored there. The spy center is being built at an estimated cost of $1.9billion, and is expected to employ 100 to 200 permanent employees after its completion. The plans note they must all be U.S. citizens. In light of the nature of the site they are building, many will have to have a higher degree of security clearance than an average construction worker. Despite the boom for the local economy, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah has expressed their fears over what will be stored at the center. Stash: The government has been tight-lipped about what will be stored in the center's four 'data halls' Plans: Sketches released by Army engineers show the massive center, which is believed to cost $1.7 billion . 'We're mining data, we're gathering data and it's all done secretly,' ACLU of Utah director Karen McCreary told Fox13. 'We don't even know what's going on.'

"This weekend's Premier League action begins with the small matter of the north London derby on Saturday lunchtime, a fiery fixture made even more important with Tottenham and Arsenal both battling for fourth place. Spurs will undoubtedly call on the in-form Harry Kane at White Hart Lane, but another of Mauricio Pochettino's strikers can also stake a strong claim for a starting place against the Gunners. Emmanuel Adebayor, who almost joined West Ham on transfer deadline day, has scored more goals in north London derbies than any other player, beating the likes of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry and former Spurs favourite Gareth Bale. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tottenham vs Arsenal preview: Stats, facts and betting . Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has scored more goals in north London derbies than any other player . Adebayor's last goal against his former club Arsenal came in a 5-2 defeat at the Emirates in November 2012 . The striker, pictured scoring against Tottenham in 2008, netted eight goals against his current employers . Booed by some Tottenham fans in recent weeks, Adebayor wasn't even on the bench for last Saturday's 3-0 win at West Brom. But, having netted 10 goals in the fixture - eight of which have come in the Premier League - the statistics suggest that Pochettino should at least consider a recall for the out-of-favour forward. Adebayor, who played for Arsenal between 2006 and 2009, scored six top-flight goals against his current employers and another two in cup competitions before leaving for big-spending Manchester City in a £25million deal. He joined the Gunners' arch rivals Tottenham on loan two years later and made the move permanent in 2012, scoring twice against Arsene Wenger's men during that time. His last goal in the north London derby came at the Emirates in November 2012 when he opened the scoring before being sent off in the 18th minute for a wild tackle on Santi Cazorla. Arsenal went on to win the game 5-2. Adebayor's form in the fixture means that he is also the top scorer when it comes to Premier League games only, beating former Gunners midfielder Robert Pires by a single strike. Ex-Manchester City man Adebayor celebrates his first goal for Spurs against rivals Arsenal in February 2012 . Robert Pires, pictured scoring against Tottenham in April 2004, scored seven goals in north London derbies . Gareth Bale scores one of his five goals against Arsenal by beating goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny in 2013 . The Frenchman bagged seven goals during his six-year stint under Wenger, two more than his compatriot Henry, Real Madrid star Bale and former team-mate Robin van Persie. Five players have hit four goals in the fervent fixture - Freddie Ljungberg, Rafael van der Vaart, Patrick Vieira, Theo Walcott and Ian Wright. The form of Arsenal's players in front of goal has meant Tottenham have kept just one clean sheet in their last 32 Premier League north London derbies, a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane in February 2009. Defender Emmanuel Eboue saw red in the first half that day but the Gunners held on to claim a point, despite the best efforts of Robbie Keane on his second debut for the club. That match was one of 18 Premier League games between the two clubs to have ended in a draw, making it the most drawn fixture in the history of the competition. Wenger, who took charge at Highbury in 1996, has overseen the majority of those games but there has been notably less stability at Spurs, who have had 12 permanent managers during the Frenchman's reign. Tottenham's last clean sheet against Arsenal came in February 2009 as Emmanuel Eboue (right) saw red . Ray Parlour (left) tussles with Sol Campbell in 1995 - the last year Tottenham finished above Arsenal . Tottenham have had 12 permanent managers during Arsene Wenger's 18-year reign at Arsenal . The 65-year-old faced his 11th Tottenham manager as his side drew 1-1 with Pochettino's men back in September, while he didn't get the chance to take on Jacques Santini in 2004 as the ex-Lyon boss resigned after just 13 games in charge. Wenger has come under pressure for a shortage of silverware in recent years but he has ensured local bragging rights have remained with Arsenal fans at the end of each of his seasons in charge. Tottenham last finished above the Gunners way back in 1995 when ending the season in seventh place left them five positions better off than caretaker Stewart Houston's side. Bruce Rioch reversed the trend during the 1995-96 campaign, leading the Gunners to fifth spot and a UEFA Cup place, before Wenger took charge in October 1996. The former Monaco boss has helped his side finish above Spurs for 18 seasons, giving them a 19-year dominance over their neighbours - an English record for two clubs in the same division.","Tottenham host Arsenal at White Hart Lane on Saturday, kick-off 12.45pm .

"Hotter summers, melting icecaps and intense rainfall are just a few of the effects of global warming. And now scientists claim we can add animal dwarfism to that list. U.S. researchers have found that mammals shrank significantly during at least two ancient global warming events. The finding suggests a similar outcome is possible in response to future climate change. U.S. researchers have found that mammals shrunk significantly during at least two ancient global warming events. This image shows an artist's rendering of the early horse Hyracotherium (right) alongside a modern-day horse . Scientists have known for years that animals such as horses and deer became much smaller during a period of warming, called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). This occurred around 55 million years ago when global temperatures rose by about 6 °C over a period of 200,000 years. Now University of Michigan palaeontologist Philip Gingerich have found evidence that mammalian ‘dwarfing’ also occurred during a separate, smaller global warming event 53 million years ago. Jawbone fossil of the early horse Hyracotherium, collected in the Bighorn Basin region of Wyoming. Researchers found that Hyracotherium body size decreased 19 per cent during a global warming event about 53 million years ago . The work at Michigan University follows a study at the University of Florida and Nebraska which claims global warming could make us shorter. Palaeontologists studying fossilised horses found a direct link between the size of mammals and the planet's temperature - with warmer times meaning smaller beasts. As temperatures went up their size went down, and vice versa, said Dr Jonathan Bloch, curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History. At one point they were as small as a house cat, he said. The researchers say that the current warming could have the same effect on mammals - and may even make humans smaller. ‘The fact that it happened twice significantly increases our confidence that we're seeing cause and effect, that one interesting response to global warming in the past was a substantial decrease in body size in mammalian species,’ said Dr Gingerich, a professor of earth and environmental sciences. Scientists believe a shrinking body size is a common evolutionary response by mammals to extreme global warming events, known as hyperthermals. They claim this may be ‘a predictable natural response for some lineages to future global warming.’ The smaller, later warming event analysed in the latest study, known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2), lasted 80,000 to 100,000 years. Teeth and jaw fossils of early hoofed mammals and primates that spanned this later climatic event were collected in Wyoming's Bighorn Basin, and the size of molar teeth was used as a proxy for body size. The researchers found that body size decreased during the later warming period, but not as much as the dwarfism seen in fossils for the earlier warming event. For example, the study revealed that a lineage of early horses the size of a small dog, called Hyracotherium, experienced a body-size decrease of about 19 per cent during ETM2. The same horse lineage showed a body-size decrease of about 30 per cent during the PETM. The researchers found that body size decreased during the later warming period, but not as much as the dwarfism seen in fossils for the earlier warming event . After both events, the animals rebounded to their pre-warming size. ‘Interestingly, the extent of mammalian dwarfism may be related to the magnitude of the hyperthermal event,’ said team member Abigail D'Ambrosia of the University of New Hampshire. The ancient warming events may have been caused by the release of seabed methane clathrates, a kind of methane ice found in ocean sediments, though this topic remains an area of active research, Dr Gingerich said. The parallels between ancient hyperthermals and modern-day warming make studies of the fossil record particularly valuable, said team member Will Clyde of the University of New Hampshire. ‘Developing a better understanding of the relationship between mammalian body size change and greenhouse gas-induced global warming during the geological past may help us predict ecological changes that may occur in response to current changes in Earth's climate,’ said Mr Clyde.","Early horses shrunk by 19% during warm period 53 million years ago .

"Banned: Jack3d contains a stimulant called DMAA . A sports supplement popular with fitness fanatics has been banned in Britain because of fears it may have lethal side-effects. The drink Jack3D contains a stimulant known as DMAA (dimethylamylamine) that has been linked to high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting, stroke and even a death. The UK’s medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) has ruled it is unlicensed and all other DMAA containing products need to be removed from the market to protect public safety. The decision follows similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online. Jack3d is said to boost energy, concentration and metabolism. But DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA. This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks. An MHRA spokesperson said: 'Jack3d is mainly bought over the internet although it is also available in sports stores specialising in work out products. 'If we find a shop selling it we will send them a written reminder asking them to remove it from their shelves. If they ignore this then our enforcement officers will move in and begin legal action. 'It is the most popular sports supplement in the UK because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer. 'But it is for people who are really into their fitness. Your average person who goes to the gym once or twice a week is unlikely to have ever used it.' The MHRA has already issued eight urgent notices instructing retailers to remove the product and any other DMAA containing products from sale. The MHRA has recently taken action against a number of products presented as sports supplements that fall within the definition of a medicinal product because of the potent herbal ingredients they contained. The chemical ingredient DMAA is also on the prohibited list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency and has been responsible for 137 doping violations worldwide. Jack3d is the most popular sports supplement in the UK because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer . David Carter, manager of the MHRA’s Medicines Borderline Section, said: 'People need to be aware when choosing their sports supplements. These products may claim to increase performance but contain powerful ingredients which can have serious side effects. 'We recommend people only use approved products and speak to a qualified medical practitioner if they have any concerns about any supplements they may be taking.' Relevant companies are advised to remove Jack3D from sale and to take similar action for other products containing DMAA, which is also known by many names including Methylhexanamine, Geranamine, Geranium oil and ‘Cranesbill’. Graham Arthur, director of Legal at UK anti-doping, added: 'This is a significant step forward for all competitive athletes as methylhexaneamine (DMAA) is a banned substance ‘in-competition’ that frequently appears in over the counter and internet bought products but not clearly on the label. 'Athletes who use sports supplements need to choose reputable manufacturers who can justify their claims with scientific evidence, and have their products screened to minimise the risk of testing positive for a substance on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List. 'UK Anti-Doping continues to work closely with the MHRA to protect the health of athletes and to prevent doping in sport.'","Jack3d is mainly bought over the internet although it has been available in some sports stores .

"A playboy Saudi prince with multi-billion pound investments in Britain was today named as the royal robbed by a Kalashnikov-wielding gang in Paris. Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd, 41, was the victim of a movie-style heist at Porte de la Chapelle, in the north of the French capital on Sunday night. His 10-car convoy, including cars full of armed bodyguards, was on the way towards a private jet at Le Bourget airport when it was attacked. Scroll down for video . The Prince was the favoured son of the late King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who died in 2005, but is best known for his high-living lifestyle. He is pictured left in 2003 and right carrying the shrouded body of his father . In what looked like a crime involving inside knowledge, around eight balaclava-wearing thugs forced the lead car to a halt, pointing their guns at their victims. They then made off with a Mercedes van containing more than £200,000 in cash, along with a case full of documents, and medication belonging to the Prince. The Prince, who had just spent almost two months living in a luxury suite at the Four Seasons George V Hotel in Paris, was in a separate chauffeur-driven car. Nobody was injured in the raid. The gang's getaway BMW cars and the Mercedes were later found burnt out nearby, while three of the Prince's kidnapped aides were released. Sources at Le Bourget confirmed that the Prince was on his way to a jet from the Saudi Arabian embassy in Paris. Abdul Aziz Bin Fahd's investments in London include a share in Heron Tower in the City of London, and he is said to have a £4 billion property portfolio in the USA alone. He once left a £60,000 tip during a visit to a trendy restaurant on the Spanish island of Ibiza, and offered a mansion for sale in Kensington Palace Gardens, the so-called 'Billionaire's Row' in west London, for £100million last year.

"British jihadists make up the largest foreign contingent of one of the most violent terrorist groups in Syria, now infamous for beheading, crucifying and stoning to death enemies. Syrian rebel commander Brigadier-General Abdulellah al-Basheer has urged the UK to send weapons to help fight Sunni Islamist group The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Almost two out of three of ISIS' fighters are foreign-born and have chosen to join a group bent on creating an Islamic state in the war-torn country and Iraq. The group is so extreme that it has even been denounced by Al Qaeda. Terrifying: A man believed to have been  crucified by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa . Dangerous: Security forces battle with ISIS members, a group where two out of three fighters are foreign and the largest contingent are from Britain, it has emerged . Earlier this month the Foreign Office said it was investigating into reports that two British nationals died fighting for ISIS. Hundreds of British jihadists have travelled to Syria to fight. Last week Mashudur Choudhury, 31, right, became . the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in . connection with the Syria conflict. The UK’s police counter-terrorism chief Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball has admitted authorities are powerless to stop young Muslims heading to the war-torn state. The Scotland Yard chief said the battle against the Assad regime acts like a ‘magnet’ – and fighters now number in the ‘mid’ rather than ‘low’ hundreds. There is speculation the figure could be as high as 700 as the authorities admit they are struggling to monitor those who are in the Middle East. A national campaign has been launched to urge women to stop their loved ones going to Syria. The mothers, wives and sisters of potential jihadists were asked to contact the police so that officers can intervene. More than 40 people have been arrested for crimes linked to Syria in the first three months of this year, compared to 25 in the whole of 2013.+ . In April prospective Brighton University student Abdullah Deghayes, 18, was killed in a gunfight in Kassab in Latakia. His two brothers, Jaffar, 16, and Amer, 20, remain in Syria. Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years to fight, with an estimated 20 having died. Last week Mashudur Choudhury, 31, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the Syria conflict after he went to the Middle Eastern country with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp last October. In a letter to The Times, General al-Basheer, chief of staff of the supreme military council, the commanding body of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA), which opposes the regime of President Assad, said the 'majority' of ISIS fighters were from the UK, with others from France, Germany and Belgium. He said: 'We, the Syrian people now experience beheadings, crucifixions, beatings, murders, outdated methods of treating women, an obsolete approach to governing society. Many who participate in these activities are British.' The general also called for the British government to send weapons to help deal with ISIS, warning that a failure to act would increase the threat of terrorism in Britain. He said: 'If ISIS is allowed to expand, these terrorists, having put their skills to the test in my country, will return to their homelands, perhaps to the UK, and continue on their pernicious path of destruction... 'We are at a critical juncture in our fight against violent extremism and hope that the UK and US can shrug off their fear of supporting us. A failure to actively support the FSA now will lead to ISIS' successes internationally.' He added: 'The FSA can only go so far with the little we have. The UK and US governments must support us to defeat terrorism in Syria and prevent it from being exported to Europe and the US.' Protests: Mourners chant slogans against the Al Qaeda breakaway group ISIS while carrying a flag-draped coffin of Ahmed Marzouk an Iraqi officer who was killed by them last week . Britain provides non-lethal and technical support such as body armour and communications to moderate Syrian rebels, The Times said, but has ruled out handing over weapons for fear of the falling into the hands of extremists. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has called for a new debate on policy over Syria, saying: 'It's high time that we revisited the issue of Syria in the House of Commons.' An Iraqi policeman inspects the site of a suicide attack carried out by ISIS . ISIS (or ISIL) is a pro-Al Qaeda jihadist group that many feared was taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria. The final letter in the acronym ISIS stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the Levant. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of ISIS's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It took over the city of Al-Reqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control.

The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. Al Qaeda refuse to deal with them. In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by ISIS fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. ISIS also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There has also been friction with other Islamists.

"With Cristiano Ronaldo celebrating his 30th birthday in Madrid, Sportsmail reflects on the forward's illustrious career with a face-morph video showing how his face has changed over the years while chronicling some of his key moments. After graduating from Sporting Lisbon's youth academy in 2002, it took Ronaldo just one season in Portugal's top flight to draw bids from some of European football's elite suitors. In the end it was Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United who won the race to sign the prodigious teenager for a £12.24 million fee, handing him the club's famous number seven shirt. Cristiano Ronaldo's prodigious talent at Sporting Lisbon was soon reognised by Europe's biggest clubs . Ronaldo poses with former team-mate Kleberson, after joining Manchester United for a £12.24m fee . Ronaldo leads the celebrations as The Red Devils retain the Premier League title in the 2007-2008 season . At United, Ronaldo went from strength to strength, maturing from a tricky winger into arguably the most complete forward in the game, prompting Spanish giants Real Madrid to shell out a then world-record £80m to sign him in 2009. Barely fathomable though it is, the player has got even better. Ronaldo has scored 288 goals in 277 games in all competitions for Los Blancos and played a key part in helping the club to 'La Decima' (their tenth European title) last season. Ronaldo is congratulated by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after wining his third Ballon d'Or in January 2015 .

"Whenever Cristiano Ronaldo’s exit from Real Madrid back into the arms of Manchester United has started to look like a possibility in recent years there has always been a minority who have dared to ask: ‘He’s nearly 30 now, would they still want him?’ Now he's turned 30, the age that for so long marked the watershed between a player’s prime and his decline, and yet there are no signs of any slowing down. He was due to take time off from the daily round of 3,000 sit-ups to celebrate with friends and family at his Madrid home in the luxury complex of ‘La Finca’ in the Spanish capital on Wednesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his 30th birthday on Thursday and Real Madrid posted this montage . Ronaldo poses in his new spring/summer CR7 underwear range as the Real Madrid star celebrates turning 30 . Ronaldo shares his February 5 birthday with other notable names from the football world. Cesare Maldini  - Former Italy coach, born 1932. Sven Goran Eriksson  - Former England and Manchester City manager, born 1948. Gheorghe Hagi  - Former Romania and Barcelona striker, now retired, born 1965. Carlos Tevez  - Juventus striker, born 1984. Jordan Rhodes - Blackburn and Scotland striker, born 1990. Neymar - Barcelona and Brazil striker, born 1992. Adnan Januzaj - Manchester United winger, born 1995 . The trappings of superstardom are always in evidence at these events. Last year he hired the magician Dynamo to do a few tricks for his son Ronaldo Jnr. This year DJ Red One had been hired to provide the music and if New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had turned up to get pass the parcel started, no one would have been surprised. Ronaldo has reached levels of global superstardom that would have been difficult to foresee when he first arrived at Old Trafford in 2003. ‘He is the greatest sportsman ever,’ says his agent Jorge Mendes, who this week reminded everyone that his number one client’s buy-out clause is set at £1billion. Yet while some players allow the fame and fortune to diminish their hunger for on-the-field success, Ronaldo seems as intent on setting records and winning trophies at 30 as he was at 20 when he was just two years into that Manchester United career. Ronaldo has been in excellent form for Real Madrid this season, helping them to the top of the league . Ronaldo gets stuck in during training with his Real Madrid team-mates . Manchester United . Premier League: 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09 . FA Cup: 2003–04 . Football League Cup: 2005–06, 2008–09 . FA Community Shield: 2007 . UEFA Champions League: 2007–08 . FIFA Club World Cup: 2008 .

When he picked up his third Ballon d’Or in January there was an: ‘I’m coming for you’ message to Leo Messi who still has one more FIFA World Player award. This year’s challenge is to become one of the first group of players to retain the Champions League. And he is slowly climbing the list of all-time goalscorers at Real Madrid where Raul awaits him at the summit. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo will play at the highest level until he is 40’ Mendes told Spanish radio recently. ‘He will still be scoring 30 goals with his head a season when he is 39 years old. The way he manages his life, what he eats and how he rests is an example to all.’ It is part of Mendes’ job to praise his player but the predictions for the future were intriguingly specific. The mention of 30 ‘headed’ goals perhaps comes from an appreciation that while eventually the blistering pace might fade other qualities will not. He started out as a winger, then became a winger who could play at centre-forward. He could comfortably end up as just an out and out centre-forward, and a formidable one at that. The finisher’s instinct, the precision from penalties and the talent for spectacular free-kicks will all be unaffected by the advancing years. Ronaldo scored against city rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final last season . Ronaldo got his hands on the Champions League for the second time while at Real Madrid . Almost as impressive as the drive to go on improving has been the way he has handled the transition from a star at United to a global icon at Real Madrid. Last year he became the first sportsman to reach 100million fans on his Facebook page as well as over 31m Twitter followers. Back in 2003 when he turned up for his first training session at Manchester United, Mark Zuckerberg was still a year away from launching Facebook, when the fan mail came back then, it came in the post. But in Mendes’ care Ronaldo has proved himself the perfect modern footballer off the pitch as well as on it. Ronaldo celebrates winning the Ballon d'Or for the second successive year . Ronaldo also won the European Golden Boot award in 2014 . A young Ronaldo growing up in Portugal and playing for his first club, Sporting Lisbon . The move to Madrid took the image to another level. The signs were there right from the start when he registered the trademark CR7 before he had even started wearing the No 7 shirt at the Santiago Bernabeu. When Raul left at the end of Ronaldo’s first season the shirt number finally fitted the brand. Madrid has embraced Cristiano the male model as much as Ronaldo the footballer. A one hundred-foot-high billboard poster of him modelling his latest line of CR7 underpants in the city’s municipal hall two years ago was proof of that. Ronaldo joined Manchester United in 2003 at the same time as Brazilian midfielder Kleberson . Ronaldo had a good relationship with Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson . When he first arrived at Manchester United, Ronaldo had a reputation of going to ground too easily . Ronaldo replaced David Beckham at Manchester United but at Madrid he has replaced the former England captain off the pitch as Real’s most marketable star. In a deal that runs to 2020, adidas pay Madrid £31m a year for the privilege of seeing Nike’s biggest client wear the adidas logo every weekend. Ronaldo himself earns around £5m a year from Nike. He has more than tripled his income from sponsors since being in Spain, earning around £20m a year from brands as diverse as Castrol, Emporio Armani, and Banco Espiritu Santo. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez used to say that he would sell the stadium before selling Beckham, the sentiment is the same towards Ronaldo. That might explain the insistence that Gareth Bale’s transfer to the club in 2013 was for less than the club paid for Ronaldo. Ronaldo quickly changed his ways at Old Trafford and became one of the biggest stars at the club . Ronaldo helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in 2004 when they beat Millwall in Cardiff . Ronaldo won three Premier League titles in his time at Manchester United . Ronaldo also helped Manchester Untied win the Champions League by beating Chelsea in Moscow in 2008 . And when too many people started to believe that Bale was indeed Real’s most expensive-ever acquisition, Real made sure that Ronaldo was the highest earner in history by putting his pay up to £15m a year net with a new five-year deal just a month after Bale’s signing. The deal which works out at around £280,000 a week is some pay rise especially when looking back to 2013 he was angling for a new contract at United that would see him move to £120,000 a week. Many back then were asking: ‘Is he really worth it?’ Just as at 30 some might ask: ‘Can he still do it?’ Perez and Mendes would no doubt answer: ‘yes he is’ and ‘yes he can’.","Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or and is regarded as the world's best .

"Burglars are marking houses as targets for break-ins with small, transparent stickers advertising a locksmith. The signs, which purport to offer a ‘24-hour service’ but include a fake phone number, are typically placed by letterboxes. Police in London have already linked one burglary to the stickers. They have received dozens of complaints from residents across the capital who have found them on their doors. Scam: The stickers - which have already been linked to one local burglary - are printed with the words '24/7 Locksmith - Repair Installation Locked out' and a fake telephone number of 0203 582 8175 . Officers believe that ‘scouts’ place . the stickers on properties they deem to be vulnerable, after checking . whether the owners are at home during the day and if windows and doors . are locked. It is . thought the stickers were designed so that if a scout is apprehended . while marking a house, they can claim they are simply handing out . advertising material. A spokesman for Wandsworth Council in south-west London said: ‘These stickers are clearly not for advertising purposes. ‘They’re . not going next to the lock where you may notice them and the phone . number has never existed. They’re difficult to spot unless you’re on the . lookout.’ Inspector . David Bannister from Wandsworth police added: ‘At this time of year with . the darker evenings there is traditionally a rise in burglaries, . particularly between 3pm and 7pm. ‘There . have been a number of front doors found with stickers, giving details . of a locksmith, which enquires reveal is not a genuine company.

Jonathan Cook, the council's crime prevention spokesman, said: ‘There . is growing evidence that some organised teams of burglars may be using . this method to target homes in South London. 'We are urging local residents to keep a very close eye out for these stickers and if they find one to remove it straight away' Cllr Jonathan Cook, Wandsworth Council . ‘We . are therefore urging local residents to keep a very close eye out for . these stickers and if they find one to remove it straight away. ‘It . also goes without saying that if people can beef up their home security . by fitting sturdy locks to doors and windows and alarms, then this will . always reduce the chances of them falling victim to thieves and . burglars.’ Inspector David Bannister from Wandsworth police added: ‘At this time of year with the darker evenings there is traditionally a rise in burglaries, particularly between 3pm and 7pm. ‘There have been a number of front doors found with stickers, giving details of a locksmith, which enquires reveal is not a genuine company. These are placed near the main lock. ‘It is assessed that these markers are being used by potential burglars to mark potential targets which are then returned to subsequently. If you find a sticker on your door, the best thing to do is remove it.’ The council later said that police had received ‘lots of new intelligence’ after a warning was issued to residents - and are now following up a number of new leads to catch those who are responsible. Burglars have been using coded chalk symbols to let other criminals know whether a property is worth targeting, MailOnline reported in September. The marks, dubbed the Da Pinci Code, are made by would-be thieves to indicate if the house is vulnerable, revealing who is living in the house and whether there is anything worth stealing. Chillingly, one sign in Walkden, Greater Manchester, in the shape of an open book, said a vulnerable female resident is the occupant and another symbol indicated a 'nervous' homeowner.

Jack Wilshere (right) appeared to be holding a shisha pipe during a night out in London . Wenger, who has been openly critical of players who smoke, will be concerned after Wilshere was caught in yet another compromising situation.

'It's (smoking shisha) is not the best thing to do. We want him to focus completely - without smoking.' The big difference between the two incidents are that Chamakh was clearly smoking the pipe, while Wilshere is merely holding it nowhere near his mouth. Nevertheless, Wenger will be frustrated that he will have to deal with yet another smoking-related controversy with regards to one of his players. Speaking in July, Wilshere said: 'The smoking?

"Horror: Meenakshi Thapa was murdered in the most horrific way . An aspiring Bollywood actress was murdered by two fellow actors she 'befriended on the set of her latest film'. Meenakshi Thapa, 26, was kidnapped and beheaded last month by Amit Jaiswal and his lover Preeti Surin in an attempt to receive a ransom payment. She had met the pair on the set of Madhur Bhandarkar's yet-to-be-released film Heroine, where she had a bit-part role. Thapa's mother is believed to have paid 60,000 (£730) Rupees for her release, but never saw her daughter again. Detective have said they believe she was strangled in a hotel and her body was hacked into . pieces and thrown in a water tank. Then in a final act of callous depravity her head was thrown from a moving bus on its way to Mumbai. Mumbai crime branch policemen recovered the body from Surin's house in Allahabad on Wednesday. Jaiswal and Surin confessed the crime to the Mumbai Police after their arrest on Saturday night and said they were taken . in by Thapa's pretentious stories about her . 'affluent family'. 'The accused believed that Thapa was . from a wealthy family because her lifestyle, despite not landing a big . film role, hid the fact that she actually came from a middle-class . background. They plotted to kidnap her for a ransom of 1,500,000 Rupees (£18,000) and kill her after the payment was made,' a police officer said. Thapa was a struggling actress who earlier played a minor role in last year's horror film 404 and she appeared in some TV commercials. Her Nepalese-origin family has settled in Dehradun some years ago. Like her, Jaiswal and Surin were struggling for a toehold in the film industry. The duo lured Thapa to travel with them to Gorakhpur. There they held her hostage and called up her family demanding the ransom. Gruesome discovery: Mumbai policemen recover the dead body of actress Meenakshi Thapa from Preeti Surin's house in Allahabad . Callous: Amit Jaiswal, 36, and his lover Preeti Surin, both covereing their faces, admitted the murder when they were arrested . The police said they told Thapa's . mother that they would drug her daughter and make a pornographic film . if she didn't deposit the money in the victim's account. They also took her debit card. The mother deposited 60,000 Rupees in Thapa's account, but that didn't . save her daughter. A police officer said: 'They returned to Mumbai from Allahabad by bus. On their way they threw out the bag.' In the meantime, Thapa's brother . registered a complaint with the police in Dehradun on March 17 about his . missing sister. The Mumbai Police were promptly alerted. Meenakshi was kidnapped and brutally beheaded last month by two aspiring actors she befriended on the sets of Madhur Bhandarkar's yet-to-be-released film Heroine, in which she had a bit-part role . In Mumbai, the killers thought they had done away with all evidence but . for one slip. Jaiswal still had Thapa's mobile phone SIM cards. These led the police to the duo hiding in suburban Bandra. 'They confessed to the crime, but couldn't tell us exactly where they threw away the head during their journey from Allahabad to Mumbai,' a police officer said. Jaiswal, 36, and Surin, who is 10 years younger, were originally from Allahabad. They eloped after Jaiswal's wife discovered their affair and landed in Mumbai to try their luck in films. Instead they scripted one hell of a murder that could even spook Bollywood scriptwriters.

However, Isis is also one of the names for the murderous al-Qaida splinter group behind the recent beheading of American journalist James Foley. Isis Downtown is a major development being built in West Palm Beach . It stands for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and was formed in April 2013 under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Palm Beach Post reports the new building is now being called 3 Thirty Three Downtown. The developers haven't commented on the change. Tim Harris, the past president of the Realtor Association of the Palm Beaches, said the prior name had become ‘scarily negative’. The developer still has a Facebook page called ISISDowntown, but it urges users to ‘like’ 3ThirtyThreeDowntown’, instead. Its website www.isisdowntowncondos.com is no longer live.

"The real-life medieval society which spawned the epic poem Beowulf is coming to light in a series of ground-breaking discoveries centred around the royal court of sixth-century Denmark. The poem, one of the oldest literary works written in English, tells the story of how the hero Beowulf defeats the monster Grendel, who has been terrorising the royal hall of Heorot. The fiend is attracted to the court by the sound of feasting - and excavations in the area thought to have inspired the poem have revealed that it did indeed host feasts on an epic scale. Epic: Archaeologists believe they have found the site where the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf was set; Ray Winstone is pictured in the 2007 Hollywood adaptation of the story . Archaeologists are currently working in on a site in Lejre, in eastern Denmark, which was the centre of one of the most powerful Viking kingdoms from the sixth to the 10th century. The town is considered by scholars to be the most likely site of Heorot, the hall of King Hrothgar, where the events of Beowulf are set. In the Anglo-Saxon epic, composed some time before the 11th century, the monster Grendel repeatedly attacks Heorot after becoming enraged by the sound of feasting. The Danish court is powerless to guard against the beast until the arrival of Beowulf, from the land of the Geats in modern-day Sweden, who kills Grendel and then descends under the sea and defeats the monster's mother. Manuscript: The one surviving copy of the poem is contained on badly burnt parchment in the British Library . Although the story of Beowulf centres . around the heroic exploits of the Scandinavians, it found fame in the . epic poem written in Old English by an Anglo-Saxon bard. The . poem, which is 3,000 lines long, is testimony to the historic links . between the Norse and the Anglo-Saxons, some of whom emigrated from . southern Scandinavia. It . tells the tale of Beowulf, a Geat warrior from modern-day Scandinavia, . who travels to Denmark to help King Hrothgar defend his magnificent hall . of Heorot. Beowulf . kills the monster Grendel, saving the Danes from his murderous attacks, . then defeats the fiend's mother and is later acclaimed king of the . Geats. The poem concludes decades later with a face-off between the ageing king and a fearsome dragon, ending with the death of both. It . could have been written as early as the seventh century, but survives . only in one manuscript from the early 11th century, which is now in the . British Library but has been badly burnt. The . epic caught the imagination of writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, and has . been filmed a dozen times, including a 2007 adaptation starring Ray . Winstone and Angelina Jolie. The extent to which the events of the poem are based on historical fact is controversial, but it seems to have been inspired by the wealthy Danish court at Lejre. And the current excavations have confirmed that giant feasting halls were an integral part of life at Lejre, according to a progress report published in BBC History magazine. Archaeologists have found a total of seven halls dating from various points between 500 and 1000, implying that the structures were periodically torn down and rebuilt. The earliest of all the halls, located 500m from all the others, is the one most likely to have provided the historical inspiration for Heorot. On the site there are the remains of hundreds of animals apparently killed and eaten at massive feasts, as recounted in the poem. The animals include cattle, sheep, suckling pigs, goats, chicken, geese, ducks, deer and fish - implying that the Scandinavian elite enjoyed a diverse and luxurious diet. Pottery drinking vessels have also been found on the site, as well as up to 40 pieces of jewellery made from precious metals. 'For the first time, archaeology is giving us a glimpse of life in the key royal Danish site associated with the Beowulf legend,' said Tom Christensen, of the Roskilde Museum. The area is thought to have been largely isolated from the rest of Europe, as the Norsemen did not convert to Christianity until the 10th century. Excavations: Archaeologists are working at Lejre, headquarters of one of the greatest Viking kingdoms . However, excavators at Lejre have found an animal jawbone which they believe belonged to a brown bear given to the Danish ruler by another European king. Despite its historic importance, Lejre is now a town of just 2,000 on the island of Zeeland, 23 miles west of Copenhagen. Officials plan to issue a full report on their finds next year, when the exhibits will go on show at local museums.","Excavations at Lejre in Denmark reveal remains of hundreds of animals .

"The first clue to understanding Philippe Coutinho is that his hero is Ronaldinho, the Brazilian maestro who probably produced more tricks and flicks than any World Cup winner in history. 'He is my idol, the player I have watched the most and tried to copy the most,' says Liverpool's new samba star unashamedly. Ronaldinho is the reason he wears the No 10 shirt in the first place. The downside of looking up to such a flamboyant character is that Ronaldinho, for all his fantastic ability, didn't really enjoy the 'other' side of the game – working, tackling, teamwork – and shied away from playing in the physical Premier League, even turning down Manchester United a year after his 2002 World Cup triumph and instead signing for Barcelona, even though the Catalans were not the world superpower they are today. Phillipe Coutinho scored Liverpool's winning goal in their FA Cup fourth-round replay against Bolton . The Brazilian midfielder points to the sky after his goal ensured Liverpool progressed into the fifth round . Coutinho has revealed he grew up watching former Barcelona playmaker Ronaldinho . 2 La Liga titles . 1 Champions League . 2 Spanish Cups . 1 Serie A . 1 World Cup . 1 Copa America . 1 Campeonato Carioca (Brazilian title) 1 Intertoto Cup . Marrying the two parts of football, individual creativity and team responsibility, has been the biggest problem for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers getting the best out of 22-year-old Coutinho but after his spectacular FA Cup winner against Bolton on Wednesday night, significantly right at the end of the game in injury-time, it seems the penny has finally dropped with the player. After an impressive start to his Liverpool career following his move from Inter Milan in 2013, it appeared twinkle-toed Coutinho was going backwards at the beginning of this season. A home tie against Real Madrid in the Champions League should have been his stage but he was ignominiously substituted after 67 minutes as Liverpool were beaten 3-0. For the win-or-bust home game against Basle, Rodgers only trusted Coutinho as a sub. He was given just 15 minutes at the end and Liverpool crashed out. Five days after that came his lowest point when Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher slated Coutinho for failing to follow Wayne Rooney in the build-up to Manchester United's opening goal in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. 'It was unforgivable, lazy and weak,' raged Carragher. Whether it was that stinging reminder about what was required as a Liverpool player or a talking-to from Rodgers, something has clicked for Coutinho. Coutinho recently put pen to paper to sign new long-term contract at the club . Jason Cundy believes Coutinho is now better than fellow playmakers David Silva and Santi Cazorla . Coutinho - 2 goals in 20 Premier League appearances . Silva - 7 goals in 17 PL appearances . Cazorla - 6 goals in 19 PL appearances . Oscar - 6 goals in 19 PL appearances . In 2015, he has only been substituted once, Rodgers has trusted him to play the full 90 minutes and beyond, and the reward came at Bolton with his fantastic, curling right-foot strike that clipped the underside of the crossbar and into the net to book Liverpool a fifth-round tie at Crystal Palace. A new long-term contract was signed earlier in the week and Rodgers has been gushing in his praise, hailing Coutinho's world-class potential and saying he's a player he would pay to watch. On a late night radio discussion on talkSPORT after the win at Bolton, former Chelsea defender Jason Cundy said Coutinho was now the best No 10 in the Premier League, better than David Silva, Santi Carzola and Oscar, even though Oscar plays for Cundy's club Chelsea and was selected ahead of Coutinho for Brazil's World Cup squad. What will please Coutinho, his manager and Ronaldinho is that the new, harder-working and more tactically-astute performances have not come at the expense of a drop in skill levels. Coutinho was surrounded by his Liverpool team-mates after scoring a late winner at the Macron Stadium . Coutinho is still fantastic on the ball, he set up the goals for Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool's last Premier League game, a 2-0 win against West Ham on Saturday, and is second in this season's Premier League stats for accurate through balls, with only Silva ahead of him. It's just he is also more disciplined with it. It's a sobering thought that Coutinho had just celebrated his 10th birthday when he watched Ronaldinho score his wonder-goal against England's David Seaman  at the 2002 World Cup. From that moment, there was only one number and position the youngster wanted. From the moment he walked into Liverpool's training ground, Rodgers spoke about his 'arrogance on the ball'. It was meant to be a compliment, and Coutinho took it as such. 'I know what he meant and I was very proud to hear it. It's very good support for me,' says the Brazilian. Carragher of course demands the 'other' side of the game too, the side Ronaldinho never quite got and hence didn't come to England. Coutinho is here, the contract he's just signed says he'll be here for another six years. Long before then, everyone might agree with Cundy that he really is the best No 10 in the country.","Reds ace Philippe Coutinho has been in impressive form in recent weeks .

"For a man who doesn't smoke, Jack Wilshere has developed an unfortunate habit of falling onto cigarettes and pipes. Three times now he has either been pictured fag in mouth or shisha pipe in hand. That’s a decent number for a player who, after (unlucky) strike one in 2013, said: ‘I made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I'm not a smoker.’ Around the time he also tweeted a picture of Zinedine Zidane having a cigarette. On that logic, he could have also referenced Cruyff, Maradona, Ashley Cole, Wayne Rooney or Mesut Ozil. Jack Wilshire with friends, holding a shisha pipe in a London Nightclub . Wilshere was first spotted smoking outside Dstrkt Club in London in October 2013 . Wilshere was again pictured with a cigarette in his mouth, this time after the World Cup while on a stag-weekend in Las Vegas in July 2014 . Jack Wilshere has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons. When is he going to realise his place in the Arsenal team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional? Robert B, Fife . Surely it’s time to start educating Jack and have somebody explain to him how to behave. If he was smoking that pipe, even if it doesn’t do him any serious damage as a player I wouldn’t put myself in that position. The goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette, shisha, lager, anything. Being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it’s not worth that risk. He is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer, there is always somebody on the lookout. You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that’s how you should want to live anyway. CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF TACKLE KEOWN . Good company and good puffers, but he might start to feel left out when the smoke clears and he sees how many medals they have each won. With Wilshere, that might always be the cliched punchline. At 23, his solitary FA Cup winner’s medal doesn't seem quite enough. In a team game it would be wrong to draw too much from that statistic. But what, then, to make of his talent when set against the staggering potential? Has one of England’s great young prospects become one of England’s great players? How much serious interest is there among title-contending clubs around Europe to sign him? It’s been almost a year since Paul Scholes said: 'Jack Wilshere, he came on the scene and what a top player he looked, but he’s never really gone on. He needs people like [Patrick] Vieira to take him to the next level. His development, he doesn’t look any better now than he did at 17.’ Wilshere has not played since Novemeber after picking up an injury against Manchester United . Wilshere posed a picture of himself in hospital after ankle surgery at the end of 2014 . Wilshere stepped up his return from injury and was pictured at Arsenal's training ground with Robert Pires . Wilshere made contact with Scholes after that and, after a bit of good form for club and country, Scholes backtracked. In October, the former Manchester United midfielder said ‘the penny has dropped’ for Wilshere. And yet it hasn't. Certainly not when it comes to smoking. And as a player has he really turned a corner? There will always be spectacular moments that make you think so. His performance in the 2-2 draw with Manchester City in September was simply sublime. But his talent has never been in doubt. Everyone knows he has brilliant physical gifts and a mind that knows how to work them. He is a unique talent. The ambiguity comes over his ability to sustain any kind of form and with that comes his never-ending challenge of staying injury free. The rent-a-quotes have had a good run in explaining that smoking will hardly accelerate a return from injury. That much is obvious, regardless of how many successful sportsmen have an occasional cigarette, and regardless of how little damage a sporadic cigarette might do. But the point remains, smoking is something smokers of all levels of dedication try to get away with. It is not something that will enhance anyone physically. If there is an affect from smoking, the scientists and doctors of this world are really rather confident about which way it goes. Wilshere celebrates scoring against Manchester City at the Emirates earlier this season . Wilshere has won 26 caps for England - but could have won far more had he not suffered so many injuries . For Wilshere, once more an injured athlete, surely now is the time to maximise his chances of good health. Surely the onus should be on returning quickly from his latest ankle problem, this one having kept him out since November 22. Surely, the desire to make up for lost time in a stop-start career must be overwhelming by now. Those are the assumptions, anyway. His frustrations and disappointments at his injuries – 84 appearances in four seasons since his breakthrough in 2010-11 is simply not enough – must be incomprehensible to anyone beyond the man himself. But aside from pontifications such as this and the many others that accompany this sort of subject, his employers have already been clear on the subject. Johan Cruyff and Wayne Rooney are two players who have smoked in their career . This was Arsene Wenger in response to the 2013 incident: ‘I disagree completely with that behaviour. I don't know really what happened, so I will need to have a chat with him about that.’ This was Wenger in 2014, after Wilshere’s post-World Cup cigar: ‘I haven’t spoken to him so it’s very difficult for me to make any statement. I know what you can make of the pictures. ‘I have to speak to him before I come out publicly. We will speak this week. I am not deeply concerned by it but I just want to know what happened.’ Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was caught smoking on New Year's day - and is now out of the team . Quite aside from the thought that Wenger’s hairdryer is not enough to extinguish a cigarette – Wojciech Szczesny felt comfortable enough lighting up in the shower on New Year’s Day, even though he has since been left on the sidelines – Wilshere is plainly ignoring advice from his manager. He will doubtless offer contrite words. But it shouldn’t be about whether he is sorry or not. It should be about a realisation that his career is ticking away and it might not be a tremendously good idea to stand in front of a camera with a pipe.","Jack Wilshere was pictured holding a shisha pipe while on a night out .

"Daniel Sturridge's dance moves were back at Anfield last Saturday when he scored in the second half of Liverpool's 2-0 win against West Ham and the striker's return to fitness has clearly been welcomed by the rest of the squad. For Raheem Sterling, Jordon Ibe and Mario Balotelli, it appears they have particularly enjoyed Sturridge's return to the first-team fold. Sturridge uploaded a video on Instagram of Sterling and Ibe dancing in the changing rooms to 'Blessings' by Big Sean featuring Drake and Kanye West, before the camera cuts to the striker himself doing a jig reminiscent of his renowned scoring celebration.

But as the England man jives away, Mario Balotelli wanders behind Sturridge and jokingly scowls at the camera, with Sturridge seemingly unaware the Italian is even there. But Balotelli's gesture was clearly taken well by Sturridge, who captioned the video 'Too much jokes...' Brendan Rodgers' side were straight back into training on Thursday, the day after their 2-1 victory over Bolton in the FA Cup, to prepare for Saturday's Merseyside derby. Sturridge's injury comeback continued against Neil Lennon's side as he was brought on in the 70th minute for Joe Allen and he could make his first start since August against Everton. But Rodgers refused to be drawn on whether Sturridge would play form the beginning. 'I think every player wants to play, not just Daniel,' he said. 'He is coming along very well. It is not that he won't start, we just need to analyse that over the next couple of days. 'We focus on the details on the game; whether it is at Anfield or Goodison, they are tough games but we are playing well, arrive into it creating opportunities that we weren't at the start of the season and we are really excited.' Sturridge (left) pictured alongside Sterling (right) and Ibe in Liverpool training on Thursday . Rodgers must decide whether to partner Sterling with Sturridge in attack against Everton . It was Sterling, the man Sturridge referred to as a 'little brother' following the West Ham victory, who scored Liverpool's equaliser in the fourth-round replay at Bolton, before Philippe Coutinho struck a last minute winner. Rodgers will also have to decide whether to bring Balotelli back into the squad on Saturday, as the Italy international did not even make the bench in midweek. Ibe, a pacy winger with similar skills to Sterling, is held in high regard at Anfield and was recalled from his loan at Derby as Rodgers felt he could contribute to Liverpool's top-four challenge. But it is Coutinho who Everton will hope to keep quiet in Saturday's late kick-off at Goodison Park.

"Chelsea new boy Juan Cuadrado is beginning to settle into London life with the help of his Colombian teammate David Ospina, as they put their club rivalries to one side. The 26-year-old completed his £27million move to Stamford Bridge from Fiorentina during the transfer window - which saw Mohamed Salah go the other way on loan. Cuadrado, who could feature in Saturday's game against Aston Villa, took to Instagram to thank Ospina for helping him settle in.

The ex-Fiorentina man was pictured training with his new teammates earlier this week and Jose Mourinho will be hoping that the explosive winger can add another dimension to his squad. While Cuadrado is expected to make an instant impact, it's taken Ospina a little while to establish himself as Arsenal's number one but he's grasped the opportunity with both hands. The goalkeeper has kept three clean sheets in his last three Premier League games, including one in the Gunners impressive 2-0 victory at the Etihad. Arsenal travel to White Hart Lane on Saturday lunchtime to face arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur, in what will be Ospina's first taste of the North London derby.

"Liverpool and Middlesbrough would have needed to convert another 13 spot-kicks to break the world record for the highest-scoring penalty shootout on Tuesday night. The shoot-out at the end of their Capital One Cup third round tie at Anfield was epic enough with its 27 goals and 30 penalties in total. But it fell some way short of the highest-scoring shootout, which was Argentinos Juniors' 20-19 win over Racing Club in November 1988, back when all drawn matches in the Argentine League went to penalties. Liverpool's players celebrate after their epic 14-13 penalty shootout victory over Middlesbrough . Boro's Albert Adomah was the unfortunate one to miss the decisive penalty - the 30th kick of the shootout . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet converts his penalty as the whole team gets a go . And it was also nowhere near the record for the longest shootout, as recognised by the Guinness Book of Records, which was the 48 kicks taken by KK Palace and Civics in the 2005 Namibian Cup final. Incredibly, 15 kicks were missed that day as KK Palace held their nerve to win 17-16. The incredible events at Anfield did however eclipse the previous League Cup shootout record of 9-8, which has happened on three occasions: Arsenal vs Rotherham in 2004 and Manchester City vs Stoke City and Aston Villa vs Colchester United in 1982. It equalled the record between two professional English clubs - the September 2011 Football League Trophy tie that ended Dagenham & Redbridge 14-13 Leyton Orient on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Arsenal beat Rotherham 9-8 on penalties back in 2003 in the previous joint League Cup record . The longest sequence of successful kicks scored in English football is 29, when Brockenhurst beat Andover Town 15-14 in a Hampshire Senior Cup tie in 2013. Andover's Claudio Herbert was the unfortunate one to miss in sudden death. The FA Cup record was set in November 2001, when Macclesfield beat Forest Green Rovers 11-10. Highest scoring shootouts at international level include the Netherlands' 13-12 win over England at the European Under-21 Championship in 2007 and the Ivory Coast's 12-11 victory against Cameroon in the 2006 African Nations Cup semi-finals.","Liverpool beat Middlesbrough 14-13 on penalties to reach fourth round of the Capital One Cup at Anfield .

"You might not think that a bird and a gambler would have much in common. But scientists have found that human gamblers and pigeons are 35 per cent more likely to take greater risks when there is a chance of a big win. They discovered that both species use past experiences to guide future gambling decisions. Risky business: Scientists have found that human gamblers and pigeons are 35 per cent more likely to take greater risks when there is a chance of a big win. Both species use past experiences to guide future gambling decisions. A stock image of a gambler planning on winning big is pictured . Researchers from the University of Warwick and the University of Alberta, Canada, said their study shows the important role that memories of previous biggest wins and losses play when we make risky gambling decisions. ‘Birds are distantly related to humans, yet we still share the same basic psychology that drives risk-taking,’ said Dr Elliot Ludvig, from the University of Warwick's Department of Psychology. ‘This may be due to a shared common ancestry or similar evolutionary pressures. ‘When people gamble, they often rely on past experiences with risk and rewards to make decisions. ‘What we found in this study is that pigeons used these past experiences in very similar ways to guide their future gambling decisions. ‘Any big wins we've had in the past are memorable and stand-out when we are making our decision to gamble again.’ Bird brained? In the experiment, both humans and pigeons (pictured) were shown to be less risk averse for high rewards then they were for low rewards. Dr Ludvig thinks this is linked to our past memories and experiences of making risky decisions . Human volunteers and pigeons were given four options: two that led to high-value rewards and two that led to low-value rewards. Humans were rewarded with points, while the pigeons were rewarded with food. For each reward level - high or low - one safe option resulted in a guaranteed fixed reward, and one risky option yielded a 50/50 chance of a better or worse reward. Both birds and humans were found to be 35 per cent more likely to take a gamble on the high-value rewards. In an experiment, human volunteers and pigeons were given four options: two that led to high-value rewards and two that led to low-value rewards. Humans were rewarded with points, while the pigeons were rewarded with food, according to the study published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. For each reward level - high or low - one safe option resulted in a guaranteed fixed reward, and one risky option yielded a 50/50 chance of a better or worse reward. Both birds and humans were found to be 35 per cent more likely to take a gamble on the high-value rewards. ‘Both humans and pigeons were shown to be less risk averse for high rewards than they were for low rewards and this is linked to our past memories and experiences of making risky decisions,’ Dr Ludvig said. Despite humans having a greater mental capacity than pigeons, he claims: ‘humans and pigeons react in similar ways when faced with risky decisions because equivalent mental processes are driving their behaviour. ‘Humans and pigeons are equally influenced by the biggest wins and losses that they have previously encountered’.","University of Warwick study found that human gamblers and pigeons are both 35% more likely to take big risks when there's a chance of a big win .

The brief change of sports might be what the German giants need after a stuttering resumption to their season since the winter break. Tuesday's Bundesliga draw at the Allianz Arena comes after Friday night's shock 4-1 thrashing at Wolfsburg. The two results leaves the 2013 Champions League winners winless this year with one point from a possible six. After going unbeaten during the first half of the season, Bayern now sit eight points ahead of their Friday night conquerers after 19 games.

Talismanic winger Arjen Robben is not just worried that Bayern back-to-back blips so far in this year may have opened the door for Wolfsburg in the title race, but that they could be made to pay for poor form in Europe too. The Holland international told FIFA.com that the Bavarian side won't be able to get away with such lapses shown in their last two games in the Champions League, where their campaign recommences against Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16 first leg later this month. 'We controlled the game with a man down, but the Schalke result is annoying,' the 31-year-old said after scoring their opener on Tuesday. 'Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you go 1-0 up and then let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League.' Arjen Robben says Bayern Munich's early season slump could cost them when it comes to Europe .

"The South Suffolk MP is a 'very strong supporter' of coalition with the Liberal Democrats . The Tories are doomed to defeat at the 2015 general election if David Cameron gives in to Eurosceptic 'obsessives' and allows policy to be driven by a fear of Ukip, MP Tim Yeo haswarned. Mr Yeo believes his own pro-EU stance as well as his support for gay marriage and green policies contributed to his local party voting not to re-select him as its candidate after 30 years in the Commons. He told the Daily Telegraph a shrinking grassroots membership was becoming increasingly 'extreme' on a variety of issues after becoming the second prominent Tory ejected in a week. And he hit out at 'obsessives like the people who organise this letter-writing to the Prime Minister on negotiation'. Some 95 Conservative backbenchers signed a letter drafted by senior backbencher Bernard Jenkin calling for Parliament to be able to block any aspect of European Union legislation. 'We have a shrinking membership which means you tend to get predominantly among those remaining activists people with probably more extreme views than the average Conservative voter and that applies to issues like the EU, on issues like gay marriage,' Mr Yeo told the newspaper. 'If we allow Ukip and our fear of Ukip to be what drives our policy that will lead us undoubtedly to defeat. 'I believe the right way to deal with Ukip is to become more like the traditional Conservative Party with a broad appeal to the Right and the centre. Rather than trying to match Ukip, David Cameron and the Tories should be seeking to expose the party's policies as 'incoherent and inconsistent' the MP said . 'Clearly, we are threatened within the Conservative Party by people's obsessive interest in this issue, which is not shared by the majority of Conservative voters and certainly is not shared by the general public,' Rather than trying to match Ukip, the Tories should be seeking to expose its policies shown as 'incoherent, inconsistent, inadequate and in many places plain wrong', he said. In comments unlikely to improve relations with local party members, the South Suffolk MP also declared himself a 'very strong supporter' of coalition with the Liberal Democrats, which had 'achieved things that couldn't have been achieved by one party on its own'. And he warned Tories not to block the HS2 rail project 'for what I would see as little England reasons'.","Tim Yeo was de-selected by his local constituency in Suffolk this week .

"ADRIAN DURHAM: The World Cup is by far the biggest stage of all, it’s Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard’s last chance to shine . ADRIAN DURHAM: Is Roy Hodgson the new Fabio Capello? England will suffer if they keep it tight with Italy... he must be brave, as he promised . ADRIAN DURHAM: England must be adventurous and take the World Cup by storm or go out in glory... my starting XI for the opener with ItalY . The most underrated player in the Premier League? Jack Colback. In an era when we are searching for young English talent, players who can keep the ball; and admiring – almost over-admiring – those who step forward and show some technique, it’s amazing this kid has been overlooked. He’s not only got ability, he’s got bottle as well. For a kid to let his contract run down so that he can leave Sunderland on a free transfer and join his boyhood club Newcastle United, is the ultimate in football bravery. It’s right up there with Sol Campbell’s evil switch from Spurs to Arsenal. Campbell recently claimed he was surprised at the venomous reaction from the Spurs fans. I hope Colback isn’t as naive – he will get fearful abuse from the Sunderland fans when the Tyne/Wear derbies take place. But he doesn’t deserve it. Happy days: New signing Colback holds a Newcastle scarf and poses for photographs pitch side . Montage: Sunderland tweeted this picture of Colback scoring and celebrating against Newcastle . Cross rivalry: Colback's move is right up there with Sol Campbell¿s evil switch from Arsenal to Spurs . Put it this way – if Colback had come through the acclaimed Southampton academy, he would have made their first team, played in central midfield and probably been in Brazil right now preparing for Manaus. But Sunderland shifted him to left back, kept changing manager, and Colback’s talents have never really been able to flourish over a decent period of time at the Stadium of Light. Colback was in the same youth team as Jordan Henderson. When a space came up in the Sunderland midfield, Henderson took it, and Colback went on loan to Ipswich. It could easily have been the other way round. All change: Sunderland's form drastically improved when Gus Poyet put Jack Colback back into midfield . Gus Poyet eventually trusted Colback in central midfield, and Sunderland’s form was phenomenal. He’s just an honest lad who wants to play for the club he supported as a boy, his hometown team. Every Sunderland supporter can understand that concept, so they should thank Jack, wish him all the best, and move on. But football sadly doesn’t work like that. Unbelievable: Gus Poyet worked a miracle to eventually keep Sunderland in the Premier League .","It's amazing Colback has been overlooked by many clubs and England .

"Any Manchester United move to resign Gerard Pique is likely to be scuppered by pop star Shakira. The Barcelona defender's partner does not want to leave the Catalan city for Manchester.

But Pique was heartened by Barca boss Luis Enrique's praise this week. The former Nou Camp midfielder said: 'Pique's attitude is great, he's optimistic, working hard. His hip problem has been solved, he's ready to help us.' But Pique has not been in contact with United, where he left for Barcelona in 2008. Pique has known Old Trafford boss Van Gaal since he was 13, with the Dutchman knowing the defender's grandfather. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Marouane Fellaini has vowed that his nightmare first season at Manchester United has made him a stronger player. The much-maligned midfielder endured a disappointing first term at Old Trafford as the deposed Premier League champions finished seventh. Fellaini's £27million transfer to the club move from Everton, in August last year, still causes much derision among many Red Devils' supporters who have been unimpressed with his performances in midfield. Marouane Fellaini believes his torrid first season at Manchester United has made him a stronger player . Fellaini (right) is currently out of action after sustaining an ankle injury at the start of the season . Fellaini says that United boss Louis van Gaal (right) has assured him of first-team opportunities this season . The 26-year-old is currently working his way back to full fitness after suffering an ankle injury at the start of the season, and the Belgian international has revealed that United boss Louis van Gaal has assured him that he will get opportunities to stake a claim in the first team. 'I talked to Van Gaal, and he has never said that I had to leave. He said I had a lot of competition, but that I got the chance to prove it [that I deserve to play],' Fellaini told Sport Wereld. 'I have known difficult moments last season, but there is a stronger player afterwards. I have confidence in myself and in my game again. 'I played a good World Cup and also during the preparation, I was good. It is unfortunate that this injury is for now just a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.'
