"Evelyn Smith, 7, died in September after a viral infection brought on by croup . A girl of seven suffering from croup died after medics sent her home three times in 36 hours, an inquest heard. Evelyn Smith had been taken by her parents to a hospital doctor, a nurse at a medical centre and a GP but just two hours after her last consultation she was dead. The inquest was told there had been a failure to understand the ‘seriousness of her condition’ that led to her death. Warwickshire Coroner’s Court heard that on September 12 last year her parents, Trevor and Helen Smith, rushed her to hospital in the early hours after she complained she could not breathe. At Warwick Hospital, she was examined by Dr Emma Sexton and vomited after being given penicillin but was discharged at 4.39am. Mrs Smith, 48, told the inquest: ‘Evelyn’s temperature rocketed from then on. The lowest I recorded was 39.7C (103F).’ The next morning she took her daughter to a local medical centre where Sister Trudy Hudson prescribed penicillin for inflamed tonsils and sent her home. She showed some improvement but later that day her temperature shot up again and her parents took her to see a GP. Dr Susan Martin said Evelyn had ‘oxygen saturations and moderate croup’ – a respiratory infection – and gave her a prescription and said she would feel better ‘in two or three days’. Two hours later Evelyn collapsed and died at home. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Richard Brittain, assistant coroner for Warwickshire, said: ‘There were missed opportunities to diagnose and treat Evelyn appropriately on each of these occasions. 'However, I am satisfied that none of these consultations were neglectful. Evelyn was sent home from A&E at Warwick Hospital, a medical centre and a GP's practice before she died after medics 'missed opportunities' to appropriately diagnose and treat her, an inquest heard. The coroner ruled that none of the consultations were neglectful . Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe, the airways to the lungs and the voice box. Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked. Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. However, if your child’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe, take them to the nearest hospital’s accident and emergency department. Why does croup happen? Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus. Typical symptoms of croup include: . ‘It is more likely than not that her death was preventable although it has not been possible to conclude the causative impact of each missed opportunity.’ In March this year Glen Burley, chief executive of South Warwickshire Foundation Trust, refused to accept doctors had missed opportunities to save Evelyn. But at the inquest, Helen Lancaster, the director of nursing, did accept more training on the seriousness of croup was needed. Haidee Vedy, of legal firm Alsters Kelley, who represented the family, said: ‘Evelyn’s death was an absolute tragedy and should never have happened. 'We will now be investigating further to find out what more could have been done to prevent Evelyn’s death.’ Dr John Omany from NHS England said: ‘We have looked into the circumstances of this tragic case and our priority now is to ensure that GPs across our area are aware of the dangers of croup.’","Evelyn Smith, 7, ran into her parents room complaining she couldn't breathe .

"A serial bride who had already married four times before she was 24 and even made a vow never to marry again tied the knot yesterday to her new partner, making it her fifth marriage at just 31. Alison Smith had told her latest husband Matthew Hume, 48, that she was not proud of her previous marriages and would never marry again. However, the mother-of-two from Arbroath arrived at the town's registrars in a knee length black and white frock for her close, family only, wedding ceremony in an apparent change of heart. And it is likely she will be hoping her latest marriage fares better than her previous four. Scroll down for video . Marriage number 5: Alison Smith, 31, (right) married her latest husband Matthew Hume, 48, (left) yesterday in Arbroath . The unusual wedding party contained Alison's mother Pat and her husband George Greenhowe. George was actually Alison's first husband in a marriage that only lasted 10 days. The two families were torn apart when George ran off with Alison's mother. However time healed the rift and they made up and reportedly even all lived in the same caravan together at one point. The happy couple (left) and Alison's first husband George Greenhowe (back) with her mother Pat (right) who ranoff with George after Alison's first wedding . Alison's first husband George Greenhowe with her mother Pat leave the ceremony today having watched Alison get marred for the fifth time . Alison, pictured here leaving the ceremony today with mother Pat (left), wore a knee length black and white frock yesterday, shunning the more traditional white gown . Marriage One: She married George Greenhowe but their union only lasted 10 days after George ran off with Alison's mother Pat. (George and Pat have since married in a humanist wedding- making George Alison's stepfather) Marriage Two: Alison was meant to marry Peter Knight but he got cold feet the day before the wedding and ran off. His best friend Daniel Innes,18, 'stepped in' and married Alison instead. Marriage Three: Having divorced Daniel due to 'family pressures', Alison married Willie McKellican. She soon discovered he was already married. He was investigated by the police for bigamy but no charges were brought. Alison left him. Marriage Four: Alison married Alex Shepherd, a friend of her first husband George. He divorced her after discovering she was having an affair with Matthew Hume, 48. Marriage Five: Alison and Matthew married yesterday at Arbroath town hall. The service was attended by family including her mother and stepfather and ex-husband George. George and Pat themselves tried to get married at a registrars office but were told because of the close family connections the law would not allow it. They were eventually married in a humanist ceremony with Alison as bridesmaid. She is now said to call her first husband 'dad'. Alison's next try for wedded bliss was also to end in disaster. In 2004, she was all set to marry fiancé Peter Knight, but Peter got cold feet on the eve of the wedding and called it off. Alison, who was eight months pregnant with her daughter, was despondent but, didn't let the grass grow under her feet. She turned to friend, 18-year-old Daniel Innes, who agreed to step in as the groom. They were married four days later. At the time she married Daniel, Alison said, 'I feel certain I've done the right thing by marrying Daniel. 'He makes me feel so secure. 'When he heard Peter wouldn't marry me, Daniel said he would instead.' However, family pressures resulted in that relationship falling apart and Alison was back in the divorce court and on the lookout for a new man. Before long, the next potential husband arrived in Alison's life. She thought she had a bright future with Willie McKellican. Marriage number 1: Alison at her first wedding where she married George Greenhowe in Arbroath. George then had an affair with her mother . Marriage number 3: Alison at her third marriage with to husband William McKellican, who she later discovered was already married . Alison, pictured in her wedding dress for her third marriage which was to William McKellican, has apparently said she is now ashamed of her past marriages . Unfortunately for Alison, McKellican had a past that he had not revealed to her. He never told her that he was still married to his wife. He was investigated by the police for bigamy but no charges were brought. Alison left McKellican after this revelation and she was on the hunt for a man again. Marriage number 4: Alison Smith, seen here arriving for her last marriage to Alexander Shepherd in 2008, yesterday married for the fifth time . Marriage number 4: Alison on her way to her wedding reception at a local bar with fourth husband Alexander Shepherd in 2008 . Alison, pictured in her wedding dress for her third marriage which was to William McKellican, has apparently said she is now ashamed of her past marriages . She married husband number four Alex Shepherd, a friend of her first husband George, but again that marriage was short lived. He dumped her after finding out she had cheated on him with new love Matthew. Alison said when she met her latest love, 'Matthew knows how many times I have been married in the past and he knows how I feel.' As Alison woke up this morning from her wedding night, no doubt she will be hoping that new husband Mathew Hume will be around for longer than the rest. When asked outside the wedding about their plans for the future the couple declined to comment. Her first husband and now stepfather George Greenhowe said, 'She is happy and just wants to be left alone.' Alison has now made peace with her mother Pat, pictured, and was even a bridesmaid at her wedding to George- Alison's first husband .","Alison tied the knot with fifth husband, Matthew, yesterday .

"Pedestrians spotted this traffic warden in Shirley, West Midlands, parking in double yellow lines before issuing tickets to other drivers . Traffic wardens are known as sticklers for rules, ready to punish motorists for the slightest violation. However, one warden in Shirley, West Midlands, has provoked outrage after parking on a double yellow line before walking off to issue tickets to other drivers. Despite being challenged by pedestrians over his behaviour, the Solihull Council employee then climbed back into his unmarked car and drove off. Witnesses say the man pulled on to the double yellow lines at around at around 8.50am yesterday. He spent the next 15 minutes waking around nearby streets, and handed out at least one parking ticket. Leon Kennedy, 31, was walking to work at the time and asked the traffic warden why he was parked on double yellow lines. He said: 'I had to say something, but he seemed pretty unrepentant. 'He said ""you wouldn’t be saying this if I was a police officer parked on double yellow lines"". 'I told him that if they weren’t attending an emergency call then I definitely would be unhappy and besides he isn’t a police officer. 'But he just said he was doing his job and got in the car and drove off. 'What gives him the right to park illegally when everybody else gets punished by him for doing the same? It’s not on.' Pedestrians Phil and Angela Hall, who were walking their dog at the time, said they could not believe their eyes. Phil, 60, said: 'We watched this car pull up on double yellow lines. 'I went over to warn him to watch out as there’s lots of traffic wardens around here and then low and behold a traffic warden popped out. Scroll down for video . Passerby Leon Kennedy, 31, challenged the official over his behaviour, but says the man told him he was only doing his job before getting into his car and driving away . Angela Hall, 58, branded the warden's actions 'hypocrisy' saying it 'does not send out a good message' 'I was just too stunned to say anything to him but he walked off and spent the next 15 minutes looking for illegally parked cars - while illegally parked himself. 'He issued a ticket to at least one other car as far as I could see, I don’t think it is right at all.' Angela, 58, added: 'It’s just pure hypocrisy. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 'I know they have a job to do but surely they should work within the law themselves because it does not send out a good message at all.' A Solihull Council spokesperson said: 'Civil Enforcement Officers are exempt from most parking restrictions while carrying out their duties. 'Parking on double yellow lines is included in this exemption. While officers will always seek alternative parking this is not always practicably possible.' However a council spokesman confirmed wardens are exempt from most parking rules while on duty, and that parking on a double yellow is included .","Traffic warden in Shirley, West Midlands, caught parking on double yellow .

"A manor house with its own indoor theatre which has seen the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Rowan Atkinson, Esther Rantzen, and even the cast of EastEnders walk the boards has gone on sale for £5million. Little Easton Manor, in Dunmow near Bishop’s Stortford, Essex, was first built in in the 17th century on an estate that dates back to the Roman era and featured in the Domesday Book of 1086. It formed part of the 10,000-acre Estaines estate that was given to politician Sir Henry Maynard in 1590 by Queen Elizabeth I and after he built the house it was passed down through his family for the next 300 years. Scroll down for video . Little Easton Manor, in Dunmow, Essex, was built by Sir Henry Maynard who was given land by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 as part of Estaines estate . Property passed down through his family for 300 years before Francis 'Daisy' Maynard converted tithe barn into theatre in the early 1900s . Actress Ellen Terry gave readings while H.G. Wells, who lived on the estate, also visited. Other performers included Charlie Chaplin, Gracie Fields and George Formby . The estate itself dates back to the Roman era and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 before the eight-bedroom mansion was ever built . In 1865 the 66-acre estate was inherited by socialite Frances ‘Daisy’ Maynard, who was said to have been the inspiration for Harry Dacre’s famous song Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two). Daisy,  the long-term mistress of Albert, Prince of Wales who was eventually crowned King Edward VII, became the Countess of Warwick in 1881. It was only in the early 1900s that she had the tithe barn transformed into a theatre which saw the great and the good of the acting world  perform there. Edwardian actress Ellen Terry gave poetry readings while War Of The Worlds author H.G. Wells, who lived with his family in a house on the estate, also frequented the theatre. Other regular performers included Charlie Chaplin, Gracie Fields and George Formby. Comedian Charlie Chaplin and singer Gracie Fields were known to regularly perform at the theatre in Little Easton Manor after the barn was converted . The outside of the property is painted in traditional 'Essex Pink' while the grounds include formal gardens (pictured) along with a tennis court and swimming pool . Other actors to have performed on the stage at Little Easton Manor include Rowan Atkinson, Bill Cotton, Tim Rice, Esther Rantzen and the cast of Eastenders . The grounds of the house, which feature fishing lakes and two cottage, have been used as the setting for multiple TV shows including BBC 1 series Lovejoy . Author H.G. Wells, who lived in a house in the grounds with his family, and entertainer George Formby were also among early fixtures at the playhouse . In 1925 famed film director Basil Dean acquired the manor through his marriage to the Countess’ daughter Lady Mercy Greville before embarking on a grand renovation project. Dean sold the manor in 1939 after his marriage to Lady Greville broke down and it passed through several hands until it was snapped up by Neville Pedley, a skilled carpenter, and his wife Vera in 1971. The couple took on the renovation of the barn theatre and during their ownership it welcomed a new generation of stars including Rowan Atkinson, Bill Cotton, Tim Rice, Esther Rantzen and even the cast of Eastenders. The eight-bedroom house and grounds was also used as the settings for numerous television programmes including BBC 1 series Lovejoy. Famed film director Basil Dean acquired the manor in 1925 through his marriage to Francis  Maynard's daughter, Lady Mercy Greville . The manor was sold on after Dean's marriage to Lady Greville broke down and was eventually bought by skilled carpenter Neville Pedley and his wife Vera in 1971 . Mr Pedley passed away in 1999 and following the death of Mrs Pedley last year at the age of 82, the house has now been put up for sale with a price tag of £5million . Mr Pedley passed away in 1999 and the house is now up for sale following Mrs Pedley’s death last year aged 82. The Grade II listed manor, which is painted in traditional ‘Essex pink’, also has a drawing room, dining room, sitting room, office and cellars. Within its grounds are fishing lakes, two cottages, formal gardens, a tennis court and swimming pool. It is on the market with Carter Jonas estate agents for £5million. Steven Foreman, from Carter Jonas, said: 'Little Easton House is very special. Country houses like this don’t come up for sale very often so to be able to sell this is a rare treat. Rowan Atkinson and Esther Rantzen were among more modern performers after the theatre was renovated by carpenter Neville Pedley and his wife Vera . As well as fishing lakes in the grounds, the eight-bedroom house also includes a drawing room, dining room, sitting room, office and cellars . Estate agents Carter Jonas said the home is already self-sufficient as it has already been used multiple times as a wedding venue and people will pay to use the lakes . 'It really is a lovely house. It has all aspects covered - aside from its wonderful theatre there are a number of lakes for fishing, and it is very popular as a wedding venue. 'Country houses come with the burden of significant maintenance costs but Little Easton generates enough income to easily cover these. It is self sufficient. 'A lot of very famous people have performed in the barn theatre over the years from the likes of Gracie Fields and H.G. Wells to Rowan Atkinson and Tim Rice. There is so much history to Little Easton Manor - it is a real English gem.'","Little Easton Manor, in Dunmow, Essex, was built on Roman estate that was recorded in Domesday Book .

"Boris Johnson's Commons comeback moved a step closer tonight after he was selected to fight a safe Tory seat at the general election. The London mayor saw off three rivals - one of whom was born in the constituency - to win the support of party members in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. In a blaze of publicity rarely afforded to a vote in a school hall, reporters mobbed the mop-haired mayor in the car park as odds on him becoming the next Prime Minister shortened to 6/1. Back in the fold: Boris Johnson at Ruislip High School tonight, where he was selected to fight the safe seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at next year's general election - despite still being London's mayor until 2016 . Mini-celebrity: Unlike almost any other Tory selection in history, Mr Johnson was mobbed by reporters as he arrived in the cart park of Ruislip High School, wearing a rucksack and accompanied by his wife Marina . 'I am obviously thrilled,' he said, playing down suggestions he had his eyes set on the Tory leadership - a prospect on which William Hill is offering odds of 2/1. He added: 'It will be a tough fight, it will be a long fight. But I have no doubt whatever that we are going to be able to return David Cameron and the Conservatives with an absolute majority in 2015. 'This is Act One, Scene One of a very long process and what I have got to do now is have a lot of talks with people here in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, get to know people, get to know the association better. There's a lot of digging in to be done.' He admitted that he had no immediate plans to relocate to the constituency. 'I live in London,' he said. 'I have got a home in London. I don't rule it out but it won't happen immediately.' Before the ballot, Mr Johnson and his three rivals made a behind-closed doors pitch to party members in the hall at Ruislip High School. Mr Johnson won outright on the first count, without the need for a second round. Criticism: Mr Johnosn insisted he was not going back on his word by saying London was out of recession . The mayor's bid survived concerns over his determination to see out his full City Hall term despite it running until 2016, a year after he may become an MP. Critics said he could not do both jobs at once to the best of his ability, citing a 2012 'solemn vow' in which he said leading the capital out recession 'cannot be combined with any other political capacity'. But he insisted he was not going back on his word - by saying London was already out of the doldrums. Last night he insisted: 'It has been done before and I see no reason why it shouldn't be done again. 'I would point out that it is possible to be both an MP and have a very big job such as foreign secretary or prime minister at the same time.' The colourful politician's decision to return to Westminster has stoked speculation over his hopes to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader. No contest: Uxbridge and South Ruislip is only Labour's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with William Hill making him the 1/50 favourite, and 2/1 to be the next leader of the Conservative party . The Prime Minister insists, however, that he would be delighted to have the mayor back in Parliament, saying he wants his 'star players on the pitch'. Mr Johnson, a former editor of the political magazine The Spectator, previously served as MP for Henley for seven years before leaving to take up the City Hall reins in 2008. He will defend a majority of 11,216 in the north-west London constituency held by former deputy chief whip Sir John Randall, who is stepping down. The others in the frame for the selection were the deputy leader of the local council David Simmonds,  deputy leader of Windsor and Maidenhead Council Simon Dudley, who was born in the constituency, and Harrow-born barrister Suella Fernandes. Praising the quality of his opponents, he said: 'It was a very enjoyable selection process and I want also to pay tribute to the other three candidates who were here who were all very good indeed and I am sure they will go on to get good seats.' The seat is only Labour's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with William Hill making him the 1/50 favourite. And the bookmaker's odds on Mr Johnson becoming the next Tory leader are now 2/1. His high profile could, however, attract a wide church of fringe candidates to compete against him.","London mayor saw off three rivals despite vow to do both jobs at once .

"An actress staged a real-life version of the Producers when she and her husband ran off to LA with $68,000 and bombed with a show meant for New York, a lawsuit from investors alleges. Candice Guardino had lined up investors to stage a production of her show Italian Bred in New York, but instead traveled to LA, where she and her husband Tom Felicciardi used a cut of the budget to live in luxury. One of the investors, Joe Cecala, 68, told the New York Post that plans were in place to mount the show at the Clurman Theatre, a 99-seat venue in Manhattan. Bomb: Actress Candice Guardino and husband Tom Felicciardi are accused of deceiving investors when they took $68,000 to LA to stage a flop . Instead, Guardino brought it to Los Angeles's Hudson Theatre where 'it got destroyed' because she 'comped' the majority of the audience, according to Cecala, himself a former producer who currently works as a hotel manager. 'I saw the receipts, and they netted only $1,500,' he said. The lawsuit alleges that once in LA, Guardino and her husband blew most of the fund on expenses unrelated to the production, such as an apartment, rented cars, spa trips, clothes and a publicist. The list of accusations against Guardino and Felicciardi are racketeering, securities fraud, and falsifying documents to 'hide an intentional misappropriation of funds.' Cecala invested $48,000 in the bomb, while two other investors, Emily Conner and Lawrence Schwartz, invested $10,000 each. The group is seeking an addition $200,000 in damages. Guardino wrote and starred in the show, which was based on her larger-than-life grandmother and other characters borrowed from her upbringing in an Italian-American family in Brooklyn and Staten Island. High life: Guardino allegedly used funds from the show for an apartment, car rentals, clothing, spa trips and more . Take the money: An investor alleges Guardino was set to stage her production at a theater in Manhattan when she left for LA . The show originally ran at the Theatre at St. Luke's, a 174-seat theater, to mostly positive reviews. Italian Bred even benefited from some star power, filling cameo roles with celebrities such as the Sopranos' Steve Shirripa and Vincent Pastore, and Sex in the City's Mario Cantone. On the Facebook page for Italian Bred, Guardino and Felicciardi claimed, 'We have an absolute contractual right to do a developmental production in Los Angeles.'","Brooklyn-born Candice Guardino lined up investors to stage a production of Italian Bred, a show based on her Italian upbringing .

"A man is fighting for his life after being shot by police responding to a domestic abuse call. Gerald Cole, 54, of San Angelo, was listed in critical condition yesterday following the incident in which he suffered at least one gunshot wound. According to the San Angelo Standard Times, police say they believe that no department policies were violated and 'very seasoned officers' were involved in the incident. 'As of right now, I think everything was perfect,' San Angelo Police Chief Tim Vasquez said. 'The officers reacted the way they were supposed to. A San Angelo police vehicle has two bullet holes in the windshield following a shoot out in Texas . 'I know the suspect was hit at least once; he's in critical condition, and I know my guys are fine. They followed policy, and it looks like their training has kept them alive today.' Vasquez said police responded to a call from a woman  who has not yet been named. She told them a man was threatening her with a firearm and he continued to call and text threats after leaving the area. 'Domestic violence continues to be our number one call for service in our community,' Vasquez said during a news briefing. 'We try to battle it as often as we can. Domestic violence has been a very tragic and too-often occurrence in our community, especially recently with the capital murders that have occurred.' A couple of hours after the initial domestic violence call, San Angelo Police Department officers tried to make a traffic stop on a vehicle that was circling the area. The vehicle, which looked similar to the one driven by the suspect,   did not stop, and police embarked on a short pursuit. When the vehicle did draw to a halt, the driver stepped out carrying a firearm which was later identified by police as a semi-automatic handgun. At this point Cole was shot by a police officer, although at present it is unclear how many rounds were fired or who fired them. A gun lies near driver's side door of a red Ford F-150 after a chase with San Angelo police responding to a domestic abuse call. The vehicle appeared to have multiple bullet holes . Gerald Cole, 54,  is taken into  an ambulance. He is thought to have suffered at least one gunshot wound . No officers were injured in the incident and neither was the women who made the initial call. The vehicle was identified as a red Ford Dodge Ram, which last night appeared to have multiple bullet holes. A police SUV had two bullet holes in the windshield. Vasquez said that video from officers' vehicles was expected to be downloaded and turned over to Texas Rangers to investigate the incident . He added that the initial call is being investigated as an aggravated assault, and that a second aggravated assault charge might be pending. He said police have secured a firearm, but did not specify what it was. He said law enforcement officers were still processing the scene and would be in the area for several hours.","Gerald Cole, 54, of San Angelo,  suffered at least one gunshot wound .

"Uber drivers protesting unfair working conditions and poor fares protested outside the company's Long Island City offices Monday. Most of the drivers are either SUV or black car operators and planned the protest after refusing to drive for Uber and in some cases going so far as to jump to rival business Lyft. This is the second protest Uber Drivers Network NYC will stage against the company in a week. Uber drivers protesting unfair working conditions and poor fares protested outside the company's Long Island City offices Monday . The strikers urged drivers to support them by shuting off their phones or refusing any Uber requests. Other drivers have posted about the strike to the company's Facebook, though Uber quickly deleted the posts. Buzzfeed reports that one of the driver's major issues is that Uber slashed driver's wages by extending summer discounts into the fall. They also complain that SUV and black car drivers have been forced to take lower rates for UberX riders - a non luxury counterpart to the company's black car service that carries a lower rate. Drivers said that by using taking UberX passengers they were making less than they would working only as a black car driver. And though they've attempted to opt out and work only as premium driver, they continue to receive UberX requests. If they take only SUV or black car requests, Uber could assign them low rider acceptance rates or temporarilly suspend them. Drivers said that by using taking UberX passengers they were making less than they would working only as a black car driver . 'Uber is basically abusing the driver,' said one driver who asked to be referred to as only Belal. 'They give us a 24 hour suspension and threaten that you will lose your . chance with Uber. To get a ride for $8.00, I’ll have to work the whole . day. Gas and insurance for SUV’s are expensive. I have to pay $80 to . $100 a day in gas.' He said since the company reduced fares in July to try and beat yellow cab UberX requests have skyrocketed. 'They make us work for UberX permanently because we received tons of . UberX calls per minute,' Belal said. 'This means we never get the chance to . accept black car or SUV cars. We can only pick UberX. It’s a strategy . for them to put us to work only for UberX. If they take only SUV or black car requests, Uber could asssign them low rider acceptance rates or temporarilly suspend them . 'They’ll forget that Uber drivers have been doing this business for 20 . years,' he added. 'They have more experience than Uber and all the . management of Uber. And Uber is not a company it’s an application. The . value of Uber, it’s our value. We are Uber. We are the ones who are . offering the service.

"Scottish MPs would be barred from voting on English issues under plans being drawn up by senior Tories. David Cameron has joined Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg in offering new powers over tax, welfare and spending if Scotland votes No to independence next week. But senior Tories say the ‘devo-max’ option would be ‘untenable’ unless it is accompanied by greater devolution for England. Scroll down for video . Former Tory Cabinet Minister John Redwood is among Tories calling for changes to be made which would exclude Scottish MPs from voting on exclusively English issues if devo-max is implemented . They are now pushing to revive plans devised for David Cameron before the last election by Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke, which would bar Scottish MPs from voting at Westminster on purely English issues. At the time, his plans would have prevented Scottish MPs from voting on health, education and local government. He added when Scotland wins the right to make more decisions following Alex Salmond's referendum, England will expect the same privileges . Under devo-max, they could also be barred from voting on critical issues such as the Budget and welfare reform. Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood, who is leading the campaign for reform, said an ‘overwhelming majority’ of Tory MPs believe the ‘lopsided’ arrangements must change. He said: ‘Scotland got first-class devolution, Wales got second-class, England got none at all. 'It meant English students going to Scottish universities have had to pay whilst Scottish students have gone free. ‘Once Scotland gets the right to make more decisions, England will expect the same powers. Everything that falls to be decided in Scotland by the Scottish Parliament would be decided by the English Parliament in England.’ Fellow Tory Andrew Percy said further devolution to Scotland would be ‘intolerable’ unless it were accompanied by a fairer deal for England. Mr Percy, MP for Brigg and Goole, added: ‘It’s a particular problem in the north of England if Scotland gets more tax powers.’ Downing Street yesterday would not comment on whether the rights of Scottish MPs could be restricted. Ministers are thought to be reluctant to raise the prospect ahead of the vote. But a Whitehall source said some change was ‘inevitable’.","Senior Tories call for greater devolution for England if devo max introduced .

"The public release of a video showing football star Ray Rice punching his now-wife in an Atlantic City elevator may have led to the termination of his contract with the Baltimore Ravens and an indefinite suspension from the NFL, but the disgraced athlete still has plenty of fans. And shockingly, a good number of those fans still supporting Rice are female. Scroll down for video . Standing by their man: Baltimore Ravens fan Bailey (above) doesn't agree with domestic violence she says, but says of Rice's attack 'it wasn't that big of a deal' Get over it: Holly Laucht, from Kent Island, Md., wears a Baltimore Ravens' Ray Rice jersey as she tailgates before the Ravens' NFL football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . Bring him back: Many feel that Rice's punishment was too harsh . Ravens fans were out in full force this evening as the team took on the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium, in Baltimore, Maryland, and there were plenty of people wearing Ray Rice jerseys, and happy to explain why they still support the team's former running back. 'There's two sides to every story,' said Bailey, a 23-year-old waitress from Baltimore who was wearing a black, rhinestone-decorated jersey with the white No. 27. 'I saw the video. That's their personal business, and it shouldn't have affected his career. I don't agree with domestic violence, but she's still with him, so obviously it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone should just drop it.' The team, meanwhile, has started a Ray Rice Jersey Exchange policy, allowing fans to trade in their Rice jersey for another player on the Ravens. They will also no longer be selling ray Rice jerseys. Return policy: Fans can exchange their Rice jerseys for any other player the team has announced, though it does not appear Karla Owens (above) will be doing that . Not everyone is a fan: One woman started screaming at someone wearing the Rice jersey, 'You support a wife beater!' Player no more: Rice had his contract with the Ravens terminated, and has been suspended from the NFL . It seems, however, that more than a few fans will be wearing their Rice jersey until it is in tatters. 'I took the bus here, so people were, like, ""Good, I'm glad to see to someone out here showing support,""' said Gage Friend, 18,  of wearing his Rice jersey. 'But I've also seen a lot of people giving me dirty looks and people saying stuff to me like, ""I can't believe you'd wear that. Don't you know what he did?""' The teenager added, 'Yeah, I'm pretty aware of what he did. And, yes, it was awful and it was definitely a mistake on his part, but he deserves a second chance. ... People have done so much worse in this league.' Not a fan: One person taped over his Rice jersey, writing Mike Tyson over his name . Stand by your man: Rice fans filled the stands . At least one fan was not fond of the jerseys though, screaming at one person wearing the white No. 27, 'You support a wife-beater!'","The Baltimore Ravens played the Pittsburgh Steelers this evening, their first game since the video of Ray Rice punching his now-wife went public .

"A teenager lost half her skull and broke almost every bone in her body after being crushed underneath a lorry. Danya Cope was listening to music through her headphones when she was hit as she crossed a road near her home in Plymouth, Devon. The 15-year-old's body was so badly crushed her mother could not tell if she was dead or alive as she lay trapped under the HGV's wheels. Danya broke her collarbone, pelvis, rib and leg and was left with a shattered bone poking out of her ankle. Danya Cope, 15, was left fighting for her life after she was hit by a lorry in February. Doctors were forced to cut a six to eight inch hole in her skull to reach her brain . Danya (pictured left before the accident) has just had an operation to put an acrylic plate onto the hole in her skull which will fuse with her own skullbone over time (pictured right) Danya broke her collarbone, pelvis, rib and leg and was left with a shattered bone poking out of her ankle . Her head was so badly injured she was taken straight into surgery where doctors had to slice away a six to eight-inch chunk of her skull to reach her brain. Her family was told that even if she survived she faced being in a coma for six months. But against the odds, the teenager woke up nine days later and doctors began operations to patch over the gaping hole in her head with an acrylic plate. Seven months on and Danya is ready to return to  school. The accident  happened in February as Danya was listening to music through her headphones as she walked to school. Her mother Zarina Cope emerged to find her daughter critically injured in the road, a scene she said must be 'every parent's worst nightmare'. Ms Cope, a supervisor at Clinton Cards, said: 'She left the house and I heard this awful noise. I just knew it was her. Zarina Cope said that seeing her daughter in the road trapped under the wheels of a HGV was 'every mother's worst nightmare' Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain . 'She was under the lorry and she was making noises. She didn't see it coming which probably saved her life in the way she fell. She doesn't remember any of it.' Danya was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but was then flown straight up to Bristol Children's Hospital. By the time Ms Cope arrived at the hospital Danya was already in surgery. She was told the devastating news that her daughter might not survive the operation. Ms Cope said: 'One of the surgeons came out after about an hour and a half and said they had done the operation but said she probably wouldn't survive. 'It was awful. Just to see her underneath the lorry - you just think 'is she alive or dead? 'But to hear she might not survive - there are no words to describe how I felt. 'They said she could be in a coma for three to six months. It was just like a waiting game of not knowing when she would wake up. But nine days later she did. 'The first words she said when she properly opened her eyes were 'I love you mum', which was so lovely to hear.' Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain. She has recently allowed home after her final operation, in which an acrylic plate was fitted to her skull to cover the hole created by the accident. Danya said: 'It still feels numb but feels pretty much normal. It felt heavy at first. 'I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school' says Danya, who will rejoin her Year 11 class soon . When Danya first opened her eyes after coming out of surgery, her first words were: 'I love you mum' 'The plate will mould into one with my skull. The stitches shouldn't take too long to fall out and then there is just three months where I might be likely to get an infection, but after that everything is done. 'My friends have all been amazing and supportive and I'm so glad I had them there. I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school.' Danya said that after her ordeal she wants to urge people to look twice as they cross the road. She added: 'I had my headphones in and was looking at my phone to pick a song. I must have just stepped out. That's all I remember. 'I broke my collar bone, one rib, had a fractured leg, pelvis and all the skin gone from my leg. 'I had a skin graft from my foot onto my ankle where the bone was sticking out.' Ms Cope lives with partner John Tremblett, 33, a plasterer, who has been Danya's stepdad since she was six. The couple also have a son, Ashby, four. The whole family have been amazed at Danya's recovery but they are anxious to warn other children not to listen to music as they cross the road. They said they do not blame the lorry driver for the accident, adding he was not charged with any offences. Ms Cope said: 'When we got back we tried to find out what happened to him. We didn't want to press charges, it was nothing more than an accident. 'We saw him when it happened and he was mortified.' The whole family have been amazed at Danya's recovery but they are anxious to warn others kids not to listen to music as they cross the road . Ms Cope added that she is proud of Danya for showing such resilience in a difficult situation. She said: 'Danya has handled it really well. If I had woken up in that situation and been told I had no skull on part of my head I would have been so freaked out. 'There were a few days when she cried but she has been so brave and resilient. 'All the doctors and nurses were amazed at her flying spirit and ability to heal really well. She has taken it all in her stride. 'She's my little miracle. I hope Danya realises how lucky she is and has a second lease of life.'","Danya Cope, 15, was hit by a lorry after crossing the road listening to music .

"Police have launched a criminal investigation into the death of a nine-day-old baby who contracted an infection from a suspected contaminated drip. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating the death of Yousef Al-Kharboush, who died in the neonatal intensive care unit at St Thomas' Hospital, south London, on June 1. They are also 'investigating the circumstances' of a second baby who died at the same hospital ten days later. Detectives from Cambridgeshire are investigating a third baby death. A criminal investigation has been launched after two babies died at St Thomas' Hospital, pictured, in June . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it was focussing on the production of the intravenous feeds and not the NHS trusts which run the hospitals where the babies died. The families of the babies involved have been notified, the spokesman added. The source of the infection was allegedly linked to an outbreak which is believed to have been caused by a batch of intravenous liquid called total parental nutrition (TPN). The feeds, manufactured by ITH Pharma in north west London, are designed to be given to babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own. It is thought they were given to babies in intensive care units in 11 hospitals across England. During the outbreak, there were 19 confirmed cases of babies developing sepsis, from which three babies died. The outbreaks occurred at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, The Whittington Hospital, Brighton & Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, Addenbrookes, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Peterborough City Hospital, Southend University Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Basildon University Hospital, and Harley Street Clinic.

Detectives from Cambridgeshire are investigating a third baby death, which took place at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured) 'Following discussion with the Crown Prosecution Service, we are investigating the circumstances of a second baby at the same hospital. 'The deaths took place of 'baby A' on Sunday, 1 June and 'baby B' on Tuesday, 10 June at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. 'Officers have also been liaising with colleagues in Cambridgeshire Constabulary about a third baby who also died in similar circumstances at the Rosie Maternity Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals. 'The families have been notified of this investigation by the forces concerned. 'The current focus of this investigation is on the production of intravenous feeds. We are not investigating the health trusts. 'The MPS is working with a number of agencies to progress matters.

'There has never been, nor should there be any suggestion of intentional wrongdoing by ITH Pharma or its employees. We understand it is normal practice for the police to investigate such circumstances and it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment during the investigation.'

"A woman who left a childhood friend in a coma after she ran over him while drunk driving has been jailed for two years. Sharon Ball, 25, left Sean Clements with shocking back injuries after she struck him with her car while more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit. Mr Clements, of Viewpark, Lanarkshire, was sitting on a grass verge with friends when Ball sped her Peugeot 307 off the road and slammed into them. Childhood friend: Sharon Ball, pictured outside court today, left Sean Clements, pictured right, with shocking back injuries after she struck him with her car while more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink drive limit . Onlookers managed to pull the car off Mr Clements, who was trapped underneath the vehicle. The 24-year-old, who was knocked unconscious by the force of the impact, spent a month in hospital and suffered third degree burns to his lower back and buttocks from Ball's spinning tyres. He had a bruised left lung and cuts to his scalp. He also had extensive skin grafts to treat his burn injuries. Scarred: Mr Clements spent a month in hospital and suffered third degree burns to his lower back and buttocks from Ball's spinning tyres. He had extensive skin grafts to treat his burn injuries (pictured) He is now receiving counselling for post-traumatic stress and can't work. Ball, a mother-of-one, had previously admitted being drunk at the wheel and striking Mr Clement and his friend Steven Millar with the car last July. She was today jailed at Hamilton Sheriff Court and banned from driving for three years. Defence lawyer John Costello said: 'The choice here is fairly stark and she fully expects to be getting a custodial sentence. 'I would have to concede that it would be merited given the nature of the offence. 'She does though have a young child who would be affected should she be in custody. She has a great deal of regret in this matter which is genuine. 'The complainants were all friends of her when this happened and she shows no malice towards them.' Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Clements said: 'I'm happy she has got what she deserved. 'Two years is better than nothing but I could have died that night and have been left scarred for life. 'We had been having a drink together that day with other friends and there had been no arguments or anything like that. 'Sharon disappeared at one point and turned up later racing her up and down the street. 'I thought she was just drunk and trying to show off. Then at one point I turned round and all I could see was the lights of the car coming right towards me. 'I had no time to get away and that's the last thing I remember. When I woke up in hospital two days later I couldn't believe it when my mum told me it was Sharon who had hit me.' Depute fiscal Paula Russell said factory worker Ball had driven at excessive speeds on the night of the incident and given a alcohol reading of 88mcgs of alcohol. The legal limit is 35. She said: 'As the vehicle stopped both men were underneath it. 'A large number of members of the public physically lifted the vehicle off him and freed him from underneath. 'It was noted by a doctor that without quick treatment Mr Clements' injuries could have been life threatening.' Sheriff Vincent Smith told Ball her early plea had persuaded him to reduce her jail term from 30 months. Struck: Mr Clements, of Viewpark, Lanarkshire, was sitting on a grass verge with friends, pictured, when Ball sped her Peugeot 307 off the road and slammed into them. Onlookers had to lift the vehicle off Mr Clements . He said: 'You drove in a particular fashion which went way beyond what could be described as dangerous driving. 'You were under the influence of alcohol and you drove a vehicle at speed and you were asked to slow down. 'You then mounted the pavement and persons who you were earlier with were on a grass verge. Two people ended up under the vehicle. 'The victim was taken to hospital and the doctors were of the opinion that had he not had treatment then he would have died. 'I would have imposed a period of 30 months but given the plea that will be reduced to 24 months.'","Sharon Ball, 25, struck Sean Clements as he sat with friends in Lanarkshire .

"A solar flare was revealed in a NASA YouTube video on Thursday. The Wednesday afternoon event was 'significant,' the space organization said in the video's description. 'Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground,' NASA said. 'However -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.' Scroll down for video . Beautiful! A solar flare was revealed in a NASA YouTube video on Thursday . Out of this world: NASA said the X.16-category flare was 'significant' Though the solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems. It has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun, Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, told The Associated Press Wednesday. The flare on the sun barely hits the 'extreme' on forecasters' scale, but with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking 'potentially strong' at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm, he said. New calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun likely will go north or above Earth this time, Berger said late Wednesday. So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth's magnetic field, it won't knock power systems off line, Berger said. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major. Not as scary as it looks! Though the solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems . Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people. 'We're not scared of this one,' Berger said. The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million miles per hour, meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. But it could be later, Berger said. Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people. 'There's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun,' Berger said. 'Because it's pointed right at us, we'll at least catch some of the cloud' of highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt Earth's magnetic sphere, which sometimes leads to temporary power grid problems. On the plus side, sun flares expand the colorful northern lights so people farther south can see them. But don't expect them too far south, Berger said. NOAA's National Weather Service Space Weather Prediction Center said a coronal mass ejection took place Thursday evening shortly before 7pm on Facebook. Accuweather.com reported Friday flares may be visible 'as far south as Maryland in the East and down over Nebraska farther west.' There may be storms Saturday, the Space Weather Prediction Center also said. Where can I watch? Accuweather indicated which areas of the US and Canada will be able to see the lights Friday .","NASA said the Wednesday afternoon solar flare was 'significant'

From today, he said, Australians will notice more security at airports, ports, military bases, government buildings, public landmarks and major sporting events. It's the highest alert level in more than a decade and means the chances of a terror strike is now considered 'much more likely'. 'Normal life in Australia can and must go on but there are people who wish to do us harm,' Mr Abbot said. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, shadowed by Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Colvin and ASIO chief David Irvine (left) has today announced an increase in the country's terror alert from medium to high . ASIO boss David irvine advised the Federal Government to increase Australia's alert level to 'high' Mohammad Ali Baryalei (left) and Mohamed Elomar (right) have been identified by Australian agencies as fighters with the so-called Islamic State . 60 known Australians are believed to be fighting with the so-called Islamic State in parts of northern Iraq and Syria and officials believe several have already returned to Australia. Among those identified by Australian agencies as leaving to fight with the Islamic State militants are the likes of Mohammad Ali Baryalei and Mohamed Elomar. 'We have no specific intelligence of particular plots,' Mr Abbott said. 'What we do have is intelligence is that there are people with the intent and the capability to mount attacks, here in Australia. 'We do know of people coming back from the Middle East, brutalised and accustomed to kill and do pose a direct threat to our community,' added the PM. Mr Abbott briefed Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and all state and territory leaders ahead of making the announcement. The Prime Minister on his way to announce that Australia's terror threat alert level has been raised to 'high' 'The only people who should feel in anyway impacted by this are terrorists,' the PM said. 'For the vast majority of Australians this will not change their daily life' It was a move flagged overnight by the ASIO Director-General of Security, David Irvine, who advised the Federal Government to raise the terror threat to high. 'For some considerable years, indeed since the Bali attacks, Australia and Australian institutions and people have been regarded by al-Qaeda and its offshoots as, they would say, legitimate targets for attack,' Mr Irvine said. 'Here in Australia a number of plots have been thwarted. The threat, therefore has always been with us. 'What has happened in recent months, has been that the events in the Middle East have increased the level of activity among people who support some pretty distorted views, extremist violent views,' Mr Irvine said. He said there are now up to 10,000 foreign fighters in the Middle East conflict and between 60 and 70 of those are Australians. 'There are people who have come home, and I use the figure tens, who have come home.' The ASIO boss said itt was a decision based on a range of factors; including the number of Australians currently fighting with and supporting terror groups overseas, those who have been identified as having returned from working with militant organisations in the Middle East, people in Australia who have been identified as having shown support for extremists and those have urged supporters to prepare to launch attack against Australia. 'This does not mean that a terror attack is imminent,' stressed the Prime Minister. The PM insists that normal life in Australia 'can and must go on but there are people who wish to do us harm'. 'The only people who should feel in anyway impacted by this are terrorists,' the PM said. 'This is about crime and combating crime. This is not about religion, this is about ensuring that this marvellous country of ours, this beacon of hope and optimism, continues to be just that.' Mr Abbott urged anyone who sees anything 'out of the ordinary' to ring the national security hotline 1800 123 400. Australian troops have been assisting the US military in humanitarian aid drops to impacted communities in northern Iraq and the delivery of weapons and other equipment to Kurdish fighters in the war-torn middle east, in their fight again the Islamic State but the Federal Government has yet to be asked for more specific military involvement. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has, however, announced that Australia is ready to 'play its part' in air strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Iraq alongside a US-led coalition of 'like-minded countries'.","Australia's terrorism threat alert is now at 'high' for the first time .

"A football team has caused an uproar among fans after proposing to use a real lion as their mascot during next season's AFL games at The Brisbane Cricket Ground. The Brisbane Lions hope to stage the caged team mascot as part of their pre-match entertainment next season at home grounds, which is commonly known as The Gabba. But the idea has sparked outrage as protesters took to social media, describing the act as 'cruel' and 'stupid', as some even plan to boycott future games. A live lion may be used as pre-match entertainment at football games next season at The Brisbane Cricket Ground . The initiative was put forward by the Brisbane Lions as the animal could act as their mascot . The club's CEO Greg Swann defended the proposed initiative, saying a decision is yet to be handed down. 'There has been a fair amount of hysteria today around the idea of having a real lion at our home games next season,' Swann said in a statement on Thursday. 'Let me be clear in saying it is an idea and only that. Brisbane Lions club's CEO Greg Swann . 'We simply asked ourselves whether we might be able to add the 'real thing' to a match day experience.' Swann revealed the live lion was just one of the many proposed initiatives discussed for next season. 'It is one of a number of initiatives we have discussed as part of planning for the 2015 season, and it has found its way into the media,' he said. 'Animal welfare would always be the overwhelming priority in any such idea, but let me stress we are only at a conceptual stage at the moment.' AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan described the proposal as a 'provocative idea'. 'Greg is making noise up there in Brisbane and we love that,' he said. 'I love the fact he's pushing the envelope.' However the proposal has enraged fans, who expressed their disgust on Facebook and Twitter. 'Kids want to see a person in a suit as a mascot not a living animal being stressed out in a cage,' Nikki Lobwein wrote. 'Very disappointing that you would even consider such a cruel and archaic idea.' It is believed the Lions club is speaking to zoos, lion parks and animal welfare groups . Fans expressed their outrage on social media, urging the club to reject the initiative . Gail Boyd encouraged others to boycott future games if the idea was approved . Barbra Bennett wrote that it was a 'stupid idea to have a live animal paraded around in a cage'. Gail Boyd says she expected her club to set a better example. 'How about the Brisbane Lions all come out with a huge collar and chains around their necks and see how it feels,' she wrote. 'Shame on your team for even considering this as entertainment ... I would encourage every Brisbane lions supporters and every other teams supporters that play against you to boycott the match/es you intend to have this animal at.' A Change petition has been circulating online, since the news came to light. Jordan Lees, who began the petition which has nearly 11,000 supporters, says a football field is no place for a lion. 'The problem with this proposal is that is continues a trend of exploiting animals for our amusement,' he wrote. 'A lion does not belong on a football field. There are many alternative methods of entertainment that Brisbane Lions may employ to attract more fans to the games. 'Perhaps winning more games would be a good place to start.'","Fans are outraged by the Brisbane Lions' proposal to have a caged lion at AFL games held at The Brisbane Cricket Ground .

"Sales of luxury cars have boomed in the first half of this year in signs that the economic recovery is picking up pace. There were 943 Bentleys registered in the first six months of 2014, compared with just 692 during the same period last year, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Sales of Maseratis almost doubled from 337 during 2013 to 624 this year, while Rolls-Royce also saw an increase in models sold, from 196 to 260. Brands such as Bentley, Maserati, Jaguar, Porsche and Rolls-Royce have all seen sales figures jump at the start of this year as the economic recovery takes hold . Figures released by the Government yesterday showed that in the first six months of this year, Maserati sold almost twice as many cars as in the whole of last year . According to The Telegraph, other high-end car brands, such as Porsche and Jaguar also saw figures increase by up to 20 per cent year-on-year. Speaking to Mail Online, Paul Watters of the AA said: 'There has been pent-up demand. 'To an extent luxury cars are a recession-proof item, but I think the recovery is now allowing more people to buy them who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it. 'In fact, a quarter of AA members say they are planning to buy a new car in the next 12 months, which seems to stack up that hypothesis.' The figures also showed that there were a record 35million registered vehicles on Britain's roads at the end of 2013, including 29million cars.

"Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to compete at the  2016 Paralympic Games if he has served his sentence by the time the Games get underway. The South African double-amputee has been found guilty of culpable homocide after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his Pretoria home but has not yet been sentenced. He could face 15 years in prison but may also walk free from court when sentenced by Judge Thokozile Masipa next month. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to compete in the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games as long as he has completed whatever sentence he is handed by a judge for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp . 'Providing he serves his sentence and he wants to compete, and if selected by the South African National Paralympic Committee, he will be free to compete in IPC competitions going forward,' IPC spokesman Craig Spence said. Spence said Pistorius, who has won six gold medals in three Paralympic Games, could not be denied the right to compete again as the IPC was not 'responsible for the punishment - that has come from the South African courts.' 'We are a sports organization,' Spence said. 'We have to differentiate between sport and what's gone on in his private life.' Event organisers described the athlete as an 'ambassador for the Paralympic movement' following his past sporting success . The double amputee shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a door at his Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year. He maintains he thought the model was an intruder when he opened fire . Xavier Gonzalez, chief executive of the IPC, said Friday that Pistorius' murder trial 'has not had any impact on our activities' because the organization is no longer dependent on the high profile of the South African. 'Oscar was a fundamental ambassador of the Paralympic movement in the period between 2008 and 2012,' Gonzalez said. 'Since then, the Paralympic movement has many other ambassadors and many other athletes that have been recognized globally and we believe that will continue growing as we lead up to 2016.'","International Paralympic Committee to allow disgraced athlete to compete .

"Father Paul Coleman said he was 'devastated' to hear of the death of Nicole's father, Antony Kidman . The Catholic priest who officiated at the wedding of Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban has spoken about the loss of the Oscar-winning actress's father. Long-time friend of the family Father Paul Coleman said he is 'devastated' by the news of Dr Kidman's death from a fall in a Singapore hotel room. The Sydney parishioner - who first met Dr Kidman when his oldest daughter was a student at North Sydney Girls school - said he was a good man and a 'great husband to his wife' who he regularly dined with. Father Coleman first met Nicole's parents at her confirmation when she was 12 - but knew Nicole from her time at North Sydney Girls School where he taught scripture. 'I knew him very well and I found him to be an honourable man, an upstanding person who was kind and generous,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Nicole Kidman with her late father Dr Antony Kidman who Father Paul Coleman said was an 'upstanding' man . 'I often dined with them (the Kidmans) and admired the good work he did in the community and at the Royal North Shore centre.' Dr Kidman was a clinical psychologist at Royal North Shore Hospital and a director of health psychology at the University of Technology Sydney. A friend of the family confirmed on Friday that Dr Kidman died from a fall in his Singapore hotel room while visiting his youngest daughter, Antonia, and six grandchildren. Father Coleman met Dr Kidman through Nicole when he was a scripture teacher at North Sydney Girls High School, before he participated in the confirmation of the Oscar-winning actress when she was about 12. He visited the school once a week for scripture teachings, up until when he left the The Parishes of Our Lady of the Way in 1986, but kept a closely-held relationship with the Kidmans that would see him unite Nicole and husband Keith Urban in 2006. When the pair advertised that they were engaged and wanted a traditional Catholic wedding down under, Father Coleman was the man trusted with the official duties at a ceremony in front of 238 friends and family at Manly, in Sydney's north. Father Paul Coleman officiated at the wedding of Nicole and Keith Urban in 2006 . He said he was 'humbled' by the opportunity to marry and counsel them on the meaning of a romantic marriage. 'I just prepared them,' he said, which involved advising the Hollywood actress and her country-rock husband on the 'importance of what they were doing.' 'I'm not married myself but I tried to draw them to the messages of marriage.' He also baptised their second child, Faith, in the NSW southern highlands. Father Coleman was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1948, and worked as a Father at the The Parishes of Our Lady of the Way from 1975 to 1986. He now spends most of his time working as a chaplain at Sydney's Mater Hospital where he visits ill patients and hospital staff. Father Coleman said he was being inundated with phone calls on Friday night in relation to Dr Kidman's tragic death. 'The family are shocked and everyone is ringing me up -  they are all shocked.' 'He was very open, a warm and friendly person of good character,' he said.","Father Paul Coleman had known Dr Antony Kidman more than 30 years .

"A hedge fund billionaire who is attempting to prohibit his wife from getting her hands on much of his fortune in their divorce proceedings has recently hired a new lawyer - for his three minor children. Kenneth Griffin, 45, had asked the court to appoint a children’s representative in his divorce against his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias-Griffin, and now both sides have agreed on an attorney for their children. This comes as Mr. Griffin, 45, is trying to get away with only paying out what he laid out in the couple's prenup, a cash settlement that amounts to about one percent of his wealth, and does not include real estate or the couple's art collection. Happier times: Kenneth Griffin (right), who filed for divorce from wife Anne Dias-Griffin in July, has found an attorney for his children . Honeymoon is over: The couple married at Versailles (above) with a performance by Donna Summer . His worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion according to Bloomberg News. He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990, which now manages roughly $16 billion in assets. Mrs. Dias-Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003. Their wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and  Donna Summer. As it pertains to the three minor children, ages six, four and two, Mrs. Dias-Griffin in seeking sole custody with 'reasonable visitation,' while her husband is asking for joint custody, according to the Chicago Tribune.

"Vietnam and the United States will soon resume limited inter-country adoptions, both nations said today. The announcement comes six years after a ban was imposed because of allegations of widespread baby-selling and children offered without the consent of their birth parents. Under the new agreement, Americans will be able to adopt children with special needs and those over five years of age. Five-month-old baby girls are cradled by workers at an orphanage in Bac Ninh province, near Hanoi, Vietnam . Adoptions will resume 'soon' once the Vietnam government announces which U.S. -based adoption service providers are authorized to represent American parents, the U.S. Embassy said in an advisory to journalists announcing a media event to discuss inter-country adoptions. Nguyen Van Binh, director of the adoption agency at the Ministry of Justice, said two U.S. agencies would be given licenses next week to operate in Vietnam. Prior to the ban in 2008, Vietnam was a popular destination for Americans wanting to adopt children. But the popularity led to concerns within the U.S. Embassy that the demand had led to a poorly regulated industry supplying young, healthy babies to prospective parents prepared to pay significant sums of money, raising ethical questions. In 2009, a U.N.-commissioned report on adoptions in Vietnam confirmed those allegations. It said cash payments by adoption agencies to orphanages led them to seek out children for adoption, often without proper checks into their background or their family circumstances. Some American senators and international adoption lobby groups have been urging Vietnam to pass stronger laws and better monitor the process so that adoptions could resume. The U.S. Embassy said the agreement was a 'success in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam.' There is limited demand among prospective adoptive parents for older children and those with special needs, meaning monitoring for any violations should be easier. A delegation of American senators which visited Vietnam last year said allowing for special needs adoptions would be seen as a first step to resuming all adoptions. Demand for inter-country adoptions has risen in recent years. For singles wanting a child, or couples unable or unwilling to conceive, the idea of adopting a foreign baby from an orphanage in a poor country is attractive. But programs in several developing countries, such as Haiti and Guatemala, have been beset by scandals and allegations of baby-selling. In September 2012, officials from Ireland and Vietnam signed an agreement to restart adoptions which were halted in 2009. Partly as a result of fears over baby-selling scandals, the number of international adoptions has fallen to its lowest point in 15 years, according to annual statistics compiled by Peter Selman, an expert on international adoptions at Britain's Newcastle University.","Announcement comes six years after ban was imposed due to allegations of baby-selling without parents' consent .

The jury was told that Lockhart, described as a prisoner at Saughton in Edinburgh, said: ‘What I did was wrong. ‘I have no excuse for it. I just snapped after a drunken argument with Janet.’ The agreement continued: ‘I don’t  feel sorry for myself but I feel sorry for everyone in her family.

Paul Simpson, who worked alongside Lockhart at a funeral parlour, told how Lockhart had phoned him early in the morning on December 28, but spoke to his partner. Returning the call, the 33-year old said ‘He (Lockhart) was quite hysterical and kept saying “I have lost my family and done something stupid”.’ ‘I asked him about that and he said: “They are away. I have done something really bad”.’ Sgt Kevin Clark, 45, described how he had forced entry into the home. As he approached the main bedroom he found a piece of paper at the door. It read: ‘I am not a bad person. Shots of alcohol made me bad. I hope I rot in Hell.’ Shining his torch on the  bed, Sgt Clark said he saw two bodies.

Taylor, 31, who is a member of the Sto-Rox School Board, punched through a car's window. David Williams, a 35-year-old Pennsylvania State trooper, ignored orders to back down and eventually assaulted two Pittsburgh police officers who were called to the scene,according to authorities. All three were taken to Allegheny County Jail.

'There are two sides to every story… and this one here, we felt the facts as they were presented in the criminal complaint were wholly inaccurate,' said David's defense attorney, David J. Shraeger.

"An independent Scotland may not be allowed to have a team at the next Olympics, it was claimed yesterday. A Yes vote would also cause divided loyalties and concerns over sports funding. Sir Craig Reedie, a Scot who is Britain’s most senior Olympic figure, believes there has been a lack of detailed information about the impact on sport of separation. Sir Craig is vice-president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), president of the World Anti- Doping Agency and was chairman of the British Olympic Association at the time of London’s 2012 Games bid. Scroll down for video . Sir Craig Reedie, a Scot who is Britain's most senior Olympic figure, said Sir Craig Reedie, a Scot who is Britain's most senior Olympic figure . He said he believed the IOC would allow Scotland to compete separately – but that the timescale was ‘very tight’ for the Rio 2016 Games. Sir Craig added: ‘If the outcome of the referendum is Yes, there will be a period of uncertainty for Olympic sport. The uncertainty lies around what happens if and when Scotland would become an independent nation that is officially recognised by the international community. ‘There are lots of complicated things to negotiate and I have heard people say it would be done by March 2016, but the timing will be very tight.’ Meanwhile, the Sport and Recreation Alliance, an umbrella group of 317 governing bodies, fears the referendum will mean ‘fundamental’ changes to some aspects of sport. Head of policy James Allen said: ‘Irrespective of the outcome, there are going to be changes, even if there is greater devolution. Sir Craig Reedie, a Scot who is Britain's most senior Olympic figure, believes there has been a lack of detailed information about the impact on sport of separation . ‘If there is a Yes vote, the biggest and most immediate change would be the potential creation of a Team Scotland and the end of Team GB as we know it. ‘The second big area of concern and anxiety is funding. UK Sport supports a large number of athletes in Scotland, but we don’t know what would happen there. 'Is lottery funding going to stop at the Border? The uncertainty is not helpful when athletes want to be focusing on training for competition.’","'Yes' would cause divided loyalties over sports funding, Sir Craig Reedie said .

"A sham marriage operation was uncovered after a couple who could not speak the same language had to resort to an iPhone translation app in the register office, a court heard. The cross-Channel ‘delivery service’ scam which brought in brides from Eastern Europe was well organised and was compared by prosecutors to the retailer Amazon. Up to ten women were ferried from Dunkirk to Dover before tying the knot. Hamid Mushtaq, 24 (left), and Blanka Farkasova, 35 (right), are among the couples accused of arranging sham marriages in which some partners did not even speak the same language . The brides-to-be were ‘ordered’ by prospective Asian grooms with ‘questionable’ immigration status – many foreign students desperate to stay in Britain. One bride, a mother-of-six, was said to have booked a flight back to Prague in the Czech Republic within hours of tying the knot. Another groom was said to have used an iPhone app so he could talk to his wife-to-be. Avtar Singh and Melania Jakabova first aroused suspicion when they registered notice of intention to marry in Shrewsbury in 2013. The officiating registrar, Paul Ainscough, said they seemed unable to talk to each other without the help of the app. Describing the couple’s big day, on March 5, Mr Ainscough added: ‘The wedding seemed to be a choreographed performance. The hem of the bride’s dress was soiled and she wore it without any deportment or sense of occasion.’ Indian national Singh, 37, of Wolverhampton, admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and awaits sentence. His bride Jakabova remains at large. Now two couples have gone on trial accused of taking part in the scam. Manchester Crown Court heard Hamid Mushtaq, 24, of Manchester, and Pavlina Kratka, 28, got married before going to a local KFC to celebrate. And, just a few hours after her marriage to Waqas Hussein, 25, – also of Manchester – Blanka Farkasova, 35, allegedly booked herself a flight back to Prague. Prosecutors told the jury at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) that one bride booked a flight to Prague within hours of tying the knot while a second couple went to KFC to celebrate their union . All four deny conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Registrars became suspicious when they saw that the couples interacted awkwardly. Czech-born Klement Buncik, 43, who denies nine charges of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, was allegedly mastermind of the operation, bringing in brides between September 2012 and June last year. They were Czech nationals and therefore EU citizens, a court heard. Darren Preston, prosecuting, said: ‘This is a delivery service, but unlike a delivery you might order from Amazon, [Buncik] is delivering women.’ The trial continues.

"Babysitter Jay Miller, pictured, has been jailed for 30 months for beating a toddler in his care . A babysitter who battered a toddler so badly his thumb and fingerprints were left on the child's face, has been jailed for 30 months. Jay Miller, 21, broke the two-year-old's arm, held her by her ears and hit her head while the youngster's mother was out of the house, Cardiff Crown Court heard. A judge told Miller that the 'emotional impact' on the little girl he attacked could not be measured. The bruises and arm fracture - caused by pulling and twisting, according to doctors - were sustained while the little girl's mother was attending a hospital appointment and on another was out at a JobCentre meeting. The mother said Miller told her, 'they'll blame me - I'm going to prison' when she called an ambulance. Her mother claimed she had heard him muttering 'I'm sorry, I'm so sorry' while her granddaughter was being put in plaster. Miller, from Barry, South Wales, had denied one charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm and four of actual bodily harm. He claimed the spiral fracture happened by her falling off a bed. And he said the bruising had happened a couple of days before when she slipped down a grass bank and into a wall after he allowed her out of her pram while taking her for a walk. Miller told Cardiff Crown Court: 'I have got a bit of a temper but it is not as bad as everybody is making out.' Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett accused him of losing his patience when the child either didn't use her potty or would not eat food he had prepared for her. Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, heard how Jay Miller battered a toddler so badly his fingerprints were left on the child's face . Expert witnesses Dr Stephen Chapman, from Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Dr Paul Davies, who works at the University Hospital of Wales, said a spiral fracture would be 'unique' and a case for the record books if it was caused simply by falling from a bed. Defence lawyer Kevin Seal told the court: 'He still protests his innocence and he faces jail with trepidation.' Recorder Jonathan Furness told Miller: 'There are profound implications for the child and mother and the emotional impact of the case cannot be measured.'","Jay Miller broke two-year-old's arm, held her by ears and hit her head, a court heard .

"Amelia Horn, who used the alias Logan Montoya, blackmailed two dentists by threatening to expose them . A call girl threatened to expose two dentists for having underage sex unless they paid out thousands of pounds by pretending she was 17. Escort Amelia Horn, who used the alias Logan Montoya, masterminded the plot so the terrified men would give the money to her and her two accomplices. Although she was 24, Horn and her accomplices pretended she was 17 to give them leverage in their blackmailing scam. The dentists - who feared the exposure would ruin their lives, careers and reputations - handed over £16,500 in return for the trio keeping their meetings with Horn a secret. At one point, Horn's friend Luke Burton, 31, demanded £5,000 off one of the dentists, by threatening to sell photographs of him 'having sex with a minor' to a newspaper. The other victim transferred £10,000 to Horn's account in return for her silence. The 24-year-old - who once appeared in a national newspaper, claiming to be a nymphomaniac - even went to one of the men's surgery's for treatment while blackmailing him. After she was caught, she told police: 'To be honest these men make me sick, they pay me for unprotected sex. I just wanted to scare them, you know.' Mobile phone footage also emerged showing the gang dancing and cuddling each other over the success of their scam. In the video, retrieved after their arrests, the third defendant Loretta Isaac was also seen putting her face up to the camera and yelling: 'Blackmail, blackmail.' Horn, from Stockton-on-Tees, and Burton, from Birmingham, were today jailed for 30 months, after admitting blackmail. Isaac, 24, who was Burton's girlfriend at the time, was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, after admitting possession of criminal items. Judge Peter Armstrong told Horn she had 'started things rolling' by blackmailing the first of her two victims. He said Burton had then 'jumped on the bandwagon' and had demanded more cash from both her victims in two phone calls on the same day. Judge Armstrong said Isaac's involvement was less serious but that she had anticipated being paid some of the money 'knowing full well where that money had come from.' During the hearing, Teesside Crown Court heard how the first victim, a married man from Newcastle, became involved with Horn and met her five or six times for paid sex. Rupert Doswell, prosecuting, said 'The first complainant, who I will call Professional Man A was a dentist by profession and at the time was practising in Newcastle. He is a married man with children. 'He became involved with Amelia Horn, who was working as an escort and he paid her for sex. She said she was 23 and from Middlesbrough and he met her five or six times. On one occasion she visited him at his place of work and received dental work. 'On August 11 last year, a couple of months later, Mr A received a message on his mobile phone from Amelia Horn demanding £5,000 from him and that if it was paid he would not hear from her again. 'He was distraught and thought she would ruin him, his career and his family and he paid £5,000 into her bank account. Horn and her accomplice Luke Burton were jailed at Teesside Crown Court, pictured, for their part in the blackmail . 'Then at 3pm on Friday November 29 he was at work when he received a call from a man saying he was a relative of Amelia Horn. In fact it was Luke Burton. 'He told Mr A he was aware he had been seeing Logan Montoya, which was an alias used by Horn. Loretta Isaac, 24, was jailed for possessing criminal items . 'He told MR A that she was under age and that if he didn't pay £10,000 by the middle of the next day he would go to the press and turn up at his house and speak to his wife and family. Mr A paid him the money.' Mr Doswell said the second victim was also a dentist who found Horn while looking on an adult website on his iPad in November last year. He found 'Logan,' who appeared to be in her twenties, and they arranged to meet for sex in an apartment on the quayside in Sunderland. The court heard how, after he had paid her £200, Horn performed oral sex on him. She later asked several times what he did for a living. In the following days, the man began to receive text messages from Horn. One of them said she desperately needed £1,500 for building work on her home. He agreed to pay her the cash in return for the equivalent amount in sexual favours. But each time he contacted her afterwards, Horn made excuses not to meet for sex. She later asked for a further £2,500, of which he gave her £250. Then, on November 29, Mr B was called by Burton - the same day that he had threatened the first victim. Burton demanded £5,000, saying he would expose Mr B if he did not pay up. Burton said he photographs of him 'having sex with a minor' and would give his story to newspapers. He even suggested the headline: 'Depraved dental surgeon pays 17-year-old for sex.' But the trio's plot came to an end when the second victim went to the police and told them what had happened. All three were arrested. Rachel Dyson, for Horn, said: 'She accepts responsibility for these offences and understands the consequences and impact on the two gentlemen involved.' She said Horn had suffered a troubled childhood, having been in care homes and foster placement. The court heard Horn has had a baby since the offences took place and had proven herself to be a good mother. Earl Pinnock, for Burton, said he had only been involved in the plot for one day - on November 29 last year. He added that, during his time in custody, his younger sister had died of cancer. Joe Hingston, for Isaac, said she had suffered a difficult past having had a 'delinquent teenage life fuelled by alcohol.' He said she still battled with a drink addiction but her only part in the plot was being Burton's girlfriend and agreeing to receive some of the money. Sentencing, the judge told Horn: 'To make a demand of £5,000 from someone in his position is a very serious offence of blackmail, made more serious because you threatened to reveal the truth. No doubt terrified of being exposed, he paid the £5,000 into your account.' He told Isaac: 'On a video that was recovered the three of you were dancing around and you were calling out ""blackmail,blackmail"", as if it was something worthy. It wasn't, it was a despicable course of conduct.'","Amelia Horn, 24, used alias Logan Montoya while working as an escort .

The shoe sits alongside iconic styles like the Rally, shining for fall with a metallic polka dot print and coordinating trim that pops against jewel tones; and the Champion, offered this season in denim and wool to add layers of warmth and texture. A bold floral with a dot overlay, sweet hearts on repeat, and a unique embroidered emblem featuring Taylor's favorite number round out the collection. Finishing touches include a special charm in one of two styles: a gold heart with the number 13, or a guitar pick in antiqued brass with Taylor's logo inscribed in the middle.","Keds' 16-piece Taylor Swift collection inspired by star's style starts at £35 .

"A Kentucky teenager was killed in his home after trying to protect his mother from her estranged boyfriend, and the woman was abducted and later found dead in Ohio during a multistate police search, a sheriff said Friday. The suspect, Terry Froman, 41, of Brookport, Illinois, was taken into custody in the Cincinnati area and faced murder and kidnapping charges back in Kentucky, said Dewayne Redmon, the sheriff in Graves County in western Kentucky. The suspect was taken to a hospital to be examined, Redmon said. Slain: Michael 'Eli' Mahoney was killed in his home after trying to protect his mother from her estranged boyfriend, Sheriff Dewayne Redmon said . Mother: Kim Thomas, Mahoney's mother was reportedly abducted by estranged boyfriend Terry Froman . Froman's vehicle was stopped by Ohio authorities, who found 34-year-old Kim Thomas dead inside, the sheriff said. According to WHIO, Froman had shot himself. Thomas 'was found naked and bloody, and likely was shot multiple times,' the affiliate station reported. Earlier Friday, authorities found the body of her 17-year-old son, Michael Mahoney, in the front part of their home in Mayfield, Kentucky, Redmon said. There were signs of a struggle, he said. 'What we believe, apparently the son intervened and tried to protect his mother, and it cost him his life,' the sheriff said. The teenager suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and an autopsy was scheduled, said Graves County Coroner Phillip McClain. A coroner said that Mahoney suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and Thomas was later found dead inside Froman's car . Michael Mahoney attended Mayfield High School. Students formed prayer circles after learning of the tragedy, and grief counselors and youth ministers were brought to the school, said school district spokeswoman Kim Hamby. Kentucky authorities were tipped off when a bloodied Thomas was seen trying to flee from a vehicle at a food mart in Paducah, Kentucky, Redmon said. Froman caught her, put her back in the vehicle and fled, he said. That prompted the multistate police search that included the vehicle's license plate and descriptions of the man and woman inside, Redmon said. Ohio authorities spotted the vehicle in the Cincinnati area and stopped it, he said. Crime: Mahoney's body was discovered in the front yard in Mayfield, Kentucky .

"F1 mogul Eddie Jordan has bought a £25million super yacht that is so big it is almost classed as a ship. The 155ft-long vessel has been commissioned by the 58-year-old and will blow his current 120ft-long boat out of the water. But it pales in comparison to the Eclipse, the world's largest private yacht. Owned by Chelsea football club oligarch Roman Abramovich, that vessel is a staggering 536ft-long and cost £272million. It has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine. Scroll down for video . Under construction: A computer-generated artist's impression of what Eddie Jordan's £25million yacht will look like when it is completed later this year . Sunseeker boss Robert Braithwaite stands in the enormous hull that is currently being built at his company's headquarters in Poole, Dorset . But even the Eclipse will soon be . dwarfed by a yacht currently being built for the Saudi royal family. Known only as Project Azzam, it will be 590ft-long and cost £400million. Still, Mr Jordan can take comfort in . the fact his yacht will have four decks to house 12 close friends as . well as ten crew members. Construction recently began at Sunseeker headquarters in Poole, Dorset, and floor-plans have hinted at what will be contained within. The sky deck could boast a giant hot tub and bar and the upper deck will feature a luxurious dining area. An on-board nightclub will be built . and, after a tiring night of partying, Mr Jordan and his guests will be . able to relax in the lower deck day-room. There will be a ‘beach club’ stern . and ‘panoramic viewing platforms’ down the side, giving guests a front . row seat for the Grand Prix at Monaco. The yacht will have an on-board garage complete with small boats and jet skis. It will cost approximately £30,000 to fill up the super yacht with fuel for her 4,500-mile range. A team of workers began building the 500-tonne vessel in April. Construction is expected to be finished by December next year. It will be the largest ever built by . Sunseeker, a firm that has long been a favourite with F1 drivers . including Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton. Robert Braithwaite, founder of . Sunseeker, said: 'She will not be owned by many but those that do will . be buying a craft of exceptional style, quality and innovation.' Mr Jordan owns a 120ft vessel named ‘Snapper’, which is currently moored in Monaco. Now a commentator at the BBC, he is a . member of the Royal Cork Yacht Club in Ireland and has keen interests . in extreme sports outside of sailing, including skiing. Last month, stunned photographers captured images of the Project Azzam vessel as it was transported out of the 170-metre dry dock at the yard of German shipbuilder Lurssen. It had because too large to build inside. The yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly moved to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers could continue with their work. Peter Seyfferth, from TheYachtPhoto.com, said: 'The photographers who took the pictures of Azzam were overwhelmed by the size of it. 'It is difficult to say at this stage but I think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then Eclipse. 'There appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there. 'In terms of length, we think it will be around 180-metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships. 'If it has been commissioned for the Saudi Royal Family it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.' The yacht's 'beach club' stern. It will also have 'panoramic viewing platforms' down each side side, giving guests a front row seat for the Grand Prix at Monaco . Yacht fans: Mr Jordan (left) may live a life of luxury, but his yacht is almost like a toy when compared to the private boat owned by Roman Abramovich (right) Huge: Eclipse, owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Mr Abramovich, has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine . Official details on mega yachts, such as Project Azzam and Mr Abramovich's Eclipse, are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers. But they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire's flotilla. It is thought a yacht this size will cost its new owner around £400million - and that is just the initial payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs. The yacht's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to man it 365 days of the year. Lurssen, which is building Azzam, has refused to discuss the top secret yacht although rumours in the industry are that is being build for Saudi billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal. Al-Waleed, 57, is worth around £10billion and a member of the Saudi royal family. If he is the owner, he is thought to have ordered the new toy as a replacement for his Kingdom 5KR yacht, which he has enjoyed for the past 20-years. When the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the French Riviera but there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - Monaco and Antibes.

"When nurse Jane Wilkinson-Tancock saw another mother zooming away from the school gates in a flashy Audi convertible, she started to think she might be in the wrong job. So she decided to forge a career for herself on the sidelines – or rather on her living room sofa. Now the 43-year-old is one of a growing number of ‘middle-class gamblers’ who hope to make a fortune by trading on the stock exchange from the comfort of their own homes. Scroll down for video . Part-time trader: Jane Wilkinson-Tancock, from Crediton, Devon, with her children, (L-R) Charlotte, 7, Chloe, 4 and Rufus, 5, spends her spare time playing the stock market . Recalling her moment of inspiration at her children’s school, Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock said: ‘I asked my friend, “How does she have a car like that?”. And she said, “Oh I think she trades in stocks and shares”. ‘So I came home and Googled “trading” and started messing about and having a play.’ Thanks to speedy broadband internet, anyone can buy or sell stocks or bet on currency fluctuations on their home computer or laptop. For Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, it means she can juggle caring for her three children, her £25-an-hour part-time nursing job and the dream of getting rich quick. She said: ‘I probably do spend too much time on it. It is like an addictive computer game. ‘I can fit it round my family life, although it can be tricky when the children want to watch a film just as I’m about to do a big trade. ‘I find the best time to trade is between 1pm, when the American markets wake up, and 5pm, when the British markets go to bed. There seems to be a lot of volatility then. But I have to pick up the children from school at 3.30pm, so I often have to drag myself away. ‘Sometimes I stay up late at night so I can concentrate properly for a few hours.’ Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, who is featured in new BBC2 documentary Traders: Millions By The Minute, taught herself about the stock exchange with YouTube videos. She then started ‘dummy trading’ on a website that allowed her to bet on the real international currency markets with imaginary money. In a year, she had made a theoretical £1.8million, with a starting base of £300,000, just by guessing which currencies would go up, and which down. Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, 43, says she has made around £1,000 since she started trading, but admits her success it is more down to luck than judgement . She then raised £6,000 to start trading with real money. In her first day, she made £99.50. On her second, she made £105. But on the third, she lost £350 when she accidentally traded £30 instead of £3, and forgot to put on a ‘stop loss’ to limit her exposure to the market. At one point, her fund went down to £3,856, but she claims that after six weeks of real trading she has made around £1,000 in total. Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock admits her success has more to do with luck than skill. ‘I know this is just betting under a more acceptable name – it is betting for the middle-classes,’ she said. ‘I’m not very good with numbers. But what I’ve learned to do is literally just look at the chart and guess, and think which way it’s going to go.’ According to the BBC2 programme, only 10 per cent of the 100,000 retail traders in Britain make a consistent profit. While Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, from Devon, would like a smart new car, she says her real aim is to make enough money to allow her more time with husband Alan, a 44-year-old sales account manager, and their three children, Charlotte, seven, Rufus, five, and Chloe, four. ‘When you’re a working mum, you’re meant to be able to juggle everything,’ she said. ‘What I’d really like is more time to spend with my family. I don’t need a fancy lifestyle or foreign holidays.’ Traders: Millions By The Minute starts on Monday at 9pm on BBC2.","Jane Wilkinson-Tancock one of a growing number of 'middle-class gamblers'

"A crew of Saks Fifth Avenue employees have been arrested after going on a  $400,000 shopping spree at the luxury store using customers' credit cards. The six members of staff treated themselves to hundreds of pairs of designer shoes and handbags through an elaborate scheme that fraudulently used the credit cards of at least 22 customers. According to the criminal complaint, police last week uncovered the scam and recovered a number of the stolen items from the ringleader's apartment in Queens, N.Y. Tamara Williams, 36, is alleged to have stolen customers' credit card data from the store computers and then shared the information with five Saks sales associates. The six employees bought hundreds of pairs of designer shoes and handbags from the New York store . It is thought she then gave her accomplices specific lists of what they should buy from the store with the stolen credit card information. The five 'fake shoppers' would buy the high-priced goods using the unsuspecting customers’ credit information, the complaint stated. Some of the items were returned to Saks and the charges were returned to fake accounts created by the suspects. The crew were caught on surveillance footage carrying out the elaborate operation, and this was then shown to police. The process was able to continue for four months until the group were caught on surveillance footage carrying out the elaborate operation, and this was then shown to police. Williams' apartment was raided on Friday and police found 'over one hundred boxes of shoes... as well as many boxes of handbags and other merchandise', the criminal complaint stated. Four men and one woman have been arrested in addition to Williams. Kris Rockson, 45; Jason Chance, 25; Michael Knight-Williams, 44; Michael Bright-Asante, 39, and Alaia Harrison, 20, have all been charged with grand larceny and identity theft.","Six employees bought hundreds of pairs of designer shoes and handbags .

"British children under ten are being turned into 'junior jihadis' as extremists bombard them with dangerous propaganda, London's deputy mayor warned today. Stephen Greenhalgh revealed he and Boris Johnson have both been briefed about radicalised primary school pupils as fears grow extremists are using the capital to spread hate. His stark comments came ahead of a private meeting with police commissioners from across Britain to discuss the alarming spread in Iraq and Syria of the militant group Isis. Stark warning: London's deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh (left) warned today that authorities are telling him about cases of Islamic extremists under the age of ten. Fears have grown over the rise of Isis (right) Radicalised: Many of the extremists fighting with Isis are young and hundreds of jihadis are thought to be from Britain. Pictured, militants who allegedly seized an Iraqi army checkpoint in Salahuddi this week . 'Some of them are very young,' he told the Evening Standard. 'We are talking about under the age of ten. 'It starts very young with them being subjected to propaganda, extremist ideology, and being trained to be junior jihadis. 'It’s pretty horrendous when you hear how some of these children are being radicalised. The threat of radicalisation of young people is real and this is a problem that is going to be with us not just for a couple of years, but for the next generation.' Tory Mr Greenhalgh, 47, is the politician in charge of London's policing and crime. His comments came ahead of a private meeting today with police and crime commissioners from Britain's largest cities to discuss the growing threat of Islamic extremism. Frightening: The group's influence has spread through the use of social media and analysts fear disaffected young people inner-city areas such as London, Birmingham or Manchester could be particularly vulnerable . Worry: Mr Greenhalgh (left) said he and London mayor Boris Johnson had both been briefed on cases of primary school children who have been subjected to extremist propaganda, a problem he said is here to stay . According to the Standard, those attending included the police commissioners for Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds alongside Scotland Yard's former counter-terrorism chief Commander Helen Ball. The outcome of the behind-closed-doors meeting, which was also attended by the House of Lords' former anti-terror supremo Lord Carlile, has not been disclosed. The Home Office already fears around 500 Britons have left the country to fight with extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, some of them still in school. In July it emerged 16-year-old star college pupils Salma and Zahra Halane, from Chorlton, Manchester, had abandoned their homes to fly to the rapidly expanding warzone. Disaffected youths in parts of east London, which has the combination of a large Muslim population and high deprivation and unemployment, are feared to be particularly vulnerable to hate preachers. Today a think tank said there was a real and present danger of some of those fighting in Iraq and Syria carrying out terrorist bombings when they returned home. The Henry Jackson Society, whose previous supporters have included the former education secretary Michael Gove, said the odds of a 'blowback' attack should not be underestimated. Between 1999 and 2010, it said, 19 per cent of all terrorists had received foreign training - but this figure rose to 41 per cent for those directly involved in the eight major bomb plots on Western soil. 'At least 500 British Muslims have travelled to Syria,' it said, 'with up to 300 already back on British soil.' The report added: 'For almost three decades, small numbers of British Muslims have fought for Islamist terrorist groups abroad and/or travelled to foreign conflict zones and ungoverned spaces to receive training from terrorist groups, most notably al-Qaeda-affiliated training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Fight: Isis militants have swept through Iraq and Syria, including the Iraqi city of Mosul (pictured in June), enforcing an extreme interpretation of Sharia law under their version of Sunni Islam . Worry: It is not only Britons who have gone to fight abroad - Interpol is searching for these two teenage girls from Austria. Samra Kesinovic, 16, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, both come from Bosnian refugee families . 'Upon their return, a small but significant number of these were involved in specific terrorist plots and attacks; the radicalising impact of others has been widely evident across numerous terrorism offences in the UK to date.' A row erupted last month after a black flag said to resemble that of Islamic State was hoisted over the gates of a housing estate in Poplar, east London - only to be torn down by a furious nun. Sister Christine Frost, 77, a nun who works at a nearby church, used a stepladder to remove the flag out of fear it could be seen as 'aggressive' or 'insensitive'. The flag had been raised next to others calling for Palestinian freedom, but anti-extremist campaigners said the raising of the black flag was a 'provocative' act and undermined legitimate anger about last month's violence in Gaza. Islamic State militants have swept through huge tracts of Iraq and Syria, taking authorities by surprise and enforcing an extreme interpretation of Sharia law under their version of Sunni Islam.","Stephen Greenhalgh said very young children are exposed to 'propaganda'

"An overwhelming majority of English voters hope Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom, a poll reveals today. But they say that regardless of the referendum result, Scottish MPs at Westminster should be stripped of the right to vote on issues which have been devolved to Holyrood. And if Scotland does vote for independence next Thursday, a clear majority of English people believe they should not be allowed to keep the pound – a slap in the face for Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond. Scroll down for video . The Populus survey for the Daily Mail shows that 70 per cent of voters in England want Scotland to stay in the UK, with just 20 per cent happy to see it break away in next week’s referendum. The finding contradicts suggestions that most English voters would be only too happy to wave goodbye to Scotland. The poll also shows that many English voters are unhappy that the future of the UK has been left entirely to the Scots. Fifty-six per cent believe voters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should have been given a say in such a fundamental decision. But the survey also reveals growing English resentment at the raw deal England gets from the current devolution arrangements. Almost two-thirds said Scottish MPs at Westminster should be barred from voting on devolved issues that no longer affect their constituents. Such a move would prevent Scotland’s MPs voting on a wide range of issues, including health, education, transport, criminal justice and local government. But, if plans to hand the Scottish parliament powers over tax and welfare go ahead, Scottish MPs could also be barred from voting on the Budget – potentially jeopardising the chances of a future Labour government enacting its main policies. First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond last week celebrated when a shock poll claimed 51 per cent of Scottish voters had sided with the Yes campaign. The Better Together crusade has since taken over again in some polls . The move was floated by the Conservatives in opposition and is now being considered seriously again by senior Tories. The poll suggests broad support for giving Scotland more powers if it remains in the UK, with 48 per cent supporting the idea and 26 per cent opposed. But it deals a major blow to Mr Salmond’s demand that an independent Scotland should be allowed to continue to use the pound as part of a currency union with the rest of the UK. Barely a quarter (26 per cent) of English voters support the move, with 53 per cent saying an independent Scotland should not be allowed to keep the pound. David Cameron urged voters in Edinburgh to sway towards the No campaign while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg visited voters in Selkirk in a last-ditch attempt to save the union this week . All three main parties at Westminster have ruled out a currency union with an independent Scotland, as has the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. Mr Salmond insists that a deal is possible, but today’s poll suggests that any attempt would be firmly rejected by English voters. This would leave Scotland forced to set up its own currency, join the euro, or continue to use the pound without the backing of the Bank of England. The last of these options would leave it unable to set interest rates or limit borrowing, and would remove protection for its banks. The overwhelming majority of English voters also believe Scotland should be forced to take its share of the UK national debt if it does go independent. With just six days until the historic referendum, the poll reveals most English voters want the Scots to remain part of the UK despite claims by the Yes campaign that the country would be better off separated . The poll is revealed after contrasting reports found different campaigns to be in the lead with less than a week until the referendum . Only 4 per cent believe the Scots should be let off the hook, with 83 per cent saying Scotland should be forced to pay its way. But there was better news for Mr Salmond on the monarchy, with 40 per cent of people in England happy for the Queen to remain as Scotland’s head of state, and only 26 per cent opposed. The Queen is thought to be alarmed and saddened by the prospect of the break-up of the UK. But the majority of voters (51 per cent) believe she should resist calls to intervene in the debate, with 29 per cent saying she should speak out.","Survey reveals 70 per cent want Scotland to stay part of the union .

"A Melbourne ice lord who mistakenly thought his ""cook"" was stealing from him has been jailed for callously kidnapping and killing the man to protect his drug operation. Brok Seckold, 31, carefully planned how he would murder and dismember 23-year-old Yengo Faugere after police raided a Canterbury laboratory where Faugere produced methylamphetamine for him. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said Seckold was obsessed with succeeding in his drug business, and killed Mr Faugere because he thought he had taken drugs to sell on the side. Murder victim Yengo Faugere who was just 23 years old when he was killed and dismembered . Seckold believed Mr Faugere had betrayed him because media coverage of the 2011 Canterbury raid did not show any methylamphetamine in the lab and he believed Mr Faugere was siphoning-off precursor chemicals. Seckold kidnapped Mr Faugere in October 2011, drove him 200km out of Melbourne, shot him and dismembered the body. Justice Lasry on Friday jailed Seckold for 32 years. He said Seckold did not once stop to hesitate about doing such a terrible thing to another human being. ""All you could contemplate was either punishment of Faugere or protection of your drug business,"" Justice Lasry said. ""The community must be genuinely affronted that people like you can kill for such thoroughly despicable reasons."" Seckold denied killing Mr Faugere but pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and weapons charges. Justice Lasry said apart from Seckold's desire to make money by selling drugs, there was little that explained how he could plan and commit such a callous killing. ""More serious cases of murder are few and far between,"" he said. Seckold, of Maribyrnong, must serve 25 years before being eligible for parole. Speaking outside the court, Mr Faugere's mother Florence Pinto said she was happy the long process had come to an end. ""That brings some closure to us, his family, and his younger brothers,"" Ms Pinto told reporters.","Melbourne ice lord who mistakenly thought his ""cook"" was stealing from him has been jailed for 32 years .

"What do a £1,000 holiday, nine Mars bars, juggling balls, a broken dog chew and cut-price kebabs have in common? They are all among the unusual 'thank you' gifts given to police officers in Cambridgeshire. One female officer was surprised and delighted to be given two pheasants, while other colleagues received four cans of lager, bags of crisps and even a filter for a vacuum cleaner. A list of presents received by Cambridgeshire police officers has been revealed, and it includes bizarre gifts such as a broken dog chew toy, a free holiday and home-grown potatoes (file picture) The list of presents received in recent years has been released following a Freedom of Information Act request. Some were passed on to charity, including a digital radio, food hamper and cash – but not the £1,000 voucher for a free holiday. PC Paul Huggett noted that he was given 'one broken dog chew', while a constable in Ely was given a 'small discount' at Ali's Kebabs. Swavesey Village College gave an officer a bottle of wine and in Ely a member of the public gave a female officer an 'afternoon fishing for her husband'. Tickets to the circus, horse races and a Tina Turner concert were also received, along with three cut-throat razors, lunch at Park Lane Hotel and a bag of home-grown potatoes. Chief Constable Simon Parr received a bottle of port from the Cambridge Magistrates' Association and, just before Christmas, two theatre tickets worth £15 each. A Cambridgeshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'The force has an open and honest gratuities and gifts policy which relies on staff and officer honesty and discretion; in-line with the College of Policing's Code of Ethics. 'All staff and officers have to register all offers or acceptances of gifts, including meals and refreshments. Singing their praises: One grateful member of the public gave an officer tickets to see Tina Turner in concert . 'The purpose of the database is to ensure there is a transparent and auditable process in place. 'In the majority of cases the gifts are small and from members of the public who want to thank officers for the service they have received. Larger gifts are fairly rare.' He added that officers can accept gifts worth less than £20 in value but anything more valuable needs prior approval from the force's Professional Standards Department. 'In all but the most exceptional circumstances gifts in excess of £50 will become the property of the relevant force,' the spokesman said. 'All cases where approval is sought for gifts over £20 will be logged in the gifts and hospitality register.'","Police officers in Cambridgeshire given a haul of bizarre gifts by the public .

"The medical director of the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic has stepped down following the throat procedure that led to Joan Rivers' death, it was reported today. Dr Lawrence B. Cohen performed the procedure on the star before she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest on August 28. Rivers was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the Manhattan clinic. She never regained consciousness and died at age 81 on September 4 after being taken off life support. A Yorkville Endoscopy spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline today: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.' Scroll down for video . Dr Lawrence Cohen (right) has stepped down from the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in Manhattan where comedienne Joan Rivers (left) stopped breathing during a throat procedure on August 28 . Sources told ABC that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Ms Rivers. Neither Dr Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat specialist, who has not been named, has been accused of wrongdoing. The specialist was brought into the operating room by Dr Cohen, Ms Rivers' own gastroenterologist, during her examination on August 28, The New York Times reported. Ms Rivers had gone to the clinic because she had a sore throat and felt hoarse, friends said. She attended the clinic because going to a hospital would have brought more publicity, a source told The Times. The specialist examined Ms Rivers' voice box before and after Dr Cohen performed an upper endoscopy procedure, according to The Times. An upper endoscopy visually examines the upper digestive system by using a miniscule camera on the end of a long, bendy tube. The procedure is used to diagnose conditions in the esophagus, stomach and sometimes small intestine. A source also told The Times that the ENT specialist did not have the correct credentials to work at the Yorkville clinic. The ENT was identified as an observer not a doctor - and one member of staff even assumed that she was Ms Rivers make-up artist, according to The Times. The Upper East Side clinic denied on Wednesday ever administering general anesthesia or conducting a vocal cord biopsy as has been alleged in media reports on Ms Rivers' death. Sources told ABC that Dr Cohen allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the Yorkville clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side, to examine Ms Rivers . The clinic did not mention Rivers by name but issued the . statement hours after NY Daily News reported on Tuesday an unplanned vocal cord biopsy at the clinic had left Ms Rivers unable to breathe. 'A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at . Yorkville Endoscopy,' said the clinic, which specializes in . gastrointestinal procedures. 'General anesthesia has never been . administered.' The cause of Rivers' death is still unknown pending further . tests, according to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The State Health Department is reviewing documents and . medical records, and interviewing staff and physicians at the . clinic, which opened in February 2013. 'The investigation is ongoing,' a department official said . on Wednesday. Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said its board-certified anesthesiologists use . light to moderate sedation and monitor the patient continuously . using state-of-the-art equipment. Three to four . anesthesiologists are on duty at any given time. 'Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the . criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a . hospital,' it said, adding it also has all the airway equipment . needed for emergency intubation. The clinic said every patient is pre-screened by their . gastroenterologist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse before being . treated. In a 2009 medical journal report, Dr Lawrence Cohen argued that the sedative propofol can be administered safely by non-anesthesiologists, typically nurses, following a debate among medical experts about the drug being used in endoscopies in the wake of Michael Jackson's death. Despite anesthesiology guidelines saying sedatives should only be used by people trained in the field, Dr Cohen told medpagetoday that the data spoke quite clearly to the contrary. An emotional Melissa Rivers and son Cooper say goodbye to Joan Rivers on September 6 in New York City . Rivers was known for her brash style, numerous cosmetic . procedures that she joked about in her comedy routines, and the . catchphrase, 'Can we talk?'

"This is what a marathon in the sky looks like – and it isn’t pretty. Hundreds of ‘vertical’ runners put themselves through complete exhaustion when they raced to the top of Beijing’s tallest building this week. China World Trade Center Tower 3, an 82-storey behemoth, rules the Chinese capital’s skyline with a height of 1,082ft and while many of the athletes managed to conquer it, some failed to scale its 2,041 steps because they were too tired to continue.

"A Chinese woman has lived to the age of 24 with part of her brain missing, before the extremely rare condition was detected. Doctors at the Chinese PLA General Hospital of Jinan Military Area Command in the Shandong Province made the discovery when the woman visited medics complaining of nausea and dizziness. Scans revealed the woman had been born with a cerebellum - the part of the brain responsible for posture, balance, motor learning like kicking a ball, and speech. It is located at the base of the skull and contains around half the neurons - cells that transmit information - in the brain, and represents around 10 per cent of the brain's mass. Scroll down for video . A woman in China lived to the age of 24 before doctors discovered she had been born without a cerebellum - the part of the brain at the base of the skull (shown in the scan as the black space) which is responsible for posture, balance and speech . It emerged the woman had experienced problems, not learning to talk until she was six and failing to walk until she was seven. While it is not unknown for a person to lose partial function of the cerebellum due to an injury or disease, completely lacking the region in the first place is extremely rare. Physicians believe the woman is only the ninth known case of a living person suffering the condition cerebellar agenesis. Doctors learned the woman had never played or jumped like other children her age, and is unable to walk steadily without support . Tests revealed she had no problem understanding words but living without a cerebellum meant she had difficulties with pronunciation. Her voice trembles, her words are slurred and the doctors treating the 24-year-old described her voice tone as 'harsh'. Specialists discovered the space where the cerebellum should be was empty. Instead, the black space was filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain, providing defence against disease. Doctors believe the woman is one of just nine people in the world known to have suffered the extremely rare condition cerebellar agenesis. File picture shows how a fully-formed brain should look . Doctors treated her with a dehydration treatment to remove some of the water pressure building up in her brain. Mario Manto, who researches cerebellar disorders at the Free University of Brussels in Belgium, told the New Scientist: 'These rare cases are interesting to understand how the brain circuitry works and compensates for missing parts.' The doctors looking after the patient, said they believe the normal cerebellar function may have been taken over by the cortex. At a follow-up appointment four years later she was showing signs of doing well, it was reported in the journal Brain. The woman married, and gave birth to a daughter with no neurological abnormalities. While the majority of people born with the rare condition will die in infancy, the patient represents a new opportunity to study the effects of living without the cerebellum.","Chinese woman visited doctor complaining of nausea and dizziness .

"Even among all the dastardly deeds King Richard III might have committed, there is one crime of which he never stood accused – he never harmed a goldfish. But five centuries on from the much-maligned monarch’s reign, he has become embroiled in a row he could never have foreseen. The murder of the Duke of Clarence in a modern-day interpretation of Shakespeare’s play has incurred the wrath of animal rights champions – after it was alleged a goldfish was injured during the performance. Scroll down for video . Richard III, starring Martin Freeman (pictured in character) is at the centre of a cruelty row over the treatment of a goldfish during the show's fish tank drowning scene . In one scene Martin Freeman's Richard III orders the death of his brother Clarence who is drowned in a fish tank (pictured) A woman who bought a front-row seat to watch Martin Freeman, star of the BBC’s Sherlock, play Richard at the Trafalgar Studios theatre in London, claimed to have seen a fish squished during a scene in which Clarence’s life is despatched in a tank of water. She reported the production to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals group (Peta), claiming the goldfish was ‘ground up with the gravel and pushed up against the sides of the tank’ as the actor ‘thrashed around wildly’. Peta contacted director Jamie Lloyd to complain the life of the goldfish was being placed in peril of injury or death. Campaign co-ordinator Kirsty Henderson asked him to stop using live fish for entertainment in what she described as an unsuitable environment. In a series of tweets, Mr Lloyd responded by insisting: ‘As a strict vegan, the safety & welfare of the goldfish in Richard III has been my top priority. They are growing & flourishing.’ He added: ‘No goldfish has been harmed or killed in Richard III. We’ve followed very strict guidelines to ensure their well-being & happiness.’ The modern take on Shakespeare's historical Richard III has been playing on the West End since July 1 . Eight goldfish are employed in rotated pairs to depict Clarence being murdered in the tank, which then appears to fill with blood. Clarence has earlier described a ‘drowning’ dream in which he sees fish gnawing at the bodies of shipwrecked men. In the original Shakespeare play, Clarence is stabbed and drowned in a butt of malmsey wine. History does not record if goldfish featured in the murder, but none is mentioned by the Bard. Peta says in its letter to Mr Lloyd that experts report fish to be ‘intelligent, sensitive animals who feel pain just like humans do’. They also possessed long-term memories and complex social structures. It concluded: ‘Taking them out of the production altogether is the only way to ensure their welfare and would in no way affect the success of the show itself.’ Yesterday Mr Lloyd agreed to withdraw the fish from the production, which opened on July 1 and is scheduled to run until September 27. He added in a statement that the goldfish were supplied by a reputable dealer and cared for under RSPCA-approved conditions to ensure no distress was caused to them. If only the same could have been said for the Duke of Clarence. George Plantagenet, the 1st Duke of Clarence was Richard the III's brother and is a key character in William Shakespeare's play. In original versions, the play opens with Clarence being framed for treason before he is arrested and taken to the Tower. Martin Freeman (pictured left alongside actress Lauren O'Neil), 43, is playing the evil king at London's Trafalgar Studios . In one scene, Clarence recounts a nightmare of being pushed into the ocean and drowning - later on in the play he is attacked by assassins sent by Gloucester, the man who framed him, and is stabbed and drowned in a butt of wine. In the version - set in 1970s Britain and starring Martin Freeman - the butt of wine was ditched for an office fish tank in a modern twist on the gruesome murder.","Animal campaigners hit out over use of live fish in the Shakespeare play .

Wanted evidence: Ryan Arakaki says he knows that filming while driving is illegal but he wanted evidence of the assault so that he could file a police report . Arakaki claims that Ong tailed his car for five minutes and shouted profanities. 'Why don’t you get out of your car you f***ing fat ass. Bite me,' Ong can be heard yelling from her window while at a stop sign as she holds up her middle finger. Later, she got out of her car in the middle of the road as her child still sat inside and stormed up to Arakaki's window. You can hear me on the video saying, 'That's assault. That's assault.' But she really didn't care,"" said Arakaki to reporters. 'She was pretty much off on the deep end already. She was pretty upset.'

'I was super, super angry. I really was angry,' said Kimberly Ong. 'And, of course, he was taunting me somewhat. So, that obviously made me even angrier. I'm not the most happy about it. But, I could have probably chosen some better words to use. I was upset and it's apparent. I don't totally 100 percent regret it.' Arakaki said that he can understand why Ong got so upset and attributed it to the fact that he cutting her off could have caused an accident. He says that her having her son in the car might have made her even more anxious. 'What made her upset was she wasn't paying attention and I cut in front of her or changed lanes to get in front of her and she probably looked up, probably stepped on the gas and probably almost rear-ended me and she was upset that she had her son in the car and almost got into a car accident,' said Arakaki. Not only did Arakaki almost start an accident but he broke the law by using a camera while driving. Arakiki says he knows that what he was doing was illegal but he wanted to document the fight so that he could file a police report. According to police, Ong's attack on Arakaki qualifies as, 'unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle.'

"He became an internet sensation after an unprompted interview in which he endearingly used the word 'apparently' eight times - without even knowing what it meant. But apparently - adorable five-year-old, Noah Ritter, has a new favourite throwaway term - 'seriously'. The charming ginger toddler appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show last night with the chat show hostess introducing him with 'apparently, our first guest is an internet sensation and apparently his video has over 15 million views, apparently'. Scroll down for video . Noah Ritter makes the shock announcement on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he has a new favourite word . A smartly dressed Noah then swaggered on to the stage to the sound of exuberant cheering and clapping before embracing DeGeneres in his arms. On cue, the toddler then trumpeted to the audience 'this is my first time on a talk show' before waving towards appreciative fans - he could have fooled us. But the big news of the night was when he told the crowd that 'he got over' the word 'apparently'- whether he ever learned what it meant or how it is spelt is uncertain. When asked what his new preferred word was, he jubilantly proclaimed 'seriously' before launching into an arm-waving celebration. After achieving world-fame with his hilarious first interview with WNEP TV at the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania - Noah may struggle to reach such heights again with his new word. The confident toddler affectionately hugged the chat show hostess after walking on to the stage yesterday . Natural: Noah Ritter, five, found fame after an interview in which he repeatedly used the word 'apparently' - above, he explains on the Today show that he does not know what the word means . Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview with WNEP TV last month. A newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda. Reporter Sofia Ojeda struggles to keep a straight face in the interview  -which has more than 15 million YouTube views . Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.' The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice. Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.' The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?' To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.' Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times. Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'","Noah Ritter, five, achieved bizarre fame after hilarious TV interview .

"Long periods of darkness have traditionally been associated with depression. But now a study says that high levels of sunshine - at least in the short term -  are linked to higher suicide rates. While a cause is not known, it's thought that the light could interact with the mood-altering neurotransmitter serotonin, which affects the mood of both humans and animals. Researchers from the University of Vienna have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates. They found suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny (stock image shown). However if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped . The research from the University of Vienna, reported by LiveScience, appears in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. They looked at sunshine hours and suicide rates in Austria from 1 January 1970 to 6 May 2010. Sunshine hours were calculated from 86 meteorological stations. The study looked at more than 69,000 suicides over the 40 years. They found that, on each day studied, sunshine hours and the number of suicides were highly correlated. Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a neurotransmitter - a chemical substance that transmits nerve impulses across the space between nerve cells or neurons. It plays an important part in the regulation of learning, mood, sleep and helps control blood vessels. It has also been linked to anxiety, migraine, vomiting and appetite. ‘Sunshine on the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide seems to facilitate suicide,’ the researchers write. However, prolonged sunshine 14 to 60 days prior to a given day was found to reduce the rate. The researchers also found a stronger link between suicide rates among women and sunshine hours. For men, on the other hand, the link between lower suicide rates after prolonged sunshine was stronger. The exact reason for the results of the study is not known, but previous studies have shown that light interacts with serotonin, a neurotransmitter in humans and animals that affects mood. This means exposure to sunlight could alter serotonin levels and lead to erratic behaviour and emotions. The researchers also found a stronger link between suicide rates among women and sunshine hours. For men, on the other hand, the link between lower suicide rates after prolonged sunshine was stronger.Sunlight is thought to alter levels of serotonin, which is known to affect peoples' moods (stock image shown)","Researchers from the University of Vienna have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates .

"George Zimmerman allegedly confronted another driver during a road rage spat, during which he asked 'Do you know who I am?' and threatened to kill him. Lake Mary police are investigating two reports involving the driver and 30-year-old Zimmerman, who was acquitted last year of a second-degree murder charge in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. Police say that on Tuesday, Matthew Apperson, 35, was driving when he noticed a truck that 'stayed next to him, not accelerating or slowing' before he came to a traffic light. Police released 911 calls from . Apperson, in which he identifies Zimmerman as the driver and says he was 'threatening to kick my ass and shoot me,' and that 'he was gonna shoot me dead.' Scroll down for video . Quiz: George Zimmerman is caught on police bodycam after he was stopped this week for threatening a driver . Stopped again: Zimmerman was stopped after allegedly threatening to kill Apperson, and in dash cam footage, an officer is seen pulling a firearm from his waistband . According to a police report, Apperson later stated had seen the 'occupants were yelling at him'. When he lowered his window, Zimmerman said: 'I f**king kill you. Do you know who I am?' Apperson: I was simply driving down Lake Mary Boulevard, left my work to get a cup of coffee, and I noticed a Honda Ridgeline on Lake Mary Boulevard that was going the same rate of speed as I, and rolled their window down.I then rolled my window down and there was a passenger going, 'Hey, what's your problem? Why are you shaking your finger?' I said 'Excuse me? I was in my car, rapping to myself with my windows up.' And I looked over and George Zimmerman was the driver. And they were threatening to kick my ass and shoot me.'Dispatcher: You know this was George Zimmerman?Apperson: Oh, for a fact! So I proceeded - I had no cell phone - so I proceeded to the nearest gas station where I could use the phone. He then came up in his Ridgeline - this will be on camera - towards my car, almost hit my car [unclear] said he was gonna shoot me dead. Apperson said he drove to a nearby Circle K store and the truck had followed him. The police report states that as Matthew exited his vehicle, 'the gold pick-up truck drove toward him, and stopped and began yelling at him again.' He went to the store and asked to use the phone to call the police. Zimmerman was gone by the time officers arrived. When speaking with Apperson, the officer stated he 'observed a bulge in the front' of Apperson's pants, and asked if he was carrying a firearm. Apperson produced a firearm and his concealed weapons permit, then placed the gun in the trunk of his car. Two days later, the man called 911 again, saying he saw Zimmerman in his truck outside his office at W K White and Associates Inc, a company described on its website as social security disability specialists. Apperson says he recognized the truck by a sticker on the back with the logo of Kel-Tec, a firearm manufacturer. After spotting the truck, Apperson told police he saw it 'accelerate hearing the tires ""chirp,""' Police arrived as Zimmerman's truck was leaving and questioned him. Zimmerman told the officers that he had just come out from an appointment at Waymont Court, the same development where W K White is located, and offered to show them a receipt as proof. After shaking hands with the officers, Zimmerman left. Officer Bianca Gillett, spokesperson for the Lake Mary police department, told MailOnline, 'the officers on scene did not verify Mr. Zimmerman’s appointment, as they did not further the investigation since the victim did not wish to prosecute.' Apperson: This is the location of the incident where this guy road raged on me, so apparently he's thinking I live or work around here, which is definitely the truth. It's really disheartening to see him lurking around here. Keller Williams Realty is the business. Dispatcher: For you? Or what he's parked in front of.Apperson: That's where he's backed in. He's backed in trying to hide, right at the Keller Williams Realty. As you first drive in to Waymont Court, the first set of buildings on the right. 'As of now, the incident is . closed. If the victim did wish to assist with prosecution, we could . reopen and review the incident at that time,' she added. Apperson told MailOnline on Friday afternoon he did not want to comment on the incidents until he had spoken to his attorney. According to police, he declined to press charges. After he was acquitted of second-degree . murder following the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Zimmerman has had . numerous incidents of trouble with law enforcement. CNN reported . that in September 2013, Zimmerman was detained but no charges were . filed after his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, 26, called 911, saying . her husband had threatened her and her father. The couple was in the middle of divorce proceedings when Zimmerman confronted Shellie at their home. Zimmerman allegedly punched Shellie's . father and smashed her iPad. In the 911 call, Shellie explains Zimmerman . left the house but waited for her outside in his truck. 'He's . in his car and he continually has his hand on his gun, and he's saying, . 'Step closer,' she tells the operator. 'He's just threatening all of us . with his firearm.' No charges: Alleged victim Matt Apperson, 35, pictured here with his partner Liza Mariel Irizarry-Apperson, declined to press charges against Zimmerman . Let go: Zimmerman was allowed to go by police because Apperson said he did not want to press charges . Two . months later, Zimmerman was in custody again, this time for aggravated . assault with a weapon and two misdemeanors after his new girlfriend . phoned 911 during an altercation. According to USA Today, Zimmerman's girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, 27, ordered him out of the house, at which point he 'cocked the shotgun' and put it in a case with his AR-15 assault rifle. As . Scheibe began moving his belongings out, Zimmerman took the shotgun . back out, pointed it at Scheibe and 'asked her if she really wanted to . do that.' Rage: . George Zimmerman, 30, is accused of threatening to kill another . motorist after an exchange where he asked 'Do you know who I am?' Scheibe later retracted her allegations and asked for charges to be dropped, saying, 'I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts that in my statement to police.' Zimmerman phoned police afterwards to clarify the incident, claiming an argument had taken place over Scheibe's pregnancy. Huffington Post later reported that Scheibe was not pregnant at the time. Back in July, Gawker reported that Zimmerman was spotted in the parking lot of Pampano Pat's Motorcycles, which sells guns along with bikes. Zimmerman told police he was 'helping protect the store for the owner,' but according to the owner, Pat Johnson, he hadn't hired Zimmerman, saying he 'has sat outside of his store several times on his own lately.'","Matthew Apperson, 35, reported Zimmerman pulled up next to him and the passenger asked, 'Why are you pointing a finger at me?'

"Three suspected metal thieves who were caught on top of a church’s 100ft bell tower have been let off by police – after claiming they were ‘free climbers’. The men were spotted on St Peter and St Paul’s Church, in Kilmersdon, Somerset, after dark. Residents suspected they might be trying to strip lead from the Grade I-listed building’s roof and called the police. Cowering: The helicopter's thermal imaging camera - which uses heat to distinguish objects in the dark - caught the three suspected thieves as they flattened themselves against the roof of the Grade I-listed building . A police helicopter was scrambled, which captured the men on its thermal imaging camera as they lay on the top of the bell tower. But the gang claimed they were simply free climbing, an extreme version of rock climbing where no ropes or other safety equipment are used. The men were allowed to go after police searched them and the church revealed nothing had been stolen in the incident, which took place at around 10.15pm on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the church said: 'The first we knew about it was when the police helicopter turned up. 'Thankfully nothing was taken and it appears that no damage was done either. Apparently it was just some boys messing around, having a joke. 'The scaffolding has been up now since the start of August as they are repairing stone work on the tower. 'Thankfully this is the first time anyone has attempted to climb it and we hope it will be the last, we would hate for anyone to get hurt.' Spotted: Police officers on the ground spotted the three men as they climbed scaffolding on the side of St Peter and St Paul's Church, in Kilmersdon, Somerset, pictured, which was undergoing renovation work . Under construction: St Peter and St Paul's church, pictured, is currently covered in scaffolding. One local resident thought that the suspected thieves might have been trying to remove lead from the building's roof . The church, which dates back to the 15th century, has been undergoing repairs because of extensive decay and was fixed with scaffolding. It is on English Heritage’s list of buildings at risk, who said it is in ‘poor’ condition. Last year a group of veteran bell-ringers, including their 90-year-old leader, were forced to flee the church’s tower after a 50kg bell broke loose and crashed through two floors towards them. The eight parishioners said it ‘scared the living daylights out of them’, but nobody was seriously injured because the bell became stuck 30ft above their heads. The latest incident comes after a spate of metal thefts in the area. St Nicholas Church, in nearby Radstock, had lead stripped from its roof twice in just a month during the summer, resulting in thousands of pounds of damage to the Grade II-listed building when the roof leaked. Avon and Somerset police reported 69 cases of metal theft from churches in the area between 2010 and 2013. Metal theft is not a crime defined by law but is recorded under broader crimes such as burglary and other theft. Last year, amid growing public pressure, MPs called for the Government to act to prevent metal theft by stopping cash transactions in the scrap metal industry and by making sellers provide ID. The Home Office revealed there were 61,349 metal thefts recorded by police between April 2012 and March 2013. That accounts for roughly two per cent of all police recorded crime in England and Wales over the period.","Police spotted the men as they climbed scaffolding on Somerset church .

"Members of the public are being asked to design the 'tails' side of the new £1 coin in a nationwide art competition. Chancellor George Osborne said the design will be 'in millions of people's pockets and purses' when the coin is launched in 2017. The new coin will be the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny or 'thrupenny' bit, which was in circulation until 1971, and officials say designers claim the new coin will be the hardest to copy in the world. Scroll down for video . Members of the public are being asked to design the 'talks' side of the new £1 coin which will be launched in 2017 . Ministers say urgent action is needed to combat the number of counterfeits in circulation. The Royal Mint estimates that an astonishing 45million £1 coins – 3 per cent of the total – are fake. The figure is as high as 6 per cent in some parts of the UK and two million counterfeits are removed from circulation every year. The competition to design the 'tails' side of the coin is open to anyone, irrespective of how old they are or where they are from, the Treasury said. All entries must be submitted by October 30. Entrants are being asked to 'show what Britain or 'Britishness' means, drawing on all of the qualities and quirks that make our nation unique'. Mr Osborne said: 'Today we're asking people across the UK to help us design the new £1 coin. Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted the design to capture Britishness . 'Think about your favourite landmark, or a great British achievement or a symbol from our Islands' Story. 'The winning design will be in millions of people's pockets and purses. It'll be heads you win; tails, it's your design.' The £1 coin has been in use since 1983 – much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – and 1.5billion were in circulation as of March 2013. The outdated technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters. Its replacement will be roughly the same size with security features including bi-metallic construction, the 12-sided design and the use of iSIS – integrated Secure Identification System. This means an additive is built into coins which can be authenticated by high-speed scanners. The technology will allow vending machines to spot fakes much more easily. The competition is open to anyone who wishes to enter, irrespective of how old they are or where they are from, the Treasury said. All entries must be submitted by October 30. According to the rules of the competition, the denomination 'one pound' must appear as part of the overall design but it is left up to the designer precisely where this is placed. Designs must not include a recognisable likeness of a known person, whether living or dead and designs must be the entrant's own work. Artworks can be submitted in pencil, ink, paint or using computer drawing or design software, but three dimensional entries cannot be entered. All designs need to be presented on a template which can be downloaded from the Royal Mail's website. People can enter more than one design if they wish, provided the entry is completed on the template, alongside a unique reference code which will be used to track the entry. Giving tips to inspire competition entrants on its website, the Mint says designs should 'symbolise the UK in a clear and unambiguous way'. It says: 'Whatever you choose as your inspiration, it must be readily understood to represent Britain. 'Think of symbols, heraldry, words, aspects of the natural world, man-made structures such as buildings and monuments, British achievements, whether social, political or cultural, and British institutions.'","Competition launched to design the reverse image of the 12-sided coin .

"A law which would force future governments to increase Britain’s bloated aid budget was voted through last night in the face of furious opposition from backbench Tory MPs. Crucially, Conservative MPs were ordered to vote in favour of the proposed law, which would make the Government’s controversial policy of spending a minimum 0.7 per cent of national income on international aid a legal requirement. It means Britain’s aid budget – which is already £12billion a year – will continue to grow if the economy grows, unless the law is repealed. Last night, one furious MP described it as a ‘sop’ to ‘Guardian-reading liberals’. Ministers today backed a Lib Dem proposal to enshrine in law the Government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid. Supplies of UK aid were dropped over northern Iraq last month to help fleeing Yazidis cornered by ISIS terrorists . But Government support for the Bill, which was proposed by a backbench Liberal Democrat MP and is also backed by Labour, means it is much more likely to become law. Significantly, it could also derail attempts by Tory MPs to pass into law a Bill for an EU referendum in 2017 by taking up limited debating time. A Liberal Democrat Bill on the ‘spare room subsidy’ is already on its way to the House of Lords and after yesterday’s vote, supporters of the EU referendum Bill will find it much more difficult to find the time to debate it. A group of Tory backbenchers furiously opposed the aid Bill, warning about the dangers of waste and corruption in aid spending. Conservative MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, described the Bill as ‘gesture politics of the worst possible kind’. He added: ‘If you criticise Britain’s huge, often mismanaged, aid budget you are accused of not wanting to help the neediest in the world. [The Bill] says we are going to spend the same amount of money every single year in perpetuity. Tory MP Philip Davies said the Bill was only going through Parliament to 'make a few middle-class, Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders' feel better about themselves . ‘That is basically an acceptance that our assistance will fail, that it will not turn around a country’s fortunes or deal with the causes of poverty, and that it will just be a hand-out to make a few middle-class, Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders with a misguided guilt complex feel better about themselves. 'It will do nothing to alleviate the real causes of poverty in those countries.’ Former Scotland Secretary Michael Moore introduced a private members bill today calling for the Government to commit to spending a minimum amount on foreign aid . He said that at a time of national austerity, huge increases in aid spending ‘at the same time as we have been making the case that we have got no money is completely and utterly ridiculous’. Tory backbencher Sir Gerald Howarth asked why international aid spending was being singled out when defence spending was ‘allowed to go hang’. Sir Edward Leigh said Conservatives should be ‘judged not by how much we spend on something but by the value for money of what we achieve’. However, International Development Minister Desmond Swayne backed the Bill, saying Britain’s aid spending could help reduce the number of migrants trying to arrive here from Calais. He said: ‘There are all sorts of arguments to be had about whether it should be 0.7 per cent and a long debate might be had on that basis. ‘Indeed, we might be having one today ... but all I can say that as an elected politician I feel myself bound by commitments that I have made and I made a commitment at the last general election to 0.7 per cent.’ The Tory minister deflected criticisms from some of his own backbenchers, fighting off the claim that ‘charity should begin at home’. Mr Swayne insisted international development aid is not charity, it is taxpayers' money spent in the national interest on things such as vaccination programmes for children. He said: ‘Charity is what you dip your hand into your own pocket and distribute. ‘Taxpayers' money is taken from your pocket without your leave, with all the coercive power of the law behind it. ‘And it is essential therefore that it is spent in the national interest.’ Back from Scotland: Former prime minister Gordon Brown broke off from the independence referendum campaign  to back the plans in Westminster today . Labour’s shadow development secretary Jim Murphy and former prime minister Gordon Brown broke off from the independence referendum campaign in Scotland to back the plans in Westminster today. Mr Murphy said: ‘For all the dry language of spending targets, goals, statistics and shortfalls to a scale of millions and billions, it is important not to forget what official development assistance is really about. ‘We live in a world where one million babies a year die on their first and only day of life. One in eight people go to bed hungry each and every night. 1.5 billion people are trapped in the brutality of conflict-affected and fragile states. 58 million children are unable to go to school and 20,000 under-five-year-olds die every year of easily curable diseases. ‘British aid works. The support we give changes lives.’ The Bill was tabled by former Scottish secretary Michael Moore, who said it would deliver ‘for the poorest in the world’. The Bill, which was voted through by 164 to six, now goes to committee stage and then to the House of Lords. All three major parties pledged to support the aid target in their manifestos, and it was part of the Coalition agreement. The last Labour government made law legally-binding targets for child poverty and climate change. The 2008 Climate Change Act included the target of reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 per cent from its 1990 level by 2050. A 2010 law set a target of ‘ending child poverty’ by 2020. It is thought that any government not meeting the targets as set out in law could face a legal challenge requiring it to do so.","Ministers today backed a bill making it legally-binding to spend  0.7% on aid .

"Vile crime: Victor Gray Dingler, 33, is accused of photographing himself having sex with a girl beginning when she was only 4 years old . An Alabama man has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse following an investigation into child pornography first initiated in Denmark. Victor Gray Dingler, 33, from Glencoe, Alabama, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly photographing himself having sex with a girl beginning when she was only 4 years old. According to a seven-page criminal complaint cited by the station WBRC, Dingler snapped 29 sexually explicit photos between 2011 and 2012 and then shared them with someone else online. The affidavit stated that in March 2013, officials from the Department of Homeland Security in Alabama received images depicting sexual acts performed on a child from the Danish National Police, which had flagged them down online. One of the photos featured a University of Alabama blanket - a clue that would eventually lead to Dingler's arrest. With the help of the Alabama Department of Education, federal officials were able to track down the alleged victim, who is now 7 years old and lives in Etowah County. When interviewed by investigators, the little girl confirmed that she was the child depicted in the pornographic pictures, and that Victor Dingler was the man who both appeared in the photos and took them. Law enforcement officials also spoke to a woman who lives with Dingler and her 3-year-old daughter, who has been identified as a second victim in the child porn case. According to the arrest affidavit, the 33-year-old Glencoe resident admitted to police on Monday that he engaged in sexual activity with the now-7-year-old girl and the 3-year-old. Some of the images showed the toddler's privates and her touching Dingler's genitals, the court document stated. Dingler also confessed that he had produced X-rated images involving both children and distributed pornography involving the older of the two girls through Yahoo Messenger.","Victor Dingler, 33, charged with first-degree sexual assault involving a child .

Mr Khan was visited this week by the Pakistane Consul after he was moved from the intensive care unit of RPA hospital to a regular ward. Mr Khan says the blast was started by a gas cylinder. The Daily Telegraph reports than Mr Khan told the consul member:  'I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened, I am very upset.' 'I have sympathy with the people who lost their lives.' Ms Adeel, who has been questioned by police over the fatal fire at Rozelle, has also dismissed allegations her husband was involved and labelled them as 'rumours.' 'I know there are a lot of rumours flying around,' Ms Adeel told Daily Telegraph. 'I feel for everybody, not just my husband. We need sympathy at this stage.' Ms Adeel was visited by detectives at her home on Monday night where she is believed to have spoken at length about husband Adeel Khan, who is recovering from head and leg injuries sustained in the explosion at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Senior police earlier revealed the blast was being treated as a suspected arson attack after traces of petrol were uncovered at the Darling Street store in Rozelle after it exploded and burnt to the ground last Thursday. A devastated John O'Brien (pictured with his son) paid tribute to his young family . Investigators have ruled out the involvement of a silver car seen racing from the scene by a witness, just moments after the fire erupted. Video footage from petrol stations near an explosion site in Sydney is being carefully examined by detectives as they try to find out what sparked the fatal inferno. Following reports of an accelerant being found at the explosion scene, investigators have collected hours worth of CCTV footage from petrol stations on nearby Victoria Road. The stations handed over up to four days worth of footage leading up to the fatal explosion on September 4.There have also been reports a jerry can was found at the site but police have refused to confirm this. Demolition works started on a building - including two shops and three units - next to the charred and twisted remains of the convenience store on Thursday. The building will be ""deconstructed"" slowly to preserve the crime scene next door. Some residents who escaped from the building with only the clothes on their back are hopeful they might be able to claim some prized possessions once the structure is deemed safe. Some have even drawn maps for police of where their most sought after items are in the unstable unit block. Friends and family have paid tribute to Chris Noble, 27, who also lost is life in the explosion in Sydney's inner west suburb of Rozelle . The family of Chris Noble (from left sister Kate, mother Liz and father Ross) gave a press conference at NSW Police Executive Offices in Sydney on Friday after he was killed in a Rozelle convenience store fire . Mrs O'Brien's husband John is said to have left his home less than an hour before flames engulfed his home located above a shop on Darling Street. He released a statement on Sunday that paid tribute to his late wife who he said was much more than the love of his life, and his baby boy Jude, who Mr O'Brien described as the perfect child. 'On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude,' the statement began. 'Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality. 'Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement', Mr O'Brien wrote. 'She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time. 'That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling', the statement continued. 'Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around. 'He made everyone smile,' Mr O'Brien continued. The message ended with a heartfelt sentiment for the family of Chris Noble, a neighbour also killed in the blaze. 'Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this.' On Sunday, a resident who survived the convenience store blaze that claimed the lives of three of his neighbours has spoken about how their deaths have weighed heavily on him. Anthony Carroll, 49, said he has spent much time since the tragedy wondering if Bianka and Jude O'Brien could have been saved from the devastating fire if he had known they were in the building. 'Had the fire crews known about the access, could they have got to Bianka and the baby?' he told Sydney Morning Herald. 'That's something I don't know. It has sat heavily with me.' On Thursday morning I lost my beloved wife, Bianka, and our baby Jude. Bianka was an inspiration to all who knew her – she was loyal, caring and absolutely loved life. People gravitated towards her because of her beautiful and warm personality. Bianka and I were together for eight years, married for two, and to say she was the love of my life is an understatement. I can’t believe how quickly those eight years have flown by but they have definitely been the best years of my life. I know I was truly loved by her and the feeling was entirely mutual. She was an exceptional person, a wonderful wife and an even better mother. This week Bianka was due to finish up her part-time work so she could move into the next phase of her life and fulfil her dream of caring for our boy full time. Being a mother made her happy and she was a natural at it. That brings me to my son, Jude, who I love with all my heart. By far the proudest moment of my life was becoming a father. He was a perfect baby and never stopped smiling. Jude had just started to walk and was only just discovering the world around him. Everything was exciting to him and he was just a joy to be around. He made everyone smile. On behalf of Bianka’s father, Bill, and myself I would like to thank the community for the many well-wishes, flowers and phone calls we have received. The events of the past few days have been devastating, but we have been overwhelmed by the response and support from the community. I would also like to thank the police and other emergency services who have been by our side and continue to support us. Finally, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Chris Noble and everyone else who has been affected by this. We now ask that the media and public continue to respect our privacy during this time. The convenience store went up in flames about 4am on Thursday morning and an explosion was heard by residents who lived about 1km away from the scene . Rescue crews have spent days looking through the rubble for Ms O'Brien, Jude and Mr Noble . Shaken by the horrific loss of a community member, player and friend, Pythons coach Graham Rice, paid tribute to Noble at his commemoration service on Saturday evening, by dedicating a special jersey in memory of the talented sportsman, ABC reported. 'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Mr Rice said. On Friday, the mother of Mr Noble tearfully remembered her son as a 'beautiful', athletic and sociable young man who loved watches. Mum Liz, dad Ross and sister Kate fronted the media to pay tribute to their son and brother Chris Noble from Canowindra. Mr Noble's sister Kate wiped away tears as mum Liz told reporters: 'We lost our beautiful boy yesterday... He should have been safe in bed'.","Naima Adeel, wife of Rozelle convenience store owner, tried to call her husband when she discovered he was absent from home .

"A 24-year-old man was convicted Thursday of killing three women and a teenage girl in northern British Columbia, making him one of Canada's youngest serial killers. Cody Legebokoff was convicted on four counts of first-degree murder after a trial that heard gruesome details about the circumstances of the victims' deaths and testimony from Legebokoff himself. He was convicted of killing Jill Stuchenko; 35; Cynthia Maas, 35; Natasha Montgomery, 23, and Loren Leslie, 15. Murderer: 24-year-old Cody Legebokoff was convicted Thursday of killing three women and a teenage girl in northern British Columbia, making him one of Canada's youngest serial killers . Legebokoff was just 19 years old when he killed his first victim in Prince George. British Columbia has a dark history of serial killers including Clifford Olson and Robert Pickton. Olson was convicted in the sex slayings of 11 children in the Vancouver area in the early 1980s. Pickton was charged with the murders of 26 women but only tried and convicted for six. Legebokoff's victims fit a familiar profile of vulnerability in the form of poverty and addiction; three were drug users who had turned to sex work in Prince George, according to testimony. Leslie, who had a rare eye condition that impaired her vision, struggled with mental illness. First and last murders: Jill Stuchenko (left), 35, was found dead in October 2009; Loren Leslie (right), 15, was killed in November 2010 . But beyond that, the trial did not reveal what motivated Legebokoff, who had an apparently typical upbringing in Fort St. James, British Columbia, but had become a frequent user of crack cocaine by the time of the murders. He admitted he was present when each victim died but denied killing any of them. Legebokoff killed his first victim in the fall of 2009. Stuchenko was last seen on October 9 of that year and her badly beaten body was found a month later half buried in a gravel pit in the outskirts of Prince George. Legebokoff's DNA was found on Stuchenko's body, and her DNA was found in Legebokoff's apartment. He killed again a year later. Montgomery was last seen leaving a friend's house on August 31 or September 1 of 2010. Her body was never found, but her DNA was discovered in numerous spots during a search of Legebokoff's apartment. Maas vanished on September 10 of 2010. Her body was found a month later in a wooded park and her DNA was also found where Legebokoff was living. Victims: Legebokoff killed Cynthia Maas (left), 35, and Natasha Montgomery (right), 23, in 2010, just over a week apart . Leslie was murdered November 27, 2010, and the circumstances of her death triggered Legebokoff's arrest. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer spotted Legebokoff's truck speeding out of a remote logging road near Vanderhoof, British Columbia. At first, Legebokoff claimed he was poaching deer, prompting the police to call in a conservation officer. When the officer ventured up the logging road where Legebokoff was first spotted, he found Leslie's bloodied body in a snowy gravel pit. He was charged with first-degree murder. A year later, the police announced three more counts. Legebokoff claimed three other people were also involved in the women's deaths, though he refused to name them, telling the jury he didn't want to go to prison with a reputation as a rat. Legebokoff is one of Canada's youngest serial killers, but there have been others who started killing as teenagers or young men.","Cody Legebokoff, 24, has been convicted of killing three women and a teenage girl .

"Marc Jacbos closed New York Fashion Week yesterday with an unprecedented move: sending his supermodels down the runway wearing no make-up whatsoever, or so it is claimed. Heavyweights including Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Adriana Lima, Candice Swanepoel, Jessica Stam, Jessica Hart and Hilary Rhoda   stomped down the runway indistinguishable from each other with choppy dark wigs and uncharacteristically washed out faces. 'It’s probably the only show in New York where we’re not going to apply any make-up,' backstage make-up chief Francois Nars told Fashionista. 'Absolutely no makeup whatsoever. Not one gram of makeup. Only moisturizing lotion and that’s it.' Scroll down for video . Spot the supermodel: Marc Jacobs hired fashion's biggest supermodels for his Spring 2015 ready-to-wear-show, led by Joan Smalls (left) and sent them down the runway with 'absolutely no make-up whatsoever' Make-up free: Hilary Rhoda shared this to her Instagram with the caption 'Bad girls do it well.' Pictured from left, Ms Rhoda, Caroline Trentini, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid . While the normcore trend for laid back beauty has held strong with many designers this past week, it's still the sort of look that requires a lick of foundation and a sweep of mascara, at the very least. Especially since Marc Jacobs' star models were turning up backstage with faces of inevitable exhaustion following their non-stop week of dashing from show to show, and party to party. 'We love the undereye circles!' Mr Nars exclaimed, mentioning that 'most' of his models naturally had 'very good skin.' He did, however, confess to New York Magazine: 'If there is a little problem, we will touch it up but in a very minimal way.' Au naturel: Ms Rhoda beams through her no make-up camera assault .

And while the likes of Karlie Kloss and Jessica Hart posted #Iwokeuplikethis-style selfies to their Instagram accounts in which they do indeed appear to be bare-faced, backstage snaps show make-up stations cluttered with Nars concealers and foundations. Still, Mr Nars insists his team's only pre-show concerns, other than covering the odd zit here or there, were with keeping the models 'moisturized.' According to the beauty guru, it was Mr Jacobs who initially raised the idea, suggesting his models 'maybe shouldn't have much make-up,' but it was Mr Nars who proposed they strip them of all of it.

Go big or go home: The catwalk was built around a large, doorless and windowless construction in lurid pink . 'I think Marc sees these girls as an army. The colors in the collection are kind of military, with beige, khaki, caramel, and chocolate,' Mr Nars said. 'But we're not locked into having to apply make-up or blush or lip gloss. Sometimes I see women journalists... wearing nothing, and I love that, it's just a part of life.' Speaking to ELLE, he concluded: 'In 2014, it’s great that we are doing this. 'In the '60s, '50s, and '40s, women had to wear make-up. It was a rule. Today there are no rules: You can do anything you want.'","Joan Smalls, Candice Swanepoel, Jessica Hart and Hilary Rhoda also appeared completely bare-faced for the designer's Fashion Week show .

"A home in an elegant north Detroit neighborhood just sold to an anonymous buyer for a cool $1.6million in cash, one of the city's biggest home sales of recent years, according to the Detroit Free Press. The Alfred J. Fisher mansion is listed at 16,466 square feet, making it the second-largest residence in historic Palmer Woods, a neighborhood that was once home to several auto industry titans. With Detroit's economy cratering and the housing market down the tubes, there's no shortage of homes on the market, but few are as beautiful as the Fisher mansion or able to command a price tag north of one million. Real estate: In what is being called the biggest sale of recent years, the Albert J Fisher mansion was sold for $1.6million . Sumptuous: Original details in the mansion were preserved or restored, including the hand-crafted features on the ceiling of the dining room . Record-breaking: The anonymous buyer looked past the clutter of a recent estate sale at the hand-crafted features of the mansion's interior . Alfred J. Fisher had the house built in 1926. Fisher built his fortune, along with his brothers, through the family's horse-carriage company, Fisher Body, which later was bought by General Motors. According to a website for the home, the previous owners worked to preserve the home and only restored areas when needed, taking care with the 'hand-painted walls and ceilings' in the library, breakfast room and sunroom. In addition to 15 bedrooms, the mansion features 17 bathrooms, an indoor pool and a ballroom. Mod mansion: The previous owners updated appliances, adding a wine cooler and other modern features to the kitchen . Restoration: Where they could, the previous owners restored or preserved original tile work, to keep the mansion as close as possible to its original state . Luxurious: The design of the rooms reflect the tastes of the period it was designed in . There are also two acres of manicured grounds outdoors that will delight the new owner. The new owner will be able to entertain guests in the dining room, where the previous owners kept the original 'gilding.' They will also be able to do whatever it is one does in a 'morning room,' where the 'poly-chroming' was preserved. Life of leisure: The owner and their guests can take a dip in the pool or walk the two acres of manicured grounds at the mansion . Cushy: The home was one of many that the Fisher family had built after making their fortune in the carriage and later the auto industries . Life of leisure: The owner and their guests can take a dip in the pool or walk the two acres of manicured grounds at the mansion . The buyer won't have to deal with antique amenities everywhere in the house, as the kitchen was overhauled and appliances were all replaced while keeping the original tiling on the walls and ceilings. The Fisher family sold the house to the University of Detroit Mercy in 1968, which then sold it off to a private buyer.","The Alfred J.

"Glen Hulley thought he had experienced the world when he worked with the Australian police force but after a trip to South-East Asia, he started to question his priorities in life. The 39-year-old  went on a relaxing holiday last year but it unexpectedly changed when he was exposed to extreme poverty, child prostitution and child sexual abuse. The former Victorian policeman and detective told Daily Mail Australia that his travelling turned into a life-changing experience and realised he needed to help these children and keep them safe. Glen Hulley went on a relaxing holiday last year but it unexpectedly changed when he was exposed to extreme poverty and child sexual abuse . 'I was travelling through Jakarta when a group of middle-aged women approached me and asked if I was interested in  'sexual services' from underage kids,' he said. 'I've seen a lot of things in my life but from what I witnessed after that trip, it has changed my whole perception and I started questioning my values and what would make me happy and fulfilled.

Following the six-week trip, the Melbourne man said he started looking at ways to make a contribution and help vulnerable and exploited children. 'I have sold my home, business and car - pretty much everything I own in order to contribute to this important cause,' he said. 'The hardest thing I will leave behind would definitely be my  sons - Ryan, six, and Matthew, four, as well as my partner Meaghan Adams. 'But I have set up a fundraising page to help maintain my relationships and contribute to their well-being when I'm working overseas.'

Glen Hulley hopes the fundraising page will help maintain his relationship with his sons - Ryan, 6, and Matthew, 4, and partner Meaghan Adams living in Australia . Project Watch will work across India, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines to bust child sex rings, stop convicted paedophiles that operate and crime groups trafficking children . 'It would be enough for me to live off in South-East Asia but I'm hoping the money raised will also help me pay airfares to fly home each month to see my family, which will in turn allow me to provide focus and sustained support to a program that will deliver strong outcomes in the fight against child exploitation,' he said.

'We will work together to create quality evidence for police to arrest these people. 'We have a system in place to take care of those things here in Australia - doing things to minimise crime and dealing with the aftermath but over in Asia, there is simply no system.

Country kids are taking over the big city, with chief executives categorised well above 10 per cent in rural areas, new data shows . The number of country-born bosses have questioned how country kids are rising to the top with almost a quarter of the nations top CEO's grew up in rural areas. Korn Ferry CEO Katie Lahey told Sydney Morning Herald that those who grew up in the country tend to be excellent at 'managing and getting on with people'. 'The lowest person in the shearer's shed knows the top grazer. If you are a leader, you have to feel comfortable with people at all levels. The figures showed 21 of Australia's CEOs in the top 100 grew up in regional towns, including Bathurst, Broken Hill, Tamworth, Dubbo, Mount Isa and many more .

Korn Ferry CEO Katie Lahey said those who grew up in the country tend to be excellent at 'managing and getting on with people' Ms Lahey added that a propensity to travel and the ability to talk to people of all levels of society were key characteristics of country people which translated well to management. 'If you have been through seven years of drought, the chances are you've got a bit of backbone,' Ms Lahey told Sydney Morning Herald. 'Children from the country have to come to the city to further their education or start even earlier at boarding school, so already they have left home and learnt about being independent. It also gives you that mobility factor which is so important for CEOs.' Another prime example is Fortescue Metal CEO Neville Power, 55, who was raised on a Queensland cattle station and was home schooled until he was 12. He left school at the age of 15 before he did an apprenticeship as a diesel fitter, according to the Australian Financial Review. With his farm upbringing, Mr Power's butchering skills has benefit  both his resourcefulness and his uniqueness as a CEO.

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee has declared his innocence from behind bars, posting a message on Facebook from custody, where he is being held over the balcony death of New Zealander Warriena Wright. Tostee, who has been in police custody for the past month, thanked his friends and family on social media for their support. The 28 year old is accused of murdering 26 year old tourist Ms Wright, who plummeted 14 floors from his apartment on the Gold Coast, Queensland. They reportedly met on dating app Tinder. Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge . New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright met with Tostee after the pair met on mobile dating app Tinder . Gable Tostee posted this message today on Facebook, despite remaining in police custody . Tostee said today in the Facebook post: 'To my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all.' 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.' 'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death. A transcript of an audio recording found on Tostee's phone has been submitted by Queensland Police in documents to Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to a bail application by Tostee. The recording spans an eight hour period of time from when Tostee met Ms Wright up until the early hours of the morning as he was sat with his father in a parked car awaiting legal assistance . The documents claim Ms Wright used her online name Cletus to set up a date with Tostee on the mobile dating app in Surfers Paradise on August 7. It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink. Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 7 . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink . Documents submitted to the court claim the recording found on Tostee's phone started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', the Brisbane Times has reported. Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier. Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath. During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall . 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying ""let go, let go"". The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him. 'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out ""no"" repeatedly. 'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.' The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit. 'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams ""just let me go home"".

"The children of the Arizona weapons instructor who was accidentally shot dead last month by a 9-year-old girl whom he was teaching how to fire an Uzi released an emotional video to let their father's killer know they bear her no ill will. Charles Vacca, 39, a father of four from Lake Havasu City, was shot and killed August 25 at the Last Stop gun range in White Hills when his 9-year-old student lost control of a sub-machine gun. On Friday, personal injury attorney Marc Lamber representing the Vacca family uploaded onto his law firm's website a video showing the instructor's children reading aloud a letter they had penned to the 9-year-old girl. Scroll down for videos . Full of grace: The four children of Charles Vacca released a video statement through their family lawyer telling the 9-year-old who accidentally shot dead their father that they pray for her . Fateful moment: The nine-year-old girl, pictured alongside shooting instructor Charles Vacca, at the White Hills shooting range in Arizona just minutes away from firing the fatal shot . ‘We don't know your name, but we're connected by this tragedy,’ the children wrote. Taking turns to read the statement, Christopher Vacca, 11; Tylor Vacca, 14; Elizabeth Vacca, 15, and Ashley Moser, 19, extended an olive branch to the child who ended their father’s life so tragically. 'You're only 9 years old, ' the Vacca children said into the camera. 'We think about you. We are worried about you. We pray for you, and we wish you peace. 'Our dad would want the same thing.' Charles Vacca’s family also used the video statement to tell the world about their father. ‘Our dad wasn't just an instructor: he was funny, strong, a protector, a hero and our friend. He was a good man. ‘Like you, we are living though this tragic event that we cannot shut off. It's with us all the time,’ the letter read. Speaking on behalf of the slain weapons instructor, his daughter Elizabeth said that their father would have wanted the 9-year-old to move on with her life. ‘You should not let that define you. You should love yourself and love your family,’ the 15-year-old read. Role model: Vacca's children described the 39-year-old father of four as a protector, a hero, a good man and their friend . The incident happened at the Last Stop outdoor shooting range, pictured, in White Hills, Arizona . Christopher Vacca concluded the statement with the words: ‘some day we hope we can meet you, hug you and tell you that it's OK.’ The Vaccas' video comes a week after Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan, the 9-year-old's parents, released a statement describing how they prayed 'day and night' that the instructor would survive after the shooting, and how devastated they were when he succumbed to his injury. The family visited the gun range August 25 while vacationing in Las Vegas 60 miles away. The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Mr Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot an Uzi gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, according to police reports. He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Mr Vacca with a single shot to the head, the reports stated. The girl then dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl then ran towards her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder. Mature beyond their years: Elizabeth Vacca, 15, and Christopher Vacca, 11, urged the 9-year-old to move on with her life and expressed hope to meet her one day and give her a hug . Group effort: Ashley Moser, 19, and Tyler Vacca, 14, took turns with their other siblings reading aloud the emotional letter they had written together . Her family were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured and didn't immediately realize that Mr Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues rushed over to him, the reports state. The incident unfolded as the girl's mother recorded her daughter firing weapons on her mobile phone. In the video, released by investigators, Mr Vacca can be heard saying 'All right, go ahead and give me one shot.' He then cheers when she fires one round at the target and then says, 'All right, full auto.' No criminal charges have been filed in the deadly shooting against the child or her family.","Charles Vacca, 39, a father of four from Arizona, was shot and killed August 25 at the Last Stop gun range in White Hills by a 9-year-old girl .

"The Tories have retaken the lead in the polls ahead of Labour, just eight months before the general election in May. David Cameron’s Conservatives are backed by 34 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote in next year's general election against 33 per cent for Labour, according to Ipsos MORI. UKIP meanwhile is on 15 per cent and Liberal Democrats just 7 per cent. It means the Tories are ahead of Labour for the first time since December 2011 in the Ipsos MORI surveys. David Cameron's Tories have inched ahead of Labour just eight months before the next general election . But the pollsters said the margin of difference was just three voters out of more than 1,000 questioned, so the parties are effectively neck-and-neck. Nigel Farage's bid to shake off the ‘wasted vote’ tag received a boost, as the number agreeing that backing Ukip at a general election amounted to throwing away your vote has declined from 57 per cent to 50 per cent since May. Over half - 53 per cent - of those questioned said the eurosceptic party was raising important issues that other parties were not taking seriously enough, and 14 per cent said they would like their local MP to defect to Ukip. Only 74 per cent of voters with a preference chose one of the three main parties - down from nine in 10 as recently as 2010. The proportion of people who think the economy will get better, meanwhile, has slipped from 51 per cent to 45 per cent. Nick Clegg remains by far the most unpopular political leader – while the Prime Minister has the highest satisfaction rating apart from Mr Farage. The proportion ‘satisfied’ with Mr Cameron is at 39 per cent, with 54 per cent dissatisfied, giving him a net rating or minus 15 per cent. Only 21 per cent are satisfied with Nick Clegg's performance as Deputy Prime Minister, with 66 per cent dissatisfied, giving him the net rating of minus 45. David Cameron and Prince Harry watch the wheelchair basketball  at the Invictus Games in London today . Ed Miliband takes a 'selfie' photograph with a supporter as he visits Edinburgh to campaign against independence in the Scottish Referendum . Ed Miliband has a net rating of minus 29, with 29 per cent satisfied and 58 per cent dissatisfied. UKIP’s Mr Farage meanwhile has a net rating of minus 5. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI said: ‘Only 74 per cent of voters with a preference choose one of the three main parties - history tells us that that is unusually low, and a fall from nine in ten even in 2010. ‘In other words, one in four are giving their vote to a party outside the main three, highlighting the troubles they all face - and UKIP are the main beneficiaries.’","Ipsos MORI poll puts the Tories on 34% ahead of Labour on 33% .

"As London Fashion Week gets underway, fashionistas everywhere will be trying to outdo each other this weekend. And here's one accessory that's sure to make you stand out - and give you a picture to prove it. A 20-year-old designer who has dressed Lady Gaga and Rita Ora has created a giant, glittery selfie-taking sombrero. The bright pink number is the result of a collaboration between London-based Christian Cowan-Sanluis and Acer, and features a top of the range tablet dangling off the side. Snap happy: The Selfie-Hat is the result of a collaboration between Christian Cowan-Sanluis and Acer . The £599 couture hat spins 360 degrees - helping selfie lovers find their best angle - and is available through appointment only. Dubbed the 'Christian Cowan-Sanluis x Acer Selfie-Hat', the piece combines the designer's unique and playful style with the Taiwanese tech firm's top-notch technology. The hat's sparkly pink design is inspired by Cowan-Sanluis' AW14 collection. No starnger to outrageous outfits, Lady Gaga was pictured earlier this year in a version of the hat (minus the tablet) which she teamed with a matching glittery pink suit. The high tech version comes with a tablet that spins while being worn and helps detect the user's best angle whilst the selfie camera is activated, letting them snap and review photos from any angle desired. The selfie sombrero helps the user understand lighting and how various expressions can change your face to create the perfect social media moment. Users can then access apps such as Facebook or Instagram whilst wearing the hat to up load their selfies instantly and share them with the world. Reday for a close up: The £599 couture hat spins 360 degrees helping selfie lovers find their best angle . Christian Cowan-Sanluis is a first year fashion student at London College of Fashion but has already worked with some of the world's most A-list fashion icons. He has already presented several collections at London Fashion Week, and Acer say his unique style was the perfect match for their selfie hat project. 'We wanted to work with someone young and fresh, that not only understands the selfie culture, but both currently is part of it and works with people in it', said an Acer spokesman. Cowan-Sanluis explains: 'With the hat, we wanted to take an element from my last collection, but correspondingly integrate the most popular zeitgeist there is in technology at the moment, the selfie. 'We also wanted to give it a fun and playful approach, but that in the end helps the user to better understand their face when taking a self-portrait. 'There has been a lot of articles over the last year looking at how the selfie has gotten so big and being monetised on, celebrities such as Kim Kardashian making a selfie book and the term becoming part of mainstream society. 'But on the other side, a lot of people taking selfies struggle to find the full potential of their front-facing camera when they use their hand. The hat helps to perfect the shot, either if it's a cute, sexy or silly selfie.' Share away: Users can access social media apps like Facebook or Instagram whilst wearing the hat to up load their selfies . Not afraid to stand out from the crowd: Lady Gaga wore a version of the hat earlier this year . A Selfie-Hat service provides you with a personal introduction to the hat with consultation from Christian Cowan-Sanluis, but it's only available in central London. The hat will also be available on display during Christian Cowan-Sanluis fashion presentation at LFW today. As part of the collaboration, the pair have also created 10 limited edition pink sparkly glitter cases with accompanying hats in the same style as that worn by Lady Gaga. 'We wanted to create something to accompany the hat, so the mini-cases are highly sought after and we've already had a few celebrity requests for these exclusive tablets', explains Cowan-Sanluis.

"In a very personal post on his Facebook detailing his latest spat with his former spouse, South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford announced that he and his mistress turned fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, a woman he once called his 'soul mate,' have called off their wedding plans. ''No relationship can stand forever this tension of being forced to pick between the one you love and your own son or daughter, and for this reason Belen and I have decided to call off the engagement,' Sanford wrote. 'Maybe there will be another chapter when waters calm with Jenny, but at this point the environment is not conducive to building anything given no one would want to be caught in the middle of what’s now happening,' he said, referring to accusations levied against him in court last month by his ex-wife. Jenny Sanford suggested in a court motion that her former husband does illegal and prescription drugs and gets drunk in front of their teenage son Blake. She also asked the court to require Sanford to undergo psychological tests and restrict his visits with his son. Scroll down for video . Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford celebrates a victory in the GOP congressional primary in April 2013. Pictured to his right is ex-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford announced today in a public Facebook that he and Chapur had decided to end their relationship . Sanford, center left, and his former fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, right, are pictured here during the New Orleans themed Radio and Television Correspondents' dinner at the National Building Museum last year. They are greeted by Sen. Roger Wicker, standing, and are seated with Dan Glickman, left, Wolf Blitzer of CNN, second from the left . Another section of the motion asks the judge to ban both parents from having overnight guests of the opposite sex who could be considered a 'paramour.' While the court filing submitted by Jenny Sanford's lawyers repeatedly asks the that the judge ban both Sanfords from inappropriate conduct in front of their youngest son, the motion makes clear that it is Mark Sanford's behavior that instigated the legal proceedings. Addressing the issue on Facebook, Sanford said, 'This really is crazy.' 'I have never taken any illegal drug in my life,' he said. 'I did not drink in high school or college and though I do drink now, my consumption is so limited that my friends give me a hard time about it. I will have but one beer or two when out at a social occasion.' Sanford also contended that his longtime girlfriend, with whom he began having an extra-marital affair with in 2008, had never spent the night when his two younger sons were staying with him. And Chapur only stayed over two times when his two older sons were under his roof, he said. 'Though Jenny herself has certainly not lived up to this clause it is clearly aimed at me given near everyone knows about Belen and in that regard it seems designed to create intrigue where none exists,' he charged. Buried in the long Facebook post about his ongoing divorce drama  is an announcement that he and Chapur separated as a result of the stress placed on their relationship by his legal battles with his ex-wife. 'Belen is a remarkably wonderful woman who I have always loved and I will be forever grateful for not only the many years we have known and loved each other,' he said, 'but the last six very tough ones wherein she has encouraged me and silently borne its tribulations with her ever warm and kind spirit.' The Argentina native and Sanford had been engaged since August of 2012. The relationship became the subject of intense media coverage after the still-married Sanford revealed in 2009 that the two were having an affair. Sanford said that he and Chapur decided to call of their engagement because the strain placed on their relationship by his ex-wife, Jenny Sanford, pictured here in 2010 at a book signing, was too much to bear . Sanford was serving as South Carolina Governor at the time of the scandal. He got caught with his hands in the cookie jar after claiming that he was hiking in the Appalachian mountains for six days when he was really in Argentina carrying on with his lover. Jenny Sanford separated from her husband soon after the love affair was reported in the press, and the couple was granted a divorce in 2010. After spending several years out of the public eye, Sanford, who was once thought to be a contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2012, jumped back into public spotlight when he reclaimed a congressional seat he once held in a May 2013 special election. In a 2,346 word post on his Facebook page on Friday Sanford claimed that he first heard about his wife's new court filings through the media and that he has 'struggled in how to respond' for the past week and a half. The Republican lawmaker said he didn't originally intend to respond publicly to his former spouses claims, but he had 'prayed on it, thought on it and asked the advice of friends' and came to the conclusion his constituents deserved an explanation. 'In as much as you sign my paycheck and you have elected me to represent you in Washington, I think I owe you my thinking on this personal, but now public matter,' he said. Sanford said he had tried to turn the other cheek, as commanded in the Bible, but recently discovered that 'I cannot do this anymore.' 'In all life there comes a point wherein lines must be drawn in the way that we attempt to respond in ways that don’t invite more in the way of conflict and add more in the way of modeling Christ’s humility in giving in every instance. 'I’ll never get that mix right, none of us do,' he said, 'but I believe it’s what we are to pursue in all of our responses to the inevitable reality of conflict in our lives.' The conservative congressman said that in the past he had not hired lawyers to fight is court battles against his ex wife, including during his divorce, and had instead represented himself or relied on the help of friends in order to save his children - and his pocketbook - from unnecessary pain. From now on, he said Friday, he'll be allowing a lawyer to handle the situation 'so that I can focus without further distraction on our boys and my work in Washington.' Even though his ex-wife continues to attack him, Sanford said he would 'never attempt  attempt to detract from her or all the positive things she has done in her life.' 'I hope and believe Jenny and I can find a new way,' he said. 'It’s also reminder for every one of you who have been blessed to avoid the agony of divorce, of how important it is you spend time when you have it with those who now bear your name.'","Sanford said in a Facebook post on Friday that he and mistress turned fiancee Maria Belen Chapur had ended their relationship .

"The lawyer representing a Michigan man accused of killing a driver in an apparent road rage incident revealed this week she is planning to mount a defense based on the state's controversial 'stand your ground' law. Martin Zale, 69, has been charged with an open count of murder for shooting Derek Flemming, 43, in the head September 2 in Livingston County's Genoa Township. Zale's attorney, Melissa Pearce, said she will argue self-defense when the case goes to trial. Deadly confrontation: Martin Zale, 69 (left), has been charged with shooting dead Derek Flemming, 43 (right), in what police described as a road rage incident . School run: Flemming was on his way to pick up his two kids, aged five and seven, from school with his wife when the attack happened . Speaking Tuesday outside Howell District Court, Pearce said ‘the whole story has not been told.’ The next court hearing is scheduled for October 7. Pearce expressed confidence that upon hearing all the evidence in the case, the jury will exonerate her client, CBS Detroit reported. Police said Zale confronted Flemming at a stoplight and shot him once in the face from a handgun as his wife, Amy, watched from their car just a few feet away. The victim was unarmed. According to state Sen Rick Jones, a Republican from Lansing Township who drafted Michigan's ‘stand your ground law,’ the legislation applies only to cases of imminent death, great bodily harm or sexual assault. From the standpoint of the prosecution, Zale’s shooting of the unarmed father of two cannot be classified as self-defense. Amy Flemming's lawyer, William Moore, said the family was considering a civil suit against Zale. On September 2, Derek and Amy Flemming had just had lunch together and were driving along Grand River Avenue to pick up their children after the first day back at school Tuesday when they ran into Zale in his 2012 Dodge pickup. Minutes later, Derek Flemming was shot in the head by Zale, police saidy. A representative for the Flemming family, attorney William Moore, said Zale was 'screaming down a side street' so fast that Amy Flemming believed he was going to hit their 2014 Ford Escape. Defense strategy: Martin Edward Zale, appears in District Court September 9 with his attorney Melissa Pearce, who said she plans to use Michigan's 'stand your ground' law . He told the the Detroit Free Press that Zale then tailgated the couple, then as they tried to pull to the right to let him pass, he passed them in the right lane, forcing them to jerk back into the left. Amy Flemming told Moore that Zale then pulled in front of the couple and slammed on his brakes. When both cars pulled up at a set of traffic lights on Grand River at Chilson, Derek Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached Zale's window. A loud argument ensued, witnesses told WXYZ, but it doesn't appear there was any physical contact between the men. Zale then lowered his window and shot Flemming once in the face. 'His wife was forced to witness this act from the front seat of her car,' Moore said in a statement on behalf of the family. Speaking to Detroit Free Press, the victim's widow recalled how Zale appeared emotionless after gunning down her husband. Heartbroken: Amy Flemming, 40, said Martin Zale appeared stone-faced after shooting her husband in the face . Never forget: Mrs Flemming holds a photo from 2012 of her late husband Derek, who stepped out of their SUV September 2 at a traffic light to confront another motorist that had been speeding and almost hit their vehicle . Broad daylight: Flemming was allegedly shot by Martin Zale, 69, at 3:35pm in full view of many witnesses . 'Shock and extreme grief': Amy Flemming witnessed her husband's shooting as the couple went to pick up their children from the first day back at school . 'He was just sitting in his truck and when I was kneeling on the ground with my husband who was profusely bleeding, I looked at Mr. Zale and he had his head turned and was just watching,' said Amy Flemming. She has told police that her husband was shot in the head after getting out of his vehicle to ask why Zale was driving aggressively. Amy Flemming holds the wedding ring she wears on her necklace belonging to her late husband Derek . She told the newspaper her husband walked up and asked the other driver: 'What's your problem?' 'And it was a second or maybe two after Derek said that to when there was a gunshot,' Flemming said. 'As soon as I heard the gunshot and I saw him fall, I was getting out of the car and running to him.' Witness Jenna St Clair told WXYZ that Amy Flemming was on the ground next to her stricken husband, begging him to live. 'She said, ""You've got to stay! You've got to stay alive. Stay alive for your kids. We need you, we need you!""' said St. Clair. Alleged killer Zale reportedly stood calmly by his car waiting for police to arrive after the shooting. Calls to 911 came thick and fast from people who had witnessed the altercation, which happened around 3.35pm. One 911 caller said she 'heard a large pop and somebody screaming.' 'Mrs. Flemming is overcome with many emotions, but primarily shock and extreme grief. In addition, her young children are asking where their father is,' the statement from Moore says. WXYZ reports that neither man had any criminal record. Flemming owned his own small landscaping business. He leaves behind his wife and two children - son Julian, 8, and daughter Lily, who turned 6 two days after her father's killing. It's unclear if Zale had a permit to carry a concealed weapon.","Derek Flemming, 43, was allegedly shot dead by Martin Zale, 69,September 2 .

"Internet giant Yahoo has revealed that the Government threatened to fine it $250,000 a day if it refused to hand over sensitive online information as part of a major expansion of US surveillance powers. The company claimed that the new regulations are unconstitutional and attempted unsuccessfully to overturn the plan in court. Yahoo said the rules were contrary to their clients' fourth amendment rights concerning unreasonable searches and seizures. Some information relating to the unsuccessful court challenge emerged after a federal judge ordered that some of the details of the case could be made public. Yahoo said the US government threatened to fine it $250,000 a day if it refused to release customer details . George W Bush, pictured, signed legislation compelling internet companies to hand over customer information . Yahoo said in a statement that it was challenging new rules introduced by President George W Bush's administration in 2007 that required online services such as search engines to supply the government user information. Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell said: 'Our challenge, and a later appeal in the case, did not succeed. Mr Bell said the company tried to 'fight every step of the way to challenge the U.S. government's surveillance efforts'. He added: 'At one point, the US government threatened the imposition of $250,000 in fines per day if we refused to comply.' Yahoo's court challenge related to the controversial PRISM intelligence programme gave the government access to online communications. Details of the controversial PRISM programme were leaked last year by former National Surveillance Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. PRISM granted the NSA unprecedented access to electronic communications without the need of securing a warrant from the courts. According to the Washington Post, after Yahoo's initial defeat in 2007 the company agreed to supply the required information to the NSA in order to avoid heavy fine while they continued with their appeal. The US government claimed that the information the on foreign targets who were using American companies to communicate. Former NSA whistleblower leaked details of the controversial PRISM intelligence system last year . Yahoo tried to reassure its users that it does everything it can to protect user information. Mr Bell said: 'We consider this an important win for transparency, and hope that these records help promote informed discussion about the relationship between privacy, due process and intelligence gathering.' The newly released documents show that the Bush administration was taking a hard line and was annoyed that Yahoo had even been allowed to get into court with its complaint. Yahoo took their case to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The company said they will release 1,500 pages of documents relating to their unsuccessful court battle with the NSA. The-then US Attorney General Michael Mukasey said there were no constitutional implications relating to the new measures. According to recently released court documents, he said: 'The government has conducted warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance for decades, and such surveillance has been upheld under the Fourth Amendment by every appellate court to decide the question. 'The government's implementation of the Protect America Act is consistent with decades of past practice and adequately protects the privacy of U.S. persons.' Yahoo countered that the government was overreaching its authority and was acting in an unlawful manner. The American Civil Liberties Union said the disclosure was a concern. Patrick Toomey of the ACLU said: 'The secrecy that surrounds these court proceedings prevents the public from understanding our surveillance laws. 'Today's release only underscores the need for basic structural reforms to bring transparency to the NSA's surveillance activities.'","Yahoo tried to challenge controversial new government surveillance rules .

"An alleged stalker who claims to be Lindsay Lohan's husband punched a theatre doorman when he refused to let him see her, a court heard. The 28-year-old Hollywood actress was rehearsing for her upcoming West End debut in Speed-The-Plow at London's Playhouse Theatre when Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37 was spotted lingering outside - despite being banned as part of his bail conditions. A court heard that when security worker Cameron Ashrat asked him to leave, he was punched in the face by Vorderwulbecke. A 'stalker' has been accused of pretending to be Lindsay Lohan's husband and bombarding the celebrity venue, Chiltern Firehouse with threatening emails. The actress is pictured leaving the haunt . A court heard how the defendant called himself King Lionheart, said he was married to Miss Lohan and had certificates to prove it and spoke to the actress every day personally and through social media . It was alleged that the assault was the climax of a campaign of harassment by Vorderwulbecke against the actress and staff at the celebrity venue, Chiltern Firehouse. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he bombarded the celebrity haunt with emails claiming the celebrity was his wife and demanding bookings be made for him. The defendant also called himself King Lionheart, said he was married to Miss Lohan and had certificates to prove it and spoke to the actress every day personally and through social media. It was also alleged that he did not get jealous but became concerned when she was pictured with other men. On his Facebook account, under the name Dan Cortez, Vorderwulbecke describes himself as Lindsay Lohan's husband. Prosecutor Rav Chodha said: 'Police were initially called by staff at the Chiltern Firehouse which is a restaurant and hotel popular with high profile celebrities. 'They started receiving emails and booking requests, and inquiries from the defendant who claimed that his wife was Lindsay Lohan. 'Along with the booking requests, the defendant also sent various photographs and documents over a three month period. 'The defendant has sent over 60 images to hotel reservations and to various email addresses, and those emails are also described as being strange, bizarre, threatening and homophobic in nature.' Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37, bombarded celebrity haunt, Chiltern Firehouse, with emails claiming the celebrity was his wife and demanding bookings be made for him . The court heard that Laura Pearce, a member of staff at the popular celebrity venue, also received a number of emails from Vorderwulbecke and became concerned about the 'level of abuse and threats' they contained. Police were informed and Vorderwulbecke was arrested near the Playhouse Theatre on August 27 where Miss Lohan was rehearsing ahead of the Speed-The-Plow show that opens on September 24. The defendant was interviewed by police and bailed on the conditions that he would not contact Miss Lohan or Ms Pearce, not enter the City of Westminster and surrender his passport. But the next day, the police were called again to the Playhouse after Vorderwulbecke attended and passed a note to the staff asking for it to be passed on to Miss Lohan. He was warned about breaching his bail conditions and after confirming to police he understood them, he was released again. But on September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre again, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100. Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted security worker Mr Ashrat. Dressed in a dark beige sweatshirt and grey cargo pants, Vorderwulbecke, of no fixed address, gave a brief rant in German - with the words 'King Lionheart' audible - when asked to confirm his name. The case was adjourned until September 18 so that his mental health can be assessed and he was remanded into custody. He is charged with harassment, assault and criminal damage.

"A man who was quarantined in a Gold Coast hospital this morning has been cleared by Queensland Health as not contracting the Ebola virus. The 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was taken to Gold Coast University Hospital at 7.40am suffering from Ebola-like symptoms. Health authorities triggered contagious disease protocols after it was revealed he had returned from West Africa in late August, via Perth airport. He is believed to have fallen ill while at a police watchhouse after he was arrested overnight for trespassing at Surfers Paradise. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man, believed to be Michael Walsh, was rushed to a Gold Coast hospital and quarantined amid fears he had the Ebola virus on Thursday morning . A Gold Coast University Hospital spokeswoman said an incoming patient was being 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus' Dr Jeannette Young, Queensland's chief health officer, thanked all health and ambulance staff involved in handling the patient. 'It was a job well done and serves to show the community that our emergency preparedness plans are sound, and that they can rely on their health services,' she said in a statement. Dr Young said it was highly unlikely the Ebola virus would make its way to Queensland.She said anyone who had travelled to West Africa who was concerned about the outbreak and their health should contact their GP. Paramedics were called as a precautionary measure after reportedly telling officers he was unwell. Gold Coast Health is assessing a patient transferred to the Gold Coast University Hospital afterbeing identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease. The patient is being assessed in accordance with universal infection control procedures. Our Director Infectious Diseases Dr John Gerrard had confirmed that Initial clinical assessmentsuggests it is exceedingly unlikely that the patient has Ebola Virus Disease but he is being isolatedin accordance with national guidelines. The Gold Coast University Hospital has been designed to accommodate patients with infectiousdisease. Prior to the results, Dr Young had  said the man would remain in hospital until the results of forensic testing were available. 'It's very unlikely that the results will come back positive,' she told reporters. 'He doesn't have a fever or early symptoms of Ebola.' Dr Young said even if the results were positive, there would not be an outbreak of the deadly disease in Australia. 'We won't have an outbreak here because we are very prepared. We've got systems in place at the border to identify symptoms... and we have good systems of hygiene,' she said. The hospital's Chief Executive Damian Green said earlier on Thursday the patient had been 'isolated and assessed' after being identified by paramedics 'as having symptoms of Ebola virus'. 'Gold Coast Health can confirm a patient has been transferred to Gold Coast University Hospital after being identified by paramedics as having symptoms of Ebola virus,' Mr Green said earlier on Thursday. '(The hospital) is taking necessary precautions and has isolated the patient who is currentlybeing assessed. 'Gold Coast Heath has processes in place to safely manage such circumstances. Universal infection control procedures are in place and there is limited risk to patients and staff.' The Director of Infectious Diseases, Dr John Gerrard, said the man was more likely to be suffering from malaria and his blood test results would be available on Thursday night . It is understood the man was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise . It is understood the man was charged with trespass after an incident on the property of the Chevron Renaissance hotel on Ferny Avenue, one of many huge tourist resorts in Surfers Paradise. The manager of the hotel, Michelle Baldwin, told Daily Mail Australia the incident did not happen inside the building, but she refused to comment on whether it occurred out the front. She said the man was not a guest of the hotel and she had not spoken to authorities about the incident. Police said the man will face court on September 25. The man was isolated in accordance with national guidelines at the Gold Coast University Hospital on Thursday . Paramedics were instructed to wear protective clothing like health workers in Africa (pictured) before they transported the man to Gold Coast University Hospital . The WHO has recorded 4,293 cases of Ebola in five West African countries as of September 6 as a worker sifts through garbage inside a high risk quarantined area at a hospital in Liberia . The scare comes after British nurse Will Pooley contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone. Mr Pooley, 29, was rushed back to London's Royal Free Hospital for life-saving treatment and is now planning to return to Africa to continue his work. It comes after British nurse Will Pooley contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone . 'So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there,' he said. ‘It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life. 'It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while.' The current epidemic is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people. The WHO said on Tuesday that it had recorded 4,293 cases of Ebola in five West African countries as of September 6. The outbreak has already affected multiple countries and sparked several travel warnings. It is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease. Mr Pooley, 29, was rushed back to London's Royal Free Hospital for life-saving care in this high level isolation apparatus . Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with the disease . WHAT IS EBOLA?Ebola is a viral illness. Initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding. WHEN DID THE OUTBREAK BEGIN?In December 2013 in Guinea, but it was not detected until March 2014. HOW MANY HAVE DIED?A total of 2,296 have died out of 4293 recorded Ebola cases in five West African countries, according to the WHO's latest report on September 6. HOW DOES IT SPREAD?It spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. WHEN ARE PEOPLE CONTAGIOUS?Ebola isn't contagious until symptoms appear. The incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - is two to 21 days. IS THERE A VACCINE?There is no licensed vaccine for Ebola available. This month scientists said they may have developed an effective vaccine for the Ebola virus after an experimental immunisation gave monkeys long-term protection from the deadly disease. WHEN DID IT FIRST EMERGE?Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, in Nzara, Sudan, and in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. HOW WAS IT INTRODUCED TO HUMANS?In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys and forest antelope. The current epidemic is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and has already claimed the lives of at least 2,296 people . A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed. The vaccine is effective for at least five weeks in lab monkeys but requires boosting with an additional vaccine to extend its protection to 10 months, according to a new study. A pair of experimental Ebola vaccines that protect monkeys from the fatal disease ravaging West Africa have been developed . The findings offer a glimpse of which - if any - of the Ebola vaccines in development will prove effective, and in what form. Pharmaceutical firms are accelerating their efforts to provide Ebola vaccines and treatments as the worst known outbreak of the virus tears through West Africa, killing more than 2,000 people. The results of the new study suggest, for instance, that a vaccine by pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) now being tested on healthy volunteers will protect against Ebola infection in the short term, but may have to be augmented for long-term protection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to report that a vaccine regimen produced 'durable immunity' against Ebola, protecting four out of four monkeys for 10 months. 'He's had a little chicken soup': Wife of US missionary with Ebola says he is showing signs of improvement since arriving for treatment in Nebraska. The vaccine uses a chimp adenovirus, closely related to a human version that causes upper respiratory tract infections, into which scientists spliced an Ebola gene. The adenovirus infects cells in a vaccinated animal, causing them to take up the gene and produce Ebola proteins. That primes the immune system to attack the proteins of Ebola viruses when an infection occurs.","Queensland health revealed the man took a number of blood tests which had negative results .

"A shortage of UK lorry drivers caused by European rules is threatening the economic recovery and putting deliveries to shops and homes at risk, hauliers and MPs have warned. The shortfall could lead to problems keeping the shelves stocked for Christmas and transporting the grit needed to keep roads safe in winter. Thousands of British heavy goods vehicle drivers are retiring as the population ages, experts warn. Scroll down for video . The shortage in lorry drivers could cause problems filling shelves before Christmas and transporting grit during the winter months (file image) Too few newly-qualified replacements are being trained up in the UK to take their place. And the problem has been made worse by a controversial EU directive, backed by Labour in 2009, which demanded experienced drivers take extra training. Drivers had until last Tuesday to qualify for a certificate of professional competence or face a £1,000 fine. But Tory MP Andrew Bridgen claims many decided to retire early or quit the industry instead. Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire and a qualified road haulage manager, said: ‘The shortage of HGV lorry drivers threatens growth in the UK economy. ‘We are still paying the cost of the previous Labour government’s slavish agreement to this and other EU directives. We already had and still have the safest and best regulated road haulage industry in Europe.’ A delegation from the Road Haulage Association is to meet Treasury officials this month to highlight the growing problem. Meanwhile, the Freight Transport Association said the lack of drivers to deliver the goods could lead to a bleak Christmas for many families. Sally Gilson, its skills policy development manager, said: ‘Our members are telling us they have genuine concerns over their ability to deliver Christmas this year. The pool of agency drivers is just not there. ‘And with the economy improving, a greater number is needed. However, this is not just a seasonal issue – our members recruiting full-time positions are struggling for applicants.’","EU rules insisting on higher training has made shortage worse .

"Chewing bamboo is serious work for giant panda Bai Yun, who quite happily gnaws on the stuff for up to 12 hours a day. So when the female panda chipped a tooth at her home in the San Diego Zoo, California, it meant that a trip to the dentist was on the cards. The 23-year-old panda was given anesthesia so that a veterinary team could take X-rays and repair the damaged  lower canine. Meg Sutherland Smith, associate director of veterinary services, uses a light to seal a dental composite during a restorative dental procedure on giant panda Bai Yun at the San Diego Zoo . Bai Yun eating bamboo - the panda is likely to have chipped her tooth while chewing on the foodstuff . Mum Bai Yun (left) with her cub little Xiao Liwu open a gift from keepers on the young panda's first birthday . A dental composite was used to fill in the chipped tooth, which was then cured with a light to seal the filling. The team also took the opportunity to give the animal's teeth a good clean. 'The good news is the pulp canal hadn't been compromised, but it's very close to breaking into the pulp canal,' said Meg Sutherland-Smith, associate director of veterinary services at the San Diego Zoo. 'What we attempted to do was a restorative procedure to cover up the part of the tooth that was chipped to, hopefully, prevent any further chipping or deterioration.' San Diego Zoo, which was recently named one of the US's top ten zoos by USA Today, explained that since giant pandas use their teeth to chew and break apart bamboo, their teeth can get worn or damaged over time.

Giant panda cub Mei Sheng, aged four months, peeps out from behind his mother Bai Yun as she dines on bamboo during his first day on display at San Diego Zoo, California . Bamboo is their primary source of nutrition for giant pandas. But since the foodstuff is not actually very nutritious, the animals need to eat a great deal deal of bamboo to get the energy they need. The San Diego Zoo’s currently has three giant pandas in residence on a research loan from China as part of a program to study the endangered species up close and help with breeding. A firm favourite with keepers, Bai Yun - which means 'White Cloud' - has already given birth to six cubs, five of which were conceived naturally. Hua Mei, aged just six and a half weeks, has a little snooze during a routine examination. Weighing just under seven pounds, vets found the little cub to be in excellent health for her age . Bai Yun first became a mother in 1999 when she gave birth to Hua Mei, seen here playing with her mum . Giant panda cub Xiao Liwu (left) examines his cake while celebrating his first birthday with mother Bai Yun . Weighing just three pounds, Mei Sheng lets out a squawk during an examination by the zoo's veterinary staff . The panda and her partner Gao Gao - father to four of her cubs - have become known as the zoo's 'super couple', thanks to their breeding record. Pandas are notoriously poor breeders, which is one reason their species is endangered, and females have only three days a year in which they can conceive. The San Diego Zoo in Balboa Park, San Diego, California, is one of the few zoos in the world that houses the giant panda. It is also home to more than 3,700 animals of more than 650 species and subspecies. The zoo pioneered the concept of open-air, cageless exhibits that re-create natural animal habitats. Its Institute for Conservation Research  raises California Condors, giant pandas, tigers, African Black Rhinos, and a 145 other endangered species. San Diego has reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and has conserved habitat at 50 field sites. It also have over 200 conservation scientist working in 35 countries around the world. The zoo also employs professional geneticists, cytologists and veterinarians, and it maintains a cryopreservation facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo. Bai Yun first became a mother in 1999 after being artificially inseminated with sperm from Shi Shi, the male panda at the zoo at that time. On August 21, she gave birth to her first cub Hua Mei, which translates as 'China USA'. The female cub was the first giant panda born in the United States to survive to adulthood. In 2003, Mei Sheng - which translates as 'Born in the USA' - came along, followed by Su Lin (A Little Bit of Something very Cute) in 2005, Zhen Zhen (Precious) in 2007 and Yun Zi (Son of Cloud) in 2009. Her youngest cub named Xiao Liwu (Little Gift) was born in 2012, making Bai Yun  the second oldest panda on record to give birth. The oldest  was two days older than Bai Yun at the time of birth of their respective cubs. The San Diego Zoo began their vital work with giant pandas in 1987, when two of the animals came over from China to visit for 100 days. After falling in love with the species, in 1996, the zoo worked out an agreement with China to house two adult pandas and their young offspring. The zoos current three residents enjoy large exhibit areas with trees and climbing structures, as well as air-conditioned bedrooms. Next to the panda viewing area is the building that houses the Giant Panda Team, where keepers and researchers can observe and study giant panda biology and behavior. As part of this long-term program, the Zoo is also collaborating with the Chinese Academy of Science in studies of behavior, ecology, genetics and conservation of wild pandas living in the Foping Nature Reserve. A mere 1,600 giant pandas are believed to exist in the wild, and the species is primarily threatened by habitat loss. San Diego Zoo Global, in conjunction with Chinese panda experts, continues to work on science-based panda conservation programs. A tiny Su Lin is seen at her first veterinary examination in 2005.

"Christina Regusters, 21, was convicted on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault and rape . A former day care worker in Philadelphia was convicted Friday of abducting a 5-year-old girl from her school classroom and sexually assaulting her during a 19-hour ordeal. Christina Regusters, 21, donned a Muslim dress and veil to impersonate the girl's mother and take her from Bryant Elementary School in January 2013, then posed as three different people to trick the blindfolded child. The girl was found half-naked the next morning at a cold, dark playground. The defense had questioned during the three-week trial whether Regusters could have acted alone. But prosecutors said she had viewed child pornography and Japanese anime involving child sexual torture and also looked up how to destroy DNA evidence. 'All the evidence pointed to the existence of one abductor and assailant — Regusters,' prosecutor Erin O'Brien said. Regusters, who is scheduled for . sentencing Dec. 15, was convicted of all counts, including kidnapping, . aggravated assault and indecent deviate sexual intercourse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The child was discovered the next day, about 4:40am, after a man walking by heard her screams from this playground . She turned . down a plea that would have put her behind bars for 40 years to 80 . years, according to her attorney. The child said she was blindfolded and stashed under a bed for most of her captivity. But she recalled hearing a talking bird, a key detail that helped police close in on a suspect. The defense argued that three other people home that day would have heard the girl's cries during the attack. Defense attorney W. Fred Harrison Jr. suggested an alternative theory: that his client helped an unnamed man commit the crime. Regusters' DNA — along with a trace of semen — was found on the T-shirt the girl was wearing when she was located. However, other key evidence was never found, including the girl's clothes, her backpack, the clothing the kidnapper wore in the school or the object believed to have been used in the attack. After the verdict, Harrison said he still believes other people were involved. 'I just don't think that this plan was something conceived by a 19-year-old to do all that was done in this case,' Harrison said. 'I just don't believe it.' The 5-year-old victim was signed out at this Philadelphia school by a woman claiming to be her mother. She was missing for the next 20 hours . The now-7-year-old girl suffered devastating injuries and needed a colostomy, but she has recovered physically and is now in second grade. She testified briefly during the trial. Regusters had moved in with an aunt in Philadelphia after her father went to prison in Maryland for assaulting her and a sister. She had worked at a day-care program the girl attended after school, but had been suspended and was home the day of the abduction. School officials did not realize the girl was missing for six hours, until dismissal time. The victim's family is suing the Philadelphia School District. The girl had been abducted from her school around 8:50am by a woman dressed in a burkha who called herself 'Tiffany'","Christina Regusters, 21, was found guilty of kidnapping, aggravated assault and indecent deviate sexual intercourse .

"Several aviation firms have embarked on a makeover this week – something airlines usually do once every 20 years. The first carrier to unveil a new look was Southwest Airlines which revealed an overhaul of the design and colour of its livery. It replaced the old canyon blue for a darker shade and rethought the stripes on the tail as well as adding new fonts and a yellow, red and blue heart underneath the plane - to show it cares. New blue: Southwest replaced the old canyon blue for a darker shade and rethought the stripes on the tail . Caring: Southwest Airlines also unveiled a heart to represent the care the carrier puts into its product . Close-up:  Southwest said the heart emblazoned on its aircraft symbolizes its commitment to remain true to our core values as it sets its sights on the future . Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines' CEO told CNN: ‘The heart emblazoned on our aircraft, and within our new look, symbolizes our commitment that we'll remain true to our core values as we set our sights on the future.’ But not to be outdone, Frontier Airlines announced it too would undergo a redesign, which will hark back to its past. The first Frontier Airlines closed down in 1986, but the airline has now borrowed design elements from the original livery, including the stylized, Saul Bass-designed F in the brand name. Both Southwest and Frontier's redesigns were leaked on Twitter ahead of the official announcements. An aviation expert suggests that the airline's new designs signify that they are going through a change in corporate identity. Both are completing deals - Southwest will finalize a takeover of AirTran Airways in the near future and Frontier is attempting to cash in on the budget market by becoming a low-cost carrier. New Frontier: Frontier Airlines redesigned its fleet as well this week, with the trademark array of animals on the tail staying  but it has reverted to an older version of the Frontier logo . Specifications: The airline has thought through every single detail of its new design for its brand . Jonny Clark, an airline brand specialist and founder of thedesignair.net told CNN that airline liveries have a shelf life of 20 years or so. But lately there's been a spate of aircraft redesigns. Other airlines which have decided to rebrand include: Air New Zealand, American and Iberia. Other airlines on the brink of doing the same are Abu Dhabi airline Etihad. ‘In the last couple of years, there's been an influx of new aircraft into a lot of fleets: 777s and A380s. ‘A lot of airlines have taken advantage of this opportunity to create a point of differentiation,’ explains Clark. American and European brands, he notes, tend to follow a similar aesthetic, known as ‘Eurowhite’ known for its simplicity. But not all airlines want to follow the current trend. Several carriers in the Pacific Rim have liveries reflecting local design culture. Hawaiian Airlines introduced its regional subsidy, 'Ohana by Hawaiian,' using a local aesthetic when crafting the new livery this year. The carrier teamed up with father-and-son design team Sig and Kuha'o Zane to craft a look that honoured the local culture. Hawaiian Airlines: It recently decided to extend its branding beyond the plane, and teamed with local arts collective Pow! Wow! Hawaii to custom design its ground service equipment at Honolulu International Airport . Artistic:  The artists incorporated Hawaiian Airlines' inter-island route map as a basis for the design . Fiji Airways also re-branded itself earlier this year drawing inspiration from Fijian Masi art, and used motifs, particularly the Teteva symbol on the tail.

New look: Fiji Airways got its new look from local culture and used the Teteva symbol on the tail . Awards: The airline has won several awards for its 2014 redesign highlighting local culture . Interior: Fiji Airways spared no expense on its interior, decorating each seat with a beautiful cushion . Last year, Bangkok Airways introduced kid-friendly mascots on its livery to appeal to families. In general, the airline is known for its colorful planes. Bangkok Airways: The airline introduced kid-friendly mascots on its livery to appeal to families . New Caledonia airline Aircalin is another airline which updated its livery this year when it received its first delivery of A320s. The airline took traditional symbols of the region -- the hibiscus flower and Kanak art -- to create a  new look. Aircalin: It updated its livery this year when it received its first delivery of A320s using the hibiscus flower and Kanak art both traditional symbols . And in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics, liveries were used to market the games. To mark Hello Kitty's 40th birthday, Taiwan's Eva Air introduced the Hello Kitty Jet to more locations around the world. However, one airline that has taken branding to another level is Air New Zealand. It partnered with the Lord of the Rings franchise, creating Tolkien-themed safety videos, and emblazoned the aircraft with a new decal each time a new film was released in cinemas. Air New Zealand: This airline partnered with the Lord of the Rings franchise, creating Tolkien-themed safety videos, and emblazoned the aircraft with a new decal every time a new film came out . All black: Air New Zealand introduced new all-black livery, featuring a decorative emblem of a New Zealand fern for the carrier's first 787-9 aircraft . But although rebranding has worked for some carriers, it  does not always have the desired affect. In 1997, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously showed her disgust for a British Airways tail fin redesign at a party conference. BA had recently ditched the Union Flag on its tail fins, replacing them with a series of unusual ethnic designs. But Thatcher was so alarmed at the sight of it that she took a handkerchief from her sleeve and covered the 747’s tail, pronouncing it ‘awful’.","SouthWest Airlines has unveiled a complete overhaul of its livery .

Samsung's It Doesn't Take A Genius parody campaign pokes fun at new Apple products that claim to have new technology . Samsung has a long history of satirical advertising and this new series called 'It doesn't take a genius to realise' campaigns is just a reboot of the 2012 campaign where the Korean company mocked Apple for the iPhone 5. In August Samsung mocked iPhone users, calling them 'wall huggers' because they constantly need to recharge the handset's battery. But it's not just Samsung who play dirty, Apple released an advertisement in 2011 starring comedian and actor Justin Long to embody an Apple Mac while a pudgy, suit-wearing man played the role of a boring and outdated PC.

"A new GCSE supergrade is to be awarded to the brightest teenagers after the current elite A* grade was devalued by being awarded to too many students. It is expected just one in 35 students who show ‘exceptional’ performance will be awarded the top ‘grade nine’ in GCSE - effectively an A**. The change for GCSE English and maths in 2017 - and other subjects from 2018 - is designed to help universities and employers spot the most gifted students. A new GCSE supergrade is to be awarded to the brightest teenagers after the current elite A* grade was devalued by being awarded to too many students . But it is also an indictment of the current system which has seen the proportion of A* grades creep up from 2.9 per cent when it was first introduced in 1994 to 7.8 per cent in 2011. The number of A* grades has since dipped to 6.7 per cent but fewer than 3 per cent of entrants are expected to get the new A** style grade nine. The changes were outlined yesterday by exams watchdog Ofqual after former Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered sweeping improvements to GCSEs beginning in 2015. Under the new system, traditional alphabetic grades – A* to G – will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine, with nine being the highest. The top two grades on the current scale – A and A* - will be replaced with three in the new system – seven, eight and nine. Just 20 per cent of pupils in line for at least an A under the current system will achieve the elite grade nine. In English, it could mean just 2.8 per cent of candidates gaining the top grade and in maths, 2.9 per cent. This is similar to the proportion who gained an A* when that grade was introduced in 1994 to identify higher and lower performers within the A-grade band. In a further reform, grades will be benchmarked for the first time against top-performing countries such as China and Finland. Glenys Stacey, head of Ofqual, said the so-called ’20 per cent rule’ was the ‘fairest’ way to ‘achieve that greater stretch and differentiation at the top end so many require’. Explaining the changes, Mrs Stacey said: ‘Similar numbers of students who got A* or A in the old qualifications will get either seven, eight or nine in the new qualifications. ‘That means we’ve got three grades – seven, eight and nine – whereas we only have A and A* at the moment, so two grades will become three. The changes were outlined yesterday by exams watchdog Ofqual after former Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered sweeping improvements to GCSEs beginning in 2015 . 'You’ll bear in mind there’s been a strong call from users of GCSEs that there needs to be greater differentiation at the top end.’ It also emerged that the same proportion of students will achieve at least a grade four under the new system as receive at least a grade C currently. Grade four is likely to be seen as a de facto ‘pass’ – as C is currently – but Ofqual said grade five was actually the standard of a pass in top-performing nations. Officials said that grade five had been pegged to performance in countries and regions such as Singapore, Shanghai, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands. Ofqual also released the results of a consultation on the planned changes, which found that a majority supported toughening up the criteria for the top grade. Several respondents said grade nine ‘should test the most able and be restricted to a small number of exceptional candidates’. One teacher said: ‘Grade 9 should be for exceptional results, otherwise it will go the same way that A* went after its introduction. How many are exceptional? I’ve no idea but based on an average school cohort sitting my subject’s exam I would expect a grade 9 to be achieved by only 2 or 3 out of an entry of 60+.’ However criticisms of the plan included the claim that state schools would suffer because independent schools would bring more pupils up to the standard required for the new grade. It would have a ‘disproportionate effect on state schools’, it was claimed. The 20 per cent rule will apply to revamped GCSEs in English language, English literature and maths which schools will begin to teach in autumn 2015, with the first exams taken in summer 2017. A similar approach is expected – but not guaranteed - for other GCSE subjects, which are being phased in from 2016. Changes to GCSEs already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects, with traditional end-of-course exams becoming the ‘default method of assessment’. The move is aimed at stopping the merry-go-round of pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade. Controversial ‘controlled assessments’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns over teachers were able to massage results. The new-look GCSEs will also feature more demanding subject content and a better mix of closed and open-ended questions. In a further move, a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an English and maths test just before their GCSEs to help examiners ensure that grading is accurate. If pupils do well in the tests, being introduced in 2017, it may mean that higher grades are awarded in GCSEs. Ofqual would be able to claim grades had risen legitimately – rather than because of grade inflation - because candidates had achieved higher standards in their subjects. If pupils fail to improve on the previous year, Ofqual will use the results as justification for keeping grades down. Head teachers’ leaders were already voicing concerns last night over the plan to limit the proportion of pupils gaining the grade nine to 20 per cent of A-grade performers. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘We do have concerns about limiting the proportion of students who can get the highest grade. If students achieve at a very high level that should be recognised. Where standards have improved, the results must reflect this.’","New grade to be awarded to brightest teenagers after A* grade devalued .

"Gold Coast Councillor Chris Robbins who says she's recived threats of gang rape and death over a proposed moque . A Gold Coast City councillor says she's been threatened with gang rape and death over a proposed mosque - and Facebook has been protecting the identity of her tormentors. Chris Robbins says she has spent several weeks trying to get Facebook to reveal the identity of the creators of the 'Stop the Mosque at Currumbin' page after it used a photo of her as its profile picture, claiming she was receiving money from unspecified Islamic backers - a claim she denies. The photo was subsequently removed after Ms Robbins engaged a lawyer who threatened the social media website with defamation, but the page and user comments threatening her with violence remain. Cr Robbins said she was targeted by protesters after announcing council had received an application to build a mosque at an industrial site in Currumbin, on the southern end of Queensland's Gold Coast. 'Horrific vilification, threatening all kinds of nastiness directed at me because I'd basically gone to the meeting and said council's got an application for a mosque and we will be assessing it as we're obliged to by law,' she said. 'That essentially peeved some people who wanted me to stand up and say that at the end of the day this wouldn't happen.' Controversy over the proposed development has deepened after it received support at a council planning committee meeting on Wednesday. Cr Robbins says she has spent several weeks trying to get Facebook to reveal the identity of the creators of the 'Stop the Mosque at Currumbin' page after it used a photo of her as its profile picture, claiming she was receiving money from unspecified Islamic backers, a claim she denies . The Gold Coast City Council's planning committee has recommended to replace an abandoned factory at Currumbin Waters into an Islamic mosque but has refused an application for 4am prayers following wide-spread objections from residents, the Brisbane Times reports. The issue was discussed by committee members for three hours on Wednesday morning, as they addressed the social impact, parking and noise of the proposed 4am morning prayers. Cr Robbins, who voted against the proposal on Wednesday, says the lack of accountability for the Facebook page's authors is despicable and highlights how easily people can target victims through social media with little fear of consequences. 'I'm very upset that the social media platform has taken no responsibility,' she said. 'If you want to make the people who posted to take responsibility for it, Facebook won't tell you who they are. That's what really peeves me because I would take legal action against those people for vilifying me. 'I can't take on Facebook. I don't have the money to take on Facebook in the USA. 'Facebook is allowing those individuals to hide their identity and to vilify and libel and threaten people like me. That's okay, I can handle it, but if I'm 15? This is a terrible thing.' The proposed mosque will be built in Currumbin, which is south of Queensland's Gold Coast . Cr Robbins, who believes there are some legitimate community concerns about the proposal, says a final decision on whether the mosque application gets approved will be judged on planning grounds and nothing else. Queensland police are also investigating death threats which were made against Cameron Caldwell and William Owen-Jones, two of the five councillors who approved the planning proposal. The Facebook page published contact details for all five of the councillors after Wednesday's meeting, calling them 'traitors' and asking followers to contact them with their views. A full council meeting next Tuesday, September 16, will decide the application's fate. Comment was sought from Facebook.","Councillor Chris Robbins says Facebook is protecting the identity of her tormentors .

"Members of some eastern European gangs are making more money from illegally harvesting shellfish than from selling drugs, police said. Divers working for organised crime gangs are using the banned practice of electro-fishing - where sea creatures are electronically stunned - to bring in hauls of  worth up to £65,000 a day. The gangs are targeting razor clams off the coast of Argyll, west Scotland. The shellfish make up an important part of the fishing industry, contributing £3.1 million to the Scottish economy in 2013. Black market: Members of some eastern European gangs are making up to £65,000 a day from illegally harvesting razor clams off the west coast of Scotland - more than they make selling drugs. File image . Detective Chief Inspector Calum Young, responsible for Argyll, Bute and West Dunbartonshire said: 'The money to organised crime and criminals is significant, it makes more than drugs does.' But he explained that the practice was difficult to stop as unlicensed boats destroyed evidence of electro-fishing, which has been illegal since 1998, over the side of the boat when police approached. He said that there are 80 known individuals involved in the black market fishing, many of eastern European origin, and that their sophisticated operation is very efficient. He explained that the gangs have boats, specialist equipment and divers who are trained in electro-fishing. He said: 'They have a generator on the boat and deploy electrodes and probes on to the seabed and run them along the seabed, between 10 and 15 metres deep. 'The electricity stuns the razor clams and divers walk behind the boat scooping the clams up.' Popular: The illegal shellfish are quickly transported to Glasgow, where they are exported to the lucrative Asian market via Singapore. File image . 'Many of the divers are known to be of eastern European origin and there is concern that they are being exploited and their personal safety is in danger - because of the proximity of electricity in water. 'There is a major concern that we will be faced with fatalities in the waters off Argyll and Bute.' He added that they have vehicles that allow them to quickly transport their haul to Glasgow airport, where they are usually shipped within 24 hours to Asian markets via Singapore. The gangs also have a way of legitimising their catch for overseas sale - despite lacking legal documents - make . The practice of electro-fishing, which renders any shellfish harvested legally unfit to eat, is highly dangerous. It is estimated that illegally active fishing boats are taking between 500-600kg of razor clams a day, while a comparable fishing boat on a legitimate fishing trip might recover between one and two kilos a day. But it has been illegal since 1998 to use electro-fishing methods to harvest the shellfish. Earlier this year the Scottish Government brought in even tougher licensing laws and punishments to deter poachers. One boat had been stopped last Thursday under suspicion of being involved in electro-fishing, Police Scotland said. Inquiries into the ownership of the boat are understood to be ongoing by Marine Scotland. Last week, a multi-agency operation run from Oban, involving Police Scotland, Marine Scotland, Argyll and Bute Council and the Health and Safety Executive, kicked into action to clamp down on electro-fishing for razor clams off the coast. Competition: Electro-fishing, which has been banned since 1998, can bring in up to 600kg of razor clams a day, while a licensed boat fishing off the coast of Argyll, pictured, might just bring in one kilo.

"It may seems like just another dance remake at first glance. But look a little closer and there are indications that set this particular remake apart from any other. As the dancers jump, grind and thrust, the footage zooms into red scars that dissect their skin and large lumps on their bodies. That’s because the women in the recreation of Eric Prydz’s ultra-sexy Call On Me video are all cancer patients. The ladies who took part in the remake of Eric Prydz's Call On Me are at various stages of battling cancer . The Norwegian patients and survivors prove that they’re not defined by their illness when they set out to re-enact one of the sexiest music videos ever. The idea was conceived by Aktiv Against Cancer, an organisation that wants people to be active after they are diagnosed with cancer, and after their treatment. Their aim was to demonstrate the positive effect of physical activity on the body and mind. And that no one should let cancer kill their confidence. The organisation believes that physical activity should be a part of cancer treatment. The video ends on the shot of the group's 'dance instructor' walking towards the lone male dancer in the class. As she gets closer to him she takes off her long, blonde wig . Not what it looks like: At first glance, it seems to be just another video but close-ups show the scars of recovering patients . Getting sexy back: The video was made by Aktiv Against Cancer which believes activity helps aid recovery . Aktiv Against Cancer was founded by nine-times New York marathon champion Grete Waitz, who after her own diagnosis, joined forces with Helle Aanesen in November 2007 and started the organisation. The group made the video not just to prove that cancer patients and survivors can still be sexy after a diagnosis but also to show that physical activity helps in recovery. The dancers in this video were given training and and then flown to London, where they were taken to the same studio where the original video was shot. One woman who took part in the video said: 'We believe in confidence. That's why we set out to remake one of the most daring music videos ever, starring cancer patients. 'We did this to raise awareness. We did this to prove that cancer doesn’t have to kill your confidence.'","Norwegian sufferers and survivors were given training and flown to London .

"Pakistan's army has arrested ten Taliban militants suspected of shooting teenage gender equality campaigner, Malala Yousafzai, in the head in 2012. Activist, Malala, won world recognition after she was brutally attacked and left fighting for her life for advocating gender equality and education for women. After receiving emergency treatment in Pakistan, she was flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and now lives in Britain with her family. Scroll down for video . Activist, Malala, won world acclaim after she was brutally attacked and left fighting for her life for advocating gender equality and education for women . Speaking today, Army spokesman General Asim Saleem Bajwa, said the detained men attacked Malala, then 14, on orders from Mullah Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistani Taliban. The army is currently waging war against the extremist group in North Waziristan, a tribal region on the border of Afghanistan that has long been a terrorist stronghold. Their offensive operation was launched on June 15 after militants attacked one of the country's busiest airports, in the southern city of Karachi, shocking the nation. Mr Bajwa said that 'the entire gang involved in the murder attempt... has been busted'. He confirmed that the 'terrorists' were part of Tehrik-e-Taliban - an umbrella group encompassing several militant organizations across the tribal areas. Pakistani Major General Asim Bajwa today announced the capture of the militants who shot schoolgirl Malala Yousafza in the head in October 2012 . Malala, now 16, was shot in the head in October 2012 while returning home from school. The precocious teenage activist had been calling for expanding girls' education in deeply conservative areas of Pakistan at the time. She is from the same region that was once home to Taliban chief, Fazlullah - the man who ordered her assassination. Fazlullah was elevated to his current leadership position after his predecessor, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in North Waziristan. He is credited with leading the Taliban takeover of Swat in 2007 in an attempt to overthrow the government and impose a harsh version of Islamic law. Just a few hours drive from Islamabad, the valley was only reclaimed after a major military operation was launched in 2009 - and since then Fazlullah has been on the run. Mr Bajwa said that 'the entire gang involved in the murder attempt... has been busted' Pakistan believes he is now hiding in Afghanistan, and Mr Bajwa said Islamabad has raised the issue with the Afghan government. Both countries have long accused each other of ignoring militants who launch cross-border attacks from their territory. Mr Bajwa did not say when or where the men were captured, but said security agencies caught all ten in a sting operation after acting on a tip-off from a Taliban member inside the same cell. The head of the cell had also been arrested. Malala recovers in Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after being shot in the head . Speaking about Malala's shooting, Mr Bajwa said: 'The group acted upon the instructions of Mullah Fazlullah who, while based in Kunar, Afghanistan, passed instructions through his two associates. 'We will continue our efforts until (Fazlullah) is arrested or killed.' He added that it was a 'known fact' that Fazlullah and other 'terrorists' are hiding in Afghanistan. The military says it has so far killed at least 975 militants and that the operation is 'progressing' as planned.

"When it comes to problem areas many of us have an uncanny ability to unearth less-than-desirable parts of our bodies that our partners probably never even knew existed. And now, it seems, one area of the body is becoming an increasing concern for women - 'the banana roll'. The fruity term is being used to refer to a pocket of fat which can accumulate just underneath the buttocks. Scroll down for video . Big-bottomed stars like Kim Kardashian (left) and Nicki Minaj (right) have made being curvaceous popular . One clinic has seen a three-fold increase in female patients booking in treatments to banish fat from this area, seemingly inspired by the perfectly curved bottoms of celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj. Dr Dennis Wolf, cosmetic doctor at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, where such treatments have been on the rise, explains: 'It is very common in women for an area of fat to form in the crease just below the buttocks. The heavier the bottom is, often the bigger the roll will become because of the weight above it. 'Removing that roll is an effective way of creating greater definition between the top of the thighs and the buttocks, however you must be careful not to remove too much, as this can cause the buttocks to droop.' 'Banana roll lipo' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the bum cheeks. The procedure means the top of the patient's thighs are reduced and this unwanted fat is then added to their bottom to make it more curvaceous. The two treatments combined are said to help achieve the perfect posterior. The patient has the dreaded 'banana roll' removed whilst improving the definition of their buttocks for a curvier silhouette. 'Banana roll lipo' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the buttocks, to reduce the size of the thighs below the buttocks crease and enhance the curves of the patient . However, Dr Wolf said the effect is not always permanent. 'Patients also need to be prepared to put in some hard work themselves. By toning up the glutes you can help prevent the bottom from drooping and to keep the area tight,' he said. Speaking to the MailOnline, British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons spokesman Nilesh Sojitra agreed that women shouldn't rely on liposuction alone to stay slim. 'Liposuction indeed has shown a dramatic rise over the years and certainly more demands for buttock contouring which involves creating curves underneath and also transferring fat to buttocks. 'These procedures are safe if done correctly but patients need to be realistic as to the eventual outcome and remember that photos in magazines are often Photoshopped. 'Weight gain in any liposuction will destroy the results gained,' Nilesh said. Do the following exercises at least three times a week for a pert bottom... 1. Squats . Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, then keeping your back straight and head up, lower your bottom to the floor as if you are going to sit down, then rise up again. Repeat x 15. 2. Lunges . From standing position, take an exaggerated step forward with one leg until the knee is at 90 degrees angle, positioned over your toes. The foot should remain on the spot but with the knee should sink to near the ground. Push back up with the forward leg to standing. Repeat x 15. 3. Glute lifts . Lie on your back with your feet on the floor with your knees bent. Then lift your bottom off the floor with your weight balanced on your feet and across your shoulders. Slowly lower your bottom back down and up again without resting it completely on the ground, repeat x 15.","'Banana roll' is a term for the pocket of fat underneath the buttock crease .

"Gone was the big-eyed, waiflike look . that made the teenage Kate Bush a pop pin-up when her first single . Wuthering Heights went to number one in 1978. Instead, . it was a more mature singer who made a rare but welcome return to the . spotlight yesterday to receive an award for her last album. She is famously reclusive after withdrawing from public life in 1998 following the birth of her beloved son. But yesterday singer Kate Bush made her long-awaited return to the spotlight to collect a prize for her album, 50 Words for Snow. Proud: Tom Jones presented Kate Bush with her award for the critically acclaimed 50 Words For Snow album . When she took to the stage her russet-coloured locks were gone and in their place was a mane of . dyed jet black hair, leaving fans hard-pressed to recognise her. Described by one American interviewer recently as now 'more like the . British equivalent of a soccer mom than a Bronte character come to . life', the 53-year-old star still sported her trademark heavy black . eyeliner. Taking the stage at the South Bank Awards to collect her gong from Sir . Tom Jones, Miss Bush, wearing a baggy black dress, admitted that she was . 'very nervous'. Thanking a list of people who had appeared on the album, the singer paid . tribute Sir Elton John - calling him one of her 'heroes' - as well as . Stephen Fry. Career: Kate Bush in 1979 when the pop star was in her heyday . Pin-up: Kate Bush first topped the charts with the single Wuthering Heights, released when she was 19-years-old . However, she saved her biggest thanks for her husband, guitarist Danny . McIntosh, and 13-year-old son Bertie, revealing that her teenage son . actually sings on the first track of the album, Snowflake. The star has praised Bertie, real name Albert, for helping her work, . previously stating: 'I love being a mother, I think it's the best thing . I've ever done, and I personally feel that it's had a very positive . effect on my work. 'I think it's an encouraging force for creativity, it . feeds creativity - it did for me, certainly.' Notoriously methodical, . Miss Bush yesterday joked that this album was one of her quickest to . make - as it only took a year to record, which prompted laughter from . the crowd at London's Dorchester Hotel. The singer was up against British singing phenomenon Adele and PJ Harvey - but beat them both to win the pop prize. Sir Tom, 71, said: 'I'm glad she showed up because apparently she . doesn't like the media much and doing these things, but it's nice she . felt this was important enough and it was lovely to see her.' Captivating: South London born singer songwriter Kate Bush on stage wearing Amazon outfit in 1980, the year she released her album Never for Ever . After retreating from the spotlight, Miss Bush did not release an album for 12 years before releasing Aerial in 2005. She then released Director's Cut last May, an amalgamation and . re-working of some of the songs from two of her previous albums The . Sensual World and The Red Shoes. Miss Bush then released a new album 50 Words For Snow last November, which won her plaudits and a BRIT awards nomination. The singer, who has confessed: 'I don't think I've ever felt part of the . music industry', now divides her time with her family between a house . set on a clifftop in Devon, and another property in Berkshire. Last year, she told a BBC Radio 4 interview that she would not tour due . to her family commitments, adding: 'I'm sure that things will change, at . the moment my family life is incredibly important to me and it comes . first and my work fits in around it, which is quite easy to do with the . recording process.' In the rare interview, Miss Bush - . whose other hits included The Man With The Child In His Eyes, Babooshka . and Running Up That Hill - also revealed she has nightmares over performing . live again. She famously only toured once, in 1979, and said: 'I do have the odd . dream where I'm on stage and I've completely forgotten what I'm meant to . be performing - so they are more nightmares than dreams.' In January, Miss Bush was back in the headlines after an obsessive flew . over from New York to the UK with a £3,000 Tiffany engagement ring and . broke into her home. American Frank Tufaro was arrested at the star's Devon property on Boxing Day after making his transatlantic flight. The Daily Mail told how Tufaro had sent Miss Bush a string of emails . proposing marriage and turned up at her home near Kingsbridge, in the . South Hams area.

"Celtic completed a deadline-busting swoop for Stefan Scepovic but missed out on a second striker when a deal for Manchester City's John Guidetti collapsed just after midnight due to the paperwork failing to go through in time. Serbian international Scepovic became the only transfer fee paid in the Scottish window when his second u-turn in 24 hours teed up a £2.2million move from Sporting Gijon. And, hours after shipping out Amido Balde, Teemu Pukki, Holmbert Fridjonsson on loan, Celtic manager Ronny Deila thought he’d made it a double with a 12-month deal to take Guidetti from Manchester City. The 22-year-old travelled to Glasgow, but saw the deal fall down when the registration papers from both sides failed to give the SFA enough time to process the transfer. Scroll down for video . Disappointment: John Guidetti travelled to Celtic for talks but the paperwork failed to arrive at SFA . The deal for number one target Scepovic ended a rollercoaster pursuit when Celtic declared themselves ‘disgusted’ by his decision to sign for Spanish club Getafe instead. By mid-afternoon, however, Spanish league Financial Fair Play regulations had wrecked that deal - forcing the striker’s agents to go cap in hand to Celtic begging for a reprieve. Guidetti hoped to join fellow City loan signing Jason Denayer in Glasgow after just one first appearance for the English champions. But Celtic senior sources said they were content to land Scepovic after the ‘will he won’t he?’ saga was finally resolved. Wanted: Guidetti has failed to break into the first team at Manchester City . Despite strong interest from Southampton and Sunderland, the Scottish champions refused to sell unsettled defender Virgil van Dijk. But they did allow Amido Balde to join Belgium’s Beveren on a year loan, while Pukki and Fridjonsson both joined Danish club Brondby for the next 12 months. Dylan McGeouch, also moved to Hibernian on loan until the end of the season while fringe player Jackson Irvine was allowed to go on loan to Ross County. Elsewhere in Scotland, Dundee United midfielder Michael Gardyne returned to former club Ross County on loan. The managerless Staggies have also signed defender Darren Barr and have agreed a loan deal for Celtic midfielder Jackson Irvine.

"This is 'La Bestia' - or 'The Beast' - which is perhaps the most treacherous train in the world. It is not built to carry passengers, but that doesn't stop about 1,500 migrants piling on board the freight train's roof every day. They are trying to reach the Mexico-U.S. border to start a new life in America. Most are refugees fleeing endemic violence in Central America. But they face a terrifying journey ahead of them. For years Mexico's notorious drug gangs have been in control of the route, charging $100 (£64) or more for permission to mount the train. Threats, attacks and extortion continue en route after it departs from Arriaga, in Mexico's southern Chiapas state, around 160 miles north of the Guatemala border. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Central American immigrants get on the so-called La Bestia (The Beast) cargo train, in an attempt to reach the Mexico-US border . Mexico's drug gangs have hijacked the route, charging $100 (£64) or more for permission to mount the train . The attacks are a vital component of Mexico’s organised crime underworld, and constitute a criminal industry estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars per year. Warning: A public service cartoon in El Salvador shows the dangers children face . El Salvador is broadcasting a cartoon to warn parents of the dangers of using 'coyotes' to take their children to the U.S. The public service cartoon shows a father being told over the phone by a 'coyote' - or people smuggler - that his children will be well cared for. The children are then led away by a menacing-looking jackal, according to Bloomberg News. The animation, funded in part by the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador as part of efforts to stem the flow of unaccompanied minors coming across the border, also shows the children describing how they were inappropriately touched, forced to work, or abandoned by those paid to care for them. The train terminates at the outskirts of Mexico City, 520 miles away. There, lying in wait, are more members of Mexico’s most powerful and violent criminal gangs. Dirty, tired and hungry, the passengers then face a 12-mile journey to the shelter for undocumented migrants in Huehuetoca. The gangs take advantage of this. The criminals make them pay a toll to walk to the shelter. If they don’t pay, they kidnap, beat them, ask for sexual favours. In the worst cases, they’ll be forced to work for the gangs or be killed. Mexico has promised to stem the flow of Central American migrants to the United States by tightening control at its notoriously porous Guatemalan border. But messages from the country's top two leaders in little more than a week have provided few details on how. And the scene on the ground is business as usual. Dozens of . Central Americans who paid $1.50 a head could be seen this week crossing . the broad Suchiate River on improvised rafts of inner tubes and wooden . boards, in full view of Mexican police on the shore and immigration . agents posted on a bridge overhead. 'I don't see anything has changed,' Guatemalan Luisa Fuentes, 56, said as she rode a raft to Mexico. 'La . Bestia,' a decrepit freight train that carries migrants north from the . border state of Chiapas, still carried many riders on its roof. President . Enrique Pena Nieto's government says it is catching and deporting far . more Central Americans, but it remains unclear if enforcement has . increased or just that the number of detentions is simply rising along . with the larger numbers of Central Americans moving through Mexico. In . the U.S., the migration has overwhelmed the Border Patrol, shelters and . immigration courts. Top officials, including the vice president, have . traveled to Central America with a stern message for those contemplating . the trip, and President Barack Obama is seeking $3.7 billion from . Congress to respond to the crisis. About 44,000 unaccompanied minors from . El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been apprehended at the U.S. border from October through the end of June. On board: Passengers risk robbery, kidnapping, rape, and murder to start a new life in America . Migrant smuggling is seen as a highly lucrative business that generates payoffs for local law enforcement to look the other way . The . United States has been sensitive about appearing to be pressuring . Mexico. But at a June 20 meeting in Guatemala, U.S. Vice President Joe . Biden warned Mexican Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong that . with the economic growth in Mexico, Central Americans might decide to . stay in Mexico, according to a senior administration official familiar . with the session. 'We found very willing partners in the Pena Nieto administration,' said the U.S. official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session. 'It's not something where we need carrots and sticks; it's been more like we need your help and they said, `All right, let me tell you what we can and cannot do.' Pena Nieto . this month announced a plan that includes more border inspection . stations to help fight trafficking of immigrants from Guatemala, El . Salvador and Honduras. Osorio Chong said last week that Mexico would put . an end to illegal migrants catching rides on La Bestia. The . government had been expected to provide details about the effort on . Tuesday. Instead, officials just announced the appointment of a . little-known politician to head its immigration-enforcement plan. They . promised again to improve border-crossing facilities but gave no details . on what is actually planned. 'We . have to get more cooperation ... to make the southern border an area of . stability, and rule of law,' said Humberto Mayans, Mexico's newly . appointed head of southern border improvement plans. Business . as usual: Mexico has promised to stem the flow of Central American . migrants to the United States by tightening control at its notoriously . porous Guatemalan border but so far progress has not been made . Passengers . risk their lives to get to Mexico City where they can travel to a . holding camp for immigrants and then on to the U.S. border . Passengers emerge from the 520-mile journey to Mexico City dirty, tired and hungry and then face gangs lying in wait . The . tragic consequences for those who risk riding the train can be seen at . Alberge de Buen Pastor Jesus, a temporary medical center in Mexico that . cares for those who lose limbs falling from the train. When organic Fair Trade coffee company Dean's Beans, from Massachusetts, visited the center they witnessed young men and women who had lost arms and legs, and were bewildered and worried that they had become a burden on the families they had been trying to help. Many of the injured passengers spoken too used to work on coffee farms before the cost of salaries fell below the cost of running the farm, or were teenagers just out of school. 'One of the men, Benito, is only sixteen. He looks around the hospital room in total bewilderment. Two weeks ago, he was heading north to help his family. Now he is in a hospital bed he can't pay for, in a country he is not allowed to be in, and is missing his left arm and right leg. I can't even fathom the despair,' the team from Dean's Beans wrote. Mexico's government had been expected to provide details about the effort on Tuesday, but the announcement didn't come . At the end of the line, passengers then face a 12-mile journey to the shelter for undocumented migrants in Huehuetoca . Mexico's southern frontier is less than half the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, but its thick jungles make it highly difficult to police, particularly for a nation already struggling to clamp down on organized crime violence and corruption. Mexican politicians generally see little upside in cracking down on migrants who simply pass through on the way to slipping into the U.S., just as so many Mexicans have done. They stay only a few days and don't affect schools or services. What's more, migrant smuggling is a highly lucrative business that generates payoffs for local law enforcement to look the other way and lots of revenue for legal businesses. In a purge in 2010 and 2011, Mexico's National Immigration Institute fired more than 400 agents for allegedly taking bribes, extorting migrants or failing vetting tests. Central American migrants routinely say they have been picked up by local police in northern Mexico, who turn them over to criminal gangs that hold them for ransom. In 2008, an entire town in central Mexico rioted to defend Central American migrants from police who wanted to kidnap them. Informal crossing has been tolerated for so long that it has become a mainstay of the southern border economy. Guatemalans resell Mexican goods on the other side, and innumerable bars and dance halls operate on the Mexican side staffed by Central American women. 'The tolerance exists because both governments know that people depend on it,' said Guatemalan truck driver Moises Moran. 'All of us who live here have done something illegal at some time ... I have.' But detentions have increased. In late June, the National Immigration Institute said the number of minors detained through the first half of the year was 10,505, more than in all of 2013. Monthly deportations rose dramatically in May, about three times the number in January. For many, the best chance of getting north is the train. But even if officials do make the train harder to board, it's far from the only path through Mexico. Migrants with money to pay smugglers also travel by car or bus. On Monday night, Honduran migrant Darwin Ernesto Ramirez, 28, said he had already heard the rumours that this could be La Bestia's last run. Just before he swung aboard the train, he said: 'I don't think they can stop this. A lot of us will just wait for it down the tracks.' 'Mexico will cede to U.S. pressure and will implement a semi-closed border in response,' predicts Victor Clark, director of Tijuana's Binational Center for Human Rights. But rather than stopping the flow, Clark says, it will just make smugglers richer. 'The prices they charge will go up,' he said.","Hundreds of 'passengers' pile onto the freight train that departs from Mexico's southern Chiapas state .

"Judge Robin Onions blasted online porn which 'treats women as objects' as he sentenced boy, 14, for raping a girl, ten, after watching films . A judge condemned the corrosive effect of online pornography after a schoolboy who visited vile websites abducted and raped a girl of ten. The boy, who was 14 at the time, stopped his victim as she walked home from school, claiming he needed help looking for something he had lost. Once they were alone, he grabbed her by the mouth and told her not to scream as he violently assaulted her using methods he had seen on free porn sites. A judge said he ‘used, abused then abandoned his victim’ after repeatedly watching internet porn that ‘treats women as objects and not people’ on his home computer. At Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday, Judge Robin Onions said the boy wanted someone to have sex with and ‘because of your age and build, it was not going to be an adult woman and you looked for someone weaker and smaller than you’. He said it was a sustained and persistent attack, adding: ‘There was also a degree of planning as a result of the corrosive effect of the viewing of adult pornography and isolating the victim from being seen in what was a busy part of the town.’ The teenager’s mother was reportedly unaware that he had visited such sites from his bedroom at their Shropshire home. Last night MPs called for urgent measures to stop children using such sites. Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘This horrific case goes to show how dangerous online pornography is for young people. ‘The Government’s failure to introduce a legal requirement for internet filters… is letting down young people.’ Jon Brown, of the NSPCC, said: ‘This case is a horrendous example of just how badly wrong things can go when children get access to inappropriate and abusive adult material.’ The Daily Mail’s campaign against online porn calls for internet service providers to block adult content unless a household opts to see it. The Government has pledged that by the end of 2014 all internet users will be asked whether they want to install a family-friendly filter. Last year, BT, TalkTalk and Sky agreed to offer such filters. In April, the Government revealed that it is drawing up plans that will force UK-based pornography sites to prove their users are over 18. David Cameron has also said that possessing online porn depicting rape will become illegal in England and Wales, in line with Scotland. The boy watched graphic material before stopping his victim as she walked home from school, putting his hand over her mouth and attacking her (file picture) The boy, now 15, admitted rape and attempted rape in April this year. Neither he nor his victim can be identified for legal reasons. He sat in the dock with his mother beside him as he was sentenced to four years at a secure unit which rehabilitates young sex offenders. Philip Beardwell, prosecuting, said the girl – who lacks social skills – was walking home on a busy street in Shrewsbury. The boy asked her to help him look for something on a patch of waste ground behind a container. He asked the girl’s name and told her his before grabbing her, saying: ‘If you scream something bad is going to happen. If you do what I say I’ll let you go.’ The girl told police she was ‘really scared’ as he raped her. It was 40 minutes before he left and she was able to pick up her school bag and escape. Initially, the boy denied his crime, even when police told him his DNA had been found on the victim. Simon Parry, defending, said he accepted his guilt and his remorse was genuine. He was a ‘young’ 15-year-old who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at an early age, he said. The boy will be placed on the sex offenders’ register and is subject to a sexual offences prevention order for ten years. He was barred from any regulated activity with children or vulnerable people.","Boy, 14, raped ten-year-old after luring her to patch of waste ground .

"Nigel Farage is preparing to muscle into the battle against Scottish independence following his historic success in the European elections. The UKIP leader wants to open a new front in the campaign against the SNP, to the horror of the established Better Together allies. Mr Farage was yesterday basking in the glory of winning his first seat north of the Border in a major humiliation for Alex Salmond, who had pleaded with Scots to make a direct choice between the SNP and Ukip. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage wants to use his European election triumph as a springboard to stop Alex Salmond splitting Scotland off from the rest of the UK in September's independence referendum . David Coburn, UKIP’s victorious candidate in Scotland, yesterday thanked the First Minister for polarising the debate, as Labour accused the SNP of foolishly delivering a boost for Mr Farage. In a stinging attack, Labour's Scottish leader Johann Lamont said: 'Scotland now has three nationalist MEPs.' After winning more than 140,000 votes in the contest, Mr Farage is now planning repeat visits Scotland in the run-up to September’s referendum as he feels he has a legitimate platform to speak out in favour of the Union. He told the Mail: 'With the election of David Coburn as the first UKIP MEP [in Scotland], we have not just put a fox into Westminster’s henhouse, we have put a pine marten into the Holyrood one. 'We are the only truly national political party, and the success of UKIP in Scotland in these elections proves that there is a voice for those who believe in an independent Scotland as part of the UK. 'Alex Salmond now finally has to deal honestly and openly with the key contradictions in his position – independence in Europe is no independence at all. 'They know it, we know it, and now we can see the Scottish people know it as well.' Mr Farage added: 'We have proven over the last few days that we are genuinely a UK independence party. 'Most of you have thought for years that every Ukip voter is a retired half colonel living on the edge of Salisbury plain desperate for the re-introduction for the birch and only cheering up after the first pink gin of the day. 'Well, we have got a few of those that vote for us there is no doubt about it. But actually we cross all social divides. 'In terms of geography that’s even more fascinating. We have made a breakthrough in Scotland - something which Alex Salmond will not enjoy very much at all. And we will inject a completely new dynamic into the referendum on separation that is coming up on September 18 this year.' SNP leader Alex Salmond is confident of winning September's independence referendum despite polls showing a narrowing, but consistent lead for the 'No' campaign . Nigel Farage was all smiles during a meeting of the leaders of European Parliament political groups in Brussels today . The UKIP leader was back in Brussels today after last week's European election triumph in which he topped the polls - pushing Labour into second narrowly ahead of the Tories . The final results of the European election were announced in Scotland yesterday lunchtime, with the SNP holding on for victory, despite a sharp rise in Labour’ s support. With just over one-third of Scots voting in the contest - a total of 1.35million adults - the Nationalists won 28.9 per cent (389,503 votes) – down 0.2 points since 2009 – and Labour won 25.9 per cent (348,219 votes), up 5.1 points. That handed both parties two seats in the European Parliament, with the Tories picking up a seat after winning a better-than-expected 17.2 per cent (231,330 votes) – it’s best total for around a quarter of a century. Ukip secured an historic and unexpected fourth place, picking up Scotland’s sixth and final seat with 140,534 votes and a 10.4 per cent share, despite a shambolic campaign north of the Border. The Greens won 8 per cent and pushing the LibDems into a humiliating sixth place. At the declaration of results in Edinburgh, Mr Coburn was rebuffed when he cheekily asked Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran if he could join the anti-independence Better Together campaign. Organisers have officially banned Ukip from joining the Tory/Labour/LibDem group, amid fears of fringe elements within the party. But Mr Coburn said: 'The Ukip revolution has now come to Scotland. He added: 'I’d like to thank Alex Salmond for his tremendous help in getting us elected.' Throughout the election campaign, the SNP attempted to persuade Scots there was a direct contest between the third candidate on their list, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, and Mr Coburn. Ukip’s success now makes it much harder for Mr Salmond to argue that Scotland and England are ‘different countries’ as he bids to boost support ahead of the independence referendum in September. In desperation, the First Minister has resorted to blaming the media. With 1.35million votes cast, the SNP won the backing of 389,503 Scots in Thursday’s contest, with Labour . But as yesterday’s results were announced, Labour’s lead candidate David Martin said: 'I’d like to suggest to David Coburn that the first thing he does when he sits down and recovers from the champagne is write a letter to Alex Salmond because there is no doubt in my mind that Alex Salmond’s decision to polarise the campaign, the Scottish debate, between two extremes is why David Coburn is with us today as a member of the European Parliament.' That was met with mutterings of ‘poor show’ by deputy SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. She said later: 'Ukip topped the poll in England and have scraped the final seat in Scotland. The gulf between the performances is absolutely massive.' Scotland's First Minister has turned the tables on Labour following devolution, becoming the dominant party in Holyrood  - despite an electoral system designed to make one-party rule extremely difficult to achieve . But Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'From Poland to France, Greece to Scotland we have seen the rise of nationalism and Scotland now has three nationalist MEPs. 'Alex Salmond and Nigel Farage represent the same things, but our country deserves better than the simple analysis that our neighbours are the problem dressed up in saloon bar charm. Those of us who believe in a just and fair Scotland need to stand firm in the face of these two.' In response, SNP MEP Alyn Smith said: 'This is a boomerang attack from Johann Lamont – the hypocrisy of which helps explains why the SNP have just defeated Labour in yet another national election in Scotland, after more than seven years in government. 'Ukip did worse in Scotland than in any other part of Britain by far. Ukip topped the poll south of the Border because the Westminster parties have pandered to their agenda in Scotland. The SNP took them on – and we won the election.' Tory MEP Ian Duncan, who takes over from the retired Struan Stevenson, said his party’s vote is the highest it has been for 25 years. 'We’ve bucked the national trend and it is a reminder that we have much to offer the people of Scotland,' he said. 'People are concerned about Europe and they want change. They want change to make Europe work for them, not against them, and I believe we have harnessed that concern and that feeling in a very simple way.' Green candidate Maggie Chapman said: 'In this election we asked ‘What kind of Scotland do you want?’ The response has been the biggest-ever vote for the Greens, showing growing support for our vision of a Scotland which prizes economic justice, welcomes new Scots from around the world, and stands for peace.'","UKIP leader claims he now leads the 'only national party' in Britain .

"Pro-marijuana advocates have been backed by billionaire George Soros for years, a new report has revealed. Soros has funneled at least $80million towards legalization since 1994, and has been joined in his efforts by a former insurance executive who openly admitted he often smoked the drug. The billionaire’s money finds its way into local ballot initiatives around the world via the Drug Policy Alliance and the American Civil Liberties Union, according to a Washington Times report detailing his unrivalled support for drug legalization. Marijuana man: George Soros has been funding pro-pot legalization pushes to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . Joining Soros in his fervent support for marijuana legalization was former Progressive Insurance chairman Peter B Lewis, who died last year after donating at least $40million to the cause. Soros and co have been behind every major marijuana legalization push in the United States, and even Uruguay, the paper claims. His strategy is similar to the one that toppled prohibition, force the federal government’s hand by legalization through individual states. The billionaire’s Open Society Foundations, which contribute roughly $4million annually to a variety of causes, carry an annual balance sheet of more than $3.5billion, according to 2011 tax returns. David and Charles Koch, billionaire brothers active in conservative causes, had a relatively paltry $308million allotted to their foundation and institute, the paper noted. Soros’ activism in the space is unrivaled by any opposing group, and accounts for about one-third of the Drug Policy Alliance’s annual operating budget, a group spokesperson admitted. Results of Soros action:  Sam Walsh, left, a budtender, and facility manager David Martinez set up marijuana products as the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary prepares to open for retail sales January 1 . Those efforts helped realize the recreational use of marijuana in both Colorado and Washington during 2012 ballot initiative, according to the Times. ‘Mr. Soros, Lewis and their various nonprofits provided 68 percent of the funding that went to New Approach to Washington, the group that mobilized signatures to get the initiative on the state ballot and then promoted it,’ the paper reported. Soros was also heavily involved in the push to legalize marijuana in Uruguay, the Times asserts.‘He also offered to pay for a study to evaluate the ramifications of the experimental legislation, which he has said will reduce overall drug use and help fight illegal drug trade,’ said the Times. Those who oppose legalization say Soros and friends are buying their way to victory through brainwashing. ‘When we look at what we’ve been able to raise in other states, they raise millions. We’re lucky if we can raise $100,000. It’s been a process of basically brainwashing the public,’ Calvina Fay, the executive director of Save Our Society From Drugs, told the paper. ‘They run ads, put up billboards, get high-profile celebrity support and glowing media coverage. If you can repeat a lie often enough, the people believe,’ she continued. Next up on the agenda for 2014 are Alaska, Florida and Oregon, according to donation records obtained from those respective states. The Soros-backed Marijuana Policy project has already donated $210,000 to state races and is expected to pour ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars to help fund a media blitz… to help support the measure,’ according to the report. Soros and Lewis have combined to put almost $150,000 to work on an Oregon intiaitve, records showed. Also legalized pot:  Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, pictured addressing the U.N. General Assembly last year, also recently signed legalized marijuana into law . Soros found a new partner in Florida in Democratic fundraiser John Morgan, and they have contributed 80 per cent of the funds used in that state. Soros and friends are looking to Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana and Nevada for 2016, a source told the Times. Other states being considered are Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. ‘It’s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized under federal law,’ Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the Marijuana Majority, told the Times. ‘We now have 20 states plus the District of Columbia with medical marijuana laws, two states have already legalized it for all adults over the age of 21 — politicians will have to follow the will of the people.’","The billionaire has funneled the money through various organizations across multiple states and Uruguay .
He reportedly has a road map to attack a handful of states each election cycle in order to eventually force the federal government's hand ."
"David Cameron insisted he did not want Britain to leave the EU, at a lunch in Westminster . Britain faces being ‘governed by fax’ from Brussels and reduced to the standing of Norway if it leaves the European Union but stays in the single market, the Prime Minister said yesterday. At a lunch in Westminster David Cameron insisted he did not want Britain to leave the EU. And he warned the ‘Norway option’ of simply having access to the single market would lead to ‘government by fax’, with Britain unable to influence the EU’s laws. He said: ‘I don’t want Britain to leave the EU. I think that we benefit crucially from the single market and I think it is worth understanding what leaving would involve. ‘You can be like Norway, and you can have full access to the single market, but you have absolutely no say over the rules of that market.’ Norway is a member of the European Economic Area. This grants it access to the single market, but it is obliged to respect the laws of the free trade area. It last held a referendum on full EU membership in 1994, when it was narrowly rejected, but anti-EU attitudes have hardened in recent years. Mr Cameron said there was now a ‘settled will’ in Britain for ‘quite significant reform’ of the relationship with the EU. But his comments came as the president of the European Commission said Britain needs to make up its mind whether it wants to stay in the EU or not. In a sign of growing EU frustration with Britain, Jose Manuel Barroso effectively warned Tory critics of Brussels to put up or shut up – suggesting the UK should quit if it was not ‘comfortable’ with the rules of the 27-nation club. Mr Barroso said: ‘It is good for the EU to have Britain on board, provided of course Britain is comfortable with the situation. Award: Van Rompuy and Barroso .

He said: ‘We should set out what our relationship ought to be and make clear to our European partners that if a consensus can be reached, our continued membership of the EU could be the recommended course of action. ‘Equally, if we were not given such assurances, then we have to be clear that the British people might well decide to leave.’ In a speech, Dr Fox added: ‘To be frank, if the choice is between the current trajectory towards ever closer union and leaving, then I would choose to leave, albeit reluctantly. If the choice is between a looser, more economic relationship and leaving, then I would choose to stay.’ Mr Cameron also said yesterday a deal on the deadlocked negotiations over the EU’s long-term budget was only achievable if Brussels backed down on its demands for an inflation-busting increase.

"Mark Fournier received the maximum fine possible for wearing the Nazi style uniform while on a stag do in Val Thorens . A Tory MP who was caught at a Nazi-themed party had organised the event himself, a report revealed yesterday. Aiden Burley, 34, had said later that he wished he had left the party in France ‘as soon as I realised what was happening’. But he had set up the stag do and even purchased an SS uniform for a friend to wear, according to a long-delayed report by Tory peer and lawyer Lord Gold. Mr Burley, MP for Cannock Chase, was unaware that donning the outfit was an offence in France, the document claimed. He also said the choice of costume was inspired by the British comic association with aspects of the war’ and denied any ‘political motivation’. The report concluded: ‘Mr Burley is not a bad man, still less a racist or anti-Semite. However, his actions were stupid and offensive, and the conclusions and recommendations reflect that.’ Mr Burley was sacked as a ministerial aide after being caught at the 2011 party in the ski resort of Val Thorens, where he was best man. The groom was wearing the uniform and guests made toasts to the Third Reich. He remains a MP. But Labour MP Ian Austin, whose father was a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia whose family perished at Treblinka concentration camp, said he was unfit to be in parliament. Mr Austin said: ‘This is not a student prank and it wasn’t as he claimed at the time a fancy dress party. It was grown men in their 30s one of them an MP and their behaviour was a disgrace. ‘He didn’t tell the truth at the time and it beggars belief the Tory party would believe him now. I think he’s unfit to be a member of the British parliament.’ The Oxford graduate was given the uniform by Conservative MP Aidan Burley. He will now have to pay a total of 2000 pounds in fines and costs, after one of the Jewish groups which complained said pretending to be a Nazi was 'not a schoolboy joke' The . report recommends Mr Burley visit Auschwitz concentration camp, which . he since has but courted more controversy when he was seen using his . mobile phone there. It was . finally published last night after the conviction of his friend, Oxford . graduate Mark Fournier who was fined by a French court for wearing the . uniform. Fournier, 36, will . have to pay £2000 in fines and costs. Guests chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, . Hitler’, while one raised a toast to the ‘Third Reich’ during the dinner . party in December 2011, a police tribunal in Albertville heard. A still from a video shows Mr Fournier and Mr Burley sitting side by side. The former has been unemployed since the scandal in 2011 . Mr . Fournier’s brother, 38-year-old John Fournier, was saying of Mr Burley . at the party: ‘This man is a Tory MP. He went to Oxford. A Tory boy. He . was the candidate for Berlin East.’ Wearing the uniform and insignia of . an organisation found guilty of crimes against humanity is against the . law in France. He was fined . around £1200 and ordered to pay damages and interest of just over £800 . to ADIF, a French group which supports Holocaust victims. Mr Fournier, who is not believed to have attended the tribunal, is said to have been unemployed since the scandal happened. During . his trial, his defence lawyer had asked prosecutors to show him mercy . because Prince Harry once got away with wearing an Afrika Korps uniform . and swastika insignia at a party. His . defence argued that he had asked his MP friend if it was against the . law to wear a Nazi uniform in France and he told him ‘no’.’ A . Conservative party spokesman said: ‘Two years ago, the party . investigated this matter. The findings of that investigation were that . Aidan Burley behaved in a manner which was offensive and foolish, and . that his behaviour was completely unacceptable. What he did was wrong. ‘That . is why, two years ago, he was removed from his post as parliamentary . private secretary. He has since apologised publicly and sought to make . amends, including by visiting Auschwitz.’","Mark Fournier received maximum fine in France for dressing as Nazi .

"Potty! The spa's clientele are fresh-faced with peachy plump skin - because they are babies . The towels are oh-so fluffy and the massage menu seductive, with its whispered promises of one-way, all-inclusive trips to planet bliss. The clientele are polished and gorgeous — all peachy plump skin, silky hair and Boden-chic. They arrived today, driven past the monied and white stucco-fronted mansions of Kensington — just a stone’s throw from William and Kate’s residence, no less — in their 4x4s, to indulge in a little ‘me’ time at the local spa. A day to kick off the nappy and let the griping, winding and weaning stresses of the day float away. Welcome to Britain’s first Baby Spa, where some very privileged tiny tots get to hang out in their own temperature-controlled pool, and catch-up on a few gurgles with some like-minded friends, before enjoying an indulgent baby massage. Now I may be a new mother to six-week-old Felix, but when I heard about the spa I thought it sounded ludicrous. I’m slowly being introduced to the world of the modern middle-class mummy, with its baby yoga and infant reflexology classes. But a spa? For babies? It did seem somewhat beyond the pale. Not, however, according to founder Laura Sevenus, 68, who insists it’s no gimmick. Instead, she’s convinced that a half-hour session in the temperature-controlled, purified waters have a raft of therapeutic effects, helping babies sleep and even tackling typical baby ills such as colic. She’s even invented a flotation device, known as a Bubby, which clips around the back of a baby’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body, allowing babies an indulgent, ‘hands-free’ floating experience. There are plans to roll out branches of the spa across Britain, although whether anyone other than wealthy Londoners will shell out the cool £60 per visit is anyone’s guess. My web designer husband Andy is less convinced when I tell him of my and Felix’s plans for the day. ‘What exactly is the point?’ he asks me. Scroll down for video . Pushing out the knots (and maybe a little wind): The pampered tots can enjoy lavish back massages . Just like a normal spa, the reception is a calm oasis of white walls, comfy sofas and soothing music, while there’s even a ‘chill-out room’ - except this one is equipped with comfy chairs and cushions for breastfeeding . I can sympathise. Like many women, I’ve visited the odd spa on hen weekends and girlie mini-breaks, but I’m inclined to think that paying a fortune to lounge around for hours by a Jacuzzi in a damp dressing gown is a bit of a waste of money. Now I am about to find out whether I’ll feel the same way about this infant version, which is tucked away in a courtyard in one of London’s most exclusive postcodes. Just like a normal spa, the reception is a calm oasis of white walls, comfy sofas and soothing music, while there’s even a ‘chill-out room’, except this one is equipped with comfy chairs and cushions for breastfeeding. Beyond that though, it’s tiny, with just the one room housing a baby-sized pool and specially designed ‘neonatal pods’— resembling a row of top-loading washing machines — for bathers, each one the size and depth of a large sink and filled with purified water, and warmed to a precise 35.6 c for optimum comfort. I am greeted by Laura, a stately but gentle South African. As this is my first visit, she asks some questions about Felix’s arrival. No dummy: Founder Laura Sevenus has invented a flotation device, known as a Bubby, which clips around the back of a baby’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body for a 'hands-free' float . A difficult birth, for example, might make a baby more sensitive to human touch. Felix certainly falls into this category: 11 days overdue, he came into the world after a marathon 60-hour labour ending in an emergency caesarean section and weighing a hefty 9lb 9oz. It wasn’t exactly the calm and positive start in life that I had envisioned for him. Maybe a bit of spa time is just what we both need. I worry he is a bit too young for such a new experience, but Laura reassures me that she has had babies little more than a day old in her spa, and water is something of a home-from-home for them after nine months in the womb. Next it’s off to the spa room itself, where I find babies Annabelle and Maya already merrily bobbing about in the pool — their heads encased in what appear to be big purple doughnuts — their expressions a mixture of puzzlement and Zen. I’m not sure whether it’s appropriate to burst out laughing, but they look as if they’ve accidentally got their heads stuck in a cushion. These are the Bubby flotation devices, which sit under the baby’s chin, keeping the mouth clear of the water, while allowing them to float and kick about safely. Five and six months old respectively, their mothers Helene, 36, and Monisha, 33 — a smart and well-spoken pair — have been bringing them here once a week since they were tiny and both are convinced it has had therapeutic effects. ‘They sleep brilliantly every time they’ve been here, and seem more relaxed,’ Helene tells me. Moreover, she says, the visits have helped to clear up Annabelle’s colic. This sounds promising, especially as both babies both look like they’re enjoying themselves, gurgling happily and flipping over like tiny mermaids in swimming nappies. I’m more than happy for Felix to join them, but as it’s his first time, Laura feels it would be better to put him in a neonatal pod so that he feels more secure. Laura gently fastens the flotation device round his neck before lowering him into the water, naked as the day he was born. I worry about the lack of swimming nappy, but Laura says she likes them to go au naturel to enhance their experience. This is Felix’s first skinny dip! Next it’s off to the spa room itself, where I find babies Annabelle and Maya already merrily bobbing about in the pool, their heads encased in purple doughnuts and their expressions a mixture of puzzlement and Zen . Long battle: The idea for the spa dated to the Seventies when Laura was a children’s swimming teacher . For a second or two Felix looks unsure, but then he relaxes, kicking his little legs and arms below the water. It strikes me it must be a nice feeling to stretch out vertically — so many newborn babies spend their lives hunched in their mother’s arms or swaddled in their cots. He seems equally chilled out when we lift him out ten minutes later. Next it’s time for the massage, which Laura does using pure grapeseed oil, as it’s gentle on a baby’s skin. Asking me to watch so that I can repeat it at home if I wish, she uses surprisingly firm strokes, as otherwise, she tells me, the baby can think you are tickling them, which can feel irritating. Laura even massages Felix’s back and the top of his buttocks — an area where babies apparently store a lot of tension from crying — and my son emits tiny little squeaks of pleasure. I’m impressed, it’s lovely to see Felix so relaxed. As she works her magic Laura, herself a mother of three grown-up children, tells me that the idea for the baby spa dates back to the Seventies when she was a children’s swimming teacher and realised that the earlier a baby could be made to feel comfortable in water, the better. Bobbing along: For those who feel it's pretentious nonsense... is there any price too high for a night's sleep? The problem was finding a way babies could be supported so they can go it alone, enjoying a good old kickabout, without you having to climb in too. The problem foxed her until, five years ago, her engineer husband Lars came up with the Bubby. The baby spa followed a year later, and has proved a success. Since it opened in 2010, between 16 and 21 babies a day have been wheeled through the doors. Nonetheless, I can see why the mums keep coming back: within ten minutes of being popped back in his babygrow, Felix is snoozing in my arms, and remains zonked for the hour-long car journey home. That evening, he goes to sleep more readily than usual, and lasts slightly longer until his first night-time feed — the Holy Grail for tired new mums. Even Andy is impressed, although it’s not enough to make him a convert. As far as he’s concerned, if we have a spare £60, it’d be better spent on something else — like a babysitter. And, of course, many will also dismiss the baby spa as pampered nonsense for women with too much money. As for me — well, I find myself thinking that you can’t put a price on a good night’s sleep.","Between stucco-fronted mansions of Kensington is Britain's first Baby Spa .

"Maria Shriver showed up at her cousin Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s wedding earlier this month with a buff date - and it wasn't husband Arnold Schwarzenegger. Shriver, who has been separated from from Schwarzenegger since 2011, introduced her new beau Matthew Dowd to the family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Dowd is an all-star political consultant with a series of political accomplishments, a family and a history of personal heartbreak that nearly rivals the Kennedys. He's the third of 11 children from a strict Irish Catholic family. He was an altar boy and keeps at least 100 crosses in his rural Texas home. He's been married and divorced twice; his second marriage fell apart after one of his twin infant daughters died in the hospital, according to a 2007 profile piece in the Los Angeles Times. Scroll down for video . Part of the family: Maria Shriver (center) introduced new boyfriend Matthew Dowd (right) to the Kennedys at her cousin Bobby Jr's (second from left) wedding to Cheryl Hines (left) The whole clan: Maria and Matthew posed for a picture with the whole Shriver clan. Maria is the niece of JFK and RFK . And he helped get a president elected - twice, albeit one from the wrong party. Dowd served as a top political strategist for George W. Bush - worth on both his 2000 and his 2004 campaign and as part of his inner circle - until he publicly split with the president in 2006 over the Iraq war. He also worked for Shriver's husband - taking a job on Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign. Shriver, 58, has been dating Dowd, 52, since last fall, according to the Washington Post - although Kennedy's wedding to Cheryl Hines appears to be their first public event together. They both currently work in broadcasting. Dowd is an ABC political analyst and fixture on the Sunday talk shows. Shriver is a special . Shriver - the niece of Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy - was married to Schwarzenegger for 25 years until it was revealed that he had an affair with his maid and had fathered a child with her. She and Schwarzenegger have four children together. Dowd grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of an auto executive father and a school teacher mother. Dowd told the Times his family would have been upper-middle class - if his strict Irish Catholic parents hadn't had 11 children. Shriver and Dowd were first spotted out together last October. Both come from large Irish Catholic families - and both have a history of heartbreak . Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria are still legally married - though they have been separated since 2011 when he revealed that he had an affair with a maid and had a love child with her . He was an altar boy and even considered the priesthood - though, he told the Times, he liked girls too much. He has two grown sons with his first wife and a 12-year-old daughter Josephine with his second wife. That marriage ended after his wife gave birth to twin girls in 2002. Josephine survived. Her sister died after two months in the hospital. After he publicly criticized the Bush administration over its handling of gay marriage and the Iraq War, he left politics and moved to a ranch in rural Wimberly, Texas, an hour outside of Austin. A Times reporter described his house as having more than 100 crosses. Above his fireplace, he has the Prayer of St. Francis: 'Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where this hatred, let me sow love.'","Maria Shriver introduced her new boyfriend Matthew Dowd to her family at cousin Bobby Kennedy's Jr.'s wedding .

"The search for a missing toddler turned tragic earlier today when the boy's body was found by police. The remains of Colton Brandt Turner, 2, of Austin, Texas, were found hidden in a wooded area less than two days after officials received a call from a friend of his mother who was concerned about the young boy's whereabouts. His mother, 20-year-old Megan Work, is in police custody. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: The body of two-year-old Colton turner was found earlier today, and his mother Megan Work is now in police custody (both pictured above) She is also four months pregnant according to her friend Briana Spieldenner, the same person who initially notified officials. 'We have every reason to believe the remains of that child are those of little Colton Turner,' Cedar Park Chief of Police Sean Mannix said in a news conference Friday afternoon. 'We are no longer looking for a missing child in Cedar Park and instead are investigating a death and disposal of a body.' Work, who is the person of interest in the case, gave officials three different accounts as to where Colton was when asked this week, and none of them checked out. The young mother had been living out of her car or with friends for the past several months. Abandoned: Work (above), who is currently four months pregnant, lied to police on three occasions when asked where her son was . She has, for the moment, been charged with abandoning and endangering a child without intent to return. Officials believe the child was a victim of abuse according to KXAN. In late 2013, Work pleaded guilty to animal cruelty. She also pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily injury stemming from a May 2013 incident where she hit another woman. Ms. Spieldenner, one of Work's best friends, fought back tears as she talked about what happened, saying, 'She's not who I thought she was.' She said she had not seen Colton since April, adding, 'He was a happy boy. Always. He was always smiling. He was so happy. My daughter, she like I said she is two and a half, and they loved each other. They would play so good.' Officials believe Colton (left), whose mother Megan Work (right) had been arrested multiple times in the past, had been abused . In addition to calling the police, is seems that Ms. Spieldenner was also the one who helped authorities locate Work. 'I just wish I could have done something sooner. I've always been involved in his life and I love him and I l feel like I should have seen something sooner and should have been able to save him,' she told KVUE. Colton would have turned three in just nine days.","The body of Colton Brandt Turner, 2, was found today in Texas .

"Ros Altmann said a new law on flexible working hours would allow workers in their 50s and 60s to take time-out for several months . Millions of workers approaching state pension age could use flexible working laws to demand ‘retirement leave’, the Government’s older people’s tsar has said. Pensions expert Ros Altmann said this would allow workers to take a sabbatical of several months before returning, possibly part-time. Three months ago the Government introduced a law which gave all employees the legal right to request flexible working, not just parents and carers. Employers must consider the request and offer an appeal if it is refused. Crucially, they cannot discriminate based on why employees want to change their hours. Dr Altmann, the Government’s new Business Champion for Older Workers and the former head of Saga, said many workers in their fifties and sixties would use the law to take time-out for several months to do things such as travel the world or spend more time with family, before coming back ‘refreshed’. She said the concept of ‘retirement leave’ would hopefully be embraced by employers but, ‘if employers don’t embrace it on their own’, it could potentially become part of legislation in the future. ‘We need to offer flexible working just like we have done for working mothers’, she said. ‘There is no reason we cannot have a concept like maternity leave, a retirement leave, where you take a break before you come back, and then perhaps come back part-time. ‘A lot of people when they look forward to retirement are looking forward to a break, but once they have retired and got the gold watch, it is then very hard to get back into work if you want to. ‘Now, with the request for flexible working extended to everybody there is an opportunity to do that. ‘I would really encourage people to use the law to ask for a period of leave, and for employers to treat the idea seriously, because it could be in their long-term interest as well.’ She said less than ten per cent of the generation coming up for retirement had been to university, let alone taken a gap year, and had worked since school. ‘Maybe they could take a few months out and come back part time having been refreshed,’ she added. ‘At the moment it is all voluntary – you have the right to request although the employer doesn’t have to agree. ‘However, 90 per cent of requests for flexible working have been granted so far.’ She went on: ‘What people think of as the retirement dream is an easier life but that does not, for many people, equate to no work at all – they may not want the same pressure or workload and move to two or three days instead.’ She warned there was 'no reason' why there cannot be a concept of retirement leave, like maternity leave, allowing a person to perhaps go back to work part-time . Dr Altmann said a combination of people living longer and a lack of retirement funds meant that working into your 70s would become the norm in the next five to ten years. Fathers work harder than men who do not have children, according to an analysis of working lives in the EU. Men with children who live with them are more than twice as likely to hold down a job than men without families or men living apart from their children. The rule holds good across Europe according to the study, based on government surveys, by EU statistics arm Eurostat. Nearly one in three women aged 25 to 54 with children under six were economically inactive last year – without a job and not seeking one – compared to fewer than one in five women without children. By contrast, only 4.2 per cent of men with one or more children in their household were economically inactive, compared to 9.9 per cent of men without children in their home. Financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown predicted yesterday that the number of over-65s still in the workforce could more than triple from 870,000 in 2010 to three million by 2037, based on factors such as population growth and the rise in state pension age. By 2037, life expectation in the UK will have risen from 79 to 82 for men and from 84 to 87 for women. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Inevitably we’re going to see more people looking to work on into their late sixties and seventies. ‘The challenge for the Government is to make it easier for people to retrain and to find new ways of earning a living. One option would be to look at tax breaks for employers giving training courses to the over-55s.’ Pensions Minister Steve Webb said he did not believe the concept of ‘retirement leave’ would become a legal right, but instead be agreed between workers and employers. He said: ‘Three out of five requests [across all ages] for flexible working are granted straight away and four out of five after a short time, so I don’t think this is something government needs to prescribe. It works better as a “do-it-yourself retirement leave”.’","Ros Altmann said 'retirement leave' could soon become a normal concept .

"John Bellamy, 72, indecently assaulted five boys aged 11 to 14 over a five-year period in the 1970s . A choirmaster who forced boys to strip before spanking them during private singing lessons at his home has been jailed for two years. John Bellamy, 72, indecently assaulted five boys aged 11 to 14 over a five-year period in the 1970s. The offences happened while he was choirmaster at St James the Greater Church in Leicester. Bellamy, from Knighton, Leicester, assaulted the boys after inviting them to his home to help them with breathing exercises to improve their singing. Earlier in the trial one of his victims told how he was abused by Bellamy when he was aged 13. He told the jury: 'I was taken into a backroom where Bellamy told me to take my trousers and pants off. He said I needed to be punished. 'He spanked me about six to ten times. Then he started stroking me on the backside. 'He said he was sorry that he was having to do this again and he hoped he would not have to do this again. 'I remember at the time I was being spanked I thought this was punishment. When he started to stroke me and the tone of his voice change I thought 'this is not right""'. At Worcester Crown Court, a jury convicted him of six charges of indecent assault and two of gross indecency. Judge Michael Cullum told Bellamy: 'You are a man who has given a lot to the community, been an organist for many years, a choirmaster running camps for the children and also teaching for over 40 years. Judge Michael Cullum told Bellamy: 'Seeing men reduced to tears by the memories of your hands on them would be difficult to forget.'You gravely affected many lives' 'However it was clear you had a fondness for these boys that was inappropriate and that developed into the sexual. 'You hurt the children everyone thought you were looking after and teaching. 'What was remarkable in this case was how much it hurt those individuals. 'Seeing men reduced to tears by the memories of your hands on them would be difficult to forget. 'You gravely affected many lives.'","John Bellamy, 72, indecently assaulted five boys aged 11 to 14 .

'Wenger says he did not want to sell him. But if he is not in his plans, then why not allow him to leave?' The £16million arrival of Danny Welbeck from Premier League rivals Manchester United has also cast doubt over Campbell's future with him now seemingly behind Welbeck, Yaya Sanogo and the injured Olivier Giroud in the striking pecking order. Welbeck, meanwhile, could not be happier to be at Arsenal, telling the club's website: 'It's exciting times for me. 'It's great to be a part of this club and it's a team that I've always watched in the Premier League. I've envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.'

"New research by Hobart's only men's shelter revealed that chronically homeless men have a lower life expectancy than those living in the slums of Africa. The shelter found that the average lifespan of 41 men who stayed at there for over a decade was 48. This is four years less than the average life expectancy in Africa according to the World Health Organization. Chronically homeless men in Australia are thought to have much shorter lifespan a caseworker from a Hobart men's shelter revealed . The research from Bethlehem House, was presented on Friday at the National Homeless Conference in Brisbane. Jeff Bendall, a caseworker from the shelter presented the case said that the main reason behind the low age of death was due to health issues homeless people face. 'A lot of these guys sleep rough every night in the cold. Therefore the body's working very hard to try to maintain the heat,' he told ABC News. The stark reality of living on the streets: 67 per cent of homeless men live 'rough' or on the streets . 'Also drug and alcohol, they have kidney problems, you've also got smoking. But this radical statistic isn't just in Tasmania, similar life expectancies have been found throughout Australia. 'For men who experience chronic homelessness across Australia, the average life expectancy is between about 45 and 47 years of age, which is an alarmingly young age for men in a country as wealthy as ours to die,"" said Glenda Steven CEO of Homelessness Australia. The organisation, Homeless Australia reports that over 105,000 people in Australia are homeless . 'The average life expectancy for a man living in Somalia is actually 48.86 years.'So if you're a man in Somalia, you can expect to live longer than a man experiencing chronic homelessness in Australia.' The figures have only been recorded by particular homeless shelters, there is no nationwide figure for lifespan of homeless men. Homeless Australia revealed that 67.6 per cent of homeless men are sleeping 'rough' or on the streets while a much smaller 32.4 per cent of women do the same. They also reported that there is approximately 105,237 homeless people in Australia.","Research from a men's homeless shelter in Tasmania reported the average age of death for 41 men who had stayed there over a decade was 48 .

"The fact that she had six kids has never stopped this 40-year-old Adelaidean mum from keeping fit and healthy. Lucia Staykov has always been a fitness enthusiast and that didn't change when she fell pregnant to Jordy who is now 12. When she found out she was going to have twins, she kept up her exercise routine up until she was 38 weeks pregnant, modifying her movements to keep her babies safe. And when she was told she would have three baby girls in 2010 she was overjoyed but never did it cross her mind to kick back and stop her from instructing her beloved bootcamp or dance classes. Lucia Staykov with son Jordy 12 (blue grey stripes), twins Alek (white top stripes) and Bailey (black top), triplets Lilly (dark top), Chloe (pink) and Mia (blue) 2 1/2 years stay fit and healthy together . Is Lucia Staykov Australia's fittest mum? She managed to keep her trim body after having six children . 'Exercise and fitness has always been a part of my life, I can't imagine giving it up and it didn't occur to me when I was pregnant with any of my kids,' Ms Staykov told Daily Mail Australia. The bootcamp instructor and owner of XDrill Challenge, an outdoor bootcamp for groups said that the fact that the classes usually ran in the mornings made it easy for her to keep teaching after she had her kids due to the fact her husband could watch the babies while she taught. Ms Staykov maintained healthy pregnancies for all six of her children and even taught a bootcamp class the morning before her son Jordy was born. 'I stopped dance and bootcamp at 38 weeks when I had the twins and stopped at 30 weeks when I had the triplets,' she said. Lucia Staykov going for a run with her triplets Lilly (dark top), Chloe (pink) and Mia (blue) Fit family: The Staykov's love keeping active and eating wholesome foods just as their mum taught them . Ensuring her baby's health has always been her first priority but she felt that keeping up with her exercise routine was something that she could still do for herself. 'It was always modified exercises and I was always careful but it gave me energy so I loved it.' 'I found that I didn't get the discomforts most women get when pregnant because I was exercising,' Ms Staykov said, 'I didn't get the back pain or any leg cramps, so I would recommend it to other women.' The question on everyone's lips to the fit mum was: How long did it take to regain your pre-pregnancy body? The belly timeline: Ms Staykov documented her baby bump and then how she recovered her rock-hard abs . Ms Staykov got her pre-pregnancy body back by maintaining her exercise routine throughout each pregnancy. She would modify exercises to keep the babies safe . 'I feel like the weight dropped when the babies were out, but it took me 12 months of healthy eating and exercise to get back to where I was at and 18 months to where I felt completely happy with my body.' Ms Staykov recommends easing back into exercise once you've been given clearance from your doctor, she kick started her exercise at six weeks after giving birth by going on light walks with her babies. 'Gradually incorporate some walking and abdominal exercises, don't push yourself too hard too early, but slowly build up your strength.' And her abs? 'I'm sure they were under the babies still!' she laughed, ' Because I had that core strength before being pregnant I was able to regain them.' Fitness fanatic Lucia Staykov, 40, and her triplets.

"A San Diego woman accused of soliciting forcible rape and sodomy on a couple who bought her dream home pleaded not guilty in court today. Kathy Rowe was arraigned on felony charges that also included misdemeanor counts for identity theft and repeated harassment by electronic communication, according to ABC News. The 52-year-old, who's free on $50,000 bail, entered the plea through her attorney, Brad Patton, and the next hearing is set for October 17. Scroll down for video . Hell: Kathy Rowe was so furious after she missed out on purchasing the home in Carmel Valley, California, pictured, that she decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell . A Superior Court judge earlier had dismissed the sex solicitation charges because he didn't have a strong suspicion that Rowe had the specific intent to cause men to commit any kind of sexual assault on the woman who bought the house, according to the Times of San Diego. The District Attorney's Office appealed the decision, and the 4th District Court of Appeal reinstated the charges. Rowe, who was named 'Mother of the Year' in 2007 for the work she did for her disabled daughter, was so furious after she missed . out on purchasing the Carmel Valley dream home, she decided to make the . new owners' lives a living hell. According . to a criminal complaint, she unleashed her fury by impersonating the . woman in a sexually-explicit online advertisement that requested . stranger men force their way into her house and 'take me while I say . no.' Rowe's ad for the 'Carmel Valley Freak Show' was graphic and encouraged interested men to contact the woman for sexual favors of all kinds while her husband was at work, NBC 7 reported. She told at least one man, who responded with a naked picture of himself, to 'just stop by any Monday-Friday 9am-3pm,' and sent him an image of the victim, which she took from a social media website. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at the door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' she wrote, before explaining that she loves anal sex and threesomes. Another man responded to the notice and ended up going round to the victim's home but no one answered the door. The husband answered the door on a subsequent visit. Prosecutors claim Rowe also harassed the couple by listing their home for sale, putting a hold on the couple's mail, sending Valentine;s Day cards from the husband to married women in the neighborhood and having members of religious groups visit the home. She also allegedly posted an online announcement for a high school New Year's Eve party at the victim's home and a free Mexican fireworks giveaway on Independence Day. Rowe was charged with soliciting forcible rape and forcible sodomy, and other crimes. However, a Superior Court judge dismissed the most serious of those charges before trial because she didn't believe Rowe actually intended for the woman to be raped. The district attorney's office disagreed, and appealed the judge’s ruling and the Forth District Court of Appeal reinstated the criminal charges. Rowe's lawyer Brad Patto told NBC 7 his client deeply regrets her behavior, which she initially denied. However he said the actions were nothing more than 'prankish behavior.' He added that the woman had sent written apologies to the husband and wife.","Kathy Rowe, who is free on $50,000 bail, made the plea through her attorney .

"A transgender girl was crowned homecoming princess at a Colorado Springs high school. The Gazette of Colorado Springs reported Saturday that Scarlett Lenh received the majority of the votes from her junior class at Sand Creek High School, besting three biological girls for the honor. Lenh, biologically a boy, was born Andy Lenh. She was bestowed the honor during Friday night's football game. Victor: Scarlett Lenh, pictured after her win, was crowned homecoming princess at Sand Creek High School in Colorado . The 16-year-old began identifying as a transgender girl this school year and began using the girls' bathroom. She said she's known she was a girl since about age 7 or 8. 'It was really exciting. It felt really good. I couldn't stop smiling,' Scarlett said after she found out at an afternoon assembly that the majority of the junior class had voted for her. Two of the other girls who were nominated by their peers were 'extremely supportive,' Scarlett said, and the other 'was really upset.' Scarlett said she didn't think she'd be nominated. 'One of my friends mentioned it, and I didn't think anything of it because I didn't think I'd be nominated. But, now, it really matters to me,' she said. 'This is something I've wanted to do since my freshman year. I want people to be themselves and not feel uncomfortable in their own body and mind.' The school in Falcon School District 49 is in the same city as Focus on the Family and the National Association of Evangelicals. 'It felt really good': Lenh said she didn;t even think anybody would nominate her for the prize . 'The leaders at Sand Creek High School and in District 49 respect the decision of the Scorpion student body in electing their homecoming court,' district spokesman Matt Meister said in a statement. 'Our board policy sets the standard that we do not exclude any person from participating in any program or activity on the basis of gender identity and gender expression.' Not everyone is supportive. 'It's craziness,' said Jana Neathery, whose granddaughter attends Sand Creek. She said: 'Originally, it was a joke that he [Scarlett] was going to be nominated for homecoming princess, but he got a lot of nominations. 'Supportive': Even two of the girls whom she beat were pleased for Lenh when she won the prize . 'Now there are a lot of upset girls because a spot was taken from them. I'm very sympathetic that he's transgender, but he should be on the boys' side, not the girls'.' Sand Creek student Michael Carl said he has been a friend of Scarlett's since the seventh grade. 'He has always been there for me and is truly a good person,' Michael said. 'I support him because it takes a lot of courage and a lot of character to do what he is doing.' Last year, a transgender first-grade girl won the right to use the girls' restroom at another Colorado Springs-area school district. The Colorado Civil rights Division ruled that not allowing Coy Mathis to use the girls' bathroom violated Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act.

"If there's one word to sum up Julien Macdonald it's fabulous (it is his favourite after all). Just like the Welsh-born designer himself, his dazzling SS15 collection befit the word perfectly, too. This is a man, after all, who has crystal balls in his kitchen and dresses best pals Abbey Clancy and Millie Mackintosh in gowns dripping with sequins. Julien, who has this year alone dressed Beyonce, Megan Fox and Emma Watson, sent his stellar roll call of models, including Alex Wek and Hollie-May Saker (Cara D, who?) down the runway in red-carpet worthy gowns. Scroll down for video . Here comes the bride (and Julien!): Mr Macdonald unveiled a covetable collection (as always) before a star-studded crowd in the Royal Opera House this afternoon . His show today was, however, a departure from the usual feast of glitter and glamour. The Strictly Come Dancing star instead focused his attention on creating figure-hugging shift dresses with dropped hemlines (a recurring theme so far this weekend) in buttermilk, yellow, moss green, duck egg blue and off white. However, the king of Bling didn't shun his favourite embellishment completely. There was a smattering of mini dresses sprinkled with shimmering palettes, chiffon dresses in oyster with sparkling silver mesh; backless pieces with sweeping trains and sheer cut-out sections revealing a glimpse of (beglittered) skin beneath. Famous roll call: The Strictly Come Dancing star  focused his attention on creating figure-hugging shift dresses with dropped hemlines modelled by the likes of Alex Wek . Red carpet worthy: The Welsh designer, who took his inspiration from a mermaid, will no doubt have his frow friends on the phone requesting his designs after today's show . Marriage material: Fancy getting hitched in style? Julien can help. 'This time we had two wedding dresses in the show,' he told us. 'The first one was very short, the second one was very long. Obviously they were covered in diamonds, lots of glitter and lots of glamour' The long and (very) short of it: As well as dazzling gowns, there were a few cheeky derrière exposing pieces perfect for partying in Ibiza next summer . Speaking about the inspiration behind his collection, Julien told MailOnline: 'The woman is a very special woman, she's a mermaid, she's a woman of the sea. She's a siren who swims in a tropical ocean that's glistening in the moonlight and full of tropical fish. She's surrounded by buried treasure and glamorous things.' But his mermaid is, in his own words, obviously no ordinary mermaid. 'She falls in love and lures a tattooed gorgeous man into the sea and it's all about an underwater love of a mermaid surrounded by tattooed men, hence the flowers, the prints and the inspiration,' he explained. The stand-out pieces (if we really had to choose) were two wedding dresses - a first for the popular designer. Fancy getting hitched in style? Julien can help. 'This time we had two wedding dresses in the show,' he told us. 'The first one was very short, the second one was very long. Obviously they were covered in diamonds,  lots of glitter and lots of glamour.' Leading ladies: Mary Charteris, Abbey Clancy, Laura Whitmore and Millie Mackintosh held fort on the front row . Welsh wonder: The vibrant designer, who won over the nation on Strictly Come Dancing, said he wants every woman to wear his pieces . However, looking this good comes at a price - the second wedding dress, a floor-length finale gown covered with real diamonds, pearls and French Chantilly lace, was worth an eye-watering £3m. The beauty look complimented the collection perfectly and industry heavyweight Val Garland created the look using L'oreal Paris - only the best for Julien. Val, who wore a hilarious badge emblazoned with the words 'Bossy B****', described the look as 'glamorous, beautiful make-up.' She created a metallic smokey eye using L'Oreal ParisColor Riche mono eyeshadow in Gold Mania across the eye with Little Gold Dress dabbed into the corners. There was no liner and no mascara but she brushed a little bit of gold shadow into the brows. 'It's all about washes of colour across the eyes, it's very wearable,' she told us backstage. Bridal beauty: James Pecis created the  hair, which was slicked back hair using gel (a recurring theme so far backstage this season). As for Macdonald's two brides, Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different' She also aimed to create 'beautiful moist skin' with a little help from Nude Magique Eau de Teint and opted for a subtle apricot lip. Nails, filed and painted by Jenny Draper and her team, were subtle and wearable. 'We used Gris Eternal, a soft, muted shade with a little touch of white to complement lighter complexion tones,' explained Jenny. James Pecis created the mermaid hair, which was slicked back hair using gel (a recurring theme so far backstage this season). He used texturiser through the lengths and secured it at the nape of the neck with a needle and thread.

As for Macdonald's two brides, Pecis said: 'We wanted something very modern and strikingly different.' For the stars of the show he braided the lengths around the nape of the neck and attached delicate sections of lace to the crown with double stick tape. Despite filling his front row with London's style elite (Millie Mackintosh, Abbey Clancy, Rosie Fortescue and Nina Nesbitt), Julien says he didn't have a muse this season.

"For those living in Tornado Alley - or planning a camping trip during extreme weather conditions - some good news may be on the horizon. A Missouri-based inventor has just come up with a relatively inexpensive way to stay safe during a twister: an over sized sleeping bag made from the same material as bulletproof vests. The Tuuli Armor Tornado Shield is extremely versatile and can be stored anywhere, weighing only 12 pounds when all rolled up. Scroll down for video . Useful for camping during British summer time? The  bag claims to withstand tornadoes  -  and even bullets . It expands to the size of a queen-sized bed in less than a minute and is large enough to accommodate two adults and a child inside. While the sleeping bag won't protect you from injuries from larger materials (like broken bones), it can resist being punctured by flying debris up to 200 miles per hour, which can be just as dangerous. Cuts and lacerations make up over 90 per cent of injuries caused by tornadoes. Lightweight: The shield is versatile and can be stored anywhere, weighing only 12 pounds when rolled up . The sleeping bag expands to the size of a queen-sized bed in less than a minute and is large enough to accommodate two adults and a child . Protection from flying debris comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon . Protection comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon, and the bag's bottom layer is made of ripstop nylon so you can breathe while you’re inside. The inventor, Steven Anderson, came up with the idea in 2011, after two massive tornadoes ripped through his home town of Joplin in the Spring. 'Our family didn't have any protection, we didn't have a safe room to go to. So after that tornado, I started looking for options to protect my family. My wife and our four-year-old son.' 'But there weren't any options that were less than $4,000, so I started developing a product that would bridge that gap between nothing and $4,000.' At just £247 - or £197 for early adopters - it's a much more affordable option than safe rooms or storm cellars. The Indiegogo campaign is looking to raise £65,000 to put the Tornado Shield into production. Currently, developers have raised just over £1870 of their goal.","A Missouri-based inventor has invented the mother of all sleeping bags .

"Hundreds of 'micro-pigs', made popular by celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Paris Hilton, have been shot by marksmen after running wild in a Welsh wood. More than 300 of the tiny pigs were discovered by stunned farmers on common moorland in Gower, West Wales. It is believed that they broke free from captivity, before becoming 'out of control' as they rampaged through the countryside and mated with normal pigs. Scroll down for video . Micro-pigs became popular pets after several celebrities were pictured cradling them (above,  Miley Cyrus) The cull was ordered by the local council - who claim they did so to protect the public from the seemingly harmless Kunekune pigs. A council official said that they had arranged for a slaughter-man to carry out a 'humane cull' of 106 of the animals in the past week. A spokesman said: 'We made several inquiries to identify ownership of the animals but no-one came forward to accept responsibility for them. 'These animals presented a serious risk to other livestock in the region in the event of a disease outbreak and because of this we were left with no option but to carry out a cull of these animals. 'This was carried out by a licensed professional and with full support of local farmers in the area.' The animals, native to New Zealand, begin life no bigger than a tea cup. American heiress Paris Hilton (pictured above) also got in on the micro-pig trend . A few years ago they became fashionable as celebrity pets - with Victoria Beckham buying husband, David, two for Christmas in 2009. American heiress Paris Hilton and Welsh singer Charlotte Church were also seen with micro-pigs, leading to a surge in pet pigs around the country. However, their popularity soon waned, with many unwitting owners getting rid of the animals after discovering that they grow to five foot long and three foot tall. Poppy Delevingne, sister of catwalk model Cara, holds a micro-piglet up to the camera . This has led to rescue centres becoming overwhelmed with unwanted micro-pigs. Karen McKay from the British Kunekune Pig Society blamed the situation on breeders cashing in on the rise of the popularity of the micro-pig as an urban pet. She said: 'Owners buying these pigs on a whim were left taking on far more than they realised. 'They bought them as cute piglets not realising or being told by breeders how big they would become. The popularity of the animals waned when people realised how big they grow to (above, Kendall Jenner) 'They can be expensive to keep and they require up to half an acre of fenced in land or more to roam around in. 'Now that the fad for them has faded, rescue centres are loathe to take on even more of them. 'And as sad as it is to hear that these pigs and piglets have been shot, it would have been worse for them to have been kept without welfare in mind. 'There is also a risk of diseases such as foot and mouth or swine flu spreading if you have wild and uncontrolled pigs going through rubbish bins.'","More than 300 found running free on moorland in Gower, West Wales .

"The last suspect being hunted in connection with a brutal attack on a father of four in his family home has been arrested in a dramatic armed police raid. Oskar Pawlowichz, a Polish national, is suspected of being involved in a violent burglary in which a gang of masked men forced their way into the £2 million home of law lecturer Paul Kohler in Wimbledon, South-West London. Mr Kohler fought with his attackers like ‘an Englishman defending his castle’ but was left needing facial-reconstruction surgery after the assault, during which he suffered a fractured eye socket. Oskar Pawlowichz was arrested in a dramatic police raid after a Mail on Sunday appeal brought new information forward . Officers from the Metropolitan and West Mercia Police arrested Pawlowichz at a five-bedroom house in Leominster, Herefordshire, on Tuesday night. Pawlowichz, 29, was found after a £5,000 reward offered by The Mail on Sunday brought forward new information which led detectives to his location. A 20-strong covert police team had been watching the three-storey property throughout the day and descended on the address at 8.30pm when they received confirmation the suspect was inside. Six armed police entered the house where they found Pawlowichz with three other Polish nationals who were also living there. He surrendered to police and later emerged from the house with his head bowed, led in handcuffs by two detectives. Paul Kohler was left with horrendous facial injuries when the four masked men broke into his home . The Met Police had mounted a month-long manhunt for Pawlowichz after the attack on Mr Kohler on August 11. The breakthrough came after detectives were informed he was at an address in Leominster by a member of the public in response to the reward offered for information by The Mail on Sunday. Last night, Cambridge-educated Mr Kohler, 55, praised police efforts as he revealed that doctors have told him he will be left with permanent double vision from the assault. He said: ‘I’m very thankful to the police and delighted with the arrest. It makes my family rest a lot easier. ‘But I’ve still got double vision because the doctors wouldn’t operate due to the strain on my heart, which is difficult because I’ve got a permanent reminder.’ Mr Kohler told how he fought for his life with his attackers, explaining: ‘I had my family there and this whole notion of an Englishman’s home is his castle – that was the feeling. ‘ . Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who has led the investigation, added: ‘This has been a complex and intensive month-long search which has had Met officers across the country tracking the suspect’s whereabouts. Finally, he was arrested with no injuries to the public or police officers.’ Pawlowichz appeared in Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, charged with aggravated burglary and grievous bodily harm with intent. Three other Polish men have also been arrested in relation to the incident. Two of the suspects have appeared in court. The third has been released on bail pending further inquiries.

"Striking photos have emerged of the ongoing recovery in New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina hit. The category four storm ravaged the Louisiana city in 2005 - it was one of the worst affected areas because it is below sea level. The images show how the speed of recovery across the city varied - in some photos the landscape looks exactly the same with just the water draining away. But others indicate the true damage of the hurricane  and show that even five years after the disaster - when these photos were taken - the city was struggling to rebuild itself.

Pictured: Franklin Avenue and Frankford Street .

"Found: Police acting on a tip tracked down missing schizophrenic mother of two Catherine Hoggle, 27, in Germantown, Maryland . The missing paranoid schizophrenic mother from Maryland was found and taken into custody Friday night, but the search for her two children continues. Police said just after 11pm they received a call from a Germantown resident saying that Catherine Hoggle was spotted walking near Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive. Officers were dispatched to the area and were able to quickly track down the missing woman, but her two children, 2-year-old Jacob and 3-year-old Sarah, were nowhere to be found. The woman, who reportedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and had gone off her medication, was taken to police headquarters for questioning, wUSA9 reported. Officers remained on the scene in Germantown overnight, scouring the streets and a nearby apartment complex with K-9 dogs in search of the missing toddlers. 'Thank you to this caller. We remain concerned for the children's welfare and ask that people still call 911 with information and tips,' Montgomery County police tweeted. Earlier in the day, authorities released a video showing Hoggle sneaking out the back of a Chick-fil-A in Germantown Monday, just moments after lying to her common-law husband, Troy Turner, about the whereabouts of their two children. Hoggle was then captured on video again at the Germantown Commons shopping center on Tuesday morning around 4.30am. The children are not seen in the video. Scroll down for video . Getting away: Catherine Hoggle, who has been missing along with her two children since earlier this week, is seen here sneaking out of a restaurant after lying to husband Tory Turner about the location of their children . On the loose: Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Hoggle's two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, (left) and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle (right), who were not with her . Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing. The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare. Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center. 'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children. Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7. Searching: Troy Turner hands out flyers at a Germantown shopping center where his wife is known to frequent. On Sunday, police said Hoggle took the children to her mother's house in Clarksburg. She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her. Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police said Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since. Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job. Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home. Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known.","Catherine Hoggle, 27, went missing along with daughter, Sarah, and son, Jacob, earlier this week .

"Fashion trends come and go, and there are several that we’re thankful do indeed go. But one of these, a wardrobe staple of the 1970s, is apparently making a comeback:  the dungaree. A revival led by celebrities including Alexa Chung and Kerry Katona has led to a surge in sales of the bib-and-brace overall, which was last popular in the early 1990s. Celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Heidi Klum have been spotted wearing dungarees leading to a sales surge of the garment in High Street stores . Selena Gomaz strolled to a Los Angeles studio last Friday in a pair of baggy dungarees that also boasted some definite side skin action . Online fashion retailer ASOS.com said dungarees – updated for the 21st century – are proving a hit this season. Head of womenswear Rachel Morgans . said: ‘All dungarees are performing well, from soft, tailored, jersey . styles through to casual denims. Luxury fabrics and adaptations in shape . have made them a fashion statement.’. Designer Stella McCartney has created . a flared set and a shorts set for this season, both of which are said . to be almost sold out. Teen stars are also embracing the trend with singer Pixie Lott and Disney star, and Justin Beiber's on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez both wearing denim dungarees recently. Miss Chung, who has been spotted in . short and long dungarees, said recently: ‘You should have fun with . fashion. I like to wear dungarees.’ Pixie Lott paired her roll-up dungarees  with stylish red leather brogues and square handbag when she saw Rihanna at her gig in Kentish town during her 777 tour . Setting a trend: Alexa Chung has said people should have fun with fashion and that she 'liked' to wear dungarees . Back in Fashion: Alexa Chung has led a revival of dunagrees . But, as with the recent onesie craze, . not everyone is a fan. Mail columnist Amanda Platell said dungarees are . ‘the most hideous fashion item short of culottes ever to walk the . streets’ Once . predominantly worn as a practical item of clothing for mechanics, . farmers and construction workers, who appreciated the loose fit and deep . pockets, the dungaree made a brief comeback in the early 1990s when . they were worn by Jennifer Aniston and Kylie Minogue. The word ‘dungaree’ comes from the name for a coarse cloth made in the remote Indian village of Dongri. Dungarees were once predominantly worn as a practical item of clothing for mechanics, farmers and construction workers . DOs . - Try shorts for summer worn with a Breton top and espadrilles for classic beach styling. - OR, add a tailored blazer for a look that will work at night, too. - Whether you’re wearing dungarees or their more feminine cousin, the pinafore, update the look with a smart heel. - You can’t go wrong with a classic, full-length style. Everyone from Alexa Chung to Alessandra Ambrosio is wearing them long. Add a ¾ sleeve top, cuff the hems and wear with statement heels for a more modern style. DON’Ts . - Avoid wearing long dungarees with lace-up boots; you’ll end up looking more 90s than now. - Denim is clearly the way to go here. Velvet and loose fabrics can wind up looking like a sack. - Stay away from belting short or long denim. It looks a bit frumpy.

"An Australian radio station has donated £298,000 to the family of a nurse who hanged herself after putting through a prank phone call to Kate Middleton's hospital bedside. Private medical information about the Duchess of Cambridge was revealed after Jacintha Saldanha, 46, answered a call from DJ Melanie Greig, who was posing as the Queen for a radio show.

The Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning sickness at the hospital when the call was made. Ms Greig, 32, broke down in court yesterday, saying she had 'waited so long to say sorry'. Addressing the 46-year-old mother-of-two's family after the inquest, Ms Greig sobbed as she told them and the packed courtroom: 'I really just wanted to say I am truly sorry, I've wanted to say that for so long.

She went on to urge hospitals and the media to learn from the incident and make sure it was not repeated. She added: 'To fellow announcers and DJs, I urge you to speak up if you don't feel comfortable and consider the feeling of others when trying to make a joke.

"An anorexic woman who drinks half a bottle of vodka a day should not be force fed even if it means she could die within weeks, a judge has ruled. The woman, who experienced childhood trauma and abuse, has a Body Mass Index (BMI) hovering between 12.3 and 12.6, but believes she is morbidly obese. A healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 24.9. The anorexic woman, who has a BMI of between 12.3 and 12.6, will no longer be forced to have treatment . In a hearing at the Court of Protection in London, Mr Justice Cobb ruled that it was not in her best interests be forced to have treatment or food because of the 'phenomenal' suicide risk. This is thought to be the first time the courts have ruled that doctors should not give life-sustaining treatment on the grounds that it could hasten death. The woman, identified only as Miss X, strongly opposes forcible nutrition and hydration even though she knows her life is in imminent danger, the court heard. She is dependent on alcohol and suffers from liver disease, drinking up to half a bottle of vodka a day, according to The Times. Doctors who treated her and independent experts were unanimously of the view that it was no longer in her best interests to force treatment. They said, given the risks posed and discomfort she would suffer, they thought it was no longer right to provide nutrition and treatment against her wishes. An NHS trust asked Mr Justice Cobb for a declaration saying it was lawful not to make her undergo further compulsory feeding.

The woman, identified only as Miss X, strongly opposes forcible nutrition and hydration even though she knows her life is in imminent danger . Michael Mylonas, QC for the trust, said he believed she was 'terminally ill' and might die at any time. She refused to engage in any therapy or discussions – even with friends – about the childhood trauma and abuse that underlay her anorexia. The woman's friend  said she 'could not cope' with more treatment and had added: 'In all honesty, I think she would kill herself.' Mr Justice Cobb stressed that he was not authorising the withdrawal of treatment. He said treatment remained on offer and said he hoped that the woman would accept treatment. 'This is about the right not to compel treatment,' he said. 'This is an unusual and desperately sad case.' He described her as being in a 'revolving door' of treatment and ill-health. 'As it is, her life expectancy is in months,' he said. Conrad Hallin, for the official solicitor, said: 'The tragedy of this case is that there is the possibility, even now, that X could live, and live a happy life. But the possibility is very small indeed. 'There is less than a five per cent chance of something very precious, which is a full recovery and a long life.' The judge ruled that the woman could not be named and details of her age, where she lived and where she had been treated - could not be reported for fear of identifying her. She had been detained and force fed under mental health legislation.","Anorexic woman dependent on alcohol should not be force fed, court rules .

"Investors pulled out £17billion from the British economy last month as fears that Scotland could go independent began to hit the prospects of the whole UK. More money flowed out of British assets in August than at any time since the height of the financial crisis, a report revealed last night. Businesses have warned of economic chaos in the event of a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum - with one leading bank predicting saying independence would be a mistake as grave as the Great Depression. Deutsche Bank said that the arguments against independence are 'overwhelming', adding that it was 'incomprehensible' to consider splitting up the Union. Scroll down for video . Risk: £16.8billion flowed out of British assets last month ahead of the referendum on Scottish independence championed by Alex Salmond . Campaign: Several business leader have come out in favour of a No vote in Thursday's referendum . A large number of businesses and entrepreneurs, including John Lewis, BP and Sir Richard Branson, have previously come out against independence and urged the people of Scotland to vote No next week. However, the polls remain on a knife-edge, with the latest survey released yesterday finding that 51 per cent of voters opposed indendence with 49 per cent in favour. A report by consulting firm CrossBorder Capital claimed that £16.8billion had been pulled out of British shares, bonds and other assets last month amidst a climate of uncertainty ahead of the referendum. That is the biggest change in a single month since 2008, when the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Michael Howell of CrossBorder Capital said: 'Sterling outflows have been an issue since the end of June, but they really gathered pace in August and now look like intensifying again with the possibility of Scottish independence coming to the front of investors' minds.' Over the course of the year, more than £120billion has been pulled out of British financial assets, compared to a net gain of around £40billion in 2013. Tight: The polls are currently on a knife edge with a slender lead for No in the latest survey . Panic: Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage are among the anti-independence campaigners in Scotland yesterday . Deutsche Bank last night issued a stark warning over the risks of independence, as its chief economist David Folkerts-Landau suggested that politicians and voters did not understand the full repercussions of a yes vote. 'Everyone has the right to self-determination and to exercise his or her democratic rights,' he said. 'But there are times when fundamental political decisions have negative consequences far beyond what voters and politicians could have imagined. We feel that we are on the threshold of one such moment. 'A Yes vote for Scottish independence on Thursday would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill's decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US. 'These decisions - well-intentioned as they were - contributed to years of depression and suffering and could have been avoided had alternative decisions been taken.' Mr Folkerts-Landau compared an independent Scotland to struggling eurozone countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal, claiming that investors would stay away due to the uncertainty caused by a break-up of the Union. He also predicted that in the event of a No vote, Scotland would have to undergo a period of severe austerity in order to establish itself as a credit-worthy economy. Count: Polling officials have already started counting postal votes in the upcoming referendum . The Scottish government hit back at the Deutsche Bank report, insisting that an independent Scotland would have 'stronger economic foundations than any other nation in history'. Finance secretary John Swinney said: 'Scotland is one of the world's wealthiest nations, with wealth per head higher than France, Japan and the rest of the UK - however for far too many people it doesn't feel that way. 'We already have well established institutions, solid economic foundations and according to the Financial Times will start life as an independent country from a strong fiscal position.' Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said this week that Scotland would have to build up billions of pounds in reserves to insure against default - implying that taxes would rise while public spending fell. Stock markets have been volatile this week after polls showed the race tightening, while the value of the pound has been steadily falling ahead of the referendum. Retailers such as Asda and John Lewis have said that they would have to raise their prices if the country became independent, because they would no longer be willing to subsidise the higher costs of operating in Scotland from profits made elsewhere in Britain. Financial institutions including Royal Bank of Scotland, TSB and Standard Life pledged to move their headquarters outside Scotland in the event of a Yes vote - although the independence campaign insists this would have little practical effect. Leading nationalist Jim Sillars yesterday warning businesses that they face a 'day of reckoning' for speaking out against independence, suggesting that the Scottish government could enact retribution on any firms which opposed it. And the Scottish National Party has accused David Cameron of leaning on business tycoons to come out against independence in order to boost the prospects of a No vote on Thursday.","Report reveals investors removed £16.8billion from UK assets in August .

"It's only his second appearance at London Fashion Week but Hunter Original's Creative Director Alasdhair Willis has already cemented his show as one of the season's hottest tickets. Stella McCartney's husband, who gives his wife a run for her money in the style stakes, unveiled his debut spring/summer collection before Sir Paul McCartney, Anna Wintour, Rita Ora and Mary Charteris, to name but a few. But it wasn't just his front row that impressed. The digital native, in his continued commitment to innovation, collaborated with visual artist Mat Maitland to mastermind a film that complimented his show and was projected onto the runway creating quite the spectacle (and Instagram snaps aplenty). Scroll down for video . It's raining men: Hunter Original sent models down the catwalk in cool outerwear in front of an impressive film projected onto the catwalk . Acting as a backdrop to the show, which was held on the site of an original swimming pool in West London, the film served as an extension of the collection and aimed to immerse the audience in a surreal underwater world celebrating our classic British summer. Hate rain? Not anymore, thanks to Hunter's SS15 offering. We can already picture Kate Moss and Poppy Delevingne rocking the colour-block outerwear at next summer's festivals. Wearable outerwear: Models rocked khaki coats souped up with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets -and it looks like sliders are here to stay .

Khaki coats souped up with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets (the coveted colours for SS15) were teamed with matching calf length socks and Hunter sliders (we bet Rita Ora had her eye on those). 'The first Hunter Original SS15 collection explores contradictions born out of a quintessential British sense of eccentricity and quest to innovate,' said Willis. 'A central story to the collection is Dazzle, a revolutionary form of camouflage that is all about contradiction. It makes the object it is disguising even more visible but works by confusing the viewer through optical illusion and distorting depth of field. 'Invented by the pioneering British painter Norman Wilkinson, dazzle represents ""twisted convention"" and ultimately ""innovation through creativity"", both of which are core to the Hunter brand.'

"Rory McIlroy may be known for his accuracy with a club, but even he will have to concede that one of his latest shots was a fluke. After teeing off in Atlanta, Georgia, 25-year-old McIlroy watched in disbelief as his ball drifted to the right, hit a tree and then bounced into the pocket of a spectator. The man was forced to stand still underneath the tree until McIlroy and a PGA TOUR official could make their way down and decide what to do next. Scroll down for video .

McIlroy watched in disbelief as his tee shot drifted to the right of the green, hit a tree, then dropped into the pocket of a spectator standing underneath (top centre, in the red shirt) The man waited in place until McIlroy made it over to him along with an official to decide what to do next . After placing a tee in the ground below the spectator's right pocket, where the shot had come to rest, McIlroy was allowed to drop the ball and play on without penalty. From the rough the Northern Irishman then fired an impressive second shot on to the green and within 12 yards of the pin. He then went on to complete a five-under-par round of 65 to keep himself in the hunt for both the TOUR Championship title and the FedEx Cup. Fortunately for McIlroy, golf rules state that if a ball is moved, deflected or stopped by an 'outside agent' - for example a spectator or animal - then the ball may be replaced and played without penalty . The official placed a marker underneath the spectator's right pocket, where the shot hand landed, and after McIlroy had dropped the ball back into play he took his second shot . Under the rules of golf, a player incurs a one shot penalty if a ball they played is moved, stopped or deflected either by themselves, their partner, their caddies or their equipment. A player may continue without penalty if a ball they hit is moved, deflected or stopped by an 'outside agency', for example a spectator or animal, then it can be replaced without penalty. If the ball is moved or lifted, then a player marks the spot where the ball landed, before dropping it back into play.

"As Ibiza host their closing parties this weekend, hot young design duo Felder Felder are already raising a glass to next season. The German sister design act unveiled a bohemian inspired range of fun, easy partywear that wouldn't look out of place on Pacha's dancefloor come next summer. Taking iconic German model Veruschka von Lehndorff as their muse, the unapologetically Bohemian aesthetic was updated for SS15 with a graceful edge via enviable kaftans, romantic kimono shawls and soft silk blouses. Felder Felder gave a nod to the Ibiza party trend in their SS15 collection and kitted out models in Jessie Western boots . 'Our woman is distinctive,' Daniela and Annette said ahead of the show. 'She has a vintage treasure trove wardrobe and those effortless enviable beach pieces, that transit, through midnight, to dawn.' And the Felder Felder woman sure caught the attention of front rowers Nina Nesbitt, Mary Charteris and Laura Whitmore thanks to her insouciant rock style. Turquoise hot pants, print drop hem shift dresses and metallic cowboy boots conveyed the urban hippy woman beloved by the fun-loving designers. Strong energetic prints in aqua (tipped to be a hot colour for SS15) and Sicilian lemon adorned shorts, maxis and kimonos. The collection featured a lot of bold turquoise which is tipped to be THE colour for SS15 . The catwalk featured many cow boy boots and fringed items giving a nod to a western vibe . Inspired by the freedom of the Sixties, the show closed with a nod to Peace One Day, an organisation that aligns with the designers' hope for peace ethos; oh so hippy. 'We have always been strongly attracted to the powerful message of peace, represented through eras like the Sixties,' said Annette. 'It's a feeling we continually tap into, especially at times of unrest, like now.' The beauty look, masterminded by Michaela Alleyson, Creative Director at Lord & Berry, was fresh, fun and wearable - just like the clothes. 'It’s a celebration of colour that completely translates to an everyday face’, she said backstage. Taking inspiration from the rock ‘n’ roll boho vibe of the collection, Michaela created a subtly highlighted face using Lord & Berry Luminizer Stick that screamed 'my days are spent roaming and writhing in the sun'. Celebrity fans: Laura Whitmore (left) and Donna Air (right) were spotted enjoying the show . Selfie expression: Left to right - Rosie Fortescue, Millie Mackintosh and Roxie Nafousi couldn't resist a frow photo opportunity . Eyes, which were the main event - sexy, smouldering but fresh with the addition of an accent colour under the eye - were a nod to the key colour palette within the collection; one to watch come next season. Hair was coiffed to perfection by Armin Morbach, Global Ambassador for Schwarzkopf, who created a young, fresh take of the iconic Brigitte Bardot look. Hair was gently curled from the middle partings to create loose waves and frame the face by resting it in front of the shoulders. 'Our girl is the one who moves between martinis downtown and rose on the sand dunes with consummate ease, said the siblings. ‘She’s a charismatic woman who is at ease with herself and the world. Age doesn’t matter. A Felder Felder woman is young at heart and she is a little wild too.’ Felder Felder show was supported by SkinDesign London, a sister partnership working in the beauty world, packed with active serums and cremes, akin to the sister fashion partnership.

"Army officials have warned Australian soldiers about the threat of being attacked when on home soil after an uniformed Digger was abused by a group of men on a Sydney street. Defence top brass are so concerned about a Lee Rigby-style attack happening in Australia they have issued an email warning servicemen and women to be on alert. Just 48-hours after the email was sent, the Prime Minister last week raised the country's alert level to High after receiving a series of terror-related briefings. Army officials have warned Australian soldiers about the threat of being attacked when on home soil after an uniformed Digger was abused by a group of men on a Sydney street . Defence top brass are so concerned about a Lee Rigby-style attack happening in Australia they have issued an email warning servicemen and women to be on alert . The email, sent by the Defence Security Authority (DSA), said a soldier in Sydney was approached by a group of men who told him to 'go to the Middle East so we can blow your f***ing head off you ****,' according to The Sunday Telegraph. A number of people witnessed the incident and the soldier just walked away. Last year British soldier Lee Rigby was targeted on a London street outside his barracks by two Muslim extremists who ran him down in their car and tried to decapitate him. Australian intelligence agencies fear a repeat incident here - and issued a warning in a notice marked 'Security Intelligence Report'. 'The Defence Security Authority assesses that this incident of anti-Defence sentiment is related to Defence’s current and possible future operations in the Middle East,' it wrote in the email, seen by The Sunday Telegraph. 'A further escalation of anti-Defence sentiment in Australia cannot be discounted.' The email said that since Australia's deployment in the Middle East, the Defence Security Authority has received 'an increase in reported threats of verbal abuse'. 'On 22 May 2013 Drummer Lee Rigby, a serving British ­soldier was run down by a vehicle and then hacked to death outside Woolwich Army Barracks in ­London. 'The attackers remained at the scene encouraging onlookers to film the aftermath — one claiming the attack was in response to British soldiers killing Muslims overseas and stating the British public would not be safe as long as it supported military deployments on Muslim lands.' Australian Defence officials' concern is based on the accessibility to weapons such as knives and cars.","An uniformed Australian officer was verbally attacked in Sydney's CBD .

"Ray Rice attended a football game at his high school in a New York City suburb and was greeted with open arms despite being suspended from the NFL following his recent domestic violence scandal. WABC-TV in New York reports that the recently released running back attended the game at New Rochelle High School with his wife, Janay Rice, and their daughter in New Rochelle. Rice was released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL on Monday after video of him punching his then fiance Janay was released. Scroll down for video . Warm welcome: Ray Rice, right, and his wife Janay Rice attend the Ramapo versus New Rochelle high school football game at his alma mater and students and the coach say they were happy to have him back . Happy: Ray Rice the former Baltimore Ravens star suspended by the NFL after video surfaced of him allegedly knocking his then fiancee in a hotel elevator was in good spirits at his high school alma mater . Previously, he had been suspended two games by the league and the Ravens organization had announced its support for him. The New York Daily News reports that students at the school and the football coach said that they were happy to see Rice back at his alma mater. 'Ray is a part of our family, and a part of this program and that's why I'm happy he's here today,' said New Rochelle Huguenots coach Louis DeRienzo. 'I know the character of the man and he will rise from this.' A 17-year-old senior named Justin Watson told reporters that he still respects Rice even after video surfaced of him beating Janay. Family affair: Rice and his wife Janay and their child were in good company at New Rochelle High school on Monday shortly after rice was suspended from the NFL for domestic violence .

'He's from New Rochelle, he's done a lot for us so we support him,' Watson said. 'We really have a lot of love for him and instead of kicking him down we want to help him back up.' The case has put the NFL in an uncomfortable spotlight as it faces criticism for how it handles cases in which players are accused of domestic violence. The schools superintendent for New Rochelle, Brian Osborne, said in a statement emailed on Thursday that 'our community stands united in the belief that physical violence to settle differences cannot be condoned.' The high school also removed Rice's jersey from its wall of fame and took down a placard honoring him.","Ray Rice attended a football game at New Rochelle High School with his wife, Janay Rice, and their daughter .

"A 36-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a mother-of-five who was found stabbed to death in a paddock in the New Forest as she tended to her horses. Penelope Davis, 47, known as Pennie, was found with multiple stab wounds by her husband, Pete, near Beaulieu, Hampshire, on September 2. This afternoon, detectives charged Justin Robertson, of no fixed address, with Ms Davis's murder. A 36-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Penelope Davis, 47, known as Pennie, who was found dead in a field near Beaulieu, Hampshire, on September 2 . This afternoon, detectives from Hampshire Constabulary charged Justin Robertson, of no fixed abode, with Ms Davis's murder . Mrs Davis, pictured here on her wedding day in May with her husband Pete, had been stabbed multiple times when she was found by Mr Davis in the field five miles from their home . Mr Robertson will remain in custody and is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates' Court on Monday, September 15. A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said Mrs Davis' family had been informed. John Montague, senior district crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, said: 'I have authorised Hampshire Constabulary to charge Justin Robertson with the murder of Penelope Davis, 47, from Blackfield, on 2 September. 'It is alleged that Mrs Davis was found killed when she was tending to her horses in a paddock near Leygreen Farm in Beaulieu. Her husband Peter Davis found her dead; she had sustained several stab wounds. 'I carefully reviewed all the available evidence provided to me by Hampshire Constabulary and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Justin Robertson with the murder of Penelope Davis. 'Proceedings are now ongoing and the defendants have the right to a fair trial. It is very important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' Sainsbury's shop worker Mrs Davis - who married Mr Davis in May - was found in the field, five miles away from the couple's home in Blackfield, Hampshire. Witnesses saw Mr Davis, who also works for a supermarket, sobbing uncontrollably as he knelt by his love's body. Mrs Davis' devastated children made a desperate plea for help to find her killer, hours before the arrest of Mr Robertson . Family and friends, including her husband, pictured arriving at the scene of the investigation, left, and laying flowers, right, have left  flowers and written tributes by the gate to the paddock where  Mrs Davis was found . Around 200 police officers and staff have been working on the investigation and the public have come forward with more than 230 calls with information. Police have already charged suspect Leanne Doyle, 24, of Hythe, Hampshire, with assisting an offender and intending to pervert the course of justice. She has been bailed and will reappear at Winchester Crown Court on October 1. A 28-year-old woman, also from Hythe,  who was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, has been released on bail until November 3. A 22-year-old man, previously arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on bail, while a 37-year-old man held on suspicion of assisting an offender has also been bailed. Police continue to ask people with information about Mrs Davis's killing to contact them in confidence. In particular, they would like to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious near Mrs Davis's work at Sainsbury's, Blackfield between 1.30 and 3pm on the day she was found. Police believe Mrs Davis was followed after leaving her work in her dark green Toyota Land Cruiser to Leygreen Farm in the New Forest. Around 200 police officers and staff have been working on the investigation, including searching a river for a weapon, just yards from where Mrs Davis was found . The public have come forward with more than 230 calls with information in the 11 days since her death . Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, leading the investigation, said: 'Pennie's death has had a significant impact on people living and working in the New Forest who are rightly concerned about what happened to her. 'I said early on, and I would like to say again today that there has never been any suggestion of a direct risk to the wider community. 'I appreciate our enquiries have also been a cause for concern and I would like to thank everyone affected for their understanding while we continue to investigate this brutal murder with minimal disruption to day-to-day life. 'I've been massively encouraged by the number of people who have come forward with information. 'During our week anniversary appeal work yesterday, we spoke to the occupants of around 960 vehicles, which has been incredibly useful. 'I'm asking anyone with information who has not already done so to get in touch. 'You may think what you saw or heard was insignificant, but it could be important to our enquiries and our efforts to secure justice for Pennie and her family.' Detectives are yet to confirm whether a murder weapon has been found but have previously said they may be looking for one or more assailants . Location: Mrs Davis was found by her husband in a field just yards from Leygreen Farm, in the New Forest . Mrs Davis' devastated children made a desperate plea for help to find her killer, hours before the arrest of Mr Robertson. Her husband Pete and her children Sophie, 20, Alex, 19, Georga, 18, Daniel, 15, and Josef, 13, described 'the void in their hearts' in the moving statement. The family said: 'It has been a long and agonising week since our precious mum and wife was selfishly taken from us. 'We had no idea how many lives she had touched and we have been overwhelmed by love and support. 'Despite this, the void in our hearts only continues to grow. The police have made progress in their investigation but there is still much more to be done. 'We only hope that no other family should ever have to go through the ordeal we are currently enduring. 'No other person deserves to have to go the way our poor mum and wife did. We will never begin to understand how scared and how alone she must have felt. 'This is why we are pleading for anybody with any information to come forward. Even if you think it won't make a difference, it might just be the call we were waiting for.' Detectives are yet to confirm whether a murder weapon has been found but have previously said they may be looking for one or more assailants.

"Rafael Nadal appears to have got over his Wimbledon woe after being photographed enjoying a romantic day with his girlfriend Xisca Perello. The Spaniard suffered a shock fourth round exit to Australian Nick Kyrgios at SW19 earlier this month, losing his world number one ranking to rival Novak Djokovic after the Serb claimed the grass-court title. However, life off-the-court seems a lot better at present for Nadal as he put on an amorous display with Perello as they soaked up the sun on a luxurious boat in Ibiza, Spain on Sunday. Smitten! Rafael Nadal cuddles up to girlfriend Xisca Perello during a day out  in Ibiza, Spain on Sunday . Affectionate: The pair have been dating for over eight years but are more in love than ever . In between ocean dips and sunbathing sessions, Nadal showered his girlfriend with kisses and cuddles. The 28-year-old showed off his elite athlete figure in a pair of salmon-coloured board shorts while Xisca slipped into a white bikini with frilly details. Following her dip Perello enjoyed an al fresco shower, layering up in soapy suds to wash away the sea water. Nadal began dating Perello in 2005 after they grew up together in their hometown of Palma de Majorca on the coast of Spain. In 2011 the tennis star  told Harper's Bazaar about his deep love for Perello.'She is a lovely person, I feel great with her and [she] is probably the woman of my life,' he said. So fresh and so clean! The stunning Spaniard showered off after her dip in the ocean . Don't forget the soap! Rafa's girlfriend made the most of her al fresco shower, layering up in soapy suds .

Pedro Hernadez, who is a friend of the couple, recently revealed: 'They are not at all interested in a celebrity lifestyle. They get together when the tournaments are over. That’s how Raf winds down.' No doubt the Spaniard was in dire need of a holiday following his surprise Wimbledon exit. Time to relax: Last month Nadal was unexpectedly  knocked out at Wimbledon by Aussie teenager Nick Kyrgios . Beach hair! Perello sported gorgeous natural curls as her wet hair dried . History: Nadal and Perello grew up together in their hometown of Palma de Majorca on the coast of Spain. Doing her own thing: 'They are not at all interested in a celebrity lifestyle.

"It was a big night for musician James Morgan, conducting an orchestra for a prestigious concert in Denmark as television cameras rolled in the background. But during this performance his life changed for ever. His left hand had been trembling uncontrollably. It wasn’t the first time – it had been happening on and off for several months, but he had ignored it. As he stepped off the stage, one musician asked: ‘What’s going on with your hand?’ ‘I looked down and couldn’t stop it shaking. If other people were starting to notice, I had to do something about it.’ Debilitating illness: Musician James Morgan, pictured with wife Juliette Pochin, initially blamed his shaking hand on drinking too much, but after a series of tests found he had Young Onset Parkinson's . James, who was 42 at the time and has worked with Katherine Jenkins and Alfie Boe, initially blamed the tremors on drinking too much red wine, and he cut out alcohol. It didn’t work. Although he had been suffering neck and back pains for more than four years and kept crying out in his sleep, he never imagined it was linked to his shaking hand. ‘I thought they were just stress dreams,’ he says as he sits in the music room of his Sussex home  with wife Juliette Pochin, 42, the glamorous mezzo soprano. In October 2012, James’s GP referred him to a neurologist, who sent him for an MRI scan to check for brain tumours. It came back clear. Next, he had a series of tests. ‘I had to establish how quickly I could move my fingers, putting my hands in front of me to see if one side reacted more slowly than the other. The doctor noted weakness, shaking and slow reactions in my left hand. He also noticed that when I walked, my left arm didn’t swing – a classic sign, I later learned, of the diagnosis that would soon follow. The fact that I didn’t blink much and my left leg shook were also clues.’ Family strength: Conductor James has the support of mezzo soprano Juliette, pictured here with their daughter Anna, now 12 . James had feared it was Parkinson’s, and when this was confirmed he was devastated. ‘When the consultant phoned, I somehow knew. I wasn’t surprised, but I was shocked. My first reaction was a mixture of denial and panic,’ says James. ‘I just thought, “I’m a working dad with three kids. How is this going to impact everyone else? I need to support my children.” ’ Popular perception of Parkinson’s is that it affects the elderly, but it can be diagnosed at any age, with one in 20 sufferers being under 40. Of 127,000 Britons with the disease, more than 6,000 were diagnosed before their 40th birthday. ‘Parkinson’s causes the nerve cells in the brain that make the chemical dopamine to struggle, be damaged and eventually die,’ explains Claire Bale, from Parkinson’s UK. ‘These nerve cells are mainly in a part of the brain involved in movement, so they can’t get messages through and people start to develop problems with movement. For example walking is more laboured.’ As the condition progresses, it can affect talking, digesting, writing, mood and sleep, as dopamine is also in part responsible for these. ‘Although Young Onset Parkinson’s is very similar in many ways, we tend to find that in younger people the condition progresses more slowly and they respond better to the drugs,’ adds Claire. There is no specific blood test for Parkinson’s. In James’s case, his neurologist’s diagnosis was confirmed by a DaTscan, which measures how much dopamine is available in the brain. It showed the right side of his brain, which affects the left side of the body, wasn’t properly producing the chemical. Juliette immediately went into practical mode, phoning her mother to come and pick up the kids so she and James could spend the next few days frantically learning everything they could about the disease. They told their eldest child Anna, then ten, because she sensed something was wrong, but their two-year-old twins Arthur and Seth were too young. It was just before Christmas, so they tried to give the children as normal a celebration as possible. For the first year they confided only in close family. ‘I spent a long time trying to hide it,’ says James. ‘It’s common for people to worry about their employer’s reaction and my big worry was if I’d be booked for concerts and other jobs.’ But as his shaking hand became more obvious, and fearing his colleagues might mistake it for nerves, he decided to tell people. ‘I felt what I said had to be done in a positive, inspiring way. I didn’t want people feeling sorry for me. It’s pity I dread the most. I just want people to be normal around me.’ Reactions were varied. ‘Alfie Boe cracked a few jokes, saying I’d make a good cocktail waiter. I’d rather that than pity.’ James admits he is still in denial –but each new symptom yanks him back to reality. ‘I’ll wake up and my left eye will take longer to open, or my finger might be bent round and I have to bend it back.’ At the moment his problems are mainly stiffness, rigidity and tremors. They are all worsened by cold weather or stress, which makes work difficult at times. ‘I’m coping, and looking at getting a giant iPad so I don’t have to turn pages while conducting. If it gets too difficult, I’ll focus on composing and producing. I struggle with depression, but I think that’s a reaction to my diagnosis.’ There’s no cure, and drug treatments, which aim to boost dopamine, have limited effect. James, now 44, takes Rasagiline, used in the early stages to manage symptoms, and has physiotherapy so he can keep working for as long as possible. Doctors can’t predict who will get Parkinson’s – unless you’re in a small minority with a genetic predisposition – or how quickly it will progress. Juliette knows she will one day be James’s carer, but the fact the couple have been together since they were 18 has helped them stay strong. They organised a summer concert, Symfunny No 1, at the Royal Albert Hall hosted by Al Murray and with performances by Alfie Boe, Jane Horrocks and Rebecca Ferguson, which helped raise more than £125,000 for Parkinson’s UK. They hope to hold another next year. ‘Just as important as the money was increasing understanding, especially for those with Young Onset Parkinson’s,’ says James. ‘This disease can happen to anyone at any age but there is some exciting research that gives hope for the future.’ parkinsons.org.uk;  helpline 0800 800 0303.","James Morgan was diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson's at 42 .

Mr Murdoch, who owns The Sun and The Times, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Scots better people than to be dependants of London. Hard choice with real pain for some time. Maybe too much. 'Wrestling with Scottish vote. Scottish Sun No. 1. Head over heart, or just maybe both lead to same conclusion'. He had previously described Alex Salmond as 'the best politician in the UK'. Today Mr Murdoch, whose media empire fell under unparalleled scrutiny during the Leveson Inquiry and subsequent phone hacking trial, is thought to have spoken with pub-goers about the coming referendum. But, stopping for lunch in the Prince of Wales pub in Aberdeen, he side-stepped campaigners brandishing Yes or No placards to get into a waiting car. This evening, the 83-year-old took to Twitter to share his experiences. Mr Murdoch was spotted by a number of surprised pub-goers, including one who took a photograph as he waited by the bar at Sloans  in Glasgow .

'Tried 24 hours incognito Scottish visit (failed!) No politicians, just street and pub talks. Glasgow, Aberdeen, Rosehearty. Great people.' A photograph taken by a pub-goer shows the mogul resting at the bar in Sloans pub in Glasgow. When asked whether the pair had met during his flying visit, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: 'No, Mr Murdoch is quite entitled to be in Scotland, I've been campaigning today and I'm sure he's having a great time here in Scotland with the weather like the rest of us.' In the event of independence, Mr Murdoch, whose grandfather Patrick John Murdoch emigrated from Aberdeenshire to Australia in 1884, could seek citizenship. But critics have been fast to accuse the tycoon of trying to influence Thursday's poll. Earlier this week Labour MP Tom Watson told MailOnline: 'Here we go again, Rupert Murdoch and his old friend Alex Salmond. The tycoon gave a wide berth to political rallies and campaign talks instead opting to visit pubs and streets . Earlier this week Murdoch hinted at his support of the Yes campaign in a series of tweets in which he referenced his ancestors . Earlier in the week the 83-year-old said he had tried to remain 'incognito' during this 24 hours in Scotland . Critics have accused Mr Murdoch of attempting to force his views on to his publications and influence the vote . 'This is new politics just like the old politics. Murdoch is trying to dictate the agenda’. Labour leader Ed Miliband meanwhile dismissed his Twitter remarks, suggesting the media tycoon does not want what is best for Scotland. Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: ‘As far as I know he doesn’t want a social democratic paradise.’ Historically the tycoon's newspapers have put their full weight behind political campaigns during British general elections.","Media mogul visited Aberdeen, Fife and Glasgow with five days until vote .

"Killer Oscar Pistorius has been exposed as a paranoid love cheat who had multiple affairs behind Reeva Steenkamp's back during their relationship. The Blade Runner was convicted yesterday of culpable homicide, escaping the more serious charge of murder for shooting his girlfriend on Valentines’ Day last year. But at sentencing next month, he could simply be fined - avoiding a 15-year jail term – after Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled there was a lack of evidence to suggest he planned the killing. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius, 27, was found guilty of culpable homicide after shooting Reeva Steenkamp. It has been revealed that the athlete cheated on her with a string of other girlfriends . It has been revealed that the 27-year-old double amputee started dating the 29-year-old model when he was still seeing student Sam Taylor, 20, and banker Jenna Edkins, 25. He was also linked to PR executive Erin Stear and Anastasia Khozissova during their stormy relationship and broke up with long-term on-off girlfriend Vicky Miles that same year. The Paralympian and Ms Stear were said to have seen each other several time in the weeks before he shot dead his model girlfriend. He started dating Ms Steenkamp when he was still regularly seeing Sam Taylor, who would stay at his gated home in Silver Woods, Pretoria, four nights a week. Sam Taylor (left) who dated Oscar until three months before Reeva Steenkamp's death last year . Jenna Edkins (right) had an on-off relationship with the Paralympic athlete for more than five years . Her mother, Trish Taylor, said: ‘All his girlfriends were, like Sammy, blonde, petite and slim. I have often wondered what effect all these perfect women had on Oscar. ‘Did they in some way make him feel his own imperfections more acutely? Perhaps this was why he tried to control women and treat them almost like inanimate objects. ‘At first, Sammy was undemanding, obedient and demure. But when she got a job and made new friends, Oscar became critical and controlling. ‘She discovered he was messaging and flirting with other women, even asking them out for lunch or dinner. He was highly possessive of his phones and they were all password protected. ‘Sammy once saw a Facebook profile picture of a woman called Jenna Edkins sitting on Oscar’s bed with Kola, the puppy that Sammy and Oscar had bought together. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide at the court in Pretoria, South Africa, yesterday . He broke up with long-term girlfriend Victoria Miles (left) in the same year he started dating Reeva . ‘He always denied he was having any contact with Jenna, but the picture proved otherwise.’ Ms Taylor split from him after a year-and-a-half when she found he had been cheating with Ms Edkins and ‘a lady from New York called Anastasia.’ She said their relationship was tempestuous, with Pistorius often “screaming” at her. Pistorius begged for forgiveness and in a series of messages he told her: ‘I don’t deserve your love. ‘You deserve so much better than me. I have lied and I have been secretive.’ It also emerged during the dramatic six-moth trail that Ms Steenkamp sent Pistorius texts complaining about his treatment of her just weeks before she was killed. One said: ‘Every five seconds I hear how u dated another chick. Anastassia Khozissova is believed to have had an affair with the athlete while he was still dating Reeva . ‘You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long-term boyfriend.’ Jenna Edkins confirmed her relationship with the star soon after he shot Ms Steenkamp. She said: I would just like to say that I have dated Oscar on-off for five years, not once has he made me fear for my life.’ Yesterday, Mr and Mrs Steenkamp spoke of their ‘disappointment’ at the verdict on their daughter’s boyfriend, who shot her four times as she cowered behind the door of the bathroom in his home. Mrs Steenkamp said: 'We were shocked. Shocked. Disappointed. 'You know your heart drops because you just want the truth. It’s going in the wrong direction, that’s how you feel.'

"Fashion week undeniably serves up some bonkers styles but away from the vertiginous heels, unflattering cuts and ridiculous headwear often spotted on the runway, we women want clothes we can actually wear and feel good in - and that's exactly where Jasper Conran comes in. As well as being a pleasure to chat to at the crack of dawn on a Saturday morning, Jasper really understands the female form and knows exactly how to show it off in all its glory. 'That is my thing, you know, creating flattering clothes,' he tells me backstage ahead of the show. Scroll down for video . Jasper Conran's collection of autumnal shades presented an extremely wearable line . He achieved it last season via sexy slips, double faced cashmere and covetable coats so how will he be dressing us for SS15? 'Its a combination of body conscious and much easier and softer shapes,' he said of his fluid jerseys and light weight silk shirt dresses punctuated with painterly abstracts in navy and coffee. And while we are more accustomed to Jasper's play-it-safe style, the designer has pulled out his paintbrush and experimented with a more artistic vibe this season. At London Fashion Week we are a accustomed to extrovert design so it comes as a breath of fresh air to see a pared down collection . Jasper says that the collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose and wearable approach . Unlike many designers who have raised their hems for SS15 Jasper has gone for a longer length . 'The collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose, easy and wearable approach. It's sporty, summery and fresh,' he said. Pigment blue was projected across a palette of mostly white, and grids, stripes and spheres emblazoned skinny knit tops and skirts. Unlike a lot of designers, who have raised their hems for SS15, Jasper's conservative silhouettes fell below the knee and footwear was exclusively espadrilles in rusty brown, navy and chalk white. 'This collection is a departure for me; it's a softening up.' And quite a departure it was at Somerset House today; one women will welcome with open arms come spring.

"A teenager says his life was saved by memories of the late Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin after his leg was pierced by a stingray barb as he swam in shallow waters. Corey Jamieson, 17, spent more than 24 hours in agony after the marine animal's razor sharp barb sank more than 6cm into his right leg, narrowly missing his bone, as he swam off a beach in Australia's Northern Territory. He resisted the urge to pull the spike out in a desperate attempt to ease the pain because he knew that could cause serious bleeding and severe tissue damage. Irwin died in 2006 when he was struck in the heart by a barb as he filmed a marine documentary. ‘Steve Irwin did pop into my head when it happened. I remembered that they thought Steve Irwin had pulled the stingray barb out,' Mr Jamieson told Daily Mail Australia. The stingray left it's barb deeply lodged in Corey Jamieson's leg. The 17-year-old had to wait more than 24 painful hours until the barb was removed in a two hour operation. After the attack, Mr Jamieson thought of the late Steve Irwin, and knew not to remove the barb from his leg in fear of making his injury worse. It is widely speculated that Irwin's fatal attack from a stingray was made worse when he allegedly pulled the barb out from his chest. ‘So I knew not to pull it out or the bleeding would be even worse, so I knew to let someone qualified medically take it out properly.' To add to his agony, Mr Jamieson had to wait more than 24 hours for the barb to be removed when  Darwin Private Hospital suffered a power outage. The incident happened on Thursday morning while he swam at Mindil Beach in the Northern Territory, whilst doing his bronze medallion test for his school’s sport and recreation class. ‘I was swimming in waist-deep water. I was standing on the bottom and it was so murky you couldn’t see the bottom,’ he said. ‘I felt a sharp pain that I thought must have been a broken branch in my leg. But it was really the serrated edges of the barb. ‘I freaked out a little bit, but all the students down in the water with me helped me get to the beach.’ A lifesaver identified that it was a stingray barb and Mr Jamieson’s ‘upset and stressed out’ mother, Vicki Jamieson, rushed to her son's side. The 17-year-old Darwin Highschool student was dragged to shore by his classmates . However, the trouble was far from over once Jamieson got to hospital, as Darwin Private Hospital was in the grips of a major power outage. The schoolboy’s operation was delayed by more than 24 hours, as he was constantly bumped down the list, waiting to transferred to the private hospital. X-rays eventually showed that the barb was 6cm above Jamieson's right knee – only narrowly missing the bone. ‘It was annoying and frustrating to wait for so long, but I do understand that my life wasn’t in danger like some of the other people that were coming into emergency,’ Mr Jamieson said. An x-ray shows that the stingray's barb plunged more than six centimetres into Jamieson's leg, 'only just' missing the bone . A stingray’s venom is painful, but rarely fatal. The sting is near the base of the tale, containing a spine with serrated edges. The stingray pierces the victim, at which point venom flows into the wound. However, the victim is also at risk of tissue necrosis, infection and other serious ailments. Mr Jamieson was in surgery for almost two hours and is expected to be released from hospital on Monday. He has ‘lots’ of stitches but hasn’t seen the wound yet, because he’s ‘all bandaged up.’ His family says it is ‘typical’ that the photos of Corey on the beach after the incident all show the 17-year-old on his phone. His family says it is ‘typical’ that the photos of Corey on the beach after the incident all show the 17-year-old on his phone. A blackout at Darwin Private Hospital meant Jamieson had to wait more than 24 hours to be moved to the private hospital, as his name kept getting bumped down the waiting list. He was being given morphine to deal with the excruciating pain .

"Queensland born jihadist, Amira Karroum's body was found shot and her body dismembered in Syria. Now Australian Federal Police have revealed that Ms Karroum is just one of a number of Australian women who have joined terrorist groups to fight in Syria. The 22-year-old Australian and her husband Yusif Ali who traveled to Syria together to join the fight for Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. Scroll down for video . Amira Karroum (left) was educated at an Anglican private school and in 2011, after moving to Sydney with her sister, became a devout Muslim, donning a hijab (right) Australian Federal Police’s counter terrorism manager Neil Gaughan told The Sunday Telegraph,  that Ms Karroum was involved in active conflict with her husband. 'That’s what we are alleging. That she was involved in the fighting with him,’' he said.It was originally believed that women were only supporting their husbands in the war zone but Ms Karroum's death proved otherwise as she was found armed. 'There’s a couple of women who have gone over as fighters — shooting guns — in Syria. 'They are young women. Under 21. One is dead. Amira Karroum.' She was lined up against a wall and shot multiple times and then dismembered. The couple was killed inside a house sprayed with bullets in Aleppo,near the border of Turkey. Her father, Mohammed Karroum, said his daughter was 'beautiful', and liked barbecues and clubbing . She moved to Sydney after completing her degree in graphic design and that's when she met her husband, whose original name was Tyler Perry. The idea that she was a terrorist in the making seemed farfetched for her friends and family. It was her Facebook that gave away the changes she had made to her life and revealed she had been recruited to join Al-Qaeda. 'Islam is my identity. The burqa is my shield. Jannah (the Islamic garden of paradise) is my destination,' she wrote. She was preparing for something the was not equipped for when she landed on the firing line. 'Everything is temporary,' she posted on the social media site. Mr Gaughan said the brutal deaths of 15 Australians in the region, including Karroum and her husband, underscored that the reality of war zone was different to the romanticised images online.'Once you go over there and you actually smell and taste it, it’s different,' he said.'Facebook and social media romanticise things. It’s just a totally different environment.’' Her father, Mohamad Karroum suffered a mild heart attack when he was told of her death while her mother Honor Deane said she was 'distraught with grief'. Mr Karroum told the ABC's 7.30  the details of her gruesome death. 'She got shot and then they dismantle her body.' 'They cut her body. I don’t know why they are so cruel. Her and her husband. There was a lot of bullet in her body. And they dismantled.' Ms Karroum visited her father before departing to Syria, she had told him she was going to Denmark to do some humanitarian work. 'She came and saw me before she left, I didn't know she was leaving, and she hugged me and she started to cry,' Mr Karroum said. Mr Karroum was devastated when he found out his daughter had been killed in Syria . 'I knew it was different this time. I said to her, 'what’s wrong?', she said to me, 'nothing, I just love you Dad'. 'I accepted it - I didn’t know she was saying goodbye.' Upon arriving in Syris Ms Karroum sent her father a chilling text message that should have been a warning sign. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' she wrote. Ms Karroum and Mr Ali were executed only two days after her arrival in Syria.","Amira Karroum, a 22-year-old Queenslander was killed and while fighting for terrorist group Al-Qaeda .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of wanting to restore the Soviet Union after he sent 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid across the border into Ukraine. A convoy of 250 Russian army trucks, painted white, are heading towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk. The development prompted Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk that Putin's 'goal is to take the entire of Ukraine'. The trucks left Russia overnight and arrived approached the disputed frontier shortly before dawn . The convoy passes through the Ukrainian border at Izvarino without being inspected by customs officers . The aid convoy of an estimated 250 trucks crossed the border on its way to the Ukrainian town of Lugansk . He added: 'He [Putin] cannot cope with the idea that Ukraine would be a part of a big EU family. He wants to restore the Soviet Union,' Yatsenyuk said. The Russian emergency ministry, which coordinated previous humanitarian aid deliveries to Ukraine, could not be reached for comment about the convoy. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told journalists Saturday that the convoy had crossed 'illegally' onto Ukrainian territory. 'Ukraine border guards and customs were not allowed to examine the cargo and vehicles. 'Representatives of the Red Cross don't accompany the cargo, nobody knows what's inside.' Colonel Lysenko's relatively mild comments on the second convoy and the silence of more senior Ukrainian officials shows how dramatically the mood has shifted in the Kiev government since August. President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to prove that last week's cease-fire deal has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine. On Friday, he lauded the deal, which has been riddled by violations since it was imposed last week, as a 'fragile but efficient peace process.' In August, Ukrainian officials said that a first convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia would be seen as an invasion of the country, and loudly protested any attempts by Russia to unilaterally bring in the aid. Ukrainian officials fear that the convoy would have been carrying military equipment instead of food . Russian officials claimed the aid was needed because of severe shortages in the eastern city of Lugansk . Workers unloaded an estimated 2,000 tonnes of 'humanitarian aid' according to Russian officials . Eventually Russia sent its trucks across the border and into rebel-held territory without the oversight of the International Red Cross, contrary to an agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia. A representative of the ICRC's Moscow office said they had not been informed about the current convoy, either. Galina Balzamova of the ICRC said: 'We were not officially notified of an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to ship the cargo.' Colonel Lysenko said that six Ukrainian servicemen had died since the truce. He also confirmed that 12 rebel fighters had been killed by Ukrainian forces near Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, where he said they were doing reconnaissance work - the first such admission that they have inflicted casualties on the rebel side since the cease-fire began. In a statement posted online early Saturday, the Donetsk city council said that there had been fighting near the airport throughout the night. Two shells had hit residential buildings in the area but no casualties were reported. Continuous rocket fire could be heard overnight in downtown Donetsk, and a column of three GRAD rocket launchers - all its rockets still in place - was seen moving freely through the rebel-held city on Saturday morning. Yury Stepanov, a Russian official overseeing the convoy said the convoy consisted mainly of foodstuffs - rice, sugar, and canned fish and beef - but also included medicine, technical equipment and clothes. The deliveries were in closed boxes, small enough to be easily carried by one person, but rice was seen spilling from a broken bag. Stepanov said his team was responsible only for delivery, and distribution will be handled by local authorities - which for now means the separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic. Gennady Tsepkalo, a senior separatist official, said the aid would first and foremost be given to retirees, hospital patients and schoolchildren. He said the food would not be used to feed rebel fighters. He said: 'The militia will feed itself separately. This is for the residents of the Luhansk People's Republic.' The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission to the Russian-Ukrainian border said Saturday that they had seen 220 trucks cross into Ukraine, none of which were inspected by the Ukrainian side or accompanied by the ICRC.","Ukrainian PM Arseniy Yatsenuk claimed Putin wants a new Soviet Union .

"Guilty: PC Alan King has been jailed for three years after having sex with a lover in his marked car . A married police officer has been jailed for three years after having sex with a witness in his patrol car while he was on duty. PC Alan King, 48, also seized cannabis from a suspect to smoke with his lover - but the 'house of cards' fell when the suspect himself told other officers about the deal, a court heard. Father-of-two King texted 'Happy Birthday' to Zoe Barham, 36, after he was called to an incident at the branch of Betfred where she worked in Gravesend, Kent. After swapping messages, the pair embarked on an affair and had sex in King's marked car, in an alleyway and at Ms Barham's home. King later used force computers to run an unauthorised background check on Ms Barham to see if she would be a suitable girlfriend. But the affair fell apart when he struck a corrupt deal at the scene of a stabbing in Gravesend, Kent. King was the first on the scene of the incident, in which a man was stabbed in the neck, and confiscated a bag of cannabis before taking the victim to hospital. He then told suspect Martin Reid that he would drop all charges - if he could keep the illegal drugs. He and Ms Barham smoked the drugs together after King asked her if she wanted 'cannabis, weed or green', the court heard. But Mr Reid later gave a description of the officer who had done the deal, and 'the House Of Cards began to fall'. King, of Hoo, Kent, had admitted the affair but denied misconduct in a public office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs - claiming Ms Barham was a 'woman scorned'. But a jury at Canterbury Crown Court found King - who had been in line for a bravery award - guilty of all charges and he was jailed for three years. Judge Adele Williams told him: 'Police officers should be beyond reproach. They should be people that the public can look up to and have confidence in that they will uphold the law. 'But you broke the law and perverted the course of justice.' As he was sent down, his 25-year career in tatters, King blew a kiss to his wife in the public gallery from which his son shouted: 'Love you dad.' Convicted: The married father-of-two (far left and right) denied misconduct, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs but was found guilty. He struck a deal to keep cannabis which he took from a crime scene . The court heard Mr King met Ms Barham, who thought he was single, in June 2011 when he was called to an incident at the betting shop. He took a statement and mobile number from Ms Barham and became a frequent visitor to the shop in the following week, chatting to her about her upcoming birthday. The relationship then began after she received his unsolicited birthday wishes. 'He gave me his personal number because he wanted to start a relationship,' she said. 'I wasn't aware about his relationship at first but I did suspect after a little while [he was married]. 'He would turn up in his marked police car and if I was at work we would just talk and have a fag. 'He would sometimes take me to my home in Gravesend in his police car. 'On one occasion he took me up an alley in Barr Road where we had sexual intercourse in his police car. That happened on several occasions. 'Mr King picked me up in his police car and took me there and he was in uniform. I went there because I was in a relationship with him. 'He promised me everything. He promised me a lot. He told me he loved me and I believed him at the time.' King took her with him on three occasions while he was investigating incidents, the court heard, and she was allowed to input information into the vehicle's police computer. King also admitted during the trial he had used the police system, 'Genesis', to search for details on Ms Barham. The court was told the officer was being routinely vetted and did not want anything bad emerging that could damage his reputation. The affair ended when the two were arrested in relation to an alleged fraud, although no charges were brought in relation to that suspected offence. Ms Barham then told police about the drugs and her affair. After the sentencing, a Kent Police spokesman said: 'We acknowledge the sentence imposed on Police Constable Alan King after he was found guilty of misconduct in a public office, perverting the course of justice and supply of class B drugs. 'PC King will now face a disciplinary hearing and until such time that the hearing has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.'","PC Alan King, 48, texted Zoe Barham after meeting her at crime scene .

"The campaign to save the United Kingdom has increased its lead over Alex Salmond’s push for Scottish independence, a new poll revealed today. The Survation survey showed 54 per cent of Scots plan to vote No in Thursday’s historic referendum, with 46 per cent backing the nationalists. It is a dramatic turnaround from a week ago when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, and sent Westminster into panic mode fearing the United Kingdom was days away from separation. Scroll down for video . With just six days left before the Scottish independence vote, a new poll has revealed that the No campaign is now in the lead by six percentage points . Men are evenly split over independence, while women are more likely to vote no. The poll also showed 93 per cent of Scots say they will certainly vote in the referendum . Latest data shows highest support for the union among older voters. Numbers also showed that those in the North East of the country were most likely to vote Yes, while those in the South favoured No . The last week has been dominated by warnings from banks, shops and oil companies about the risks of independence, including rising prices and jobs being relocated to England. The latest Survation survey, commissioned by the Better Together campaign, suggests it has persuaded more voters to swing behind the Union. Polling experts said it would be difficult for Mr Salmond to make up the lost ground with only five days left until polling day. Some 40 per cent of those surveyed say they and their families would be financially worse off if Scotland goes it alone, compared to 27 per cent who believe they would be better off. Survey also points to a very high turnout with 93 per cent of voters saying they are certain to vote. Men are split exactly, with 50 per cent support independence and 50 per cent opposed. Among women, 57 per cent plan to vote no with only 43 per cent in favour. The breakdown of the poll showed that support for independence is highest among 35-44-year-olds, at 58.5 per cent, and lowest among the over 65s, with just 33 per cent backing the break-up of the UK. The North East of Scotland is the most pro-independence region of Scotland (54 per cent) with the south most supportive of the Union (30 per cent). Just 9 per cent of those surveyed say they have yet to make up their minds about which way they will vote. Professor John Curtice, an expert in political polling, wrote on his blog: ‘Survation continue to fail to find any evidence of a swing to Yes in recent weeks. That will undoubtedly be disappointing for the Yes side. ‘But otherwise this poll clearly confirms the message of many another poll that the referendum race is now tight, albeit one in which the No side still appear to have the edge. The news will come as a fresh blow to Alex Salmond after businesses warned this week of rising prices and job losses if he secures a Yes vote on September 18 . With almost all Tory voters in Scotland vowing to vote No, Labour has deployed former Home Secretary John Reid and Jim Murphy MP to shore up their base . Gordon Brown has also travelled to Scotland this week in order to fight for the No campaign . ‘The poll also suggests that gaining further ground could well prove far from easy for the Yes side.’ Blair McDougall, Campaign Director of Better Together, said: ‘This poll suggests that No are in the lead but that the race is far from over. ‘No-one can afford a protest vote. Any one of us could cast the vote that makes the difference between the UK staying together or breaking apart. ‘This week employers and retailers have set out the real economic costs of separation. They have made it clear that jobs will be lost and that prices will rise if there is a yes vote. ‘When we can have better, safer, faster change as part of the UK, why should we risk the costs of separation.’ A Yes Scotland spokesman said: ‘This poll records support for Yes at 46.5 per cent, and an ICM poll conducted around the same time put Yes at 49 per cent. There is everything to play for, and this will spur on everybody who wants and is working hard for a Yes to redouble their efforts. 'As we say in response to all the polls, we are working flat out to ensure that we achieve a Yes vote, because it's the biggest opportunity the people of Scotland will ever have to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy. 'A Yes vote is our one opportunity to achieve job-creating powers, protect our NHS from the damaging impact of Westminster privatisation and cuts, and ensure that never again do we get Tory governments imposed on Scotland that we have roundly rejected.' The poll will be a bitter blow for Mr Salmond, who was today forced to deny he is plotting a ’day of reckoning’ against businesses opposed to his dream of independence. The First Minster scrambled to reassure banks, oil companies, supermarkets and retailers after SNP grandee Jim Sillars said an independent Scotland would break up or nationalise pro-Union firms. With just five days to go until the historic referendum, Mr Salmond has faced a wave of warnings from companies that they will move jobs out of Scotland or put up prices if voters back the breakup of the UK. Mr Sillars, a former deputy leader of the SNP who appeared campaigning with Mr Salmond last week, lashed out after a host of companies including BP, John Lewis, Asda, Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone RBS, Lloyds and B&Q warned of the dangers of independence. Retailers ASDA and John Lewis have warned of price rises if Scotland becomes independent, while Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone RBS, Lloyds and B&Q have all warned of dangers . The Royal Bank of Scotland also announced this week that it will move its headquarters to England if Mr Salmond manages to secure independence . More than £17billion in shares in Scottish firms have been dumped by investors in recent weeks and when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, the pound tumbled to a 10-month low. Mr Sillars retaliated by saying that oil giant BP would be nationalised 'in part or in whole', while bankers and 'scaremongering' big business chiefs would be punished for 'being in cahoots' with the Tories. He added: ’This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.’ The incendiary remark threatened to overshadow the last weekend of campaigning ahead of the referendum on Thursday. The Lib Dems claimed ’intimidation is the tactic of choice’ for the Yes campaign. In an attempt to quell the deeply damaging row, Mr Salmond today rushed out a statement attempting to reassure businesses they have nothing to fear if Scotland goes it alone. Mr Salmond said: ’Jim Sillars is a great campaigner who has put aside his personal grief over the loss of his wife Margo MacDonald to put his heart and soul into galvanising the Yes vote. ’He is fighting a fine campaign all over Scotland - but the day after a Yes vote will be a day of celebration for the people, not reckoning for big companies drawn into the No campaign by Downing Street.’ He added that Mr Sillars was ’simply trying to express the anger felt by so many people about the revelations that some supermarket statements were orchestrated by the Prime Minister himself’. Better Together insiders say the biggest battle is being fought in the west of Scotland, where Labour has launched a massive operation to stop its working class supporters from backing independence. Senior Tories say almost all of their supporters are committed to vote No and it is down to Labour to secure their base. Support for the Yes campaign is highest among the 35-44 aged group, while those aged 65+ are most likely to vote against independence . In Glasgow former Labour home secretary John Reid joined Labour MP Jim Murphy for the conclusion of his 100 Meetings in 100 Days tour of Scotland. Since June Mr Murphy has been travelling across the country and speaking to voters in town centres from atop an IRN-BRU crate to urge a No vote. Hundreds of people gathered on Sauchiehall Street with Love Scotland, Vote No placards . Mr Murphy said: ’I've lost most of my voice but I don't think we've lost the argument. ’The nearer it gets, a lot of the undecided voters have looked into the precipice and they've stepped back.’ Mr Reid said: ’The arguments are coming down to two very simple questions. ’Do you want to retain Scotland's history, culture, control over its own affairs within a bigger state that allows us financial stability, economic growth and and the best of both worlds? ’Or do you want to go a separate route with all the dangers, which are now becoming obvious, to pensions, jobs, investment and security?’ As part of the Labour push, former prime minster Gordon Brown used a SPCA at an event in Kirkcaldy to say: ’I yield to no one in my patriotism and my pride in Scotland. ’None of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes no is less patriotic and less proud of our country. ’We are patriotic Scots. We've got a patriotic vision for the future. We're proud of our institutions. We're patriotic, we're proud of Scotland.’","Survation survey says 54% plan to vote No with only 46% backing Yes .

"Fiona O'Loughlin has been bullied by Internet trolls who are ridiculing her for her history of alcoholism, after the comedienne criticised Adam Hills for posting grieving tweets after Joan Rivers' death. O’Loughlin reveals she was told to ‘drop dead’ and get ‘back on the booze train’ by trolls. Ms O'Loughlin blasted Adam on social media for 'boarding the grief train' two weeks ago, after Hills paid his respects, sending sad tweets to pay tribute to the late Joan Rivers. Hills' infamously called Joan Rivers a 'd***' and yelled 'f*** you!' during a heated monologue on his television show, The Last Leg, last year. Scoll down for video . A still from the heated rant Adam Hills made last year on his television show, The Last Leg, in which he took the late Joan Rivers to task for being 'a d***' and a 'jaded, bitter old mole' Joan Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81, after complications during a routine throat procedure. River's passing has been met with an outpouring of grief and emotion worldwide . Fellow Aussie stand-up comic O'Loughlin is now apologising to Hills for her comments. She has also taken to the Internet to expose the relentless abuse she has received from online trolls since she made the comments. On September 9, she first made mention of being bombarded by insulting comments. 'Why can't anyone troll me without mentioning my alcoholism? It's a disease you twats & I'm the first to admit I've got it.' Hills expressed his concern when it was announced that Joan Rivers was in an induced coma via this message on his Twitter account on August 28. The Aussie comedian again used social media to publically share his opinion of Joan Rivers. Although, this time round, Hills approach was to celebrate her contribution to comedy . Fiona O'Loughlin took to Twitter to publically try and put Adam Hills in his place, after he posted two emotional tweets about the late Joan Rivers. Adam Hills gave a raging two-minute monologue directed at Joan Rivers during his show The Last Leg last year . In a Facebook post that has since been deleted, O'Loughlin allegedly acknowledged that during her battle with the bottle, Adam Hills' former tv show, Spicks and Specks, were supportive and tolerant. 'I’m embarrassed to complain because the industry has been so kind and forgiving. 'Ironically in particular by Adam Hills and the crew on more than one occasion by showing me nothing but concern and kindness having turned up drunk to the recording of the show,' according to news.com.au. O'Loughlin then pays tribute to the late Joan Rivers, who passed away 10 days ago. 'What I know is that Joan Rivers could have wiped the floor with me with stories of hardship. 'Her husband suicided and she had no choice but to get up on that stage.' Aussie comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has taken to Twitter, criticising Adam Hills for 'jumping on the grief train', considering Hills so publically slammed Joan Rivers for her behaviour and attitude last year. The former alcoholic has been honest about her struggles with the disease and has been sober since 2008, so is hurt by the cruel comments from strangers. 'The only condemnation I don’t accept this week has been cracks about my addiction. Because it’s a sexist double-standard I don’t accept and will always fight. 'Robin Williams, Billy Connelly, Barry Humphries to name a few all suffered the same affliction but it is rarely mentioned in a negative way, as a woman it has much darker and hurtful connotations.' Standing up to online trolls is likely to be an important issue for the comedienne who was a close friend of the late Charlotte Dawson. The two hilarious women starred on The Celebrity Apprentice together in 2012. Charlotte Dawson spoke out frequently about how damaging negative comments online can be for everyone, making a point of tracking down and shaming Twitter trolls who had told her to kill herself. Dawson reached out to O'Loughlin to see if she was okay, only two weeks before taking taking her own life in February this year, O'Loughlin revealed in an interview with news.com.au. Adam Hills has not publically responded to any of Fiona O'Loughlin's comments. Adam Hills is yet to respond to O'Loughlin's comments. Adam Hills' comments were made in March 2013 on his Channel 4 program, The Last Leg, during a segment in which he rants about what is annoying him in the world that week. Hills angry tirade went viral, in which he told Rivers 'f*** you' and to 'get a plastic surgeon to grow yourself a new soul' Adam Hills took offence to the comments Joan Rivers made about Brit pop star Adele, in which Rivers made jokes about Adele's weight .","Fiona O'Loughlin says Twitter users are bullying her about her alcoholism .

Brian Kandare, 32, and Precious, 36, charged with daughter Rebecca's murder, appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court . Despite attempts to save her, Rebecca, who suffered from rickets, died from pneumonia as a result of severe malnourishment. Her parents were arrested at the time and later bailed. But yesterday, West Midlands Police announced the pair had been charged with Rebecca's murder. And today, the parents appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court. The couple were kept in custody after a brief hearing and are due at the city's Crown Court on Monday. Baby Rebecca was rushed to New Cross Hospital, in Wolverhampton, from her home on January 6 this year . Earlier this year, Wolverhampton City Council said the child was not known to social care services. At that time, residents in Park Village spoke of their shock at the baby's death. Phil Yates, who has lived in the area for 35 years, said: 'It's a shock and sad to hear.' Another woman who has lived in the area for 37 years added: 'It's a huge shock, terrible news. Some parts of Park Village are quiet and others are like a war zone but not all people here are bad.' Councillor for Park Village, Milkinder Jaspal, said: 'This is disturbing news for the community and for people living in the rest of the city.'

"The New York State Department of Health said Friday over twelve children in New York have enterovirus D68. 'Cases have been confirmed in the Capital Region and Central New York,' the health department said in a news release. It also revealed there may be even more people affected, admitting that 'more samples from around the state are on their way to the New York State Department of Health's (DOH) Wadsworth Laboratory for testing.' 'EV-D68 is causing cases of severe respiratory illness among children and other individuals, sometimes resulting in hospitalization, especially among children with asthma,' the health department said. The New York State Department of Health said Friday over twelve children in New York have enterovirus D68, which usually causes illness lasting about a week with no lasting problems . The Acting State Health Commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, said in the release 'It is important that we follow common sense rules to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for flu and other contagious illnesses. Because there is no specific treatment or vaccination against this virus, our best defense is to prevent it by practicing proper hygiene.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that 'From mid-August to September 12, 2014, a total of 97 people in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri have been confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.' Nearly 500 children have been treated at one hospital alone - Children's Mercy in Kansas City, Missouri - and some required intensive care, according to authorities. The suspected germ, enterovirus 68, is an uncommon strain of a very common family of viruses that typically hit from summertime through autumn. The virus can cause mild coldlike symptoms including runny noses, coughing and wheezing but Mark Pallansch, director of the viral diseases division at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press this summer's cases are unusually severe and include serious breathing problems. 'It's not highly unusual but we're trying to understand what happened this year in terms of these noticeable and much larger clusters of severe respiratory disease,' Pallansch said Monday. The virus typically causes illness lasting about a week and most children recover with no lasting problems. What can I do? The CDC has published this infographic to help prevent the spread of EV-D68 . The CDC (pictured) has said 'a total of 97 people in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri have been confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68' The CDC's Dr. Anne Schuchat said at a Monday news briefing that there are other viruses making kids sick. 'Most of the runny noses out there are not going to be turning into this,' she said. Children with asthma and other health problems are especially at risk for the enterovirus, but reported cases include children without asthma who have developed asthmalike breathing problems, Pallansch said. He said no deaths have been reported in the outbreak. Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, director of infectious diseases at Children's Mercy, said local cases began appearing in mid-August and they appear to have peaked in her area. Schuchat said the strain involved also appeared in the United States last year and in specimens from other countries. She said the CDC learned it had reappeared in this country last month when authorities in Chicago and Kansas City notified the agency about severe illnesses in children who had to be hospitalized. In the Denver area, more than 900 children were treated for severe respiratory illnesses at Children's Hospital Colorado and its urgent care locations and 86 were hospitalized in recent weeks. The University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital has treated several cases, including extremely sick children requiring life-support machines, said Dr. Rachel Wolfson, an intensive care unit physician. Affected children are 'as small as infants all the way up to teenagers,' Wolfson said. The virus can spread through sneezing and experts say good hand-washing practices are important to curb transmission. 'The take-home point is wash your hands and keep your hands away from your face,' Wolfson said.","Over twelve children in New York have enterovirus D68, or EV-D68, the New York State Department of Health said Friday .

"Lord Hill has been criticised after taking severance pay before landing a highly-paid position . The ex-Tory cabinet minister named as Britain’s new man in Brussels has been accused of ‘pure greed’ – for taking a £25,000 ministerial pay-off ahead of a huge pay rise for his new job. Lord Hill of Oareford was last week formally nominated as European Commissioner for Financial Services on an expected annual salary of almost £200,000 – double the pay of his previous job in David Cameron’s Cabinet. But Government insiders have confirmed that the Tory peer – a friend of the Prime Minister – had also taken £25,260 in ‘severance pay’ when he stood down as Leader of the House of Lords in July. And last night, Labour MP John Mann branded it ‘pure greed’ and challenged Lord Hill, whose job will include ensuring the EU’s financial stability, to repay the money. Mr Mann said: ‘This pay-off is totally unjustifiable, especially given the scale of his new salary in Brussels and all the perks attached to it. 'Lord Hill is certainly looking after his own financial stability – at the expense of the British taxpayer. ‘Whether he is technically entitled to this money or not, I think he should pay it all back.’ Former lobbyist Lord Hill, 54, was a surprise choice to be the UK’s new European Commissioner in July as just three weeks earlier he had insisted he did not want the job and preferred to live in Britain. There were also concerns that he was not a big enough figure to guarantee the UK a major portfolio in Brussels amid reports that Jean-Claude Juncker, the new European Commission president, resorted to Google to find out who he was. Two years ago, there were claims that Lord Hill had actually tried to resign as an education minister, only for Mr Cameron not to realise that he was trying to quit and tell him to carry on with his good work. But last week, Mr Juncker nominated him for the coveted financial services brief on the Commission – potentially a key role in preventing Brussels from imposing damaging new rules on the City of London. The job, to be confirmed later this autumn, comes with a salary of just under £200,000 – almost twice his Lords’ Leader salary of £101,000. Two years ago, there were claims that Lord Hill (right) had actually tried to resign as an education minister, only for Mr Cameron not to realise that he was trying to quit and tell him to carry on . As a new commissioner, he will also be entitled to an ‘installation allowance’ of £33,000, plus reimbursements of his moving expenses and travel costs to Brussels. Last night, a spokesman for Lord Hill defended the pay-off, pointing out that until he was confirmed as European Commissioner, he was not receiving a salary. The spokesman said: ‘Like all Ministers who leave the Government, Lord Hill received three months’ severance pay in mid-July. He has not received any salary since then.He will only receive a European Commission salary once the new Commission is formed. This is not expected to be until November 1, at the earliest.’ Since his nomination, Lord Hill – a former political secretary to Prime Minister John Major – has announced he would sell his shares in public relations firm Huntsworth to avoid a potential conflict of interest. The firm represents some of Europe’s biggest companies and also does media work for the European Commission.","Lord Hill took £25,260 after stepping down as Leader of the House of Lords .

"The doctor in charge of the endoscopy that led to Joan Rivers' death once operated on an elderly patient without his informed consent. The 93-year-old patient lost his 2004 medical malpractice suit against Dr. Lawrence Cohen, his attorneys admitted. However, his attorneys also claim there were similarities between that procedure and Rivers' operation. The doctor in charge of the endoscopy that led to Joan Rivers' death once operated on an elderly patient without his informed consent . The 93-year-old patient lost his 2004 medical malpractice suit against Dr. Lawrence Cohen, his attorneys admitted . Rivers died Sept. 4 at Mount Sinai . Hospital, a week after going into cardiac arrest. The sharp-tongued . comedian, talk show host and fashionista was 81. The New York Post reports that Yorkville Endoscopy spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz denies similarities between those two procedures. She added that the 2004 patient, Dr. David Lehr, went into surgery as 'an emergency, not an elective, as Ms. Rivers' was.' Lehr's attorneys, Denise Rubin and Cheryl Harris, shot back that the 'characterization of Dr. Lehr's procedure as being being an emergency is at odds with the hospital record and testimony.' Lehr's attorney claims he was put under before he was able to tell doctors he'd had two meals earlier that day. That caused him to vomit, and later develop severe pneumonia. Cohen is no longer the Yorkville Endoscopy facility's medical director, nor is he performing procedures there . 'As a . result the previously vital and active 93-year-old retired physician . who was still involved in scholarly writing was rendered a homebound . invalid for the rest of his life,' doctors said.

Just over two decades earlier, Thompson appeared more like a conquering hero after he docked his ship in Norfolk, Virginia, weighed down with thousands of pounds of gold that had sat on the bottom of the ocean for 131 years. The gold remains of a wooden cargo box unearthed from the SS Central America are shown at a coin collection expo in Long Beach, California. The gold was unearthed  after treasure hunter Tommy Thompson found the ship in 1988 . Thompson holds a $50 pioneer gold piece retrieved from the wreck of the gold ship in a photo from 1989. He led a group that recovered millions of dollars worth of sunken treasure only to end up involved in court cases brought by dozens of insurance companies laying claim to the treasure . Hundreds cheered his achievement on that day in 1989, but it wasn't long before companies claiming they had originally insured the gold sued him claiming it was all theirs, according to the AP. And eventually the investors who poured $12.7 million into his expedition along with his crew were demanding their shares too. It soon became too much for Thompson, it seems, and he vanished without a trace two years ago after skipping a court date to explain to investors what had happened. Since then the U.S. Marshals Service has hunted Thompson as a fugitive. 'I think he had calculated it, whatever you want to call it, an escape plan,' Marshals agent Brad Fleming told the AP. 'I think he's had that for a long time.' Thompson's adventure started in 1983 when he began to grow obsessed about tracking down the SS Central America, which carried 425 people and gold worth hundreds of millions millions of dollars when it was lost in a hurricane in 1857 off the coast of South Carolina. An oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Thompson convinced 161 people to invest in his quest and eventually found his treasure on October 1, 1988. He later described it as 'otherworldly in its splendor'. Not long after, 39 companies claimed they had insured the gold back in 1857 and that it belonged to them, suing him for their right to the treasure, the AP reported. U.S. Marshal Brad Fleming in May displays a wanted poster for fugitive Tommy Thompson in Columbus, Ohio . This undated drawing made available by the Library of Congress shows the U.S. Mail ship SS Central America, which sank after sailing into a hurricane in September 1857 in one of the worst maritime disasters in American history; 425 people were killed and thousands of pounds of gold sank with it to the bottom of the ocean . In 1996, Thompson's company was awarded 92 per cent of the treasure, with the rest divided among some of the insurers. Four years later, Thompson's company made $50 million selling 532 gold bars and thousands of coins to a gold marketing group. But Thompson still hadn't paid his investors. Two of them - a now-deceased investment firm president who invested $250,000 and the Dispatch Printing Company, which put in about $1 million - sued in 2005. And the following year, nine members of Thompson's crew piled on their own lawsuit, claiming they were promised some of the proceeds. After that Thompson sank into seclusion and moved into a mansion in Vero Beach, Florida. He said he feared for his life. Thompson, left, stands at the helm of the Arctic Explorer as Bob Evans, center, and Barry Schatz look on in Norfolk, Virginia, 1991 . In this 2003 photo provided by Odyssey Marine Exploration, the company's eight-ton remotely operated vehicle, named Zeus, is launched for a descent to the ocean floor from the ship Odyssey Explorer about 100 miles off the coast of Georgia. The Florida based company used the vehicle to recover gold bars and coins from the wreck of the SS Central America . He refused to use his real name on utility bills and told realtor Vance Brinkerhoff that he had been threatened, the AP reported. 'How would you like to live like that?' Brinkerhoff recounted  Thompson asking him in a court deposition. It isn't clear when precisely Thompson disappeared. On August 13, 2012, he failed to appear at the court hearing, and a federal judge ordered him found in contempt and issued an arrest warrant. James Kennedy, the maintenance worker who last saw Thompson, soon after that he went inside the mansion and found prepaid disposable cellphones and bank wraps for $10,000 bills, along with a book called 'How to Live Your Life Invisible'. The Marshals Service, which splashed Thompson's face on billboards, ran down hundreds of potential leads, including one from a guy who thought he shared an elevator with him and another that suggested the treasure hunter signed his name on a memorial website for a dead friend. This 1989 file photo shows gold bars and coins from the  Central America. Columbus-America Discovery Group, owned by Thompson, has argued that it has the exclusive rights to the treasure from the shipwreck . Assorted gold bars recovered from the Central America are shown at a coin collection expo in Long Beach, California . Nothing panned out. Now a 'wanted' poster hangs inside a barge that repeated Thompson's voyage and has since Apirl been busily pulling millions of dollars in gold and silver bars and coins from the Central America, known as the 'Ship of Gold'. Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration will continue the work indefinitely, and Thompson's original investors are expected to receive a share of the recovered riches, according to the AP. to Central America now in search of the 'Ship of Gold'. There are many theories as to where Thompson, now 62, might be. Mike Szolosi, the crew members' attorney, argues that he has seen records indicating Thompson grabbed 500 gold coins worth $2 million and potentially millions more from his company, Columbus-America Discovery Group. 'Presumably all of that is still somewhere with Tommy,' he said. Attorney Rick Roble, who defended Thompson's company until he withdrew from the case last month, said there's no proof Thompson stole anything. Author Gary Kinder, who chronicled the treasure hunt in 'Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,' said nothing in his time with Thompson gives him any insight into his whereabouts. 'I don't know what it would entail to hide like that,' he said. 'Get your teeth fixed? Buy a blond wig?' Agent Fleming believes Thompson is likely still in the U.S. If caught, Thompson would be asked to account for the missing coins and explain where proceeds from the treasure's sale went. He could face jail time and hefty fines if he refuses. Gil Kirk, a former director of one of Thompson's companies, said he put $1.8 million into the treasure hunt. Though he hasn't gotten any of that back, Kirk still supports Thompson and insists he never bilked anyone. To Kirk, Thompson remains an American hero, 'like the Wright brothers.' The tragedy, he said, is that Thompson's dream became his doom. 'Tommy used the word, what's the word?' Kirk said. 'Plague of the gold.' Thompson, right, talks with Bob Evans on the Arctic Discover in 1991. Thomson hasn't been seen in more than two years since he missed a court hearing and vanished .

"They say good looks run in the family and the Le Bons proved that as they took to Gyunel's catwalk last night. Yasmin and Amber, the mother daughter duo whose good looks have made them world famous, opened the Azerbaijan designer's SS15 show at the Bloomsbury ballroom yesterday evening. Watched from the front row by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Roxie Nafousi, Rosie Fortescue, Lilah Parsons and Donna Air, the 49-year-old catwalk stalwart and her 25-year-old daughter were the perfect fit for the show, which aimed to convey a strong and adventurous woman. Scroll down for video . Two of a kind: Amber (left) and Yasmin (right) appeared as a mother/daughter duo at last night's Gyunel show . The collection told the story of a nomadic traveler traversing the desert and shirt dresses, relaxed blouses and flowing maxis were appropriately emblazoned with scorpions, a symbol inspired by Gyunel Rustamova's Zodiac sign. Hair too, created by Wella's team of stylists, was braided across the face to depict a scorpion – sounds creepy, looked cool (even Millie Mackintosh was coveting the look). Gowns in midnight blue, maroon and beige were juxtaposed with sculpted separates, reinventing that much-loved sportsluxe vibe for SS15, while layers of crochet and leather gave the collection a tough edge. She's still got it! Yasmin Le Bon is 49-years-old but gave the young 20 something models a run for their money . Yasmin, 29, proved that good looks do run in the family as she joined her mother on the catwalk . The designer, who studied Economics before finding her calling at Central Saint Martins, also worked as an artist - a talent and passion that didn't go amiss on last night's catwalk. Leather trousers and soft leather jackets in titian orange and brittle green were given an artistic edge, while chunky gold and silver jewellery adorned model's arms and necks. 'I like to think of the Gyunel woman as a nomadic traveler with a strong adventurous attitude,' said the Baku-born designer. 'I was inspired by the idea of journeys through places steeped in culture and the creatures that inhabit them.'

"Officials in Montgomery County, Texas, said they stand by the child abuse charges they filed against Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, arguing the injuries to his four-year-old son exceeded normal disciplinary measures. Peterson, 29, surrendered to authorities early Saturday after flying to Texas from Minnesota and was released after posting a $15,000 bond. 'Obviously parents have a right to discipline their children, except when that discipline exceeds what the community thinks is reasonable,' assistant district Attorney Phil Grant told the Houston Chronicle on Saturday. 'It wasn't that he just used a switch.'. Scroll down for video . Indicted: Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson, smiling in this booking photo, reportedly admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping' These pictures show the cuts and bruises on the four-year-old's arm that Peterson is said to have caused by using a leafless tree branch . The grand jury, which indicted Peterson on Friday for reckless or negligent injury to a child, concluded that the incident was 'unreasonable discipline'. Meanwhile the NFL, which is reeling from its second public outcry about player misconduct in as many weeks, said Peterson would be disciplined under the league's personal-conduct policy. The Vikings said he wouldn't be playing in Sunday's game against the New England Patriots and that it is reviewing the matter. The 2012 NFL MVP admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping' last May with a switch - a term he used to describe a leafless tree branch - on two occasions as a form of punishment while the boy was visiting him in Houston. A copy of the indictment issued by the grand jury accusing Peterson of reckless or negligent injury to a child . Peterson said the boy pushed another one of his children off a motorbike video game they were playing. The player then grabbed a tree branch, removed its leaves and struck the child repeatedly, leaving cuts and bruises over many parts of his body, including on his buttocks, legs and scrotum. He then reportedly texted the boy's mother about the incident, saying that one wound in particular would make her 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch,' according to CBS. In further text messages, the football star said he 'felt bad after the fact when I notice the switch was wrapping around hitting i (sic) thigh' and that he “got him in nuts once I noticed. But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!' He also texted the boy's mother: 'Never do I go overboard! But all my kids will know, hey daddy has the biggie heart but don’t play no games when it comes to acting right.' The child offered police a different version of events, telling them Peterson hit him on the face and that he feared further punishment for talking to the authorities about what happened. This is Peterson's home, where he admitted to beating his son with a 'switch' for punishment for misbehavior . He said that he had been hit by a belt and that 'there are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.' The boy also said that Peterson put leaves in his mouth when he was being hit with the switch while his pants were down and told his mother that his dad 'likes belts and switches' and 'has a whooping room.' Peterson's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said Peterson is cooperating fully with investigators. 'Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son,' according to a statement from Hardin. 'He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.' The statement adds that Peterson 'deeply regrets the unintentional injury'. A grand jury indicted Vikings running back Adrian Peterson for reckless or negligent injury to a child, and a warrant was issued for his arrest . In fact, Peterson didn't think there was anything wrong with his actions when he was interviewed by police, telling them he only used 'whoopings' or spankings as a last result. When asked if some of the marks on the boy's body were from an extension cord, he said 'Oh, no, I’d never hit my child with an extension cord. I remember how it feels to get whooped with an extension cord. I’d never do that', CBS reported. After Peterson's four-year-old boy returned home to Minnesota, his mother took him to a doctor, who found a number of lacerations on this thighs, bruise-like marks on his lower back and buttocks and cuts on his hand. Tyrese Ruffin, pictured above, died last October in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Peterson, who is his biological father, only learned about him two months earlier . Joseph Patterson, the boyfriend of Tyrese's mother at the time of his death, is accused of second-degree murder. His trial is set for October . A police report obtained by a radio affiliate of CBS said the boy told the doctor that Peterson had hit him with a branch from a tree. A doctor describes some of the marks as open wounds and called it 'child abuse'. Another agreed and called the cuts 'extensive'. Peterson told investigators when they questioned him that he regarded the incident as a normal spanking and not excessive. A grand jury held in the summer had declined to charge him. A new one was impaneled in Montgomery County, Texas, and decided to pursue the indictment. In a statement, the Vikings said it was deactivating Peterson for this Sunday's home game against the New England Patriots. Peterson had plenty of fans and detractors on Twitter. Some thought what he did was nothing out of the ordinary. Others were less than kind. Another fan noted on Twitter that Peterson's image is featured on the tickets for the game this weekend, even though he won't be playing in it. The incident comes just 11 months after another son of Peterson's, Tyrese Ruffin, died in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after allegedly being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother. Peterson only learned about the two-year-old's existence two months before his death. Joseph Patterson faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault, and the trial is scheduled to begin next month. In July, Patterson pleaded not guilty to a second charge of assaulting Tyrese's mother  and holding her against her will for more than an hour. Peterson reportedly has had seven children, including Tyrese and the four-year-old. Erica Syion, a former dancer from Dallas and mother of one Peterson's kids,  said in October that her son knows of 'four other brothers and sisters' but the total number of children remains unclear.","Montgomery County, Texas, officials say the injuries to Peterson's four-year-old son exceeded what can be deemed normal discipline .

"The world's smallest water lily, which was narrowly saved from extinction by experts, has been plucked from Kew Gardens by green-fingered thieves. Known by Kew botanists as the ‘pygmy Rwandan water lily’, the invaluable and extremely rare tiny Nymphaea Thermarum was taken from a green house on Thursday. The specimen, which has flowers smaller than a pound coin and pads just a fraction larger, was wrenched or dug out of its shallow pond in the Prince of Wales Conservatory. The world's smallest water lily has been plucked from Kew Gardens by green-fingered thieves . The horticultural heist took place some time between 8am and 3pm in an area hidden from CCTV. The plant was saved from extinction in 2009 when the Kew team nurtured a new generation of plants from seed. The gardens in Richmond, Surrey, are one of just two locations in the world where the bog-loving plant is grown after it completely disappeared in the wild. It only grows in damp mud rather than water. Richard Barley, Director of Kew Gardens’ Horticulture, said: 'You can’t put a price on it by virtue of its rarity. 'One can’t go down to the local garden centre and buy another one.' Kew Gardens are keeping an open mind who the thief could be, but Mr Barley said: 'The plant was taken when we were open, so it is likely that it was a member of public. 'Someone took the plant when no-one was in the area, although unfortunately there was no CCTV watching them. Known by Kew botanists as the ¿pygmy Rwandan water lily¿, the invaluable and extremely rare tiny Nymphaea Thermarum was taken from a green house on Thursday . 'Our staff are dedicated to the conservation of plants and when incidents of this nature occur it is a blow to morale. 'We take theft of our invaluable scientific collection of plants very seriously and this matter is with the Metropolitan Police.' For years Kew Gardens has battled with plant enthusiasts who take cuttings from the rare and important plants to grow at home. Mr Barley said: 'Any person who unlawfully removes plant material from the gardens is a serious problem. 'The plants we have here at Kew are here for special conservation purposes and are of scientific value. 'Of course they are also here for the enjoyment of our visitors and it it not something we take lightly. 'The plants that Kew holds are of high conservation value so the message is clear, that this is something that we are seeking to prevent.' The 'thermal' water lily, which grew around freshwater hot springs, was discovered in 1987 by German botanist Professor Eberhard Fischer and was found in just one location in Mashyuza, in southwest Rwanda. Police officers investigating the theft have been told by experts at Kew Gardens, in Richmond pictured, that the plant would have had to have been dug or pulled up from the shallow pond in the Prince of Wales Conservatory . It disappeared in the wild two years ago due to over-exploitation of the hot spring that fed this fragile habitat. Mr Barley added: 'It’s a plant that was once thought to have disappeared. 'A small number were found again in one location in Rwanda, but they completely disappeared from that location a couple of years ago. 'There were 30 of the plants on display in the conservatory at the time, but the material that’s held at Kew and at a botanical garden in Germany is all there is in the world.' Police have launched an investigation into the theft and appealed for the public’s help in tracing the lily’s whereabouts. A Scotland Yard spokesperson: 'At some time between 8.30am and 2.55pm on Thursday, 9 January a ‘Nymphaea Thermarum’ was stolen from the Princess of Wales Conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. 'Officers have been informed that the plant would have had to have been dug, or pulled up, from a shallow water lily pond. 'Anyone with information is asked to contact the CID on Richmond-Upon-Thames Borough on 020 8721 5934.'","The world's smallest water lily was narrowly saved from extinction by experts at Kew Gardens in Richmond in 2009 .

"Chris Noble was remembered at a packed service today in his home town in country NSW . A man who died when a convenience store exploded, destroying his unit block above, texted his mother 'I love you' around the exact time the blast went off. At 4.08am on Thursday September 4, 27-year-old Chris Noble reached for his phone at his Rozelle unit in Sydney and sent a  final message to Liz Noble. Speaking at a packed memorial service for her son at Canowindra, in central west NSW, his emotional mother read the contents of his final text message  which stated that he loved her. 'The last thing he (Chris) ever did was send a message at eight minutes past four on the morning of Thursday September 4 saying ""I love you."" A timeline of events suggest the message was sent minutes after the building caught fire at 4.05am - and just 25 minutes before both the convenience store and unit block were reduced to rubble when it collapsed. The refrigeration mechanic was one of three who died in the  fire, including a mother and her one-year-old son. Chris' father Ross Noble said his son would leave an everlasting 'legacy' on the people he knew . Chris' family farewell him at Canowindra, central west NSW, where his mother spoke of his last message he sent to her . Police are still determining the cause of the blaze which one officer said was 'the worst he'd seen' and have not ruled out the likelihood it was deliberately started. Leichhardt Local Area Command Inspector Gary Coffey said the 'very traumatic incident' had taken an emotional toll on his officers. 'This is certainly the worst tragedy that I've had to deal with,' he said. 'It's a very difficult time for the police, particularly for the young police involved in this matter.' Speaking at the country NSW service in front of 1000 people Chris' father Ross Noble said his son would leave an everlasting 'legacy' on the people he knew. He said he loved living in Sydney and was excited by the opportunities big city life offered him. He said the 27-year-old - who had a passion for both rugby union and American Football - enjoyed living near the central business district because it was 'close to the action.' Mourners gathered and wept for the well-liked 27-year-old refrigeration mechanic . Chris may have sent his final text to his mother while trying to escape the crumbling building . 'He would have been chuffed about the fuss being made about him today and all the messages we've received and the number of people here has given the family strength.' 'We will miss Chris so much but he has a legacy that forever will be entrenched in our hearts and minds.' Mr Noble frequently travelled from Sydney to Canowindra and would play for the local Rugby Union Club, the Canowindra Pythons, three games a season. A shaken friend and coach of his rugby team earlier delivered a statement paying tribute to the 27-year-old. 'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Graham Rice said. The Rozelle fire in Sydney's inner west killed three people including a one-year-old baby . Roommates of Chris Noble  told of how they escaped the fiery inferno and when they last heard the voice of the 27-year-old. Todd Fisher and Corey Cameron were the two men who leapt from the second storey balcony of a Darling Street apartment, which was above a convenience store. 'It was just a huge bang, you wake up and the ceiling is already gone,' Mr Cameron told The Saturday Telegraph. 'It was like a movie, the floors were falling in behind us, the walls were caving in, the roof was gone, smoke everywhere. 'I could just hear Chris say 'I'm coming, I'm coming.' The pair said they had tried to re-enter the building when they heard their friend's voice but could not see past the flames.","Chris Noble sent his mother a message at 4.08am - three minutes after the Rozelle convenience store exploded .

"Comedian Rowan Atkinson crashed out of a classic car race at Goodwood today after a head-on collision with a fellow motorist. The 59-year-old careered his blue Ford Falcon Sprint into the front of another car during the Shelby Cup, a one-off race which marks 60 years of the small-block V8 engine. According to the Telegraph, the carnage began when a fellow competitor, who was driving two in front of Atkinson, lost control of their car and spun off the tracks. Scroll down for video . Rowan Atkinson, 59, pictured in his blue Ford Falcon Sprint, before crashing it during the Shelby Cup at Goodwood Revival earlier this afternoon . It caused the next car in line to swerve on the tracks, to avoid crashing into the stricken vehicle. But Atkinson, who was not far behind, could do little to stop his own vintage Ford hitting the crashed car head-on. The actor, best known for his role in Mr Bean, then abandoned his vehicle, but luckily did not sustain any injuries. A Goodwood regular, Atkinson is frequently pictured at the race track during its renowned festivals. He is a classic car fanatic and his impressive collection of vehicles includes a Honda NSX, a Jaguar Mk7, an Aston Martin DB2, a 1939 BMW 328 and a Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe. But it is not the first time that one of Atkinson's prized cars has been involved in a collision. Atkinson, pictured in June this year, has a fleet of impressive supercars, including this Mercedes SLS AMG supercar . The Blackadder star - said to be worth £71million - famously crashed his McClaren F1 into a tree in 2011, after losing control of the 240mph car. It veered off a slippery section of the A605 near Peterborough, hitting a tree and bursting into flames. Atkinson escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder but his vehicle – one of only 64 models in the world – was a virtual write-off. Most of the back of the car was destroyed while the 6.1litre engine ended up 20 yards away. Atkinson is a regular at Goodwood, which played host to the Revival festival, pictured, this weekend . Afterwards, he successfully claimed £910,000 from his insurers to fix the supercar – the highest repair bill ever recorded in Britain. His insurers spent almost eight months considering the claim, before agreeing the massive payout following more than a year of specialist repairs at McLaren's base in Woking, Surrey. Earlier this year, Atkinson helped to save a McLaren F1 driver's life following a horror crash in Tuscany. The British actor was one of the first to come to the wealthy American businessman's aid after he smashed his 240mph 6.1-litre engine sports car into a tree in central Italy. The actor's fascination with classic cars is a far cry from the interests of Mr Bean, the character for which he is most famous . The driver lost control of the vehicle, before careering off the road and crashing into the tree in a nearby olive grove. Atkinson, who had been part of a convoy of motoring enthusiasts driving their McLaren F1s through the Tuscan countryside, immediately rushed to the businessman's aid. He was also photographed picking up pieces of debris from the sports car, which was completely destroyed after flipping on to its roof. Goodwood Revival carries on until Sunday evening. Among the racing legends, the other famous faces taking to the track over the weekend include TV chef James Martin.","Comedian, 59, careered his blue Ford Falcon Sprint into back of another car .

"It's not everyday you stumble across a three-storey house  built entirely from a stack of shipping containers. But in the Brisbane suburb of Graceville, 8km south west of the city, that's exactly what you'll find. The three-storey home designed by Australian builder Todd Miller comprises of 31 strategically placed containers filled with all the essential items of any home, plus a whole host of extras. Miller, of ZieglerBuild, describes the  three-storey structure as the 'first of its kind' in Australia and has been built out of brand new, not recycled, containers. It contains four bedrooms positioned over three levels, with the top floor completely dedicated to the master bedroom. It is Built over 706 square metres and is possibly the most innovative of its kind in the country - with only one other residential property like it in Australia. Standing among a row of quiet, contemporary  properties at  Jaora St, Graceville, it features a mezzanine reading room, a pull out queen wall bed in the rumpus room, an art study, workshop, gym space, water tank and saltwater pool. The only other house which rivals it has been built from five containers, and is located on just a quarter the size of the land. The home is built to flood regulations and will be auctioned on site on December 1. Mr Miller said it was the 'hardest house he has ever built.' 'The reason it was so hard is that every single thing I did I had to think of.' 'Normally you can just go and grab a pair of stairs from a steel company and whack it on the front of the house and you're done.' 'But everything I did it was actually very taxing.'

"With the Olive Garden's sales drooping like an overcooked noodle, one activist investor has released a savage analysis taking the chain to task for wasting cash, not pushing drink sales, and, perhaps most damningly, failing to salt the pasta water. The 294-slide report was compiled by Starboard Value, an investment firm that's trying to convince shareholders changes are needed. In response, the Chief Operating Officer of parent company Darden Restaurants Gene Lee said the company is already working on many of the recommendations.

Overall they reported a $19.3 million loss over the last three months compared to the same period last year. Starboard, which hopes to replace the entire Darden board, has called for a number of changes at the Olive Garden. For one, they argue that the restaurants unlimited breadstick promotion as led to 'massive unnecessary waste' as the average consumer does not eat three breadsticks, which is the average serving per customer. That adds up to nearly 700 million breadsticks per year. Overall Olive Garden reported a $19.3 million loss over the last three months compared to the same period last year . Starboard also worries that servers are filling salad bowls to the brim with as much as four times the recommended serving of dressing leading to even more waste and soaked, unappetizing salads. They're also losing out on lucrative alcohol sales by not pushing wine and other spirits with the Olive Garden customer typically drinking much less than at other restaurants. And, as mentioned, there's the issue with failing to salt the water which the Olive Garden defends as a measure to get a long warranty on pots but which leaves the pasta flavorless.","Chain reported nearly $20 million loss over last three months compared to the same period last year .

A surge in child sex abuse cases reported to Victoria Police shows the problem is no longer being swept under the carpet, political leaders say . 'I think those figures reflect, on the advice that I have, an increased reporting rate and I welcome an increased reporting rate,' Victorian premier Denis Napthine told reporters on Saturday. 'The increased awareness of child sexual abuse is bringing to the fore cases that were under the carpet, behind closed doors.' Opposition leader Daniel Andrews said it resulted from a new 'culture of extra reporting, courage, transparency, and people feeling safe to come forward and report those despicable crimes'. A justice system overhaul was also needed, Mr Andrews said, and Labor would hold a royal commission into family violence in 2015 should it win the November state election. Fairfax, which published the figures, has also reported concerning trends observed by police and support services. They are seeing more cases of children instigating sexualised behaviour at primary schools, men pretending to be boys online so they can trick girls into exchanging explicit photos, and sexual abuse of girls after arranged marriages.

"Fish and chip shops regularly source cheaper species of fish before selling them to customers as cod and haddock, according to a food safety expert. An investigation conducted by Which? discovered that around one in six of the fish sold in UK takeaways was labelled incorrectly. The consumer watchdog took DNA samples from 45 portions of cod or haddock bought in shops in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. Scroll down for video . An investigation conducted by Which? discovered that around one in six fish sold in UK takeaways was labelled incorrectly . Seven were found to be mislabelled, with whiting - often used in fish meal and pet food - the most common substitute. The findings follow the watchdog's larger survey into lamb takeaways, where they discovered that 40 per cent of meals they bought were either contaminated with other meats or did not contain any lamb at all. They are now urging the Government, the Food Standards Agency and local authorities to do more to tackle the issue and in April launched a campaign called Stop Food Fraud. Last week, it was announced that a new Food Crime Unit will be established to crack down on criminal activity in the food industry. The move came in response to recommendations made in the Elliott Review, a government-commissioned investigation that was launched in the aftermath of last year's horse-meat scandal. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Consumers must be put first if we are to restore trust in the food industry. 'It's in the interests of responsible food businesses, as well as consumers, to make sure there are effective controls in place and a zero tolerance approach to food crime. Whiting - used in fish meal and pet food - is often served as British favourites cod and haddock . 'We now want the government to quickly implement all of the recommendations so consumers can be confident in the food they buy.' The Which? study is not the first time that fraud has been exposed in the seafood industry. Last year, marine protection group, Oceana, published research showing that a third of fish in supermarkets, shops and restaurants in the U.S. was wrongly labelled. In 120 'red snapper' samples, 28 different species of fish were found, including 17 not even from the snapper family. Another study by Boston Globe in 2011, found that almost half the fish they tested from supermarkets and restaurants was labelled incorrectly. Amazingly, every single sample of tuna turned out to be another variety of fish - in many cases escolar, which looks and tastes similar.","Watchdog, Which?, tested 45 cod and haddock meals from shops across UK .

"Cutting it fine: Over 90% of doctors say NHS training is not enough to be able to carry out facelifts . Doctors and patients have overwhelmingly called for the introduction of new specialist training for cosmetic surgeons to remove cowboy practices from the industry. The latest survey, the results of which are exclusive to The Mail on Sunday, polled 500 clinicians and 2,000 women and was carried out to coincide with the UK’s largest plastic surgery conference, next month’s Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo (CCR Expo). Hundreds of doctors said newly qualified consultants were not competent enough to perform specialist operations like boob jobs and facelifts – despite the fact there is currently  no requirement for them to complete any further accredited training. Only seven per cent – just one in 14 clinicians – said they believed NHS training alone was enough. About . a third of doctors said clinicians should undergo at least three . months’ training before injecting cosmetic fillers and Botox. The same . number thought medics should have a minimum of three months’ training to . carry out laser treatment for acne, skin rejuvenation and hair removal. Three-quarters . of women would feel more confident having cosmetic surgery if doctors . were forced to  take a special qualification. Patients thought training . for fillers and Botox ought to last at least six months. The . shock results are revealed days after Health Education England (HEE) released the first part of its review into training for non-surgical . cosmetic procedures. Officials have recommended that anyone injecting . Botox or fillers has specialist qualifications. The . proposals include undertaking minimum training hours, being taught to . spot patients with mental health issues and shadowing clinicians – they . will be allowed to inject patients only once deemed competent. In their hands: There is currently no requirement for newly qualified consultants to complete any further accredited training after that provided by the NHS . The . Mail on Sunday’s long-running Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys . campaign calls for tougher regulation. We want a minimum standard for . surgeons, proper regulation for those practising cosmetic surgery and an . end to hard-sell tactics. Overwhelmingly, doctors felt professional associations such as the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and the British College of Aesthetic Medicine should be responsible for training. Many specialists will argue that the HEE proposals don’t go far enough. For example, the HEE is not expected to recommend a mandatory register of accredited clinics. The organisation Save Face is compiling a voluntary register of non-surgical cosmetic practitioners who are thoroughly vetted by doctors before being accredited – so consumers can have confidence in selecting a clinic.","Newly qualified consultants not competent to perform plastic surgery .

The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand. The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife. They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor. Today's wedding came just weeks after Mr Cameron faced criticism for returning to the Cornish surf hours after a crisis meeting about a British jihadi beheading journalist James Foley. It will be back to business for the Prime Minister on Monday, but he is staying away from Scotland on this crucial Saturday and Sunday, despite polls showing the No camp is neck-and neck with Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaign. On the campaign trail: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond talks to hordes of supporters today on the Devorgilla Bridge in Dumfries. The Yes campaign mocked the absence of the Prime Minister and his deputy .

Today a new poll suggested the Better Together campaign was holding the lead with 54 per cent of those who had made up their minds, but Yes campaigners insist there is everything to play for. Much of the pro-Union fight is being taken up by the Labour old guard, with Gordon Brown and John Reid leading the effort to stop working-class voters backing independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has been in Scotland all week, is not expected to campaign this weekend. And Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is also a no-show with just five days until polling day. Independence campaigners today mocked Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg’s absence from the battlefield, claiming if they did turn up it would boost the case for independence.

He will deliver a passionate plea to not to 'break up the family of nations'. Welcome: Samantha Cameron carried a bouquet and lined up to greet guests in the Hampshire sunshine . Marriage: The couple outside St John the Evangelist Church today in the village of Northington, Hampshire . But the biggest battle is being fought in the west of Scotland, where Labour has launched a massive operation to stop its working class supporters from backing independence. Senior Tories say almost all of their supporters are committed to vote No and it is down to Labour to secure their base. In Glasgow former Labour home secretary John Reid joined Labour MP Jim Murphy for the conclusion of his 100 Meetings in 100 Days tour of Scotland. Since June Mr Murphy has been travelling across the country and speaking to voters in town centres from atop an IRN-BRU crate to urge a No vote. Hundreds of people gathered on Sauchiehall Street with Love Scotland, Vote No placards. Mr Murphy said: ’I've lost most of my voice but I don't think we've lost the argument. Prime Minister David Cameron has been attacked for returning to London during the final days of the campaign . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also faced criticism although their absence may help the No campaign . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been tasked with securing Scotland's Labour vote for the No side . ’The nearer it gets, a lot of the undecided voters have looked into the precipice and they've stepped back.’ Mr Reid said: ’The arguments are coming down to two very simple questions. ’Do you want to retain Scotland's history, culture, control over its own affairs within a bigger state that allows us financial stability, economic growth and and the best of both worlds? ’Or do you want to go a separate route with all the dangers, which are now becoming obvious, to pensions, jobs, investment and security?’ As part of the Labour push, former prime minster Gordon Brown used a SPCA at an event in Kirkcaldy to say: ’I yield to no one in my patriotism and my pride in Scotland. ’None of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes no is less patriotic and less proud of our country. ’We are patriotic Scots. We've got a patriotic vision for the future. Postal votes are already being counted in advance of Thursday's crucial referendum poll of eight million Scots . Nigel Farage on a visit to Glasgow urged voters not to destroy the Union because of their hatred of Tories . We're proud of our institutions. We're patriotic, we're proud of Scotland.’ Better Together strategists admit the spectacle of Mr Cameron jetting into Scotland to tell people how to vote risks angering those who have yet to make up their mind. Last night UKIP leader Nigel Farage pleaded with Scots not to allow their ‘loathing’ of the Tories to destroy the Union. But in a direct appeal to Labour voters, he urged them not to use the referendum as a chance to punish the Westminster politicians they hold in ‘contempt’. A Labour spokesman said: 'This is not and will not be Labour Party policy.'","Prime Minister attended wedding of his wife's half-brother Jake Astor .

"Using Botox diminishes the experience of feeling emotion - making it 'morally wrong' to give to young people making their way in life, a new study has warned. The anti-ageing treatment is becoming increasingly popular with teenagers who strive towards achieving the 'plastic' look seen in shows such as The Only Way Is Essex. But by restricting their range of facial expressions, young people may 'stunt their emotional development', according to Helen Collier, an aesthetic nurse practitioner in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh. Scroll down for video . Actress Gwyneth Paltrow (above) admitted last year that she had tried Botox . Miss Collier, writing in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, claims the actions of smiling and frowning are not simply outlets for emotion, but key factors in the experience itself. She is now urging her colleagues not to give the treatment to wrinkle-free people, reports The Times. She said: 'Our ability to demonstrate a wide range of emotions is very dependent on facial expressions. 'Emotions such as empathy or sympathy help us to survive and grow into confident adults. Movie star Nicole Kidman (left) and chef Gordon Ramsay (right) have both confessed to having the treatmnet . 'Removing the ability of the face to express these emotions can seriously affect the ability of patients to develop into maturity.' The nurse is set to speak at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in London next month, where she will argue that Botox should only be given to people who show clear signs of ageing. She added: 'I wouldn't want to be associated with a practitioner who would happily stick a needle in a 16-year-old for £200.' Singer Kylie Minogue admitted to using Botox during an interview in 2009, where she said 'I've tried Botox, I've tried them all' The nurse believes reality TV shows are to blame for the increase in under-25s seeking the treatment - as many want to look like the stars of shows such as The Only Way Is Essex. Botox is a drug made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The injections work by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by blocking certain nerves - thereby removing wrinkles. The effects last about three to 12 months, depending on what you are treating. Side effects can include pain, swelling, or bruising at the injection site as well as drooping eyelids. You can also get flu-like symptoms, headaches, and an upset stomach. Pregnant women should not use Botox. She believes young people need to grow into their faces before they limit their ability to communicate and says that by dampening the ability to express feeling, they could stunt their emotional growth. But she claims the treatment is fine for those in their late 30s, who have already developed emotionally. Three years ago the cosmetic surgery industry was rocked by the breast implant scandal involving French company, PIP. The firm's products were banned after it emerged substandard silicone was being used - with many implants rupturing inside women's bodies. Since then, the government has been considering whether tighter rules need to be introduced to regulate the cosmetic surgery industry.","Aesthetic nurse Helen Collier says young people should avoid treatment .

"Plans to make Kerala a 'dry' state have been blocked at the eleventh hour amid fears from tourism chiefs  that overseas visitors will stop visiting the popular Indian state. India's top court has put on hold until the end of the month a move by the authorities to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol everywhere but in five star hotels. Protests from bar owners and hoteliers about the devastating effect a ban could have on tourism has led the court postpone the government's plans. Disastrous consequences? One tour operator says the level of bookings to Kerala has noticeably dropped . The proposals include shutting down bars and shops which sell alcohol and introducing 'alcohol-free days'. Only luxury, five star hotels will be allowed to serve alcohol in a bid to tackle the state's drinking problem. Tour operators specialising in Kerala holidays expressed relief that the plan has been temporarily shelved, but are concerned that the proposals are already affecting business. 'It's madness,' says Graham Roberts, director of tour specialist Ellison Roberts, of the government proposals. Rajiv Wahie, consultant at India Footprints 4u, says he has already noticed a drop in enquiries for holidays in Kerala. 'Interest in holidays last year was tremendous but the last six or seven weeks I've noticed much fewer calls and bookings,' he said. 'We're only here for the beer... ' or not, possibly . 'If the ban goes ahead it will affect tourism on a huge scale. It will put small hotels out of business and the five star hotels will put their prices up even more,' Wahie says. 'We are all fighting against it.' The number of foreign tourists visiting Kerala jumped by 8 per cent last year to 858,143, but Wahie says this will fall drastically if the move goes ahead. 'The government's recent move to impose gradual prohibition in Kerala is nothing short of madness in my view,' Paul Zacharia, a writer and well known cultural figure in Kerala, wrote in an opinion piece about the proposals. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in India at more than eight litres per person annually. The government has announced it will shut more than 700 bars as well as some shops in a move towards total prohibition within the next ten years. In India, consumption of alcohol is already prohibited in the states of Gujarat, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption although there is a fixed legal drinking age. Holidaymakers were quick to admit they would think twice about booking a holiday to a 'dry' destination. 'When you're on holiday, you want a cold beer,' said Matthew Loney, 26. 'I would think twice about booking a flight to a country where you can't have a drink when you want to.' But Graham Roberts believes that even if the ban is passed by the court at the end of September, there will be ways to get around it. 'Tourists will always be allowed to drink,' he says. 'And ""special tea"" will always be available. I'm not unduly worried about it as I don't believe it will be enforced religiously - off-licences will remain open.' Roberts is one of many tour operators heading to Kerala next week for the Kerala Travel Mart (KTM) being held in Kochi on September 18-20. 'I fully expect the subject to be the main topic of conversation at KTM,' said Roberts. Alcohol contributes 22 per cent of Kerala's revenue, and the State exchequer stands to lose 90bn rupees (£897m) if liquor is banned. Courts in Kerala will until September 30 be able to hear petitions from bar owners who say that the move to ban alcohol is discriminatory and affects their business.","Government wants to ban the sale of alcohol everywhere but 5* hotels .

"Warning: M&S chief executive Marc Bolland has said prices will rise in an independent Scotland . Marks and Spencer today became the latest big name retailer to warn prices will rise in an independence Scotland. The firm’s chief executive Marc Bolland joined the bosses of B&Q-owner Kingfisher and shoe repair chain Timpson said firms would have to choose ‘whether or not to pass on the increased costs through higher prices to Scottish consumers’. Alex Salmond was today forced to deny he is plotting a ’day of reckoning’ against businesses opposed to his dream of independence, after warnings from BP, John Lewis, Asda, Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone, RBS and Lloyds. More than £17billion in shares in Scottish firms have been dumped by investors in recent weeks and when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, the pound tumbled to a 10-month low. A row over the impact of a Yes vote on businesses was ignited when SNP grandee Jim Sillars said an independent Scotland would break up or nationalise pro-Union firms. Mr Sillars, a former deputy leader of the SNP who appeared campaigning with Mr Salmond last week, said: ‘This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.’ In an attempt to quell the deeply damaging row, Mr Salmond today rushed out a statement attempting to reassure businesses they have nothing to fear if Scotland goes it alone. Mr Salmond said: ’Jim Sillars is a great campaigner who has put aside his personal grief over the loss of his wife Margo MacDonald to put his heart and soul into galvanising the Yes vote. ’He is fighting a fine campaign all over Scotland - but the day after a Yes vote will be a day of celebration for the people, not reckoning for big companies drawn into the No campaign by Downing Street.’ He added that Mr Sillars was ’simply trying to express the anger felt by so many people about the revelations that some supermarket statements were orchestrated by the Prime Minister himself’. Mr Salmond went on to claim that people in Scotland ’are in no mood to be bullied by big Westminster Government putting pressure on big business to intimidate the people of Scotland. Indeed, just the opposite is happening.’ However, in a joint letter, M&S, Kingfisher and Timpson warned about the ‘greater complexity of trading across a national border coupled with the uncertainty over big issues such as the single currency and membership of the EU’. Row: Alex Salmond reassured businesses they had nothing to fear today after former deputy SNP leader Jim Sillars vowed to show oil giant BP 'the meaning of nationalisation'. The referendum is in just five days' time . ‘Within our group there is first-hand experience of trading across national borders - in France, Ireland and across the world. Our experience is that it always leads to more red tape and higher costs and we feel it is important to share this experience,’ they wrote in the Daily Record. ‘We know that running a separate pricing system in Scotland will mean taking the difficult decision as to whether or not to pass on the increased costs through higher prices to Scottish consumers. ‘And it won't just affect us, it will also impact on our thousands of suppliers, many of which are small to medium-sized businesses.’ Major stores including Asda and Next have already warned that prices on essentials such as bread, milk and children’s clothes will rise. The boss of Iceland also added his voice to growing concerns, saying he would ‘panic’ if Scotland voted Yes. The M&S chief executive signed a joint leader with Timpson and Kingfisher, the owner of the B&Q brand . The cost of landlines, mobile phones and internet will increase in Scotland, a host of firms will say before the vote. BT is in talks with mobile providers Vodafone, EE and O2 as well as TalkTalk about issuing a joint statement warning of the implications of separation. It will be released over the weekend or early next week. The cost of installing broadband cables or mobile phone masts are already higher in Scotland because of the distances involved. Currently these are subsidised by the rest of the UK, but an independent Scotland would be likely to have its own separate pricing structure. A draft of the letter was yesterday said to warn of ‘the inevitability of cost increases’. John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield this week warned that the department store would be forced to pass on higher costs of operating in an independent Scotland. Iceland boss Malcolm Walker, whose chain has 71 stores and a major distribution centre in Scotland and employs more than 2,000 people, said his first response to a Yes vote would be to ‘panic!’. Consequences: John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield warned his firm would be forced to pass on higher costs of operating in an independent Scotland. His is just one of a string of firms issuing the same warning . ‘The consequences will be just massive,’ he told Channel 4 News. ‘To be perfectly honest with you, we didn’t take it too seriously. 'I don’t think anybody for one moment considered that there would be a Yes vote.’ Large Scottish banks including RBS and Lloyds have drawn up contingency plans to move their registered offices South. UBS said an independent Scotland would shed jobs and tax revenues. Economists at the bank said: ‘Until there is clarity over the currency arrangements and the banking system, Scotland is likely to suffer some degree of a credit crunch. ‘Scottish GDP would suffer a one-off contraction of somewhere between four per cent and five per cent as half of the banking sector moves to Britain before independence.’ A spokesman from Deutsche Bank said last night that ‘a Yes vote would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill’s decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US’.","Firm joins B&Q and Timpson to warn of higher cost of trading in Scotland .

"Andy Prowting has been given months to live after being diagnosed with malignant melanoma . A man has been given just months to live after learning a mole he developed while on holiday was in fact a rare form of cancer that has spread through his inner organs. Andy Prowting had returned from a trip to Turkey when he noticed the large, brown mole on his back. After having it removed, the 24-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, learned the rare form of cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with months to live. Now he is frantically raising money for a potentially life-saving treatment in the US that is not yet available in the UK. 'I was in Turkey last July and even though I was applying sunscreen every hour, I got burnt,' he said. 'In January I felt something on my back and got my mum to check. 'There was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and I went to see my doctor.' After being referred to a dermatology centre, the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at Queen Alexandra Hospital in April as part of an aggressive course of treatment. Three months later, Mr Prowting was referred to Southampton to take part in a chemotherapy clinical trial. It was then doctors revealed the cancer had spread throughout his body and he may only have nine months to live. 'Without treatment I have got about nine months to live, which is scary and upsetting,' he said. Andy Prowting's discovered the mole on his back after returning home from a trip to Turkey. After having it surgically removed, the 24-year-old learned he had just months to live as the cancer had spread through his body . The security guard (pictured with his girlfriend Katie Ward) is now raising money for a trip to a clinic in Houston, Texas, where doctors believe they may be able to treat his condition . 'I can feel tired and sick and I get achy as well.' He is now raising £60,000 for a trip to the Burzynski Clinic in Houston, Texas, which offers treatment to stop the disease from growing. 'After seeing my medical notes the clinic has accepted me, it's just a matter of raising the money.' 'We've raised about 11,000 pounds in three weeks and everyone has been so supportive. 'I've got to have hope, this has all been so devastating for me.' Skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year. There are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases. Melanoma - which Mr Prowting has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease. Beginning in the skin, it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs. The most common symptom of this form of cancer is a mole, most frequently appearing on the back, arms and legs. These types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm. NHS Choices has devised an ABCDE checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes: . Non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. While not all forms are preventable, it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways. Applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit UV rays. Exposure to UV rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer, though family history, fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person's chance of developing it. Applying sun screen frequently and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer .","Andy Prowting discovered mole on his back after trip to Turkey .

"Martin McGuinness has said he and Ian Paisley 'pointed the way to a better future' for Northern Ireland as he signed a book of condolence for his former arch-enemy. The pair buried decades of hostility for good when they took office together in 2007, and their friendship became such a symbol of the peace effort that they were dubbed the Chuckle Brothers. Signing a book of condolence today for the famed Unionist firebrand, who died aged 88 yesterday after a long illness, the Deputy First Minister wrote: 'In rising above old enmities, we pointed the way to a better and peaceful future. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Martin McGuinness signed a book of condolence today for his former arch rival Dr Ian Paisley . Symbolic: Despite being on opposing sides during the Troubles, the pair formed a lasting friendship in office . 'The peace process and I have lost a friend.' It came after former IRA commander Mr McGuinness led tributes to his former enemy this weekend, saying: 'I have lost a friend'. The only hint of past disagreement came in the address column, which Mr McGuinness signed as Derry City. Although legally known as Londonderry, the debate over what to call Northern Ireland's second city was for decades symbolic of the schism between supporters and opponents of Westminster rule. In 2007 the local authority, whose legal name is Derry City Council, lost a judicial review to change the name of the city and county to Derry permanently. It came after Mr McGuinness led tributes to his former enemy yesterday, saying: 'I have lost a friend' Lasting peace: The message said the pair had 'pointed the way to a better and peaceful future' Before serving as First Minister of Northern Ireland from 2007 to 2008, Dr Paisley - once renowned as a symbol of hard-line Unionism - became crucial in forging the peace process and bringing an end to conflict in the province. The bellicose symbol of unionist defiance was famous for bellowing 'never, never, never' during a mass protest against Irish government involvement in Northern Ireland affairs in the 1980s. But in a mark of his status as an unlikely symbol of reconciliation, his death was mourned by nationalists including Mr McGuinness and Sinn Fein's president Gerry Adams, who said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news. Others described him as a 'big man with a big heart', who despite his abrasive character and fiercely-held views will be remembered as a key figure in bringing peace. Leader: The Reverend Dr Ian Paisley died at the age of 88 after a long battle with illness . Preacher: Paisley, pictured in 1986, was once a fierce opponent of reconciliation with Irish Republicans . Prime Minister David Cameron added Paisley would be remembered as the 'Big Man' of Northern Ireland politics. Dr Paisley entered government with republicans in 2007 as Stormont's First Minister after republicans lent their support to the police. He was known as Lord Bannside after joining the House of Lords in 2010, following his career as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party from 1971 until 2008. His wife Baroness Eileen Paisley said yesterday: 'My beloved husband, Ian, entered his eternal rest this morning. 'Although ours is the grand hope of reunion, naturally as a family we are heartbroken.' Celebration: The DUP leader was committed to the United Kingdom - but often scathing of its leaders . Tribute: Mr McGuinness described his former fierce rival as a 'friend' in a statement on Twitter yesterday . Prime Minister David Cameron said Dr Paisley was a controversial figure for large parts of his career - 'yet the contribution he made in his later years to political stability in Northern Ireland was huge'. 'In particular, his decision to take his party into government with Sinn Fein in 2007 required great courage and leadership, for which everyone in these islands should be grateful.' Former prime ministers Tony Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, plus current DUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, also paid tribute. Dr Paisley was treated in hospital in the past, including in 2012 for an unspecified heart problem. His funeral will be private, but a public memorial event will be held later this year.","The Reverend Dr Ian Paisley died yesterday aged 88 after a long illness .

"Mark Ormrod, who lost three of his limbs in Afghanistan, has been given new legs that can be controlled by Bluetooth - allowing him to run, cycle and ski . A former Royal Marine who lost three of his limbs in Afghanistan has been given new legs that can be controlled by Bluetooth - allowing him to run, cycle and ski. Mark Ormrod’s state-of-the-art limbs can be adapted at the touch of a button - with settings for five different activities. Mr Ormrod, 30, lost both of his legs and an arm six years ago after he stepped on an IED. The father-of-three was later dubbed a ‘real hero’ of the war by Prince Harry. Mr Ormrod feared he would have to remortgage his home to pay for the top-of-the-range £115,000 legs but they were supplied for free on the NHS thanks to an £11million Government scheme to help veterans. As a result, he has now become the first injured British veteran to be fitted with a set of Genium limbs. The carbon fibre prosthetics include microprocessors which make hundreds of adjustments. They can be adapted with Bluetooth or a remote control so amputees can stand and walk naturally on slopes, climb up and down stairs, and even ski and cycle. After taking his first steps on the new legs, Mr Ormrod said: ‘The stability is so much better. I can stand on a slope, walk up stairs or just stand on the spot. ‘I don’t need to reach constantly for . stability which means I’ll be able to pick up my baby daughter and walk . around the house like a regular dad. ‘The battery life is ten days and they are even splash-proof. ‘I took the kids to Legoland last year and had to sit out the log flume - now I’ll be able to get stuck in like everyone else.’ Mr Ormrod was serving in Helmand Province on Christmas Eve 2007 when the explosion ripped off both his legs and his right arm. He lost huge amounts of blood but was . saved by comrades from Taunton-based 40 Commando, who wrapped . tourniquets around his mangled limbs to stem the flow. Mark Ormrod's state-of-the-art limbs can be adapted at the touch of a button - with settings for five activities . Mr Ormrod, 30, lost both of his legs and an arm six years ago after he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan - he was dubbed a 'real hero' of the war by Prince Harry . Back in the UK, he faced years of gruelling rehabilitation as the first soldier to leave Afghanistan with such injuries. But as he rebuilt his life he was . soon able to ditch his wheelchair for prosthetic legs, quickly learning . to run and walk and leaving medics stunned by his progress. Since . then he has completed a series of fundraising targets - culminating in a . 3,500-mile run across the U.S. on prosthetic blades which raised . £100,000 for military charities. Mr Ormrod feared he would have to remortgage his home to pay for the top-of-the-range £115,000 legs but they were supplied on the NHS thanks to an £11million Government scheme to help veterans . Mr Ormrod has now become the first injured British veteran to be fitted with a set of Genium limbs. He is pictured serving in Afghanistan before he lost his limbs . But his new upgraded legs should give . him the one thing he has yet to achieve - the sensation of moving and . standing just like normal. Each . Genium limb relies on tiny gyroscopes that monitor and adapt to the . precise speed, angle and position of the wearer - utilising the same . technology that keeps an airplane’s wings level during flight. They make 100 decisions every second, have five settings for different activities. Mr Ormrod (pictured with his wife Becky shortly after he returned from Afghanistan) can adapt his new legs with Bluetooth or a remote control so he can stand and walk naturally on slopes and climb up and down stairs . Mr Ormrod was injured on Christmas Eve 2007. He lost huge amounts of blood but was saved by comrades from 40 Commando, who wrapped tourniquets around his mangled limbs to stem the flow . They had previously only been available privately and to serving soldiers until the Government set aside funds so veterans could access the same standard of equipment. Mr Ormrod currently works full-time . for the Royal Marine Association and lives in Plymouth, Devon, with wife . Becky, 27, and their children Mason, one, and four-week-old Evelyn. He has a daughter Kezia, eight, from a previous relationship. Mr Ormrod faced years of gruelling rehabilitation in the UK (pictured) as the first soldier to leave Afghanistan with such serious injuries . Mr Ormrod said: ‘Getting my first set of legs really changed my life. I started learning what they could do and seeing what was still possible. ‘From then on I got my independence, my confidence, I’m not a burden on anyone, I don’t need a wheelchair. ‘I feel like the older veterans get totally forgotten about and goodness knows what some of them are hopping around on. ‘If . you serve in a conflict and risk your life for your country you deserve . the same level of care, regardless of whether it was a current conflict . or a previous one. Each Genium limb relies on tiny gyroscopes that monitor and adapt to the precise speed, angle and position of the wearer . ‘If you’re alive and kicking you deserve the help. Hopefully this money will help others benefit in the same way.’ World-leading prosthetic manufacturer Ottobock said the Genium took ten years to develop and that each limb lasts at least six years. Emma Gillespie, Academy Clinician for . Ottobock Academy UK, said: ‘The prosthetic knows where it is in space . so the patient feels in control no matter what the situation. ‘The . design is aiming to get as close as possible to what was there before. And because the movement is more natural and more intuitive, the patient . expends much less effort and energy. World-leading prosthetic manufacturer Ottobock said the Genium took ten years to develop and that each limb lasts at least six years . ‘Patients now have the ability to walk leg over leg up the stairs which sounds a tiny step forward - in reality it’s a monumental leap in prosthetics.’ Mark’s fitting took place at The Thornberry Centre in Plymouth, which provides treatment and rehab for patients who been born without, or lost, limbs. Principal Prosthetist Clayton Smith said: ‘Geniums are the very latest in technology. They are expensive but Mark is an inspiration and if anyone deserves this, it’s him.’","Mark Ormrod, 30, lost both his legs and an arm when he stood on an IED .

"Whether grainy movie reels featuring marching armies of khaki-clad soldiers heading towards the front line or harrowing images that reveal the aftermath in bloody detail, World War One was among the first to be documented in photos and on film. Now a new exhibition is to combine rarely seen photos of men and women fighting in the Great War with a series of harrowing artworks that shed light on the human tragedy that ensued. The Great War in Portraits, which debuts at the National Portrait Gallery next month, also tells the stories of some of the most fascinating participants, among them a Russian female soldier, a British nurse executed by the Germans and the first Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross. The Gassed and Wounded: Eric Kennington's 1918 work was based on sketches made on the front line . Harrowing: Two of the portraits from Henry Tonks' series, Soldiers With Facial Wounds . Others, among them the striking Henry Tonks' series, Soldiers With Facial Wounds, document the experience of disfigured British soldiers and their treatment in the hands of Dr Harold Gilles - one of the founding fathers of modern cosmetic surgery. His techniques, pioneered at the Cambridge Hospital at Aldershot and The Queen's Hospital in Sidcup, were used to reconstruct the faces of injured soldiers, with Tonks on hand to provide the before and after shots. Equally startling is Gilbert Rogers 1919 effort, The Dead Stretcher Bearer, which was commissioned by the government-sponsored Committee for the Medical History of the War. Charged with recording the medical consequences of the war, Rogers, who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, offers a painfully frank account of the risks faced by both soldiers and support staff. Harrowing: William Orpen's 1917 work, The Receiving Room: the 42nd Stationary Hospital . Record: Gilbert Rogers was commissioned to paint The Dead Stretcher Bearer in 1919 . But not every soldier to appear in the new exhibition does so through an artists' gaze. Many more peer shyly out of the exhibition's vast collection of photographs. And it's not just men: some of World War One's female participants feature, among them Mata Hari, the exotic Dutch dancer executed by the French after being accused of spying for the Germans, and Maria Bochkareva, a Russian peasant woman who became a soldier with the blessing of Tsar Nicholas. Although badly injured in 1916, Bochkareva later went on to form the 2,000-strong 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death in 1917. Sadly ,after the Bolshevik Revolution ended Russia's involvement in the Great War, Bochkareva was deemed surplus to requirements and was executed in 1920 by the Communist regime. Another woman to suffer a similar fate was British nurse, Edith Cavell, whose daguerreotype portrait also appears in the exhibition. Executed: Maria Bochkareva died at the hands of the Bolsheviks while Mata Hari was killed by the French . Brave: British nurse Edith Cavell ran a network of safe houses for Allied soldiers but was executed in 1915 . Her story began in the village of Swardeston in Norfolk, where she grew up before moving to London to train as a nurse in 1896. In 1907, she moved to Brussels to become the director of a training school for nurses but was caught behind enemy lines after the German invasion of Belgium in 1914. The school became part of a network of safe houses created to shelter Allied soldiers before smuggling them into the Netherlands. Less than a year after the invasion, Cavell was caught by the Germans and on the 12th October 1915, she was executed by firing squad. Her final words were, 'I am glad to die for my country.' Unlike Cavell, not every soldier fighting in the war did battle on behalf of the country of his birth. As the exhibition makes plain, many troops fighting for Britain hailed from the Commonwealth. In addition to 100,000 formidable, knife-wielding Gurkhas, troops from India, Australia, Uganda and New Zealand went into battle alongside their British brethren. Kulbir Thapa was the first Nepalese soldier to win the Victoria Cross . Shahamad Khan, a Punjabi Muslim, also won the UK's highest military honour . Private Ivor Evans, from Swansea, enlisted at 15 and was killed aged 18 . Captured: This German soldier was taken prisoner by Scottish and South African troops at Passchendaele . Among them was Kulbir Thapa, the first Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross, whose heroics saved the lives of three injured comrades during the 1915 Battle of Loos. Another was Shamad Khan, a Punjabi Muslim serving in the 89th Punjabis, British Indian Army, who earned a Victoria Cross while fighting on the Tigris Front. Equally brave were British recipients of the UK's highest military honour, among them Private Reginald Roy Inwood who won his for capturing an enemy strong point and nine prisoners single-handedly. Peering out of grainy black and white photos, the portraits of Private Inwood and his comrades offer a very human perspective of what turned out to be a spectacularly inhuman struggle.

"Benjamin Harris Todd III never gave up hope of finding his kidnapped daughter. Now his ex-wife faces deportation this month from Australia to a US prison, he nervously hopes Savanna Todd can love him as a father. The intensely private stockbroker from America's Deep South understands why the daughter snatched from him in 1994 by her mother Dorothy Lee Barnett and who never knew him as father has so far held off from speaking with him. Charleston stockbroker, Benjamin Harris Todd III, (pictured with baby Savanna in 1994) never gave up hope of finding his kidnapped daughter who became the subject of an FBI international manhunt . The only father she knew: Savanna Todd (left) thought her name was Samantha Geldenhuys and that Juan Geldenhuys was her natural father. She is pictured here with Geldenhuys, her half brother, Rhys, and mother, whose real name is Dorothy Barnett . 'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis, told the MailOnline. 'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.' As Barnett faces an extradition hearing in a Queensland court and possible immediate immigration detention as early as next week ahead of deportation to the US, Benjamin Todd fears jeopardising his hoped for reunion with his daughter. But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna. He had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared with her mother, to when Australian police knocked on a door in a beachside suburb and arrested Barnett for abduction. The Yale-educated, softly spoken Southern gentleman has refused to speak with the media about the daughter he spent endless hours and a considerable amount of his fortune on a worldwide search for her. The extraordinary story of how Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 20-year-old Savanna Todd. Until the day federal US charges of child abduction and passport fraud were laid against her mother last November, the young nursing student believed her name was Samantha Geldenhuys and the recently deceased Juan Geldenhuys - really her stepfather - was her biological parent. Dorothy Barnett's friends have launched a campaign against Benjamin Todd, telling the Seven Network's Today Tonight he had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993. Savanna Todd (left), who only learnt her real name three months ago is said to be 'deeply confused' about the fact her mother kidnapped her and is 'reluctant' to meet Benjamin Todd, the father (right) she never knew . Friends of Dorothy Barnette (left, with daughter Savanna) have llaunched a campaign against Savanna's real father, Benjamin Todd, calling him 'evil' One friend described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'. Details have emerged about the doomed relationship between the quite classical music lover, Todd, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky, and Barnett, who was raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare. Todd spent his career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina. Barnett ran a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, finally settling for a job as a flight attendant before meeting Todd and marrying him in a whirlwind romance. When the marriage failed, and Todd gained custody of Savanna after a court case which alleged Barnett was bipolar, she was awarded only supervised access to her daughter. It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son. The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys. It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that Barnett slipped up. She referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America. Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. Savanna Todd (pictured as a toddler) has only known Juan Geldenhuys (right) as her father, causing 'deep confusion' about her real identity . They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha. They contacted Benjamin Todd in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over. J Graham Sturgis said Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her there on her birthdays,' Sturgis said. 'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.' It is believed Dorothy Barnett does not hold Australian citizenship and risks detention should she be granted bail from Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre. A hearing in Maroochydore Magistrate's Court will determine whether she is 'eligible for surrender' to the US, after which the Federal Attorney General will decide whether to give Barnett over to US authorities. If Barnett loses an appeal against extradition, she will be deported to the US and imprisoned in a federal correctional facility until she faces court over the alleged kidnapping and passport charges, for which she could serve more than 20 years if convicted.","US father never gave up on daughter,Savanna Todd, kidnapped as a baby .

"It sounds like the kind of crazy creation you'd expect to emerge from the kitchens of Heston Blumenthal or Marco Pierre White, but this black bamboo and squid ink burger is actually the work of fast-food giant Burger King. The chain's Japanese franchises will offer the pitch black patty from September 28 to mark its fifth anniversary in the land of the rising sun. The buns are made from dough mixed with bamboo charcoal, and between them is paprika and tomato beef...slathered with black squid ink ketchup. 'Overturning preconceptions': Burger King's kuro burger is made with bamboo charcoal and squid ink . Costing 790yen (£6.25) with fries and a drink, the creation has been imaginatively dubbed the 'kuro', or 'black' burger. But perhaps the 'Ninja' would be a better name, since Burger King says it is intended to 'punch you in the mouth with taste'. The chain wants to 'overturn the preconceptions of what constitutes a fast food burger'. It's not the first time they've challenged convention. Their 2012 summer menu included an ice cream sundae flavoured with vanilla, fudge, caramel and bacon. Fast food chains are having to adapt their menus to suit tastes in emerging markets, with McDonalds planning a vegetarian restaurant in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, India. The world-leader in fast food has itself experimented with black burgers for the Asian market, introducing a meal in China featuring a pair of buns - one black, one white. Available for a limited time only, the kuro will be staying in Japan. A spokesman for Burger King UK said there are no plans to add it to the menus in their British restaurants.","Restaurant has created 'premium kuro burger' to mark fifth anniversary of trading in Japan .

"We may think that trolling is a modern phenomenon, but the Romans wrote vile messages wishing ill on others, centuries before social media was invented. A collection of 130 ancient 'curse tablets' featuring gruesome messages of revenge has been added to the World Heritage register. They include wishes that thieves should go blind and mad, while cheaters become as 'liquid as water.' Curses! A collection of 130 ancient 'curse stones' (pictured) featuring gruesome messages of revenge have been added to the Unesco heritage register . The wishing of ill-health and death on a person is typical of many Roman curses. People inscribed pieces of lead and pewter with nasty messages asking gods and spirits to act on their behalf. Some messages included magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Others were pierced with nails to achieve a similar result. Many of the tablets were thrown into sacred pools in temples or interred with the dead so that gods could be easily contacted. Curses were sometimes rolled up, hidden under floors or in wall cavities, or nailed up. The nasty messages – known as curse tablets - were written on pieces of lead by victims of theft or wrong doing, and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset. Now 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the . Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the . United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation . (Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary . heritage. In what could be the Roman version of modern-day trolling, the authors poured bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways. One tablet asks for an adversary's intestines to be ‘quite eaten away’, while another one reveals that the victim of a theft of a bronze vessel wanted the cup to be filled with the thief’s blood. One of the tablets is written in British Celtic - the only text known to survive in that language - while another tablet contains the earliest known use of the word Christian in Britain. The curses, which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of lead and pewter and are addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva. Ancient trolling? The nasty messages - known as curse tablets (pictured) - were written on pieces of lead or pewter by victims of theft or wrong doing and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset . Fishing for revenge: The curses (pictured left) which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of . lead and pewter and addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva. Victims of crime dropped their nasty wishes into the sacred hot baths (pictured right) Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom and healing (as well as the arts, commerce, strategy and magic). She can be depicted with weapons or with an owl. Celts worshiped Sulis, who was a sun god of fertility at the thermal spring of Bath -named Aquae Sulis in Latin. The two goddesses were gradually rolled into one so that British Romans came to worship Sulis Minerva. Fires were continually burned at shrines, which were natural hot springs. The lead tablets suggest that Sulis Minerva was life-giving but also adept at punishing wrong-doers as a goddess of justice. Over 130 curse tablets addressed to the goddess have been found in Bath - written in Latin, a local version of the Roman language and in Brythonic, an ancient Celtic language. There is a Roman temple dedicated to Sulis Minerva - the primary deity of the temple spa - in Bath. Aquae Sulis was a religious site before the Romans arrived and the springs at bath have been used for more than 10,000 years, with the Celts thought to have built the first shrine there in 700BC. But the Romans modernised the site with grand temples, altars and bath buildings complete with lead pipes to ensure a constant flow of water to the giant lead-lined pool. They were cast into the hot springs at Bath, where they were left for the goddess, who was worshiped by Celts and Romans and believed to dispense justice. They are the only objects from Roman Britain to have been added to the UK’s part of the register. Many of the curses have been translated from their original Latin and reveal that not only were Bath's Romans creative in their requests for revenge, but were also very specific. One person asked that a thief who had stolen their gloves should go 'mad and blind', saying: ‘Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds and eyes in the goddess' temple.’ While . another person wrote: ‘May he who carried off Vilbia from me become . liquid as the water. May he who so obscenely devoured her become dumb’. There was also a tendency for particularly gory punishments for the guilty, including a curse about a stolen ring. The . aggrieved victim said: ‘…so long as someone, whether slave or free, . keeps silent or knows anything about it, he may be accursed in (his) blood, and eyes and every limb and even have all (his) intestines quite . eaten away if he has stolen the ring or been privy (to the theft).’ Councillor . Ben Stevens, Bath and North East Somerset Council's cabinet member for . sustainable development, accepted the certificate of inscription on . behalf of the local authority. He . said: ‘The decision by Unesco to inscribe the Roman curse tablets from . Bath on the Memory of the World register reflects the very special . nature of this collection, and is another reason for local people to . take pride in the exceptional quality of our local heritage here in . Bath.’ Settler of scores: The lead tablets suggest that Sulis Minerva (a Roman bust is pictured) was life-giving but also adept at punishing wrong-doers as a goddess of justice . Precious insults: Now 130 of the tablet curses (pictured) unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary heritage . A flexible religious centre: Both Romans and Celts worshiped the goddess Sulis Minerva at Bath (pictured). The lead tablets suggest that she was life-giving but also adept at punishing wrong-doers as a goddess of justice.

The first video in the collection shows one of the employees stuttering and freezing, to make reference to the fact Apple’s live stream failed repeatedly during the launch event on Tuesday. In the advert, his colleague exclaims: ‘You can’t handle a live stream? You work in technology. Unbelievable.’ A second advert mocks the larger screen.

"Iran's supreme leader has undergone prostate surgery and is recovering at a government hospital in Tehran, state media said in a rare report on the state of health of the country's top cleric. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 75, who has the final say on all state matters and has been Iran's top leader since 1989, was reported to be in 'good condition' and his doctors said he was resting after the surgery. President Hassan Rouhani visited the supreme leader in hospital after the procedure and later released a statement saying that Mr Khamenei's condition is 'very good and hence the people should not be worried'. Mystery: The official IRNA news agency described the operation as 'routine' and said it was successful, without giving details on what had prompted it or the underlying medical condition . Mr Rouhani said he had offered to cancel his attendance at a regional summit in Tajikistan but that Mr Khamenei had convinced him to proceed with the planned trip. The official IRNA news agency described the operation as 'routine' and said it was successful, without giving details on what had prompted it or the underlying medical condition. Head of Mr Khamenei's medical team, Dr Ali Reza Marandi, told state TV that the procedure took less than half an hour and was performed under local anaesthetic. He said Mr Khamenei will need three to four days of rest. Earlier in the day, state TV aired brief footage of Mr Khamenei before the surgery in which he asked people to pray for him. 'There is no room for concern, but this does not mean that they - the people - should not pray,' Mr Khamenei said. Mr Khamenei was a close ally of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution and was later Iran's supreme leader until his death in 1989. He served as Iran's president for eight years before becoming the supreme leader in 1989 and has proved a powerful defender of the clerical rule established by his predecessor. Not worried: President Hassan Rouhani visited the supreme leader in hospital after the procedure and later released a statement saying that Mr Khamenei's condition is 'very good and hence the people should not be worried' 'Pray for me': Earlier in the day, state TV aired brief footage of Mr Khamenei before the surgery in which he asked people to pray for him . Mr Khamenei has kept Iran on a firmly anti-US path, pushing ahead with its nuclear ambitions despite international pressure and sanctions. At the same time, Iran sought to extend its influence in the Middle East through its ally Syria and Islamic militant groups despite attempts by US-backed Arab governments to contain Iran. In 2009, Mr Khamenei thwarted the movement in support of a reformist presidential candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, and when hundreds of thousands rose up around the country marching in the streets, some overtly denouncing him, he stepped forward to crush the protests. Under the Iranian system, the president and members of parliament are elected in nationwide balloting but an undisputed clerical hierarchy controls councils that approve legislation and candidates running for office. The clerics are also in charge of the powerful judiciary and are tightly linked to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard force. Mr Khamenei has seen four presidents take office during his leadership. Hard-line former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who once was seen as being firmly within the theocracy's fold, later rebelled and challenged Mr Khamenei's authority. More recently, Mr Khamenei has lent support to the talks between Iran and the six world powers on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme and the breakthrough interim agreement those talks produced last November. Powerful: Mr Khamenei (pictured)  served as Iran's president for eight years before becoming the supreme leader in 1989, following the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and has proved a powerful defender of the clerical rule established by his predecessor . But he has also expressed doubts the talks will lead anywhere. Last month, Mr Khamenei said the United States had only grown more hostile to Iran since the talks began, and that there was no point in holding direct negotiations with Washington. The UN's nuclear agency is trying to investigate allegations that Iran secretly worked on nuclear weapons - something Tehran denies, insisting its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, such as power generation and cancer treatment. Mr Khamenei has backed the reformist Mr Rouhani, who took office in August 2013, and his efforts to stabilise the national currency and halt inflation. But the government has a long way to go to deliver on promises of economic growth. Mr Khamenei earlier this year said the priority for Iranians is to make their economy immune to outside pressures. He has called UN and Western sanctions imposed over Iran's nuclear programme a 'full-fledged economic war' on his country and has ordered the government to create an 'economy of resistance' to counter the measures. The project involves efforts to diversify Iran's exports, reduce dependence on sales of raw materials and promote knowledge-based high-tech industries. 'If a nation is not strong, the world's extortionists will extort from it, insult it and if they can, they will trample on it,' Mr Khamenei said in March, in his annual speech for the Persian new year, Nowruz. 'If a nation doesn't become strong, it will be bullied by others.' Most Iranian state TV and radio channels kept broadcasting their regular programmes on Monday, an indication that the situation was business as usual.","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 75, reported to be in 'good health' after operation .

"A teenager's 16th birthday wasn't so sweet after her hopes for a glamorous tattoo didn't go to plan. Siobhan Fields, from Hamilton, Scotland, wanted to have silver screen siren Marilyn Monroe etched on her arm. But instead she was left with an 'embarrassing' botched drawing that 'looks more like a blow up doll'. The hairdressers' assistant had previously taken to social networks to warn others against rushing into getting a tattoo in light of her experience. Regrets: Siobhan has appeared on Extreme Beauty Disasters to warn others not to rush into getting a tattoo . Spot the difference: The picture of Marilyn Monroe that the teen wanted etched on her arm, left, and what she got, right, which she said looked like a blow up doll . Now she's appearing on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if their experts can rid her of the 'horrible' tattoo for good. She explained how she wanted the tattoo for her 16th birthday but was misled over the expertise of the tattoo artist she found. She said: 'I looked on the internet for pictures of Marilyn Monroe. Then I found the tattooist on a social media . website, I had a look through his work and they all seemed really nice. But I later found out they were someone else's work that he'd stolen. 'I could see that it looked awful (as he was doing it) but I was too scared to say anything. It definitely wasn't a success, it looks horrible.' As a result of the tattoo, Siobhan has stuck to wearing long sleeved tops and said 'knowing that it's there forever is a horrible thought'. She applied to Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if they could help her. The show's resident skin expert, Dr Sam Bunting, admitted the tattoo was one of the worst she'd ever seen. 'I've learnt a lot from this experience - . one that laser treatment is absolute agony and two, not to rush into . getting a tattoo' She said: 'It looks like it was etched by a three-year-old. I haven't seen a worst looking tattoo in a long time. Blurry around the edges, facially indistinct, it looks nothing like it's supposed to. 'I feel sorry for Siobhan as she wanted something that would looks cool and glamorous on her arm but she's ended up with a real mess.' Siobhan admitted that she wished she hadn't rushed into getting a tattoo but the show revealed that she's not alone in having tattoo regrets. According to their statistics, a third of people opt for tattoo removal with 70 per cent of these young women with black ink tattoos. Reasons for removal included disliking the design, breaking up with a boyfriend whose name was featured in it or finding they couldn't wear the clothes they wanted because of the tattoo. Hope: The teenager hates her 'horrible' tattoo but it's finally getting fainter after painful laser treatment . Siobhan was told she would need painful laser treatment in order to remove the tattoo but she said she was prepared to 'go through anything to take this away.' She had to endure a number of laser sessions where the tattoo was bombarded with light energy to breakdown the ink into small particles that could then be absorbed by the body. Dr Bunting pointed out that one advantage of Siobhan seeing an amateur was that it would make it easier to remove. She explained: 'Amateur tattoos are easier to remove as the pigment lies higher in the skin so is more accessible for the laser.' After having the laser treatment Siobhan admitted: 'It's far more painful than getting a tattoo. I would advise people feel what this is like before getting a tattoo.' After her first treatment, Siobhan returned to the TV show to show off the results. The tattoo was already looking much fainter but she would need further sessions to rid herself of it for good. She added: 'I've learnt a lot from this experience - one that laser treatment is absolute agony and two, not to rush into getting a tattoo. I'm looking forward to saying goodbye for Marilyn Monroe.'

"Two 'menacing' life-sized cat bookends are being auctioned almost 70 years after they were 'liberated' from the Nazis. The carved oak figures are believed to have once belonged to Hitler's Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering. They were picked up by RAF Squadron Leader Geoffrey 'Butch' Butcher after the British Army seized the Luftwaffe air base at Jever in Germany in 1945. The two life-sized cat bookends were 'liberated' by Squadron Leader Geoffrey 'Butch' Butcher after the British Army seized the Luftwaffe air base at Jever in Germany in 1945 . The 'menacing' cats are carved from oak and are expected to fetch up to £800 at auction . The Nazi leader apparently used the pair of cats as book-ends for . leather-bound volumes including the Fuhrer's Mein Kampf. Following the war, Butcher, the CO of No 6 Air School brought the 'trophy' cats back to England. They are now expected to fetch up to £800 when they go under the hammer at auction. Sqdn Ldr Butcher served as a chief flying instructor and was posted to South Africa where he trained RAF airmen before they returned to fight the war against the Luftwaffe in Europe. Auctioneer Malcolm Claridge, who will sell the cats at auction house Dreweatts, said: 'They are a very distinctive pair of Black Forest-style cat book-ends which Sqdn Ldr Butcher reputedly ""liberated"" from one of Goering's homes. 'The cats are life-sized and they certainly share a rather distinctive menacing facial expression.' Goering, who founded Hitler's Gestapo . secret police, was a prime architect of the Nazi Holocaust. He took his . own life aged 53 by swallowing a cyanide capsule after he was sentence. Geoffrey 'Butch' Butcher, left, picked up the bookends from the airbase. They are believed to have belonged to commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goering, right . Auctioneer Malcolm Claridge said the cats 'share a rather distinctive menacing facial expression' The origin of the cats is unknown and they may have formed part of the 'Collection Goering'. The Nazi 'magpie' was known for his collection of loot that encompassed paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting . ornaments, altarpieces and rugs. The bookends were found at the airbase once it was taken over by the British Army. The RAF took control of the base, later designated RAF Jever, and used between 1952 and 1961, when it was handed back to the German Air Force. The bookends will be sold at Dreweatts' militaria sale in Bristol on March 28.","The carved oak bookends were found at Luftwaffe airbase in Jever in 1945 .

"Amazon has agreed to buy live-streaming gaming network Twitch for $970m. San Francisco-based Twitch allows gamers to broadcast live streams of themselves playing videogames. The company says more than 55 million gamers visit its site every month. Scroll down for video . Twitch allows people to watch people play computer games live online, ad boasts over 55 million monthly users. San Francisco-based Twitch allows gamers to broadcast live streams of themselves playing videogames. Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts. The system works on PCs, consoles and mobile phones. Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts. 'Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month,' said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. The deal is the latest example of Amazon expanding into new commercial arenas. It introduced its own smartphone, the Fire, this month. Earlier this summer, it added same-day delivery, a set-top video streaming device to its list of services for members of Prime, its $99 annual loyalty program. The firm already has an in-house gaming studio that makes games, and its Fire TV set top box was designed to attract gamers. Google was earlier in talks to buy Twitch, with reports emerging in May that the internet search giant had agreed to buy the company for $1 billion, but a deal was never confirmed. 'Today, I'm pleased to announce we've been acquired by Amazon,' said CEO Emmet Shear, announcing the deal on the company's blog. 'We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster. 'We're keeping most everything the same: our office, our employees, our brand, and most importantly our independence. 'But with Amazon's support we'll have the resources to bring you an even better Twitch.' It had been thought Google was the front runner. Video games are among the most popular content on YouTube, the world's No. 1 video website owned by Google. The site allows dedicated game fans to watch each other play online . However, Tech blog The Information first reported news of talks related to the Amazon deal early on Monday. The firm was first set up by Shear three years ago. 'It's almost unbelievable that slightly more than 3 years ago, Twitch didn't exist,' he wrote. 'The moment we launched, we knew we had stumbled across something special. 'But what followed surprised us as much as anyone else, and the impact it's had on both the community and us has been truly profound.'","Site broadcasts games live online from PCs and consoles .

"Samsung has filed a design patent for wearable computer glasses that are tethered to a smartphone. The Samsung spectacle plugs into a mobile phone and displays information such as text messages and phone calls. Unlike Google Glass, which is wireless, the Wall Street Journal reports that Samsung’s design will be attached using a micro-USB connection. Samsung has filed a design patent for wearable computer glasses that are tethered to a smartphone . This attachment could overcome one of the biggest problems of Google Glass; battery life. By drawing power from a smartphone’s battery, Samsung’s design could potentially have a longer life and be lighter than Google’s version. The patent says that the device will allow users to ‘take phone calls and listen to music during workouts’. The spectacle plugs into a mobile phone and displays information for alerts such as messages or calls . Unlike Google Glass (pictured), which is wireless, Samsung's design is attached using a micro-USB . While Samsung may be attempting to steal Google Glass' thunder, there are reports that Google is working on developing a internet-enabled watch that could be unveiled 'in weeks'. The watch, believed to be codenamed Gem, could take advantage of the work Google has been doing on its Glass wearable computer. It could also use the same Google Now alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear. In August, it was revealed the firm bought a company called WIMM, which makes a watch that runs on Google’s Android software. The design also integrates ear phones into the frame, so users won’t need separate buds to listen to music. Samsung calls its design a ‘sports glass’ which means the company doesn’t expect it to be worn all day. The main downside, however, is users will be constantly attached to a cable, and that could be a deal breaker for many. If Samsung releases its spectacles, it will be the latest in a series of efforts by the South Korean company to break into the wearable technology market. The device could follow the launch of its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, which was unveiled in September. By drawing power from a smartphone's battery, Samsung's design could potentially have a longer life and be lighter than Google's version (pictured) Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its second-generation Galaxy Gear smartwatch after sales of the original model, pictured, were slow. Reports from Korea claim the Galaxy Gear 2 will replace the chunky flat screen of the original with a curved OLED display and is set to look 'totally different' Meanwhile, Microsoft is thought to be preparing to launch its own version of Google Glass based on its experience in the gaming world. The Verge reports that the company filed patent applications for head-mounted displays that related to video games. Some experts claim that, more than anything, price point is going to be the way to differentiate a Microsoft and Samsung glass product from their competition at Google. Google Glass is expected to retail for about $1,500 making it a luxury product rather than a device available to a wider audience.","Samsung’s design could have a longer life and be lighter than Google Glass .

"From the wildflowers that dot the crumbling slag heaps of south Wales to the elegant lines of the vast industrial chimneys of the North, there's a strange beauty in the remnants of the UK's industrial past. And no-one knows it better than David Lynch, the American film director turned photographer, whose haunting shots of crumbling factories are the subject of a new exhibition. The Factory Photographs, which were taken between 1980 and 2000, include brooding shots of power plants and the decaying corners of abandoned manufacturing plants. Haunting: A brooding photo of a power plant belching steam taken in the late 1980s in the north of England . Beauty: Lynch's lens brings out the geometric beauty in a group of iron electricity pylons, photographed in northern England in the early 1990s . Others provide a new perspective on electricity pylons; the vast metal contraptions given a stark, geometric beauty by Lynch and his lens. Beautiful though many are, the images, which go on display at The Photographers’ Gallery in London this week, also chart the decline in Britain's manufacturing capability, a fact that becomes starkly apparent in later shots. 'I just like going into strange worlds,' explains Lynch. 'A lot more happens when you open yourself up to the work and let yourself act and react to it. 'Every work ‘talks’ to you, and if you listen to it, it will take you places you never dreamed of.' Bleak: Lynch's photographs document the decline in heavy industry and the crumbling footprint it leaves on the landscape, in this case in New Jersey . Derelict: The impact of new technology on outdated manufacturing plants is made brutally apparent in this photo, taken in Łódz in 2000 . Crumbling: A photograph taken in the same factory in Łódz shows disintegrating brickwork and a tattered cupboard in a spot that used to be thronged with workers . Lynch is certainly no stranger to unusual places and eclectic experiences. A successful director, he is famous for his surrealist films, as well as TV series such as Twin Peaks. Like his photos, many of his films have an industrial vein running through them and in films such as Eraserhead (1977), The Elephant Man (1980) and Dune (1984) machinery and the sounds of industry dominate the background. In The Factory Photos, the machinery and manufacturing plants are pushed into centre stage, much of it looking quaintly old-fashioned. With traditional manufacturing in terminal decline, Lynch's beautiful photos could, one day, be all we have left of Britain's industrial past. The Factory Photographs will be displayed at The Photographers’ Gallery (tpg.org.uk) until 30 March 2014. The associated book is published by Prestel (prestel.com) Obsolete: This photo, taken in Los Angeles in 1980, makes plain the impact of modern technology on industry; once cutting-edge machines now outdated and abandoned . End of an era: The Industrial Revolution of the 1700s has now petered out, edged out by modern technology, as this bleak photo taken in 2000 shows .","The Factory Photographs were taken between 1980 and 2000 .
