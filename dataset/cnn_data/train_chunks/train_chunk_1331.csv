"British Muslim extremists are offering teenage girls in the UK money to marry Islamic State militants waging bloody jihad in Syria and Iraq, it has been claimed. Supporters of the terror group are believed to be offering cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters. It is understood that ISIS channels money for the would-be jihadis' payment and travel expenses through international money wire systems, enabling the group's UK cell to offer significant sums of cash to disenfranchised teenagers, many of whom are from poverty-stricken backgrounds. The whole grooming process operates using the same techniques of trust-building and reward-offering employed by sexual predators, and is designed to turn the teenage girls into jihadi brides. Grooming: Islamic State supporters are believed to be using British intermediaries to offer cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters . 'Terror twins': Zahra (left) and Salma (right) Halane, who have 28 GCSE's between them, were groomed online and flew to join ISIS. The 16-year-olds ran away from their Manchester home on 26 June . Jihadi bride: Another Briton who left Britain to join ISIS is Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare (left). Here she is pictured alongside her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr. Their marriage was arranged by his mother . News of ISIS' secret teenage terror trade was revealed in The Times today, following a three month investigation by the newspaper in which reporters posed as two schoolgirls. It exposes how vulnerable young British Muslims are to ISIS' chilling network or groomers - and reveals that police are taking seriously the idea that the terror group has already provided money and travel assistance to children under the age of 16. Posing as Aisha, a 17-year-old girl from East London, the reporters - who have not been named for their own safety - were swamped with approaches from ISIS sympathisers, and were eventually put in touch with an alleged Syria-based extremist of Lebanese origin named Abu Abbas al-Lubnani. Having built something of a rapport with the jihadi - including getting him to prove his authenticity by asking him to send photos taken in Raqqa with a banner reading 'Aisha' - al-Lubnani then offered to introduce 'Aisha' to a British intermediary, who would then pay for her to travel to the Islamic State. A surveillance operation followed, in which investigators identified a white British Muslim convert as the prime candidate for being the UK-based jihadi who offered to pay for two girls to travel to Syria. The man reportedly also offered intensive coaching on how the girls could avoid drawing attention to themselves before and during their journey to the Middle East. Terror: Aqsa Mahmood was reported missing by her Scottish parents a year ago before surfacing in Syria in February. She is now a prominent member of ISIS' all-female police force in de facto capital Raqqa . Shocking: Earlier this year Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria. She was standing alongside young children at the time . Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey and went on to Syria . Police in Britain have been urging families to contact them if they believe their loved-ones are trying to leave for Syria so they can be stopped. Detectives say young women are being manipulated online with glamorous descriptions of life in Syria with ISIS, only to suffer a miserable existence when they arrive. Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey. She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl Samya Dirie, who she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters. Police failed to stop schoolgirl Miss Dirie despite being told she had run away with her passport. Three hours after her panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey. Her exit may have prompted the urgent response in the latest Heathrow case. In June 'terror twins' Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married in the war-torn nation since disappearing overnight from their home. Both have insisted that Allah had 'chosen' for them to be in Syria. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. Bodies of Islamic State militants killed during fighting in Koban, Iraq were photographed this morning . Details of the investigation came after it was revealed that police stopped a plane at Heathrow just seconds before it was due to take off because a 15-year-old girl on board was planning to fly to Turkey before continuing her journey on to join ISIS militants in Syria. The young girl had secretly saved up to buy a ticket from London to Istanbul and planned to continue her journey through Turkey and over the border into Syria. It appears it was treated as a missing person's inquiry and she was not arrested. Her family, who had no idea she harboured extremist views, reported her missing and Scotland Yard tracked her down to a passenger jet about to leave Britain. After rushing to Heathrow, officers realised the girl's plane was already taxiing along the runway, so the pilot was ordered to stop and the girl  taken home. It later emerged that a second British 15-year-old girl was not spotted on board and was able to continue her journey to join the Islamic State in Syria. A United Nations official says one of the two Austrian girls who fled their middle class homes in Vienna earlier this year to fight in Syria has definitely died in the conflict. The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic, 17, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic, whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria. They first went to the Turkish capital Ankara by plane, and then on into the southern Turkish region of Adana. After that, their tracks were lost. But they appeared on social networking sites branding Kalashnikov rifles and surrounded by armed men - photos which Austrian police said acted as recruitment posters for young girls.

The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic (left), 16, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic (right), whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria . David Scharia, a senior Israeli expert of the United Nations Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTED) said: 'We received information just recently about two 15-year-old girls, of Bosnian origin, who left Austria, where they had been living in recent years; and everyone, the families and the intelligence services of the two countries, is looking for them. He added: 'Both were recruited by Islamic State. One was killed in the fighting in Syria, the other has disappeared.' His confirmation comes three months after the Austrian government said it had informed both sets of parents of the girls that one of them might have been killed.","ISIS supporters offer cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls to join them .

'This individual has been selling false and fabricated stories to the tabloids for years about Kourtney Kardashian and her son, Mason.  Scott Disick is Mason’s father,' Todd Wilson told the website.

Close: The couple left their young children at home to enjoy some alone time . Lots to talk about: With her sister Khloe reportedly having marriage difficulties, big sister Kourtney is sure to be concerned .

"A corrupt policewoman has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for stealing thousands of road crash victims' details and selling them to compensation lawyers. Sugra Hanif, 27, from Banbury in Oxfordshire, was branded 'a disgrace to her uniform' for stealing details from a Thames Valley Police computer for her married lover Raza Khan, 27 to sell on. Today Hanif and Khan were each jailed for three years at Winchester Crown Court for a scam that could have made the pair up to £1million in referral fees had they not been caught. Guilty: Sugra Hanif (pictured left, and with her solicitor, right)  was branded 'a disgrace to her uniform' for stealing details from a Thames Valley Police computer for her married lover Raza Khan to sell on . As part of the scam, Hanif - a former . officer with Thames Valley Police - would access the Police National . Computer and make notes of personal information from people involved in . car crashes. It is believed they accessed 2,456 files in total. She . and her former lover Khan, from Handsworth in Birmingham, would then . make phone calls pressuring the victims into making accident claims with . no-win no-fee legal firms. Crime: Hanif would access police computers and steal personal information from road crash victims . Each . referral would earn Khan’s fledgling accident claim management business . SR Auto Repairs between £700 pounds and £800 pounds. Before the conspiracy was detected in December 2011, Khan earned around £26,400 in only seven months. Prosecutors estimated the pair stood to have made more than £1million pounds if they had not been caught. Jailing . the pair at Winchester Crown Court today, Judge Andrew Barnett said: . 'It is a serious undermining of the public’s confidence, and that gross . breach of trust, Hanif, is something for which you in the main are . responsible.' 'You have . behaved in an appalling fashion. Bearing in mind the trust imposed on . you by the public and those who employ you. You are a disgrace to the . uniform you once wore.' 'You have let down the police service; you have let down your colleagues because their reputation has been tarnished.' The . court heard Thames Valley Police could face a fine of around £500,000 . pounds from the information commissioner because of the data breach, . which was said to be unprecedented. Some 5,000 members of the public could also take individual legal action against the force, the sentencing hearing was told. Hanif was sacked by Thames Valley Police after she was convicted earlier this month, following a seven-week trial. She . had been having a extra-marital affair with Khan and claimed had been . pressured into obtaining the data by him after he threatened to tell her . devout Muslim father about their relationship.

He also had a number of other convictions for violent offences going back to 2002. Khan's . wife Paramjeet Kaur, 26, had also been charged with conspiracy to . commit misconduct in a public office.

"Stephen Collins has blamed three separate incidents of child molestation on 'exhibitionist urges', maintaining in a new interview that he is not a pedophile and crediting 20 years of therapy and faith for helping him move on from the 'unspeakable' acts. The shamed former 7th Heaven star insists he has inappropriately touched a minor on only one occasion, in 1973, but went on to expose himself to two other underage girls between then and 1994. During a taped sit-down with Katie Couric for 20/20, that will air in-full on at 10pm Friday, the 67-year-old - who is being investigated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department on molestation allegations but has not been charged with any crime - said that while his actions were 'terrible', he does not fit the definition of a pedophile. 'A pedophile is someone who is mainly or wholly attracted to children. I'm not,' he told Couric. 'I had a distortion in my thinking where I acted out in those ways. 'But I'm absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted to children. I'm just not.' Scroll down for video . Confessional: Stephen Collins gives a taped interview for 20/20 where he denies being a pedofile, despite admitting to three separate incidences with underage girls between 1973 and 1994 . Interview: Collins, of 7th Heaven fame, will appear on 20/20 in an interview with Katie Couric tonight,  where he says he's a changed man who hasn't touched an underage girl since 1994 . The actor added that he has 'big boundary issues', but stressed he is not a sexual predator. When pressed by Couric on reports that he was also attracted to young boys, Collins said he has never felt such urges. According to Collins, the first incident occurred in 1973, when a girl had come to visit and stay with him and his first wife. After his wife had gone to sleep, he and the girl were watching TV together. 'I took her hand and moved it in such a way that she was touching me inappropriately,' he said. 'I knew that something unthinkably wrong had just happened that I couldn't take back.' He also said he exposed himself to a teenage girl in 1982 and another in1994. He said he has had no such urges since 1994. 'I'm absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted, to children. I'm just not.' Collins said he's been in treatment and religious counseling for 20 years. 'I'm a human being with flaws,' he said. 'I have dealt with them very, very strongly and commitedly in my private life.' Excerpts of the interview - which will stream on Yahoo tonight - have been released this week. They coincide with a woman who claims to have been molested by Collins telling TMZ that the actor is lying. The woman, who is in her 50s but has not been named, told the website Collins gain sexual gratification during the alleged incident and ejaculated while making her touch him inappropriately. Collins has previously said  'there was no gratification' during the three encounters he had - calling them an 'impulsive act' that's 'haunted' him ever since. The woman told TMZ: 'Stephen is minimizing the incident. It was not just a spontaneous touching ... that aggression resulted in him ejaculating.' She also slammed his decision not to apologize to her and another girl he targeted, adding: 'His assertion that he wanted to avoid reopening an old wound seems nonsensical to me.' The woman refuses to believe there were just three victims - as Collins stated in a taped confession leaked to TMZ by his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant during their bitter divorce proceedings. She has filed a police report with the NYPD  - although it's believed any case would be rejected because of the statute of limitations. Scandal: Collins is best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together-right) released a taped confession that was obtained TMZ . The woman adds: 'Why isn't he donating any disposable income, beyond what he needs to survive, to a child-abuse charity? Maybe he should at least try apologizing to his victims.' Collins first admitted to the three incidents in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine. None of his victims have ever publicly came forward. In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show . He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' Collins says he was 25-years-old during the first incident in 1973. He says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 'It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.' Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994. Bitter divorce: Faye Grant, pictured with Stephen Collins in both images, leaked a tape of the actor confessing to molesting girls to TMZ . 'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior. For the past 20 years, Collins says he's been undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day. These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls. 'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.' Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'. The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship. The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge. The shamed actor appeared alongside Jessica Biel in 7th Heaven from 1996 . The couple of nearly 30 years filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets. Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter. She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ. Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim. 'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.' When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims. But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'. Los Angeles police investigated him in 2012 and reviewed their case in October but a spokeswoman said Friday there were no updates on its status. Los Angeles Sheriff's Department detectives also opened an investigation into Collins over an early 1980s incident, but as of Friday had not presented their case to prosecutors. Collins and Grant remain in divorce proceedings.","Actor was first accused of abuse in October, when his ex-wife released a private taped confession from a therapy session .

"Thug rice, Wu-Tangy dressing and Blood money sausage. These are only some of the items on a planned 'hip hop tribute' menu at a Washington DC restaurant that have left a bad taste in the mouths of prospective patrons. Graffiato, an Italian-inspired restaurant run by celebrity chef Mike Isabella, is hosting a special $65-a-plate dinner February 2 dedicated to the West Coast/East Coast hip hop rivalry of the '90s. Earlier this week, the popular eatery shared on its website the menu for the upcoming event honoring legendary rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. 'In bad taste': This hip hop -themed menu created for an upcoming dinner at the Washington DC restaurant Graffiato has sparked a backlash on social media, prompting the owner to rethink the dishes . Themed dinner party: Graffiato is hosting a $65-a-plate dinner in February honoring the West Coast/East Coast hip hop rivalry of the 90s . The five-course prix fixe meal crafted by Mr Isabella and his team included such dishes as blood money sausage; Lil Kimchee; thug rice dyed black using cuddle fish ink; cali-cali cobb salad with 'Wu-tangy dressing ' and cheddar, and milk chocolate chip blunts for dessert, according to Washington City Paper. As soon as the menu became public, it was universally derided on social media for being offensive, insensitive and downright racist, according to some critics. The ferocious backlash eventually prompted the DC restaurant situated in the capital’s Chinatown neighborhood to scrap the tribute menu and go back to the drawing board. In a statement to the media, Mike Isabella's spokesperson stated that the menu for the hip hip-themed dinner was a 'work in progress.' In an email to Daily Mail Friday, Mr Isabella explained in his own words that the idea to host a dinner paying homage to the legends of hip hop was inspired by his and his staff's musical tastes. 'I grew up listening to hip hop and many of my chefs and cooks love this kind of music too,' Mr Isabella wrote. The chef and restaurateur pointed out that to this day he enjoys listening to songs by Tupac and Biggie Smalls - two of his favorite artists. Addressing the negative response to his menu choices, Mr Isabella said that 'some of it has been taken out of context.' Idol: Chef/owner Mike Isabella, who appeared on season 6 of Top Chef (left), has dedicated the upcoming dinner to late rapper Tupac Shakur (right) and his rival Biggie Smalls . One of the items on the now-scrapped menu for the event paid tribute to the Wu-Tang clan . The listing for the event on Graffiato’s website reads: 'Join us on February 2 at 8pm, for our first food and art pairing dinner: a culinary tribute to Tupac, Biggie and the East Coast/West Coast hip hop rivalries of the ’90s. ‘The evening’s dishes are directly inspired by some of the biggest hits of these two godfathers of hip hop, and will be accompanied by a DJ playing those tracks, along with others from the era. Opened in 2011, Graffiato specializes in seasonal pizzas and small plates inspired by Chef Isabella’s Italian-American heritage. Isabella is the chef-owner of Graffiato DC, Graffiato Richmond, Kapnos and G in Washington. He appeared on Season Six of the popular TV cooking competition Top Chef and was the runner-up on Top Chef All-Stars.","Chef/owner Mike Isabella is hosting a $65-a-plate dinner at Graffiato restaurant February 2 in honor of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls .

"There is always that fear about cruising. Who else will be on board? Will jumping into the sea be the only option when cornered by a double-glazing salesman struggling to meet his target? The solution is to pick a ship full of enthusiasts bound by a common and familiar theme. Better still, let the ship pick you. Now and then: David with wife Thorunn (left), and in his halcyon days captaining the England cricket team (right) That is what happened to my wife, Thorunn, and me. ITC Sports has been running cricket cruises in the Caribbean for some years, and we have drifted in and out of most of them. This time, we were on for the duration - two weeks on Sea Dream 1, which sits at the boutique end of cruising (or ‘yachting’, as they like to call it). We were some 80 guests in total, including Daily Mail columnist David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd - and Paul Allott, with whom I played cricket through the Eighties. In those days, our accommodation on overseas tours lacked something compared to the luxuries and services of Sea Dream - where we were never far from a rum punch. A little slice of paradise: David sailed aboard the Sea Dream 1 - a small ship perfect for the Caribbean . My task as one of the hosts was simple. I had to be convivial with a mixed bunch of cricket lovers from all walks of life. When I was pretending to captain England in the mid-Eighties, the Kensington Oval in Barbados was a different beast. The ground was rebuilt for the 2007 World Cup, and is now an excellent stadium. When the great Desmond Haynes and Gordon Greenidge were blasting my bowlers to the boundary, the main stand looked like a long chicken shed. On this trip, three days of T20 cricket were more of an interlude to the rest of the voyage. The itinerary had us picking up the ship in Antigua - from where we headed to St Barths, Barbados, Canouan, Mayreau, the Tobago Cays (the setting for some of the Pirates Of The Caribbean films), Petit St Vincent, St Lucia and Martinique. A place you might find difficult to leave: The cruise set sail from the sunshine island of Antigua . Although Barbados has been a building site for the past 30 years, it is still a favourite of mine. My advice it to head north towards Speightstown, where the pace is slower and the prices lower. This was a day off from our duties on board, and we lingered until we realised we were due to host a table back on Sea Dream for dinner - something that is always an occasion. Afterwards, those with unquenchable thirsts head to the top deck and the open-air bar for further refreshment. Or, if the weather was not so fair, to the piano bar a deck below. Either way, there’s always someone with a cocktail shaker at the ready. Our most outrageous meal was on Mayreau — at Robert Righteous and De Youths Seafood Restaurant and Bar. What a day that was. Mayreau is not much larger than the big cruise liners so common in the Caribbean. A different side of the Caribbean: David is especially fond of Speightstown, in the north-west of Barbados . We anchored off the beach, and were ferried ashore. The first treat was caviar and prosecco in the shallows just off the beach - with the crew, some still in uniform, and Franck, the ever-handy head sommelier, in his floral beach shirt, dispensing Beluga caviar and blinis off a surfboard. No sooner had the big pot of Beluga been emptied than it was time for a barbecue lunch, with the ship’s chefs in full cry. This was a meal that needed working off, so in the afternoon it was time for beach cricket. I survived at the crease for an unusually long time, thanks to half the bowling not reaching my end, and because LBW was ruled out. Now you must believe me when I say such a voyage isn’t just about the eating and drinking. The itinerary was structured so that a lot of the sailing between islands was done overnight. Day job: David on commentary duties with fellow England cricket legend Ian Botham (left) On several mornings, we were already anchored in the next gorgeous little bay by the time the alarm roused me from my slumbers. There were sun-loungers on the top deck (and on the pool deck for those in need of Vitamin D) - and even indoor golf for those who have not, like me, sworn off the dreaded game. There were also quiet areas, a library with more than enough books  for even the most anti-social traveller - and charts to show you where you’d been - and were going next. Inevitably, our two weeks disappeared all too quickly. But in that time, we renewed our friendships with those loyal ITC customers with whom we had travelled before - and we enjoyed the company of new faces. I hope to be invited back.

"Billionaire George Soros has offered his Brazilian soap star ex-girlfriend $250,000 to 'persuade her' to drop a $50million lawsuit, it has been claimed. Jilted actress Adriana Ferreyr, 31, launched legal proceedings against the 81-year-old mogul in August after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9million apartment in Manhattan, New York. The staggering lawsuit said she was emotionally tortured, harassed and abused by Soros, who denies all the claims - during an alleged fight when he told her he had given the apartment to another lover. Battle: Soros' lawyers last night finally filed their response to Adriana Ferreyr's  lawsuit, which claimed she was emotionally tortured, harassed and abused by the 82-year-old . But now it has emerged that, when she threatened to take him to court, Soros approached his former lover's lawyer cousin Mauricio Carneiro with a cash offer. An email obtained by the New York Daily News, from Soros' lawyer William Zabel to Carnerio, is reported to have made the offer. It is said to have said: 'Pursuant to your conversation with George Soros... I understand you may wish to be helpful with the situation.' Carneiro replied that he 'could not be bought' and was 'shocked that George called me to offer me $250,000 in order to get my sympathy, get rid of her lawyers and settle the case.' Zabel admitted that the email had been sent, but that it was not a bribe. He told the News: 'George had met him before and he liked him. He had reached out to him because he is a lawyer and a relative and he hoped to settle the case before it went to court. It is in no way a bribe.' Jilted: Adriana Ferreyr is suing her ex for $50 million, claiming he physically abused her and broke a promise to buy her a home . Ferryr broke her silence in August about her five-year relationship with the financier known as the Man Who Broke the Bank of England after making millions during the 1992 UK currency crisis. Despite . their 53-year age gap, she insisted their relationship was 'respectful . and loveable' before the acrimonious split, followed by her allegations . of physical abuse. Ferreyr, a former child actor and star of Portuguese McDonald’s commercials, first met Soros five years ago. She . told the New York Post: 'For five years, he was my boyfriend. He was . respectful and loveable. Then, suddenly, he changed and became cruel. I . don't know why he would do this to me.' 'He treated me with a lot of . respect,' she said. 'When we first started dating, I would see him every . weekend at his house in Bedford. He was very nice, very sweet, very . loveable... We travelled and went to St Bart's. 'As far as I was concerned, this . was a proper, loving, committed relationship. He introduced me to people . as his girlfriend after a year. We attended events. I met his friends. I . met his business associates. Upscale apartment: The building at 30 East 85th Street - where the love rivals are residing - contains luxury properties in a prime Manhattan location . 'Some people don't understand the . age difference, but for me, it wasn't a problem. I wouldn't go out with . a muscular guy who has tattoos, but I wouldn't call other people . strange because they have different taste than me. 'He is a likeable person. He is . outspoken. I spent a lot of time with him, and I had a lot of feelings . for him. We had a happy, normal relationship,' she continued. Ferreyr said she was . monogamous during their time together, and was hoping to 'settle down' with Soros, who she said never lavished her with money or gifts . during their first few years together. Eventually, however, she said he offered . to buy her an apartment. And she found her 'dream home' - a $1.9million . condo at 30 E 85th St - just two streets from him. 'I did a lot of research on it. I . made sure it was a good investment. I explained to him what good a deal . it was, why I loved it, why it would be a great place to live.... 'He . told me, ""I am going to buy it. I am going to do this for you, ""' she . said. But Ferreyr claims the day . after they signed off on the paperwork in December, Soros had a . change of heart, and offered the apartment to 39-year-old Tamiko Bolton, described as his 'travelling nurse'. 'We were in bed, and he just . replied coldly and bluntly that he had given (the apartment) to his . other girlfriend. I got emotional and cried... He just said, ""I don't . care."" I was in bed with him. It was horrifying for me,' Ferreyr . said. The soap star has also claimed . that Soros slapped her in the face and attempted to choke her as they . argued over the property in bed together. According to a lawsuit filed in . Manhattan Supreme Court, in the inevitable row which followed, 'Soros . slapped Ferreyr across the face and proceeded to put his hands . around her neck in an attempt to choke her.' Ferreyr claims she managed to evade him and picked up a glass lamp to protect herself. Soros then allegedly grabbed the lamp and tried to hit her with it, narrowly missing. She claims she ran into the office next to Soros’s bedroom and called police. According to the lawsuit, Ferreyr claims Soros twice broke promises to buy her flats in the . building - once again after a brief reconciliation. Lavish: Sample pictures showing one of the $1.9million apartments at 30 East 85th Street in Manhattan . 'When... I saw him again, he was . loving. We got back together and started dating again. Then he invited . me for tea at his house. He said to me, 'Go look for an apartment. I owe . you an apartment anyway,' she told the Post. She said she found a $4.3million . apartment in the same building. But when she told him about it he . pretended to know nothing about it. To make matters worse, Ferryr and Bolton now live in the same New York apartment block. And after learning his ex was . going to rent a flat in the same building anyway, Soros hired private . security men to ‘follow and intimidate’ her, Ferreyr claims. Hungarian-born Soros, while being a notable philanthropist championing liberal . causes, is also known as the 'Man Who Broke The Bank Of England'. He . made an estimated £600 million during the 1992 'Black Wednesday' UK . currency crises, correctly predicting that the British government would . have to devalue the pound. On . 16 September, 1992, his fund sold short more than $10 billion worth of . pounds, profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise . its interest rates or float its currency - finally withdrawing from the . European Exchange Rate Mechanism and devaluing the pound. In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.4 billion. According to Ferreyr's suit, Soros ‘not only breached his multiple promises…but he proceeded to . engage in a deliberate and malicious campaign of extreme and outrageous . harassment and intimidation against Ferreyr, which has directly resulted . in her suffering and continuing to suffer severe emotional distress and . damages.' She claims their confrontation . traumatised her to the point she was ‘unable to function in her . day-to-day life’ and that she has since had to have treatment for . post-traumatic stress disorder. Her lawyer, Robert Hantman, said . it was unfortunate she had to resort to court action as she had hoped to . settle the dispute privately. He said: ‘It’s 1/7000th of his wealth. She just wants what he promised her.’ Soros strongly denies the allegations. William Zabel, Soros’s lawyer, called the suit ‘frivolous and entirely without merit’. Although he admitted his client . had an ‘on-again, off-again’ relationship with Ferreyr, he said the . complaint was ‘riddled with false charges and is obviously an attempt . to extract money from my client, who is known to be a very rich man’. He added: ‘The police . investigated the incident referred to and concluded that no assault . occurred. George Soros did not slap, choke or throw a lamp at her. A source close to Soros, whose birthday was yesterday, said: ‘This is nothing but a woman scorned who is out to get paid. These claims are outrageous and he will seek to dismiss them at the earliest opportunity. ‘George is dealing with this well – this is a man who survived the Holocaust. The suggestion he attacked her is without merit.’ Headache: Mr Soros has denied that he physically abused Miss Ferreyr and promised to buy her an apartment . Ferreyr remains undetoured. 'George is so powerful he thinks . he can get rid of anyone he wants. But I am not going away. I am going . to fight,' she told the Post. Soros’s private life is rarely . touched on in the U.S. Married and twice divorced, he has five . children.  In the past few years, his reported girlfriends have . included the violinist Jennifer Chun and former Miss Russia Anna Malova.","Brazilian soap star Adriana Ferreyr suing mogul .

"A protective Nevada father who invited an accused molester and child porn criminal to numerous charity events he organized has attempted to attack the man in court. Rick Cedeno was sitting in the dock of Las Vegas Justice Court this week during the hearing for Christopher Sena, 48, who is facing 58 charges of sex abuse against children, including incest and bestiality, in what police have described 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory'. Cedano told My News 3 of his outage over the case, having had Sena take photographs at several events he help plan for child-centric local charities. 'Just by looking at him i couldn't contain myself,' Cedano told the station. 'I was full of rage and anger. It took all my strength not to put my hands on him.' 'He betrayed us. He's a monster.' 'I couldn't contain myself': Rick Cedano (left) tried to approach Christopher Sena (sitting)  Las Vegas Justice Court this week, but was restrained by police as he went to the dock . 'Get back': Police threatened the protective father with weapons to get him to leave. Cedano has had associations with Sena through local charities . Scared: Christopher Sena, appearing in court this week, looks frightened as Cedano comes at him . Accused: Christopher Sena, 47, allegedly sexually abused children for more than a decade. Rick Cedano (right), a local father, knew Sena through local charity organizations and tried to approach him in court . Sena, his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife, Terrie Sena, 43, who all lived together in a trailer in Las Vegas, are accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years. Some victims were relatives, while Christopher Sena also encouraged his children to bring their friends over to the house so that he could abuse them, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report. Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. One woman who says she was sexually abused told investigators that she believes her high school friends were assaulted by Sena. Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house. Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said. To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police. Arrests: He lived in a trailer with his wife Deborah Sena, 50, (left) and ex-wife, Terrie Sena, 43, (right). The women are also accused of engaging in sexual activity with children . Christopher Sena was arrested in September when Deborah, who recently split from him, another woman and a child told a family attorney about the alleged abuse. The attorney went to police, as is required by law, and a SWAT team stormed the house on September 18 to arrest Sena and seize his recording equipment. Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children, which led to the arrests of Deborah Sena and Terrie Sena last week. At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. One alleged victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them. That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that he would fall pregnant with Sena's child, police said. Scene: After his wife told a lawyer about the abuse, Christopher Sena was arrested at their home (pictured) in September. Officers seized electronic equipment and allegedly found videos of the abuse . Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three and continued until he was a teen, while another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade. But according to police he was not the only one carrying out the abuse. His ex, Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena. But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'. Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife. Authorities also allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband in August, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August . Deborah says her husband said that, if she loved him, she would do what he wanted her to do . She claims her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported. Christopher Sena is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. Police said they expect more charges to be brought against the trio. All three have been held without bail.","Christopher Sena, 48, his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, and his ex-wife Terrie Sena, 43, have all been accused of sexually abusing children .

Gordon has been heroic all night but there was no chance of him getting a hand to that. Guarin unleashes a rasping shot from outside the box into the left corner and that will be that for Celtic. Inter were all set to go through but Guarin's shot is the icing on the cake. That wasn't too far off from the substitute. The contest has really slowed down and tightened up in the last 20 minutes of so. Inter look happy to see this out but are living dangerously. Final throw of the dice by Ronny Deila with the introduction of Kris Commons. Now they just need a free-kick 20 or so yards out... Can the Celtic midfielder make a difference late on in this contest? Inter are looking more and more frustrated here. Heading into the final quarter, Inter are going through as things stand but Ronny Deila's men are still in this and are looking dangerous on the break. Click the above link to get an update from Tottenham's clash . Click to above link for an update from Liverpool's game in Turkey . That's the first thing Gordon's done wrong all night. The Celtic keeper is booked for time wasting from the kick out. Bit of a harsh call. The Inter midfielder takes a theatric tumble in the box after a challenge Izaguirre but it was never going to be a penalty. John Guidetti was becoming increasingly frustrated up front. His replacement by James Forrest leaves Celtic without a recognised striker but with the chance to try and use the Scotland international's pace through the middle. The Swedish striker doesn't look too pleased to be taken off but it's been a tough hour for the Celtic forward. The Argentie is put through on goal but Gordon pulls off another point-blank save to keep Celtic in the contest. They'll be calling him Gandalf Gordon by the end of the night if he keeps this up! Follow the link for an update from Tottenham's clash . Hernanes unleashes a powerful curling shot from outside the box but Gordon sees it nice and early and gets down to parry the shot away. The Celtic keeper is having quite the night in goal. Izaguirre fires a long pas which splits the Inter defence and Guidetti looked clean through there but the Celtic frontman is called back for offside. The action doesn't stop there though as that man Palacio wastes a great chance as he blazes his shot high over Craig Gordon into the San Siro stands. Massive 45 minutes ahead for 10-man Celtic. Celtic will have been thankful for the half-time whistle. Virgil van Dijk's red card leaves Ronny Deila's side with it all to do in the second half. 0-0 as we break for half-time. As things stand, Inter will go through on away goals. Heroic stuff from Craig Gordon in goal as he pulls off two incredible point-blank saves. The Celtic keeper has single-handedly kept his side in the contest in the last 10 minutes. Van Dijk' sending off has had a huge effect on the contest. The momentum has definitely swung towards Inter as we approach half-time. Mauro Icardi ensured referee Ivan Kruzliak wouldn't forgot to show Van Dijk a second yellow as he waved an imaginary card. Two soft, but needless, bookings. Mackay-Steven sacrificed to bring Efe Ambrose into action. Titanic task for Celtic now. Mauro Icardi beats Van Dijk for pace down the left wing and the Celtic defender pulls the Inter player's shirt. Silly play. A second yellow card soon follows and Celtic are down to 10-men. Hernanes swings in the free kick and Gordon makes a superb save to deny Icardi in the box. Emilio Izaguirre looking vulnerable when Inter attack down their right. The Honduran left-back has been pretty poor in his distribution and positioning. Celtic otherwise pretty composed. Virgil van Dijk catches Palacio from behind and follows through. The Celtic defender got plenty of the ball but the Argentine takes a right tumble. Van Dijk is booked and will miss Celtic's next game in Europe - should they progress tonight.. Ronny Deila will be delighted with his side's workrate so far. The visitors are pressing high up the pitch and giving Inter no time on the ball. Inter have plenty of possession but have created very little so far. Stefan Johansen leading Celtic's pressing game with typically high energy levels. The Norwegian midfielder also helping to stretch the Inter defence with some clever runs. A very open game so far. Stuart Armstrong gets goal side of Santon and goes down in a heap in the Inter box, but play is waved on by the referee. Armstrong is furious. No doubt there was contact from Santon but Armstrong's antics didn't help his cause. Promising play from Celtic so far. Mackay-Steven shows good pace down the right but is brought down by D'Ambrosio. Medel, Shaqiri and Icardi are looking dangerous in midfield but Celtic are containing the trio thus far.. Gary Mackay-Steven is put clean through on goal but Inter keeper Carrizo stays big to deny the Celtic forward. The game has sparked into life with Palacio unleashing a long-range shot but Craig Gordon is alive to the danger. Nice open feel to the game so far. Adam Matthews was down getting treatment but the Celtic centre back is up and running again. Would have been a huge early blow for the visitors Matthews was forced off.

Good evening and welcome to Sportmail's live coverage of Celtic's crunch second leg Europa League clash against Inter Milan at the San Siro. A late Fredy Guarin goal in the 88th minute sent Inter Milan through to the last 16 of the Europa League and sent 10-man Celtic out of the competition after a valiant display at the San Siro. Guarin struck from outside the area to give Roberto Mancini's side a 1-0 win on Thursday. Defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for Celtic after only 36 minutes for two bookable offences. Going down to 10 men made it harder for Ronny Deila's side to commit men into attack, having conceded three away goals in the 3-3 first leg draw last week. But they produced a valiant display until Guarin lashed in two minutes from time.","Inter Milan progress to next round as Celtic crash out .

"Andy Murray will take a detour to Spain later this month, as a last-ditch effort to reach the season-end climax in London after suffering yet another setback on Thursday.

"Spain begin the defence of their European Championship title against Macedonia in a qualifier on Tuesday evening but a crucial selection dilemma faces head coach Vicente del Bosque ahead of the tie. Who should Del Bosque start as No 1 - Real Madrid veteran Iker Casillas, or Manchester United stopper David de Gea? It seems peculiar to think that Casillas' position in goal is under threat, yet the voices calling for the 33-year-old to be replaced are growing in both number and volume. VIDEO Scroll down to see Remy fire past David de Gea . Old vs new: Iker Casillas (left) and David de Gea (right) are vying for Spain's No 1 jersey against Macedonia . Looking on: De Gea (left) watches as Casillas (centre) saves a shot during Spain training on Sunday . Experience: Casillas has made a record 156 appearances for Spain since he made his debut in 2000 . Talking tactics: De Gea (right), Casillas (centre) and Francisco Casilla (left) talk during Spain training . Casillas has won a national record 156 caps, he skippered Spain to their first ever World Cup triumph, and he led his nation to an unprecedented third major title in a row since his debut 14 years ago. De Gea, on the other hand, has been capped just twice for his country and playing just 97 minutes in the process. If the choice was to be measured on just experience and pedigree alone, there is no comparison - yet when form, age and ability are introduced, it becomes a far closer contest. Whereas Casillas crumbled under the pressure during the World Cup - including putting in a calamitous showing against Holland in Spain's 5-1 group stage loss - and has failed to nail down the No 1 jersey at Real, De Gea has been one of the bright sparks in Louis van Gaal's otherwise disastrous reign at Old Trafford to date. The 23-year-old struggled during his first season in the Premier League but, in the three campaigns since, he has become one of the finest 'keepers in the league - assured under the high ball, cool in one-on-one situations and superb as a shot-stopper. Save: De Gea (right) makes a save  from Karim Benzema during Spain's 2-0 friendly loss to France last week . Glory: Casillas (back centre) has lifted an unprecedented three major trophies as Spain captain . Nightmare: Casillas endured a torrid World Cup campaign, including a disastrous display against Holland . De Gea was between the sticks for Spain's 2-0 loss to France last week and made some crucial saves to keep the score respectable. The feeling around the country is that Del Bosque may part with the old - Xabi Alonso and Xavi have already retired - and try and blood in a new generation of players, including at goalkeeper. Jose Mourinho dropped Casillas two years ago and, although many thought it was merely a trademark Special One-style move designed to cement his authority, the goalkeeper has not recovered since. His position as Real's first choice has not been assured throughout the whole of Carlo Ancelotti's reign at the club, but he has been an ever-present in the Spain line-up during that time. If rumours are to be believed, however, then Casillas may no longer be No 1 for club or country. Step forward David de Gea...

"She may be dressed down in a simple white T-shirt and parka jacket – but one part of Kim Sears’ outfit certainly stands out. Balancing two cups of coffee as she picked up her food shopping, Miss Sears gave the first glimpse of her enormous diamond engagement ring from tennis star Andy Murray. The former Wimbledon champion proposed to his girlfriend last month with a ring he chose himself, believed to be worth around £200,000. Scroll down for video . Statement piece: Kim Sears unveiled her ring, right, believed to be at least three carats, while out shopping . Experts said Murray, who has an estimated fortune of £30million and earned £11.5million this year alone, had picked out a ‘perfect statement ring’ for Miss Sears, 27, who has been a constant courtside presence during his career. Diamond jeweller Lewis Malka said the ring appears to be a three-carat diamond, surrounded by smaller stones for an even greater impact. ‘It’s the perfect statement ring of the moment; every girl wants a large diamond and this is an exquisite piece,’ Mr Malka added. ‘Knowing how much of a perfectionist Andy is, I would say the colour and clarity is top notch, and I would conservatively value the ring at around £100,000.’ Perfect match: Andy Murray and Miss Sears (left in 2012 and right in 2013) have been dating for nine years . Shopping trip: The ring, which is believed to be worth £200,000 was spotted for the first time on Friday . Wedding bells: Judy Murray, above with her son, said the couple are planning to wed next autumn . But jeweller and diamond expert Vashi Dominguez said he believed the central diamond was a five-carat stone, meaning the ring could be worth more than £200,000. He added: ‘Stepping away from the traditional shapes such as the round solitaire and emerald cut diamond, the couple are clearly choosing a lane of their own with a very loud and bold statement piece.’ Miss Sears – an artist who specialises in pet portraits – has been dating Murray, 27, for nine years. The couple, who live in a £5.6million home in Oxshott, Surrey, are planning their wedding for next autumn, according to Murray’s mother Judy. Courtside: Miss Sears, 27, who has been a constant presence at matches during Murray's tennis career . Celebration: Miss Sears (right) kisses Andy Murray following his win at Wimbledon last year (left) They met in 2005 when 17-year-old Miss Sears was at a tennis championship with her father Nigel Sears, a coach. Murray, who is ranked sixth in the world, has credited Miss Sears with helping him to ‘work better’. Murray wooed her with phone calls and flowers. But she did not allow their burgeoning romance to affect her schoolwork, and she achieved straight As in her exams. The couple managed to keep their relationship quiet – until Murray won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to give his girlfriend a kiss. Young love: The couple, pictured, met in 2005 when 17-year-old Miss Sears was at a tennis championship . Success: Murray, above with Miss Sears and his Wimbledon trophy, has spoken of the strength she gives him . Brief time apart: The couple pictured at Wimbledon in 2009 - the year that they separated for six months . They separated briefly in 2009, reportedly because of the sports star’s video games obsession, but rekindled their romance after six months and have stayed together since. She has been credited with improving the tennis player’s scruffy appearance and helping him to control his fiery temper on court. Murray, who grew up in Dunblane in Scotland, has spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11. ‘I work better in a relationship. Supportive: Speaking after the engagement, Judy Murray (above with Miss Sears) said she was 'thrilled' Planning for the future: Andy Murray has previsously spoken of his want to have children with Miss Sears . Affectionate: The couple embrace after Murray's defeated Federer to win gold at the 2012 London Olympics . At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,’ he said in 2009. In January he jokingly tweeted: ‘We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.’ The message prompted Twitter users to offer their congratulations, until he admitted that it was just ‘tongue-in-cheek’. Murray has already spoken of how he would like to have children with Miss Sears. In his 2013 memoir Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, he wrote: ‘I would like to start a family and try to be a good father. That’s important to me. It’s something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’","Kim Sears gave first glimpse of her diamond engagement ring from Murray .

"Strictly favourite: Caroline Flack has been mad about dance she was at school and trained for three years at a top dance school . Anyone watching this year’s Strictly Come Dancing will be familiar with contestant Caroline Flack’s post-dance routine. After leaving the floor on the arm of hunky dance partner Pasha Kovalev, she’ll often put a hand up to her face to hide her emotions, occasionally even shedding a photogenic tear of relief that they have danced so well. Of course, anyone learning to dance in the very public spotlight of Strictly would be forgiven for being relieved that a routine had gone well. But should TV presenter Caroline really be so surprised that she’s pulled off yet another brilliant, high-octane performance? Or might her reaction be somewhat disingenuous? For, with the 35-year-old tipped to lift the famous glitterball trophy in the series finale tonight, the Mail can reveal for the first time that Caroline is actually a professionally trained dancer. She spent three years studying the discipline at the Bodywork Dance Company in Cambridge, emerging with a musical theatre qualification at the age of 20. While other contestants such as Pixie Lott, Simon Webbe and Frankie Bridge have come under fire for having gone to stage school for years or danced in bands, thereby seemingly gaining an advantage in the competition, Caroline’s managed to keep her previous experience mostly under the radar, citing only a ‘performing arts course’. She even played down her time on BBC3’s Dancing On Wheels show — where she was coached by Strictly professional Kristina Rihanoff to dance with a wheelchair-bound partner — describing it as more of a ‘documentary’ than a contest. But our investigation has discovered that, in fact, Caroline has been mad about dance since she was at school, where she took ballet lessons, performed in shows and later joined a dance troupe. And although you will struggle to find mention of it in the numerous interviews she has done since starting the show, she pursued this after school and is remembered as the cream of the crop of those in her year at Bodywork. The school’s staff also appear to not want to talk about it: they turned down our request for an interview this week. But Karen Laogun, 48, whose 30-year-old son Jay Banks’s time at Bodywork crossed over with Caroline’s, told us: ‘She was a great dancer even back then. ‘She did loads of dance, jazz, the lot. She did a degree and I watched the show for her leaving graduation. I would say she was probably the best in the class, she was really talented.’ One poster to an internet message board observed: ‘My wife (an ex-professional dancer) and I were looking at the images of who is in the line-up for Strictly Come Dancing 2014 and she was surprised to see Caroline Flack. The reason is that Flack used to be two years below her when my wife studied dancing at the Bodywork Dance Company where she (Flack) earned the nickname of “Twiglet”. ‘So, they get a load of “celebs” on, many of whom have never danced, and expect them to compete against a trained professional.’ The BBC this week admitted that Flack had trained in dance but offered no comment on the issue. Scroll down for video . The Harry effect: The 35-year-old was linked to both Harry Styles from One Direction (left) and Prince Harry (right) Even so, Caroline — who until joining the dance competition was more famous for dating a host of much-younger men than any professional achievement — remains the hot favourite to win tonight. William Hill has her odds at 6-4 to win and she’s still the only contestant who has managed the perfect score of 40 in the entire series. Indeed, Caroline has admitted she’s hoping that Strictly will lead to a string of roles on the West End stage. In an interview last week she said: ‘I’ve found I really enjoy this kind of thing, so maybe I could do something like a musical. ‘That was what I wanted to do when I was younger and now I’m thinking, “Maybe I could tread the boards.” ’ After leaving Bodywork, Flackers —as she’s known on Strictly — unsuccessfully auditioned for roles in several West End musicals, including Cats and Les Miserables. A career in TV presenting, which had never been her plan, followed instead. The presenter has also been linked to comedian James Corden (left) and her fellow The Xtra Factor presenter Olly Murs (right) Her big break came in 2002, when she was cast as an actress in the sketch show Bo’Selecta! then began to present the International Pepsi Chart show. A spell on the BBC children’s show TMi followed before she replaced Kirsty Gallacher as the host of Sky One’s Gladiators, then progressed to presenting spin-off shows for The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity . . .Get Me Out Of Here! Perhaps unsurprisingly, during this period she admits to being ‘wild’. She was often found to be propping up the bar of the notorious Hawley Arms pub in Camden, North London, with her drug-addict friends Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty. ‘I’ve turned up for work still drunk,’ she’s admitted. Her chequered love life could also have been termed ‘wild’. Indeed, it’s been so busy that it reads rather like a Who’s Who of the TV entertainment world. In 2011, she was at the centre of a media storm when she started dating One Direction’s Harry Styles, then 17 years old to her 32. Naturally, the band’s fans were appalled. ‘Shame on you!’ cried one. ‘Does he call you Mummy?’ asked another. The backlash was vicious enough for her to seek therapy after the three-month fling ran its course. Caroline seems to collect interesting young men in the way that schoolboys once acquired stamps. Before Harry Styles, there was Prince Harry — whom she reputedly nicknamed ‘jam’ because he was red (headed) and sweet. They went on numerous dates in 2009, after being introduced by a mutual friend while he was on a break from Chelsy Davy, and she even stayed over one night at Clarence House. Caroline has since insisted nothing happened — instead she and Harry, who is five years her junior, were ‘consoling’ each other over broken romances. William Hill has Caroline (pictured left with her dance partner Pasha Kovalev and right during Strictly) at odds at 6-4 to win . She is still the only contestant who has managed the perfect score of 40 in the entire series . ‘He’s a friend and I regard our friendship highly,’ she said. Then there was Declan Donnelly, who was apparently bowled over by her flirtatious nature and long legs back in 2008. Again, she insists there was no romance, although it appears he was — fruitlessly — quite smitten for a time. As was Joe Swash, her co-presenter on the I’m A Celebrity spin-off, Get Me Out Of Here Now! ‘I don’t think anything happened with her and Joe, but she has quite an effect on men,’ said a co-worker on the show. Caroline hopes her Strictly success will lead her to the West End . There was also talk that pop star Olly Murs, her co-host on The X Factor’s ITV2 spin-off The Xtra Factor, was similarly smitten. And comedian James Corden was spotted in a series of clinches with ‘Flacky’ in a dark corner of a Camden pub not long after the Prince Harry affair. That’s not to forget her three-year ‘on/off’ romance with drummer Dave Danger (real name Dave Healy) of The Holloways. A hook-up with comedian Noel Fielding is, however, denied, as are rumours of liaisons with Russell Brand and Jack Osbourne. Yet Caroline’s most serious relationship has been her latest. Indeed, she was so convinced music manager Jack Street — 26 to her 35 — was ‘The One’, she texted him after their first date 18 months ago referring to herself as ‘Caroline Street’. But the pair, who had been living together at her North London flat, recently broke up, breaking her heart. Rumours abound that Street, who manages rising pop star Sam Smith, may have had a wandering eye. Her publicist insists that the split was mutual and amicable. Whatever the truth, her distress is evident. When he reminded fans on Twitter last weekend to: ‘Vote for @carolineflack1. You’d be silly not too [sic],’ she snapped back: ‘Easing your guilt??? Fill yourself with glee jack.’ She quickly deleted the tweet and replaced it with: ‘It’s not bad to be sad.’ Ever the professional, she’s been hiding her distress on Strictly. Let’s hope that if she lifts that glitterball trophy tonight, she may finally get over her broken heart.","Caroline, who dances with Pasha Kovalev, is this year's Strictly favourite .

"Ties: A website associated with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has outlined why it would be acceptable to kill all Jews and annihilate Israel . A website with close ties to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has outlined why it would be acceptable to kill all Jews and annihilate Israel. Conservative site Alef has published a doctrine detailing why the destruction of the nation and the slaughter of all its people would be legally and morally justified. The doctrine, first reported by WND.com, warned that the chance to remove the 'corrupting material' of Israel must not be lost - and that it would only take nine minutes to wipe it out. And it said it was a 'jurisprudential justification' for Iran's Islamic government to then take the helm. The article, written by Khamenei's strategy specialist Alireza Forghani, is now being run on most state-owned conservative sites, indicating it has the regime's support. The crux of dossier said Iran would be justified in launching a pre-emptive strike against Israel because of the threat the Jewish state's leaders are posing against its own nuclear facilities. It said Israel would need U.S. approval and help to carry out such an attack, and that because of acurrent passive climate in America the time for Iran to strike was now. Danger: The dossier said that Ghadr missiles could be used to target urban settlements until the Israelis were wiped out . Listing statistics that reveal 5.7million of Israel's 7.5million citizens are Jewish, the dangerous dossier breaks down the districts with the highest concentration of Jews. Ruler: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited South America recently to build relationships with leaders . It states that Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa contain more than 60 per cent of the Jewish population, which could be hit by Shahab 3 ballistic missiles to easily kill everyone. Sejil missiles, which are almost impossible to intercept, could be used to hit key nuclear plants - including Israel's main engineering centre Rafael and the Eilun and Nebrin plants. They could also targety the Dimona reactor, in the nuclear research centre in Neqeb, which produces 90 per cent of the enriched uranium used in Israel's nuclear weapons. Airports, air force bases, power plants, sewage treatment facilities and energy resources would also be hit. And, the dossier concluded, Ghadr missiles could also be used to target urban settlements until the Israelis were wiped out. The publication of the doctrine comes after Khamenei announced on Friday that Iran would support any nation or group that attacks the 'cancerous tumour' of Israel.",Doctrine says Israel would be wiped out in 9 minutes .
"Long may this continue: here we are, heading into Christmas, and the 20 men who started the season as Barclays Premier League managers all retain their jobs. If it was down to me, they would all still be in their roles on May 24 next year, when the campaign reaches its conclusion. I’d certainly back a rule being brought in that prevented clubs sacking their manager during a season, as there are so many implications from one decision. Alan Pardew came under fire earlier this season and was favourite to be the first boss sacked in the top flight . Newcastle have won six of their last nine games, including victory over previously unbeaten Chelsea . Think about the negative domino effect that is created: if one club is performing poorly and sacks its manager, that means another club will lose their manager through no fault of their own. They, in turn, then have no option but to try to lure someone else away... and on it goes. Why should owners and chairman be able to do that? If the man they started out with in August isn’t delivering, they shouldn’t be allowed to correct their own mistake by inflicting huge change elsewhere: they make the appointments, so they should live with the consequences. How long this stability continues is anyone’s guess, given that there is a lot of scrutiny on some managers, but it is looking like this will be the first season since the opening Premier League campaign in 1992-93 that no managerial changes will have taken place before Christmas. What I have found fascinating this year is how some managers, who were seemingly walking a tightrope not so long ago when they were in the middle of bad runs, are now being hailed for doing ‘brilliant’ jobs. Use Alan Pardew as an example. The outsiders’ perception is that he will have changed his methods to generate Newcastle’s improvement but the reality will be different. New signings, like Ayoze Perez, have settled, while Moussa Sissoko is showing the form he did when first arriving here. Sam Allardyce is another case in point. West Ham’s owners wanted him to play more attacking football and it looks like that is what he has given them. Has Allardyce, with more than 20 years’ coaching experience, completely altered his approach in one summer? Sam Allardyce also came under fire early in the season after an underwhelming start by West Ham . Yet signings like Diafra Sakho (front) have propelled the Hammers to fourth in the Premier League table . Or is it down to two new signings — Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho — making an instant impression and Stewart Downing hitting the form of his life? David Moyes’ recruitment at Everton was excellent. Players such as Tim Cahill and Seamus Coleman were real finds, but during his time at Manchester United he was constantly reminded about how his one big signing, Marouane Fellaini, was struggling. Similarly, look at Brendan Rodgers. He said this week ‘it wasn’t rocket science’ to see why Liverpool’s fortunes had dipped. Losing strikers of the calibre of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge would have an impact on any side. It shows how vital it is to buy well and keep your good players. I’ve long felt managers receive too much criticism when things are going badly and they can receive too much praise when they are winning. Of course, as Sir Alex Ferguson says, the manager must be the most important person at a club — but is he more important than players in securing results? As in any walk of life, there will be some who are more capable of influencing situations than others. Ferguson was a serial winner wherever he went and he could be worth up to 10 points a season for Manchester United. Likewise, Jose Mourinho gets results no matter what club he is at. Both men would tell you they have been blessed to work with great squads of players. Some would say they were fortunate to be able to utilise such talent, but let’s not forget how good they have been at attracting the right men to add to their teams; they know how essential recruitment is. Brendan Rodgers has struggled in his second season at Liverpool after losing Luis Suarez . The Uruguayan hitman now plays in Barcelona, leaving Liverpool with a daunting hole to fill . Every manager I speak to tells me the most important part of the job is recruitment and it is impossible to disagree. When you speak to someone who loses their job abruptly, the first reason they will give is that their signings didn’t work out. Nothing more needs to be said after that. That is why you have to wonder whether there is any point in sacking a manager in the middle of a season. Yes, clubs tend to benefit with an initial boost for the first five or six games when a new man comes in but then, after the honeymoon period, results tend to level back out. Again, there is evidence of men who have come in and transformed a club’s fortunes. Tony Pulis, at Crystal Palace last season, is probably the most spectacular example of someone rescuing a team that looked to be dead and buried. Owen Coyle (with Bolton) and the late Alan Ball (at Southampton in 1994), however, are the only others who have joined a club in the relegation zone after Christmas and been able to keep them in the Premier League. Alan Ball (left) embraces Matthew Le Tissier - the pair helped Southampton escape the drop in 1994 . Crystal Palace were bottom when Tony Pulis took over last December; by May he had taken them to 11th . Changing managers doesn’t mean a club is waving a magic wand to make things better and that is why I keep coming back to players being absolutely essential to the prospects of those who oversee operations from the sidelines. Take Louis van Gaal and Manchester United. When he first arrived at Old Trafford and he had those poor results early on, it was questioned whether he could adapt to the English game or if the methods that had served him well in Europe and with the Dutch national team would pay off. Four months on and United are thriving, but is it just down to Van Gaal? No. United spent huge money to buy top talents, such as Angel di Maria, and have others in Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney who are making a difference. Their balance is starting to look right. And that is essential. If players perform, managers flourish and then you have a winning formula. If players lose their way, the manager, ultimately, will pay. Louis van Gaal has steered United to five straight wins and his side are being talked about as title contenders . De Gea could be player of the year . You have to go back to 1985 for the last time a goalkeeper was recognised as being the outstanding player of a season. Back then, Neville Southall — a man I grew up watching — received the FWA award for the remarkable form he showed when Everton won the League Championship and last week at Old Trafford I began to wonder whether David de Gea might emulate him. There has been a lot of debate about where De Gea stands at the moment in terms of the goalkeepers we have in this country, but there is no doubt in my mind he is now the No 1, having just edged past Chelsea’s Thibaut Courtois. David de Gea has been nothing short of exceptional this season, pulling off a string of fine saves . Thibaut Courtois, who took over from De Gea at Atletico Madrid, has  impressed in his first year in England . Neville Southall won the FWA award in 1985 helping the Toffees to win the First Division title by 13 points . I thought his performance against Liverpool was amazing. He never did anything wrong at any stage in the game and, most importantly, gave his defenders the confidence that he would save them when he was called into action. He looks a different goalkeeper to the one who first arrived in England. If De Gea keeps playing as he has been, it will be difficult to overlook him at the end of the season. With Manuel Neuer in contention for the Ballon d’Or, we are seeing what a difference a top-class goalkeeper makes to a team. History shows how hard it is for No 1s to be singled out — Pat Jennings (1976) and Peter Shilton (1978) are the only keepers to win the PFA gong — but if De Gea maintains this consistency, it might be hard to overlook him. This week I'm excited about... Sky signing Thierry Henry . Thierry Henry is the best of the Premier League era . There has been widespread acclaim for Thierry after he announced his retirement this week — and all of the praise has been richly deserved. At the peak of his powers, it was almost impossible to stop him. I will never forget the moment, during one game at Anfield, when he engaged overdrive and ran away from me with a change of speed I had not witnessed. It felt as though I was trying to chase after someone on a motorbike. He is rightly regarded as the best player of the Barclays Premier League era and looking back at some of the footage that has been shown of him in recent days provided a reminder of just how ahead of the game Thierry was; the medals he won accurately reflect his talent. But if I used to feel apprehensive when I knew I was playing against him, I am looking forward to working with him at Sky. Thierry is intelligent and knows football but he will know he won’t get an easy ride when we are debating the key issues, especially when the focus is on Arsenal!","All 20 Premier League managers who started the season are still in charge .
I'd certainly back a rule being brought in that prevented clubs sacking their manager during a season .

"Despite having his international future publicly questioned by Holland coach Louis van Gaal, Wesley Sneijder collected his 100th cap against Spain. Just two months ago Van Gaal said the Galatasaray midfielder was not doing enough to even warrant a place in the Dutch squad – but on Friday night Sneijder was back in the heart of the Oranje’s midfield on a landmark occasion. Century: Wesley Sneijder made his 100th appearance for Holland against Spain in the World Cup . Influential: Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder is back in favour with coach Louis van Gaal . The diminutive playmaker has had more ups and downs in his international career than most hundred-cap heroes, with a quarter final-winning brace against Brazil and receiving the Silver Ball for being voted the second best player at the 2010 finals contrasting with being stripped of the Dutch captaincy and a late World Cup final defeat after a lacklustre performance. Speaking . earlier this week, Sneijder said he had no intentions of ending his . rollercoaster career which has also taken in spells at Ajax, Real . Madrid, Inter Milan and most recently Galatasaray at club level. ‘When I was 21 or 22 I used to think footballers of 30 were old. They were close to finishing their careers,’ he said. ‘That . happens but there is no way I'm stopping just yet. You think this is my . last tournament? Are you crazy? You won't get rid of me over the next . four years.’ Leader: Despite being dropped as captain in favour of Robin van Persie, Sneijder is a key figure in the squad . Got it, boss: Van Gaal has given Sneijder another chance, despite criticising his form and fitness . ‘Everything that was said about me in the past is forgotten. Also the question of the captaincy. I'm looking only forward.’ The Dutch physios even spoke of their disbelief at Sneijder’s fitness when the national side got together at the end of May – amazing when less than 12 months ago Van Gaal said he was ‘not getting the message’ and questioned his fitness levels. Sneijder became the eight-youngest player to play for the Netherlands when he made his senior debut against Portugal in 2003, just a month after making his Under-21s international bow. Euro 2004 . came slightly too soon for him, contributing just 57 minutes of play off . the bench as the Dutch made it to the semi-finals. But by 2006 Sneijder was ready to take centre stage for his country, although perhaps the Dutch squad weren’t quite as ready. Experience: Wesley Sneijder has played at three World Cups and three European Championships . He . started all four games but was flying home early with his team-mates . after they were eliminated by Portugal in the infamous ‘Battle of . Nuremberg’ that saw 16 yellow cards dished out. Both 2008’s European Championships and the 2010 World Cup saw the number 10 at his best, being named in the team of the tournament for both competitions. Sneijder also picked up the Silver Ball in South Africa as the second-best player behind Diego Forlan, scoring five goals to eclipse his two in Austria and Switzerland. Poland and Ukraine in 2012 wasn’t quite as successful but after a spell out of the side Sneijder will be keen to show Van Gaal and his doubters what they could have missed out on – as well as getting revenge for the final defeat four years ago.","Dutch ace made 100th appearance since debut against Portugal in 2003 .

"Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton on Friday forcefully defended his company's decision to cancel the release of The Interview and had some harsh words for President Obama who earlier today said the movie studio 'made a mistake.' In an exclusive interview Friday with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Lynton insisted that 'we have not given in and we have not backed down.' In a controversial move earlier this week, the studio pulled the plug on the release of The Interview after hackers officially linked to North Korea made terrorist threats against theaters showing the comedy. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton on Friday forcefully defended his company's decision to cancel the release of The Interview . Lynton told CNN Sony does not have the interface necessary to distribute the movie on the web directly . Harsh words: On Friday, President Obama said during a press conference Sony 'made a mistake' when it decided to cancel the release of the political satire . 'The president, the press, and the public are mistaken as to what actually happened,' Lynton said. 'We do not own movie theaters. We cannot determine whether or not a movie will be played in movie theaters.' After Wednesday's threats, Sony told theaters they could drop the film if they chose to, and all major chains promptly did. The company then scrapped the release altogether. Responding to calls from the likes of George Clooney to release the movie online, Lynton told CNN Sony does not have the interface necessary to distribute the movie on the web directly. Lynton explained that in order to release the film online, they need to go through a third-party distributor, but so far none have come forward offering their services. Scrapped: Sony told theaters they could drop the film if they chose to after receiving terrorist threats, and all major chains promptly did . Leak: Hackers linked to North Korea breached Sony's system and released embarrassing emails written by top executive Amy Pascal, pictured here with Lynton at Variety's 5th Annual Power of Women event in October . Earlier on Friday, Obama said during his end-of-the-year press conference Sony should have released the film and not bowed to pressure from hackers. 'I wish they would have spoken to me first,' Obama said. 'I would have told them, ""Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks."" 'We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' the president said. 'Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don't like, or news reports that they don't like.' The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes. The Sony executive said if given the chance, the studio would have made The Interview again, and that he still would like the public to see the film . Responding to the president's critique, Lynton said Sony had 'no alternative' but to pull the screwball comedy about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un because movie theater chains said they would not screen the film. 'We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down,' Lynton said. 'We have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie.' The Sony executive added that if given the chance, the studio would have made The Interview all over again, and that he still would like the public to see the film. 'Knowing what I know now, we might have... done something slightly differently,' he added. When asked about his reaction to the president's statement earlier today, Lynton - a long-time support of Obama - said he would be 'fibbing' had he said he wasn't disappointed. 'I don't know exactly whether he understands the sequence of events that led up to the movie not being shown in the movie theaters,' Lynton said. 'Therefore I would disagree with the notion that it was a mistake.' The full interview with Michael Lynton will air Friday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 at 8pm and Sunday on Fareed Zakaria GPS.","CEO Michael Lynton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria his studio has not backed down in the face of threats over movie release .

"Once upon a time in Manchester, the United left back Patrice Evra made his debut in a derby game across town at City. Hauled off at half-time, the combative little Frenchman reflected colourfully that his first taste of English football had been akin to spending the afternoon ‘in a washing machine’. Years later and not much has changed and another Frenchman has arrived in town to bear witness to the rough and tumble. Eliaquim Mangala is 6ft 2in and looks like he could carry a washing machine on his back. Nevertheless the Manchester City central defender admitted this week that he is only just finding his feet in the Barclays Premier League following an introduction to life in England that has led to some pretty miserable days. Eliaquim Mangala has endured a difficult start to his life at Manchester City, but is ready to step up . Mangala scored an own goal and gave away a penalty in the 4-2 win over Hull City earlier this season . ‘I have spent a lot of time at home watching and studying games I have played in,’ Mangala told Sportsmail. ‘I do that at home on my own. I try to use that information for the next game. ‘It’s all about improving your game. That is what important. ‘Watching 90 minutes is too much so, if we play on Saturday, I will probably watch the first 45 minutes on Sunday then go and do something else. Life has to go on. Then I may sit down for the second half on a Monday. It’s all about attention to detail and doing everything you can to improve. If you want to improve then you have to work hard, there is no substitute for it. It has helped.’ Mangala arrived in England at the end of the transfer window for £32million, the final piece in the City jigsaw. A September debut at home in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea passed without much trouble. A new star had seemingly arrived at the Etihad. The French defender, who has impressed in the Champions League, holds off Roma's Francesco Totti . Up against the likes of Gervinho in Europe, Mangala has shown flashes of why City paid £32million for him . Mangala has found it tough to adapt to life in the Premier League, with the pace and physicality of the game . GARETH BALE (Tottenham) Now one of the best players in the world, things were not always so rosy for Bale. After moving to the Premier League, the one-time left back initially struggled. It took him two years, three managers and 25 games to experience a league win. FABRICIO COLOCCINI (Newcastle) The Argentine arrived with a big reputation and a price tag to match. But his first season was shaky, typified by his display in a 5-1 defeat by Liverpool. He is now among Newcastle’s best players, and the effect his absence had on their league form in the 2012-13 season shows how valuable he is. PATRICE EVRA (Man Utd) The left back made a miserable debut at Man City in 2006. He was substituted at half time with United 2-0 down. Evra admitted he was struggling to adapt to the English game but became a cornerstone in the United defence. KOLO TOURE (Arsenal) There was never any doubting the Ivorian’s talent, but his runaway-train style of play made him a liability in his first season. Twelve years later Kolo has two league titles and three FA Cups to his name. NEMANJA VIDIC (Man Utd) Signed in January 2006, Vidic was in and out of the United team in his early months at the club as he adapted to England. But the Serb would form a formidable defensive partnership with Rio Ferdinand. Next up, though, was a trip to Hull City and suddenly somebody turned on the spin cycle. An own goal, a penalty conceded and a yellow card in one afternoon. The apprenticeship had begun. ‘I spoke with Martin (Demichelis) and Vinny (Kompany),’ he said. ‘They warned me about how it’s different but they can tell you, “Oh yeah, you get pressed all the time, it’s going to be physical, it’s going to be hard, they’re going to play the ball behind you, you’re going to have to turn, you’re going to get players who are good with it into feet and who turn and run”. ‘They can go through every situation, but until you have actually experienced it, until you’ve lived all that, you can’t appreciate it. And you can’t react and improve until you have experienced it. ‘You appreciate people giving you advice and trying to help, but a lot of it is seeing it for yourself and dealing with it and improving at it over time through hard work. There is no substitute.’ Since that day on Humberside, Mangala’s learning curve has been steep. It is just one of the reasons he took the unusual step of requesting this interview himself. It was time, he felt, to introduce himself to English football followers and assure those of a sky blue persuasion that he is working hard to adapt. ‘I wanted to speak because I haven’t spoken to the public at all,’ he said. ‘I would like the fans to know a bit more about me as a person. They see me on the field but they don’t know me. ‘I have tried to make the adaptation quick but you have to be patient and hope that other people will be patient with you. There has been (media) criticism but I’m cool with that. If you can’t take that you shouldn’t be a footballer. ‘All over Europe you have ex-players on TV who criticise you. It doesn’t worry me. I am my biggest critic. I know I am moving forwards and adapting.’ Mangala keeps the ball away from Leicester's Jamie Vardy, as he looks to build on his recent run of form . The centre back knows it will take time, and hard work, to adapt to the pressures of the Premier Leagu . As it happens, the day his invitation to meet and talk is passed on he goes on to contribute his finest performance in a City shirt as he and Demichelis guide Manuel Pellegrini’s team to a clean sheet at Roma in the Champions League. There was no Kompany that day and there will be no Kompany at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday lunchtime in the League. The City captain’s hamstring troubles have struck again and Mangala and Demichelis will be centre halves for the foreseeable future. It seems as though better form has arrived just at the right time. Rome may yet transpire to be a pivotal night. ‘I would say that playing against Chelsea back at the start wasn’t particularly a typical English game, it’s the sort of football I’m more used to,’ he reflected. Despite receiving plenty of criticism, Mangala is determined that he can be a success at Manchester City . The defender knows his style of football is more suited to Europe, so he must work on his domestic form . ‘Roma, too, in the Champions League was a different style of football to the Premier League, so that was OK. But I must emphasise I’m still going through a settling-in period so coming up against teams like Hull and Palace this weekend and facing that typical English style, where it’s a long ball, high balls, balls in the air, big physical battles, fighting for every ball, that is the stuff I’m going to take longer to get used to. ‘Maybe that’s harder for me than games against the big teams at the moment. I will improve and I will cope with that, but it’s all about taking it stage by stage. ‘It’s all right having one good game there and then not so good there. What I have got to aim at is consistency and having a good game every game rather than in-and-out performances. I am confident that will happen.’ The day we meet, Mangala is also talking to students from east Manchester’s Connell College. The college lies on 5.5 acres of land donated by City for community use near the new training ground. Mangala answered questions from the students in City’s new media conference room and shortly afterwards the 23-year-old tackled the more thorny issue of interest last summer from arch-rivals United. Mangala's good form has arrived at just the right time, with City skipper Vincent Kompany out of action . Kompany has again been beset by injuries, this time to his hamstring, ruling him out for some time . There were suggestions from Old Trafford that Mangala would rather have joined United, but the former Porto player said: ‘I was aware there had been some contact from United, but the major conversations that had gone on with my agent were with City and it was City that I was attracted to all the way through. I was aware of what a great project and plans the club had. ‘They want to make history and I want to be part of that and did back in the summer. I’m pleased I made the right choice.’ Born in France, Mangala moved to Belgium at the age of five as his mother sought a better life for his disabled brother. His first club was Standard Liege and Mangala was a centre forward until he was 16. Back then his hero was Thierry Henry and, by coincidence, Henry announced his retirement just moments before we met this week. Since his impressive debut in the 1-1 draw against Chelsea, Mangala has been exposed at times . With an extended run in the side likely, it is time for the Frenchman to show he has what it takes . With Pellegrini and City suffering an injury crisis among their forwards, Mangala joked that he was ready to come to the rescue over an intense Christmas period he claimed to be relishing. ‘Yeah absolutely,’ he laughed. 'I’m going to play No 9. ‘We are about to hit the Boxing Day period and I am fascinated by it. In France and other countries we don’t play over this period so I am really looking forward to seeing what it is like. I am excited about it. I want to experience it.’ It is impossible not to admire Mangala’s enthusiasm. It is indicative of a refreshing attitude. City are about to play five games in 15 days, though. Time to open the door to the washing machine.","Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala joined this summer for £32m .

"Super-rich Premier League clubs are charging up to £600 for packages to allow youngsters to be mascots and walk out on to the pitch alongside their heroes. The high costs have been condemned by fans and parent groups, who argue the policy excludes children from less well-off families. The attempt by teams to cash in on the loyalty of young fans is just the latest evidence as to how Premier League teams are squeezing every penny from families. Scroll down for video . West Ham charge the most in the Premier League with their most expensive mascot package costing £600 . West Ham mascots line up before a Premier League game against Newcastle in January 2014 . QPR offer the second most expensive mascot package, charging up to £450 . For the clubs already charge extortionate prices for replica kit, while ticket prices and pay TV subscriptions are higher than in any other major football nation in Europe. Eleven of the 20 teams in the Premier League charge a fee for being a mascot, rather than giving the opportunity away to deserving children in the community. The majority of the mascot packages include hospitality places at the designated match, a free kit, signed footballs, photos of the day, match tickets and other benefits. The most expensive is at West Ham where it can be as much as £600 for the most attractive and high profile fixtures. Both Queens Park Rangers and Swansea City charge £450 plus VAT. The packages can be £425 at Crystal Palace, £400 at Leicester and Spurs, £390 at Stoke, £300 at Burnley, £265 at West Brom and £150 at Hull. At Newcastle United the corporate hospitality packages of £3,000-4,000 include mascot places. Some of these clubs do soften the pain, including West Ham, Spurs, QPR and Newcastle, by offering a number of free mascot places during the season through competitions and charities. However, others do not charge at all, including Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Southampton and Sunderland, according to the research by the Guardian. Manchester United are one of the clubs that do not charge a fee for children to be mascots . Swansea also charge £450 for their most expensive mascot package . Manchester United mascots walk out on the the Old Trafford pitch with beaming smiles . Fans took to Twitter yesterday to condemn the high charges and praise those clubs who give the places free of charge to deserving youngsters. Rossco wrote: ‘So rich PL clubs charging children up to £600 to be a mascot for a day? I’m quickly falling out of love with what once was a beautiful game.’ Sunderland Stats said: ‘Well done Sunderland for not charging to be a mascot. Absolute disgrace that some clubs charge. West Ham £600!’ Richard Keys the former Sky sports football presenter described the tactic as ‘disgraceful’. A blogger on the West Ham fansite Ironviews.com was also unhappy, describing the fees as ‘ridiculous’ and ‘unjustifiable’. A number of West Ham fans challenged the chairman, David Gold, to justify the fees. Stoke City's most expensive mascot package is £390 . Crystal Palace off the fourth most expensive mascot package in the Premier League, charging up to £425 . Children can become mascots for Merseyside duo Liverpool and Everton free of charge . One took a swipe at the West Ham fan, Russell Brand, who presents himself as a champion of the downtrodden, suggesting he should boycott the club for ‘this shameful exploitation of the proletariat’. Clive Efford, the shadow minister for sport who is campaigning for fans to be represented on club boards, said: ‘I find it extraordinary that clubs which are getting so much money from TV rights then exclude kids from poorer backgrounds by imposing a fee. ‘It means that a certain class of kids will never be able to be a team’s mascot, and that doesn’t seem fair when their clubs are earning so much money. It seems ridiculous that some will be excluded because their parents can’t afford to put them on a waiting list.’ Kevin Miles, the chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation, described the charges as ‘extortionate’. Clubs that charge children to be mascots have been criticised for excluding less well-off families . Stoke mascots  mascot watch the players run out on to the pitch before a league game last season . ‘So many of the trappings around football, like junior replica kits and mascot opportunities are designed to win a place in the hearts of children for the football club. It then seems counter-intuitive to make those things themselves extortionately priced,’ he said. The Premier League did not comment. West Ham stressed it does offer some free spaces for child mascots in special cases. A spokesman said: ‘We are committed to making football more affordable and offer a range of incentives to make it easier for young Hammers to attend our matches. This season we will be offering Kids for a Quid prices for six Premier League fixtures, where any number of Under-16s can attend when accompanied by an adult.’","More than half of Premier League teams charge for kids to be mascots .

"'Just war': Michael Gove says left-wing myths about the First World War peddled by Blackadder belittle Britain and clear Germany of blame . Left-wing myths about the First World War peddled by Blackadder belittle Britain and clear Germany of blame, Michael Gove says today. The Education Secretary criticises historians and TV programmes that denigrate patriotism and courage by depicting the war as a ‘misbegotten shambles’. As Britain prepares to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war, Mr Gove claims only undergraduate cynics would say the soldiers were foolish to fight. In an article for the Daily Mail, Mr Gove says he has little time for the view of the Department for Culture and the Foreign Office that the commemorations should not lay fault at Germany’s door. The Education Secretary says the conflict was a ‘just war’ to combat aggression by a German elite bent on domination. ‘The First World War may have been a uniquely horrific war, but it was also plainly a just war,’ he says. ‘The ruthless social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified.’ Britain has pledged £50million in public money to mark the event, with school trips to battlefields and ceremonies planned over four years. The French government has also embraced the centenary, planning 1,500 events across the country. But there are few plans for events in Germany itself. Mr Gove, who has rewritten the school history curriculum to give pupils a better grasp of the broad sweep of British history, reserves his greatest scorn for those who have sought to depict the soldiers as lions led by donkeys. He says: ‘The war was, of course, an unspeakable tragedy, which robbed this nation of our bravest and best. ‘But it’s important that we don’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict in the last 70 or so years. ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite.’ Vanessa Redgrave playing Sylvia Pankhurst, in the film Oh! What A Lovely War: Mr Gove singles out the film as propagating what he calls the myth of the First World War as a 'misbegotten shambles' Mr Gove turns his fire on ‘Left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking Britain’s role in the conflict’. He singles out Richard Evans, regius professor of history at Cambridge University, who has said those who enlisted in 1914 were wrong to think they were fighting to defend freedom. Dramatisation: Paul McGann, as Percy Topliss, in the 1980s television series The Monocled Mutineer, another of the TV programmes Mr Gove targets . Mr Gove writes: ‘Richard Evans may hold a professorship, but these arguments, like the interpretations of Oh! What a Lovely War and Blackadder, are more reflective of the attitude of an undergraduate cynic playing to the gallery in a Cambridge Footlights revue rather than a sober academic contributing to a proper historical debate.’ The Education Secretary says it is time to listen to historians such as Margaret Macmillan who has ‘demonstrated how those who fought were not dupes but conscious believers in king and country, committed to defending the western liberal order’. He also cites the work of Professor Gary Sheffield, who has reassessed the damaged reputation of British commander Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig. Blackadder Goes Forth cast Rowan Atkinson in the title role as a captain in the trenches of Flanders during 1917. It focused largely on his cowardly attempts to avoid certain death through going ‘over the top’ to engage the enemy. Under the misguided leadership of a general played by Stephen Fry, and with little help from the hapless Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson) plus a twittish ex-public schoolboy played by Hugh Laurie, it chronicles his increasingly gutless efforts to dodge the action or escape the trenches. The series was written by Four Weddings and Bridget Jones creator Richard Curtis in partnership with Left-wing comic Ben Elton. It is still shown in schools to help children learn about the war. By MICHAEL GOVE, Education Secretary . The past has never had a better future. Because history is enjoying a renaissance in Britain. After years in which the study of history was declining in our schools, the numbers of young people showing an appetite for learning about the past, and a curiosity about our nation’s story, is growing once more. As a Government, we’ve done everything we can to support this restoration. We’ve changed how schools are judged, and our new measure of academic success for schools and pupils, the English  baccalaureate, rewards those who study history at GCSE. And the changes we’ve made to the history curriculum have been welcomed by top academics as a way to give all children a proper rounded understanding of our country’s past and its place in the world. Captain Coward: Tony Robinson as Private Baldrick, left, and Rowan Atkinson as Blackadder in the titular sit-com, which Education Secretary Michael Gove blames for distorting attitudes about the First World War . That understanding has never been needed more. Because the challenges  we face today – great power rivalry, migrant populations on the move, rapid social upheaval, growing global  economic interdependence, massive technological change and fragile confidence in political elites – are all  challenges our forebears faced. Indeed, these particular forces were especially powerful one hundred years ago – on the eve of the First World War. Which is why it is so important that  we commemorate, and learn from, that conflict in the right way in the next  four years. The Government wants to give young people from every community the chance to learn about the heroism, and sacrifice, of our great-grandparents, which is why we are organising visits to the battlefields of the Western Front. The war was, of course, an unspeakable tragedy, which robbed this nation of our bravest and best.  But even as we recall that loss and commemorate the bravery of those who fought, it’s important that we don’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict. Our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings, and misrepresentations which reflect an, at best, ambiguous attitude to this country  and, at worst, an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour and courage. The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are Left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths. Professor Sir Richard Evans, the Cambridge historian and Guardian writer, has criticised those who fought, arguing, ‘the men who enlisted in 1914 may have thought they were fighting for civilisation, for a better world, a war to end all wars, a war to defend freedom: they were wrong’. And he has attacked the very idea of honouring their sacrifice as an exercise in ‘narrow tub-thumping jingoism’. These arguments are more reflective of the attitude of an undergraduate cynic playing to the gallery in a Cambridge Footlights revue rather than a sober academic contributing to a proper historical debate. The First World War may have been a uniquely horrific war, but it was also plainly a just war. Nigel Biggar, regius professor of moral and pastoral theology at the University of Oxford, laid out the ethical case for our involvement in a superb essay in September’s Standpoint magazine. The ruthless social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified. And the war was also seen by participants as a noble cause. Historians have skilfully demonstrated how those who fought were not dupes but conscious believers in king and country, committed to defending the western liberal order. Other historians have gone even further in challenging some prevailing myths. Generals who were excoriated for their bloody folly have now, after proper study, been re-assessed. Douglas Haig, held up as a crude butcher, has been seen in a new light thanks to Professor Gary Sheffield, of Wolverhampton University, who depicts him as a patriotic leader grappling honestly with the new complexities of industrial warfare. Even the battle of the Somme, once considered the epitome of military futility, has now been analysed in depth by the military historian William Philpott and recast as a precursor of allied victory. Rehabilitated: Even Field Marshal Douglas Haig, popularly known as 'the butcher of the Somme', has been seen in a new light thanks to Professor Gary Sheffield, of Wolverhampton University, writes Gove . There is, of course, no unchallenged consensus. That is why it matters that we encourage an open debate on the war and  its significance. But it is important to recognise that many of the new analyses emerging challenge existing Left-wing versions of the past designed to belittle Britain and its leaders. Instead, they help us to understand that, for all our mistakes as a nation, Britain’s role in the world has also been marked by nobility and courage. Indeed, the more we reflect on every aspect of the war, the more cause there is for us to appreciate what we owe to our forebears and their traditions. But whatever each of us takes from these acts of remembrance and hours of debate it is always worth remembering that the freedom to draw our own conclusions about this conflict is a direct consequence of the bravery of men and women who fought for, and believed in, Britain’s special tradition of liberty.","Education Secretary says war is represented as a 'misbegotten shambles'

"Joe Hart has signed a long-term contract worth £120,000 a week that ties the England goalkeeper to Manchester City until 2019. Hart was widely expected to become the latest player to agree a new deal with the Premier League champions and the news was confirmed on Friday night. ‘Wanting to stay here was never going to be an issue for me. I’ve loved every moment since I joined,’ said Hart, who has made 276 appearances since signing from Shrewsbury Town in 2006. Joe Hart has committed his long-term future to Manchester City by signing a new deal with the club . City's director of football Txiki Begiristain shaking hands with Hart after he signed the deal . ‘The club’s doing amazing things. We’ve created history and we want to keep doing that. The club’s growing and I’ve been really lucky to be part of the ride. We’re enjoying building that winning mentality, how the club is growing around us and how we need to grow along with it.’ City, who also expect James Milner to agree a new deal soon, have won their last seven games in all competitions and could feasibly replace Chelsea at the top of the table on goal difference with an emphatic win at home to Crystal Palace in today’s lunchtime kick-off. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trailed Chelsea by nine points at one stage last month, and the City boss warned Jose Mourinho’s side that Arsenal blew their chance from a similar position last season. The Gunners occupied top spot in December after 16 games and then fell away in the second half of the campaign as City emerged to become champions. Hart joined City in 2006 from Shrewsbury Town, he was then loaned to Tranmere, Birmingham and Blackpool . Hart broke into the City first team in the 2010-11 season after impressing on loan at Birmingham . ‘You never win a title in December,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe you can be the best team but you don’t know what will happen in the second half. ‘I think Arsenal had a very similar number of points last season as Chelsea have now so we’ll see what happens in the second half and how many points you need to win.’ Asked what psychological impact relinquishing such a big lead might have on Chelsea, Pellegrini replied: ‘I don’t know but in our team we always fight to the end and are never beaten until mathematics say you cannot win. ‘We always believed that we could make up the points because we had so many games to play. ‘You may remember last year when we had just five games left and knew that we had to win them, we did it.’ Hart has made 276 appearances for the club, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup .

"Sam Burgess speaks matter-of-factly about the moment, barely 10 seconds into the NRL Grand Final, when a sickening clash of heads with fellow Englishman James Graham shattered his right eye socket and cheekbone. ‘I put my hand to my face and knew straight away something had been broken,’ the cross-code star told MailSport this week. ‘I could feel my jaw was out of shape and I felt the pain straight away. There was a sharp stinging down my face. It was like when you break your arm. It didn’t really cross my mind to stop playing. It’s not every day you get to play in a Grand Final. I just got on with it.’ Sam Burgess the new signing for Bath Rugby looks on during a Bath training session on Friday . Not only did Burgess ‘just get on with it’, he produced a man-of-the-match display in his final game of rugby league before switching codes after the South Sydney Rabbitohs won their first Grand Final in 43 years. The performance prompted an outpouring of praise from an Australian public usually loath to hand out accolades to English sporting heroes. ‘People talk about Sam becoming the greatest English forward to ever come to Australia,’ said Rabittohs chief executive Shane Richardson. ‘The reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game.’ The 25-year-old’s courage, indeed some would say foolhardiness, in playing on earned Burgess a place in rugby league folklore while showing why Bath and England had been so keen to lure him back to England before next year’s World Cup here. The prospect of the 6ft 5in 18st wrecking machine, who combines outstanding physical prowess with quick feet, deft hands and a commitment to tackling which sometimes borders on the reckless, wearing the red rose of England excites head coach Stuart Lancaster. Speak to those who know Burgess, among them Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe, and they talk of a fiercely driven individual who places family above all else. Burgess celebrates with Rabbitohs team-mate Greg Inglis during the 2014 NRL Grand Final after he had shattered his eye socket and cheekbone in a man-of-the-match performance . The death of his father Mark from motor neurone disease affected his outlook on life and informs the decisions he takes today. ‘Losing my dad taught me a lot about life,’ said Burgess who, as a teenager, used to carry his stricken father to bed in the final years before his premature death at the age of just 47. ‘Motor neurone disease is a pretty devastating disease. It was obviously a shock to the family. I look back on those days now and I’m able to take plenty of joy from the time we spent together in his last days. It definitely shaped me as a young man. I was 16 or 17 and it taught me a lot about things. 'It puts a lot of things in perspective and it’s why I don’t take anything for granted. I’m very grateful for everything I’ve got. Not just being able to play sport for a job but to be healthy and be able to give something back to a few people is quite rewarding. ‘I’d like to think I’ve already overcome quite a few big hurdles in life. When you face something like losing a parent you learn to realise what is real and what is not. You learn what should actually affect you and what you can just brush off. ‘As a professional sportsman we’re in an incredibly fortunate position so we should never complain, although I still do sometimes, but you learn a lot going through things like that. But I really do believe it has helped shaped me into what I do today.’ Unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday after landing in England on Wednesday, the former Bradford Bull, who convinced a sceptical Australian public he was the real deal, must now attempt to grasp the technical aspects of union — the ruck and maul among them — which have been gradually removed from league over more than a century of professionalism. He must do so away from his mum Julie and brothers Luke, George and Tom, who have stayed in Sydney. His girlfriend Phoebe will join him in Bath in the next few weeks. Bath head coach Mike Ford, a forerunner in the wave of former league players and coaches who have flooded the union market since professionalism in 1996, will not attempt to mould Burgess into a ‘traditional’ union player and remains relaxed about his best position. Burgess alongside Bath team-mate George Ford (centre) and head coach Mike Ford (right) Whether he ends up in the back row or midfield when fully recovered from the complicated surgery which left him with five metal plates in his face following the NRL Final, Burgess can be sure of a warm welcome when he makes his union bow. But he’s used to that. ‘Slammin Sam’ has shown he is no shrinking violet. ‘What makes a good sportsman is that competitive edge,’ he said. ‘It separates the good from the great. I’m not saying I’m great but I’ve been around teams for 10 seasons now and you see a lot of different characters and personalities. You can see why people succeed through their character traits. ‘I’ve been targeted in league for years so I’ll be ready for what comes at me in union. I’m well used to it, believe me.’ Burgess had dinner with his new team-mates George Ford and Kyle Eastmond on his first night in his new city. It was perhaps no surprise he should seek out two players with rugby league backgrounds in an Aviva Premiership club which arguably has been influenced more by the rival code than any other. Burgess had dinner with new team-mate Kyle Eastmond (left) on his first night in his new city . He trained with his new team-mates on Friday but is unlikely to make his first-team debut until mid- to late December; nine months before the World Cup. It seems a huge challenge but Burgess will take it in his stride. ‘I think the biggest challenge I’ve faced in my career was leaving England and moving to Australia [in 2010] to play in the NRL, the toughest competition in rugby league,’ he said. ‘I thought that was a bigger challenge than coming back over here. ‘I know people over here. Fordy and the boys. I didn’t know anyone over there. This is big in its own right. Playing rugby union is going to be fun and I’m going to have a great time in a new city. ‘I’m just going to enjoy it. I won’t let the pressure mount up on me. We’ll see how I get on in time.’","Burgess discusses the injury he suffered in NRL Grand Final in Australia .

Eoin Morgan is set to replace Cook as England's 50-over skipper despite his own poor form . Cook ultimately paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50-over form which has seen him average just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike-rate of 73 and lead England to five one-day defeats in their last six series. Yet it still came as a shock when it emerged on Friday night that England were going to make a last-gasp change at the top because they have stuck with their man through thick and thin during a traumatic year for English cricket. Last Sunday England coach Peter Moores, who has backed Cook emphatically since replacing Andy Flower in April, said ahead of England’s last one-day international in Sri Lanka: ‘If you ask my opinion, Cook will be captain at the World Cup.’ Then on Monday, just before England’s last defeat in their 5-2 series loss, managing director Paul Downton added: ‘I would be extremely surprised if he’s not captain at the World Cup.’ Now, with England leaving for a triangular series against Australia and India ahead of the World Cup in just over a fortnight, the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in Cook. Moores met fellow selectors James Whitaker and Mick Newell at Loughborough on Friday, while Angus Fraser joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in Barbados and Downton sat in as a non-voting presence. Cook looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final ODI of the series against Sri Lanka . Cook plays and misses at one in Colombo during another stuttering innings . Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook . They ultimately reached their decision because of Cook’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven-match series in Sri Lanka even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him. And the sense of England being in a state of one-day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace Cook with a batsman in Morgan who has a worse one-day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds. At least Irishman Morgan, such a key performer in England’s one-day batting, seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one-day captain. Cook, nothing if not a stubborn fighter, was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in Australian conditions. Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake (right) celebrates with  Angelo Mathews after taking the wicket of Cook . He was under extreme pressure when England lost to India in the second Test at Lord’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three Tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one-day cricket. Cook, who has never played in a World Cup, leaves the post having led England to more one-day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one-day rankings in 2012 and the Champions Trophy final a year later. It was the way Cook confounded his one-day doubters after succeeding Andrew Strauss in 2011 that convinced England he was still their man but they agonised over Cook’s future when he lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer. They stood firm then but have lost their nerve now. Now, as well as Morgan, the beneficiaries of Cook’s misfortune look sure to be Ian Bell, who will compete with Alex Hales to become Moeen Ali’s opening partner, and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was left out of the Sri Lankan squad. England had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on Friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper Morgan in Sydney. Whitaker, the national selector, will confirm the World Cup squad at Lord’s that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it. Bell, dropped after two matches in Sri Lanka, Ballance and the fit-again strike bowling pair of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will all form part of a 15-man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one-day tournament of all. England captain Cook leaves the field after being dismissed by Senanayake of Sri Lanka on December 11 . Cook, who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild England from the ashes of their 5-0 defeat by Australia, has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm. The news may be a blow to Cook, but it should ensure that he is in better condition, both mentally and physically, at the start of a run of 17 Tests in little more than a year which begins when England tour the Caribbean in April. A refreshed Cook will be integral to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes next summer which, whatever anyone in English cricket says, remains far more important than competing in a 50-over tournament. England, who have not been World Cup contenders since 1992, have had to replace their one-day captains immediately after failed World Cup campaigns going back to Mike Atherton in 1996 and continuing with Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Strauss. The only difference this time is that the axing has come before a World Cup failure rather than after one.","Eoin Morgan to replace Alastair Cook as England one-day captain .

"Australia wing Nick Cummins could extend his Japanese stint into a third year in exchange for a Super Rugby loan move that reopens his World Cup chances. The 'Honey Badger' said he had been 'busting for a bit of meat' before claiming a priceless try against his international team-mates as the Barbarians went down fighting 40-36 at Twickenham. The 27-year-old vowed to fulfil his two-year deal with Japanese club Coca Cola West Red Sparks, but admitted to being 'creative' in his bid for a Super Rugby loan deal. Barbarians tar Nick Cummins (right) sprints away from Australia's defence at Twickenham on Saturday . Cummins dives to score a try during Barbarians' narrow 36-40 defeat to Australia . Cummins must complete next season's Super Rugby campaign to qualify for Australia selection, and is still in talks to secure a short-term release from his club. 'I would love to be back in the mix there, but I've signed for two years in Japan and I'm a man of my word so I'll go through with that,' said Cummins. 'If there's a chance we can work things out, I'd be stoked. 'We're being creative already, trying to get it through. Sometimes it's not so straightforward with the language barrier.' New Australia boss Michael Cheika has told Cummins to arrange his own Super Rugby return to be eligible for international selection. Cummins is now understood to be willing to extend his Coca Cola contract in exchange for a season-long release that would pave the way for a World Cup recall. 'I'm lucky enough to have a crew behind me, my agent and family: I'm happy to be on board and I'm doing my best,' said Cummins. 'Contract-wise we're trying to be creative: it's not just about me taking, it's a two-way street, whatever I can give to them, and what they can do for me, hopefully we can work together. Cummins is hoping to secure a loan move to Super Rugby from Japanese side Coca Cola West Red Sparks . Moving to Super Rugby would make Cummins eligible to be selected by Australia for next year's World Cup . 'At the moment they have the power, so I suppose that's what we've been doing.' Nicknamed the 'Honey Badger' due to his love of the African weasel, Cummins spent a week living with Mongolian nomads before linking up with the Barbarians. The free-thinking wing still switched on to score one of five Barbarians tries in a narrow defeat to Australia, who had new boss Cheika at the helm for the first time. Sam Carter, Benn Robinson, Tevita Kuridrani, Rob Horne, Bernard Foley and Sean McMahon crossed for the Australians, who struggled for rhythm throughout Saturday's Twickenham encounter. The Wallabies had Will Genia and Quade Cooper back in half-back tandem for the first time in a year, but still lacked fluency. Frank Halai, Adam Thomson, Francis Saili and Marnitz Boshoff claimed the other scores for the Barbarians, John Kirwan's side unlucky not to prevail in the event. The Barbarians now face Leicester at Welford Road on Tuesday night before head coach Kirwan's squad disbands and a new group will face the Combined Services in the annual Remembrance fixture in Bath on November 11. Cummins is hopeful of staying in England to compete in a match against the Combined Services in Bath . Cummins said he will try to talk Coca Cola into allowing him to stay in England for the Bath fixture, keen to pay tribute to the fallen. 'There's a Remembrance game against the Combined Services which I'd love to get involved in,' he said, before summing up scoring against his national side. 'I'd like to hang around for that, but we'll have to talk to Coca Cola, again, and gee whizz, we'll see how that goes. 'A lot of people have got feelings towards that, and everyone's been told a lot of stories over the years about your grandparents and great-grandparents. 'It's one of those special things in everyone's hearts. 'I was bloody busting for a bit of meat against the Wallabies, so it was great to get that try in the end. 'It wasn't even a move. Old Timmy (Tim Nanai-Williams) just said 'give me the ball early, Badge: get off me hip', and I just said 'copy that'. 'The next thing you know we're bloody under the sticks: outstanding.'","Australia beat the Barbarians 40-36 at Twickenham on Saturday .

Neil Warnock has never been one to hide his feelings and, as he began digesting an eye-catching scoreline, he was at his most colourful. A Crystal Palace victory over Everton had not been expected but there was nothing fortuitous about a 3-2 win, built on hard work and ruthlessness, which handed Warnock his first success since being re-appointed to the managerial hot seat at Selhurst Park.

Though Roberto Martinez described Palace's statistics as 'spooky' – three efforts on target led to three goals – to say they were lucky would be grossly unfair; relentless in their running and committed in their approach, they took full advantage of Everton's miserable defending. From being in a position of strength thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s ninth minute opener, Everton fell asunder as, first, a penalty from Mile Jedinak, then a header from Frazier Campbell and, finally, a smart finish from Yannick Bolaise – the game’s outstanding player – put Palace in command. It left Warnock hopping gleefully on the touchline, oblivious to the howls of the home support, who were so vexed by Everton’s defending. Days such as these are why he always felt there was one more job for him before retirement. ‘I thought we deserved to win it, I really did,’ said Warnock. ‘In the first 20 minutes we probably gave them a bit too much respect. 'But from then, we grew into the game and at half-time we said we should go and try and win it.’ Such an outcome looked improbable when Phil Jagielka popped a ball forward to Leon Osman in the ninth minute; he fed Lukaku and the Belgium international finished smartly. Had Osman then take a chance to double Everton’s lead in the 29 minutes, it would have been a long way back for Palace. But Palace hung in and Everton’s downfall started in the next attack, when John Stones and Tim Howard made a hash of trying to thwart James McArthur. Instead of clearing their lines, McArthur scampered on to a loose ball but was chopped down by Howard. Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot. Jedinak did the rest, smashing in his kick from 12 yards – two goalkeepers would not have saved it; Palace might have led at the break but Bolaise struck a post via a deflection from Stones.

No matter. in the 54th minute when Martin Kelly bombed forward and hoisted in a cross to the back post that looked set to be comfortably gathered by Howard but, instead, he dropped the ball and presented Campbell with a simple header. Frustration swirled around Goodison and worse was to follow when Osman dithered, allowing Puncheon to pick his pocket and the winger fed Bolaise, who kept his calm and rolled a right-foot finish under Howard’s flailing dive. Baines’ penalty was just a consolation. ‘Team like us can go and give a good account of themselves,’ said Warnock. ‘Look at (the results of) Leicester and West Brom. I just feel it is wide open. But this just gives everyone a lift, doesn’t it? 'We had to make headers and blocks at the end.

"The way is finally clear for Russia and Qatar to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after nothing emerged from Michael Garcia’s corruption report that could force a re-vote. FIFA agreed unanimously at their summit here for the Garcia findings, where legally possible, to be published in full — but only after being assured there is no explosive detail within the 430 pages that would require another World Cup election. Garcia had sent hapless FIFA into meltdown — first by disowning ethics committee colleague Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of his report and then resigning his FIFA role on the eve of the executive committee’s meeting in Morocco. This was after FIFA’s appeals committee turned down his Eckert complaint. VIDEO Scroll down for Sepp Blatter: FIFA to publish appropriate version of Garcia report . The report into corruption by Michael Garcia will be published, the FIFA ExCo have decided . Sepp Blatter, the FIFA chairman, saw the day as a personal triumph that there will be no forced re-vote . After the meeting Blatter echoed the famous quote by former British PM Jim Callaghan: ‘Crisis? What Crisis?’ But Houdini-like FIFA chairman Sepp Blatter, taking full credit for persuading his executive to support publication without opposition, saw the day as a personal triumph. After the meeting he echoed the famous quote attributed to former British PM Jim Callaghan: ‘Crisis? What Crisis?’ Blatter said: ‘We have been in crisis — the crisis has stopped. There will be no revote, the decision has been taken. I managed to get the executive to back publication under certain conditions. The most important thing is to share the will of the president and for the executive to move forward.’ However it will be some time before a heavily redacted Garcia report does see the light of day, when the lawyers have had their say and all those who spoke to Garcia under privacy agreements have been protected. And the eventual published report is likely to be a damp squib, soft on Russia and Qatar transgressions, while focusing on individual ethics codes violations. England’s doomed 2018 bid is likely to remain in the firing line as it was in Eckert’s disputed summary of Garcia’s work. FIFA president Blatter speaks during the press conference in Marrakech, Morocco, on Friday . FIFA chairman Blatter (centre) was in favour of Garcia's report being published previously . FIFA will also wait until the personal investigations ordered by Garcia are completed before publishing. The investigations into five individuals suspected of breaching the code will now be carried out by Garcia’s successor as FIFA ethics investigator, Cornel Borbely. Those under the microscope are German football great and former FIFA executive member Franz Beckenbauer, three current members of the FIFA executive; Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, Belgium’s Michel D’Hooghe and Worawi Makudi of Thailand, as well as Chilean Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who led the delegation assessing the 2018 and 2022 bids. Only six of the 25-strong executive had been expected to support Garcia’s publication before they convened in the ballroom of La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech — once a favourite of Sir Winston Churchill. So Blatter — as he demonstrated afterwards — was overjoyed to sway the doubters not to oppose the transparency. Even the three still being probed by FIFA, who have the most to lose, agreed not to rock the boat. FIFA chairman Blatter (centre) was overjoyed to sway the doubters not to oppose the transparency . Blatter announces that Qatar will be hosting the 2022  World Cup, which caused plenty of controversy . Blatter said: ‘What do you do to convince people? To convince people is to say what is so important — that we are the guardians of the FIFA statutes and regulations. There comes a situation where there must be unity and a determination to end a situation that has created a lot of problems. ‘It’s not the first time that I have found myself as president of FIFA in a critical situation. When something is wrong, we fight and I had big fighters today on the executive.’ Germany’s Theo Zwanziger was the most vocal at the meeting in favour of publication. But, as it turned out, there was no need for a vote or for his motion to be debated. The executive were happy to rely on the recommendation of compliance chief Domenico Scala, who considered there was nothing big enough in it to take the World Cups away from Russia and Qatar. Scala, before he came to that verdict, had taken legal advice from Swiss professor Anton Heini, from Zurich University and German professor in sport at Cologne University, Martin Nolte, who are now the seventh and eighth people to have seen the full Garcia findings. Only six of the 25-strong executive had been expected to support Garcia’s publication before they convened . Domenico Scala considered there was nothing big enough to take the World Cups away from Russia or Qatar . Scala would not estimate how many of those 430 pages would survive the redaction process, but did say: ‘There is nothing in the report that says a re-vote is needed.’ He did recommend that FIFA should never again vote for two World Cup stagings at the same time, and suggested rules should be tightened regarding gift protocol, as well as friendly match procedures and the roles of bid consultants. He also said promotion of football development projects outside the bid country should be stopped, there should be official audits of bids and there must be a legal obligation to store documents. Russia scandalously said their leased bid computers had been returned and all information destroyed, when Garcia came knocking during the investigation process. Meanwhile, the investigation into the five individuals will be fast-tracked according to Blatter, to avoid a repeat of the length and cost of Garcia’s investigation.

"Roberto Soldado has admitted he is embarrassed at how poor his performances have been since joining Tottenham for £26million in 2013. The striker said he was ‘ashamed’ to hear Spurs’ fans sing his name despite failing to deliver on his lofty reputation. The Spaniard has scored only seven goals in 38 league appearances, just one of which was in the Premier League this season. Roberto Soldado celebrates a rare goal for Spurs in the 2-1 win against Everton at White Hart Lane last month . Soldado scored only his fourth goal of the season in the Capital One Cup win against Newcastle on Wednesday . Mauricio Pochettino has repeatedly put his faith in Soldado to justify his price tag. The Argentine also implored Spurs fans to forgive Emmanuel Adebayor, who could feature as Spurs host an in-form Burnley side on Saturday. It would be the first time Adebayor has played for his club since November 9 when they were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane. He later directed his ire at home fans, claiming their booing was damaging players’ confidence. Both big money forwards have been outshone by Spurs academy product Harry Kane, who scored his 13th goal of the season in Wednesday’s 4-0 League Cup win over Newcastle. Soldado, who was a club record transfer from Valencia when he arrived in the summer of 2013, scored when he came off the bench to replace Kane against Newcastle. But he has struggled to find consistent scoring form. ‘From the first minute I’m involved, even before I’ve done anything, the fans show they believe in me, and I feel ashamed at not being able to satisfy them,’ he said, ‘It’s hard when they sing. ‘I hear them chanting my name and if I miss a chance, I feel bad. I can’t thank them enough. I just hope I can reach the level they expect and take advantage of the great players around me. ‘If only I knew that little something that’s missing for me to find my form, really show my game and for the goals to start flowing. I am reassured, though, because the manager (Pochettino) is giving me more minutes on the pitch. The 29-year-old has failed to impress for the north London side since joining the club last August . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino says confidence is high within the squad after two straight wins . ‘With that, my time will come, because in the games I’m feeling good. The critical thing is that the goals aren’t coming but I know they will.’ Pochettino said confidence was high among his players after two consecutive victories, including an away Premier League win over Swansea. They have lost four times in front of home fans this season so will be keen to avoid slipping up against Sean Dyche’s Burnley, who are hovering just above the relegation zone despite taking 11 points from their last six games. Adebayor could play a part having returned to training after being granted a week leave for ‘personal reasons’ to travel back to Ghana. Pochettino said he thought fans would forgive the striker for saying Spurs were ‘better off’ playing away from home. ‘I think the fans love the good player. Ade is a fantastic player. I think this (his comments) are not a big problem,’ said Pochettino, ‘In football the mood changes quickly. 'When you have lost you are upset, our fans are upset, the players are upset and I was upset. After I think we have only one objective and that is to take Tottenham as high as possible. I think this is in the past.’","Roberto Soldado has been below-par since joining Spurs last August .

"World rugby chiefs must not abandon 'history and tradition' in favour of staging Six Nations matches in the USA, according to former Scotland captain Alastair Kellock. Glasgow lock Kellock captained the Barbarians to a thrilling 40-36 Twickenham defeat to Australia on Saturday, showing his Test class despite being overlooked for Scotland's autumn campaign. International Rugby Board chief executive Brett Gosper said he would welcome Six Nations action being staged in America, following the sell-out Chicago clash between New Zealand and the USA. Alastair Kellock (above) warned rugby bosses not to abandon the traditions of the game in taking it abroad . Kellock (left) was captain of the Barbarians in the 40-36 defeat to Australia at Twickenham on Saturday . After upholding long-standing rugby values as the Barbarians pushed Australia to the limit in London, Kellock warned against the sport making too many changes too soon owing to its growing financial benefits. 'The game is changing; it's becoming more commercial, which is a good thing,' Kellock told Press Association Sport. 'It's getting more viewers in from all over the world. 'The history and the tradition of playing Six Nations matches at the Millennium Stadium or playing at Murrayfield, to give just two examples, is also very strong. 'So whatever happens I'm lucky enough not to have to make those decisions! 'But we need to remember the history and tradition of our game, and that's what we showed at the weekend against Australia. IRB chief executive Brett Gosper (second left) suggested future six nations games could be held in the USA . Rugby's growth in the USA was underlined by New Zealand taking on the Eagles in Chicago on Saturday . 'I believe you've got to wait and see how the game with the All Blacks goes over there, the pick-up and the noise after it. 'And then it's important to drip-feed it. 'Let's not try and run and talk about Six Nations games over there until we've taken a few steps forward and talked about some more exhibition and friendly matches.' New Zealand dispatched the USA 74-6 at Chicago's Soldier Field on Saturday, the All Blacks stopping off en route to their northern hemisphere tour. The Kiwis took on the Eagles in America for the first time since 1980, underlining rugby's growth in the US, leading IRB boss Gosper to call for Six Nations chiefs to consider staging a match stateside. Sonny Bill Williams (left) in action for New Zealand as they beat the United States  74-6 in Chicago . New Zealand perform the Haka in front of a packed crowd at Chicago's Soldier Field stadium on Saturday . 'I know Premiership Rugby are talking about bringing some big club games to the States and why not some internationals like the Six Nations?' Gosper told the Daily Telegraph. 'If that fits in with the Six Nations' vision of their tournament that would be certainly interesting from a developmental point of view in the United States. 'It is up to the Six Nations as to where they want to play their games but again I think that would be a terrific thing for the game.' Kellock, meanwhile, hailed the All Blacks for helping the global game's growth, but reiterated his desire for caution on radical changes to tradition. 'It's brilliant the All Blacks went to America,' said Kellock. 'You want this great game to be seen by as many people as possible. Former Scotland captain Kellock was the first Scottish captain of the Barbarians in 21 years . Australia led the Barbarians by 18 points at one point on Saturday, before the margin was cut down to four . 'If we can take the game to places where it's not strong, and grow it, that's brilliant. 'But we still can't get ahead of ourselves with any of this.' Scotland's first Barbarians captain for 21 years said he was proud head coach John Kirwan's side did not fold under extreme Australia pressure on Saturday. 'I thought Australia were outstanding from 45 to 65 minutes,' he said. 'They claimed an 18-point lead but we whittled it back down to four and were in control at the end. 'Even though we lost we were over the moon with the performance and the attitude shown. 'To be asked to play was a huge honour, but to lead the team out was extremely special.'","International Rugby Board's Brett Gosper mentioned staging games in USA .

"They could reveal the secrets of Hollywood - and explain just why TV shows and films become hits. A Northwestern University professor has plotted a series of graphs revealing some of Hollywood's scripting tricks. They include leaving the phrase 'love you' until the last possible moment. The analysis looked at key words and at what point in films and TV shows they were used . Love Actually: Keeping the use of the phrase 'love you' until later in a script is key, researchers say. 'What I've done is cut every script there into 'twelfths' of a movie or TV show; the charts here show the course of an episode or movie from the first minute at the left to the last one at the right,' explained Ben Schmidt, an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University on his blog. He found that almost all TV and film writers delays the use of 'I love you' until late in the plot. 'For example: the phrase 'love you' (as in, mostly, 'I love you') is most frequent towards the end of movies or TV shows: characters in movies are almost three times more likely to profess their love in the last scene of a movie than in the first.' Other words and phrases that are key include 'if you'. 'It's rare at the beginning of scripts, common in the middle, and then rare again towards the end,'says Schmidt. The phrase 'if you' rarely appears early in a script - as it needs characters to build up to it . Schmidt analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study, and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot. He believes this is because it reveals a particular type of dialogue, in which the protagonist has to give or seek advice about the consequences of their actions. 'First scenes won't have the necessary exposition laid out for the hero to reach a crossroads; and as the script wraps up in the third act, the importance of decisions fade out in favour of consequences.' Schmidt analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study, and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot. Schmidt analysed a whole series of words and phrases as part of the study, and found there were key patterns reveal throughout the plot. For instance, he found over the course of a script, characters talk more about the truth and lying; they more often narrate murders; they use the language of apology and authenticity. (Two out of the nine topics display 'sorry' prominently.) 'They talk less, on the other hand, about 'business' and 'companies,' about their 'job' and the 'office,' and about times of day.'","Professor plotted Hollywood's scripting tricks by analysing films .

"It seems that President Obama may be more of a football fan that an lover of film. In his year end news conference on Friday, President Obama spent some time talking about the decision by Sony to not distribute their film The Interview following threats from a hacking group out of North Korea, and at one point called actors James Franco 'James Flacco.' It would seem that he had confused the Hollywood heartthrob with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco. Scroll down for video .

Bruised ego: The slip happened while the President was talking about Franco's (above) film The Interview . Welcome: The President likely had the actor confused with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco (above) Flacco found the entire incident hysterical, writing soon after on Twitter; 'Welcome to the family, brother. @JamesFrancoTV.' Franco, meanwhile, has yet to respond. President Barack Obama said on Friday that Sony Pictures Entertainment made a crucial mistake in self-censoring when it canceled the Christmas Day release of 'The Interview,' a satirical film that depicted the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. The decision followed a crippling cyber attack on Sony's servers that was launched by the North Korean regime. But critics have branded the film company as cowards for tucking tail and running when it was threatened. Welcome: Friday afternoon, Flacco tweeted (above) to Franco . 'Sony's a corporation. It has suffered significant damage,' Obama told reporters in an end-of year press conference. 'There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.' But then he lowered the boom. 'Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.' 'I wish they had spoken to me first,' he said. 'I would have told then, ""Do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks"".'","President Obama accidentally referred to James Franco as 'James Flacco' during a news conference on Friday .

"The prosecutor who presided over Darren Wilson's grand jury trial in Ferguson claims a number of witnesses lied under oath. Bob McCulloch has been accused of manipulating the six men and three women who refused to indict the officer over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Slamming the allegations as baseless, the Missouri lawmaker blamed witnesses for twisting the narrative in his first interview since the verdict on November 24. Scroll down for video . Accusations: St Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch claims witnesses lied under oath to the grand jury . McCulloch, who convened the grand jury in August, told KTRS Radio in St Louis on Friday: 'Clearly some were not telling the truth.' He made reference to one woman who claimed to have seen the shooting. McCulloch said she 'clearly wasn't present. She recounted a story right out of the newspaper' that backed up Wilson's version of events, he said. State Rep. Karla May is pushing for a state investigation, saying she believes McCulloch helped sway the grand jury into the decision. McCulloch did not return messages left with his office by The Associated Press on Friday seeking comment about May's allegations, and whether he would pursue perjury charges against any witnesses who may have lied. The shooting by a white police officer on August 9 spurred significant unrest, both in August and immediately after the grand jury decision was announced. Twelve Ferguson-area businesses, along with police cars, were burned on November 24, and several other businesses were damaged. In the radio interview, McCulloch also defended the decision to make the announcement at night, saying it was best for schools and allowed business owners time to decide whether to open the next day. A joint House and Senate committee is already investigating why Gov Jay Nixon did not use National Guard troops in Ferguson on November 24. May, a St. Louis Democrat, sent a letter Thursday to committee chairman Sen. Kurt Schaefer, urging that the investigation expand to look at whether McCulloch committed prosecutorial misconduct. Controversy: There was national outcry when Darren Wilson (left) wasn't indicted for shooting Michael Brown . 'Many St. Louis-area residents believe — and there is at least some evidence to suggest — that Mr. McCulloch manipulated the grand jury process from the beginning to ensure that Officer Wilson would not be indicted,' May wrote. She said in an interview that McCulloch should have removed himself from the case at the outset. 'I don't believe he followed proper procedures when he presented evidence to the grand jury,' May said. 'To me, he was working for the defendant in this case and not the victim.' Critics had called for McCulloch to either step aside or for Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor, citing concerns about whether McCulloch could fairly oversee the case. McCulloch's father was a police officer killed in the line of duty by a black assailant in the 1960s. McCulloch said immediately after the announcement that the jury of nine whites and three blacks met on 25 separate days over three months, hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses, including three medical examiners and experts on blood, toxicology and firearms and other issues. He said he assigned prosecutors in his office to present evidence, rather than himself, because he was 'fully aware of unfounded but growing concern that the investigation might not be fair.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and others expressed anger that of the hundreds of National Guard troops dispatched to the St. Louis region on Nov. 24, none were in Ferguson as the announcement was made. No timetable has been set for the legislative committee's investigation, and it wasn't clear if the committee would consider investigating McCulloch. A message left with Schaefer was not immediately returned.","Prosecutpr Bob McCulloch accused of manipulating Ferguson grand jury into acquitting officer Darren Wilson over Michael Brown's death .

"It was a mission that captivated audiences across the world - and now video reveals exactly what astronauts will experience when they come back to Earth in the Orion capsule. Among the first data to be removed from Orion following its uncrewed Dec. 5 flight test was video recorded through windows in Orion’s crew module. Nasa says it 'provides a taste of the intense conditions the spacecraft and the astronauts it carries will endure when they return from deep space destinations on the journey to Mars.' Scroll down for video . During the re-entry, flames are visible on the capsule at it reaches 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F) During the uncrewed test, Orion traveled twice through the Van Allen belt, where it experienced periods of intense radiation, and reached an altitude of 3,600 miles above Earth. The spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Although much of the video was transmitted down to Earth and shown in real time on NASA Television, it was not available in its entirety. The blackout caused by the superheated plasma surrounding the vehicle as it endured the peak temperatures of its descent prevented downlink of any information at that key point. However, the cameras were able to record the view and now the public can have an up-close look at the extreme environment a spacecraft experiences as it travels back through Earth's environment from beyond low-Earth orbit. The video begins 10 minutes before Orion's 11:29 a.m. EST splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, just as the spacecraft was beginning to experience Earth's atmosphere. Peak heating from the friction caused by the atmosphere rubbing against Orion's heat shield comes less than two minutes later, and the footage shows the plasma created by the interaction change from white to yellow to lavender to magenta as the temperature increases. As Orion emerges safely on the other side of its trial by fire, the camera continues to record the deployment of the series of parachutes that slowed it to a safe 20 mph for landing and the final splash as Orion touched down on Earth. Orion was then retrieved by a combined NASA, U.S. Navy and Lockheed Martin team and carried back to shore aboard the Navy's USS Anchorage. After returning to shore, it was loaded on to a truck and driven back to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where it arrived on Thursday. The video begins 10 minutes before Orion's 11:29 a.m. EST splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, just as the spacecraft was beginning to experience Earth's atmosphere. Orion traveled 3,600 miles above Earth on its 4.5-hour flight test – farther than any spacecraft built for humans has been in more than 40 years. In coming back from that distance, it also traveled faster and experienced hotter temperatures – 20,000 mph and near 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, to be exact. After the fiery re-entry, the craft slows as it enters Earth's atmosphere, revealing the bright blue sky above it. Orion will travel faster and experience even higher temperatures on future missions, when it returns from greater distances, but this altitude allowed engineers to perform a good checkout of Orion's critical systems – in particular its heat shield. Orion's flight test was a critical step on NASA's journey to Mars. Work already has begun on the next Orion capsule, which will launch for the first time on top of NASA's new Space Launch System rocket and travel to a distant retrograde orbit around the moon. Three minutes from landing, the main parachutes open to bring the capsule back to Earth. A combined US Navy and Nasa team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing. The successful retrieval of Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) was part of a US government inter-agency effort to test recovery techniques for future space flights. But although this was Orion’s first trip to space, it is actually the fifth at-sea testing of a module using the Navy well deck recovery method - although the others had used mock-ups. Four tests were conducted prior to the flight to prepare the recovery team and make sure everything went smoothly. The first test was conducted at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in August 2013. The others were conducted earlier in 2014, known as Underway Recovery Tests (URTs). If astronauts had been onboard Orion, they would have experienced a g-force of 8.2 - nearly twice that generated when Soyuz capsules return from the International Space Station. Orion hit its target point 275 miles (442 km) west of Baja, California, and achieved at least one record: flying farther and faster than any capsule built for humans since the Apollo moon program. 'There's your new spacecraft, America,' Mission Control commentator Rob Navias said as the Orion capsule neared the water. He called the journey 'the most perfect flight you could ever imagine.' The capsule reached a peak altitude more than 14 times farther from Earth than the International Space Station. No spacecraft designed for astronauts had gone so far since Apollo 17, 42 years ago. splashdown! A combined US Navy and Nasa team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing. NASA's Orion spacecraft is off loaded from the back of the USS Anchorage at Naval Base San Deigo, California . Divers surround the capsule (in green helmets) as the operation begins to recover Orion . The USS Anchorage was ultimately chosen for EFT-1 as it has a combination of capabilities suited to assist Nasa with the Orion recovery. Called a landing platform dock (LPD) ship, it has a well-deck, advanced medical facilities, helicopters, three dimensional air-search radar and small boats that could all be used in the recovery operation. A specially-trained bridge team were also used throughout the duration of the recovery. And once the capsule had landed in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Baja California, the ship manoeuvred close to it along with small boats in order to safely retrieve it. Recovery team members in a Zodiac boat help guide Nasa's Orion spacecraft into the well deck of the USS Anchorage following its splashdown in the Pacific Ocean . Divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward Anchorage, where a Nasa-designed winch hauled the capsule into the well deck. ‘Orion is meant to be reused, which is why we tailored this recovery to accommodate keeping the capsule safe,’ said Navy Diver 1st Class Matthew Demyers of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 11. And Chief Boatswain’s Mate Jason B. Roberts, deck department leading chief petty officer, added: 'We practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority. The sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully. 'I couldn't be more proud of our sailors and the work they accomplished here today.’ In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32kph) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence . On target: Orion splashed down at its target point 275 miles (442 km) west of Baja, California while travelling at around 20mph (32km/h) On Friday Nasa's new Orion spacecraft made the 'bull's-eye' splashdown in the Pacific  following its dramatic test flight that took it twice around Earth in 4.5 hours. The spacecraft, which could someday take humans to Mars, made a fiery 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F). Cameras fitted to the rocket and capsule captured the entire mission - giving an unprecedented 'Orion's-eye' view from inside the capsule that could on day take man to Mars. Looking home: Cameras onboard the Orion capsule took this stunning snap of the Earth during re-entry. Flames show the incredible heat the capsule was subjected to, as it hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching 2,200°C (4,000°F) Cameras onboard Orion captured its entire mission, from blast off (left) to its climb into orbit (right) An astronaut's eye view: A camera mounted insde the capsule looking out a windows captured this stunning image of Earth . Nasa needed to send Orion that high in order to set the crew module up for a rapid and fiery entry. That was considered the most critical part of the entire flight - testing the largest of its kind heat shield for survival before humans climb aboard. In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32km/h) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence. Earth shrank from view through Orion's capsule window during its trip out to space, and stunning images were relayed back home. Its return was recorded by an unmanned drone flying over the recovery zone, providing more spectacular views. Helicopters then relayed images of the crew module bobbing in the water. Three of the five air bags deployed properly, enough to keep the capsule floating upright. 'Today's flight test of Orion is a huge step for NASA and a really critical part of our work to pioneer deep space on our Journey to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden on Friday. 'The teams did a tremendous job putting Orion through its paces in the real environment it will endure as we push the boundary of human exploration in the coming years.' After being offloaded at shore the capsule will make the journey back to Kennedy from San Diego on the back of a truck - and officials said they hoped it would arrive by Christmas. Orion is being developed alongside the world's most powerful rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is due to make its maiden launch in 2018 or 2019. Together, SLS and Orion will allow Nasa to send humans into deep space to destinations such as Mars. There were a number of key moments throughout the flight (shown in diagram), designed to test the capability of Orion, all of which it passed without a hitch. In total the flight lasted about four and a half hours . First step towards Mars: Orion's Delta IV Heavy rocket clears the service tower that sits alongside the launchpad at Cape Canaveral.

"Tyson Fury had predicted that the war which preceded his heavyweight encounter with Dereck Chisora would be ‘the fight of the night.’ He was right. The minor epic in which Billy Joe Saunders put a stop – probably temporary – to the rise of Chris Eubank Jnr was indeed the fight of the night at the ExCel in London’s Docklands. But what Fury did not expect was to be booed to victory. VIDEO Scroll down for Peter Fury: Tyson have to be at death's door to pull out of a fight . Tyson Fury dominated Dereck Chisora for 10 rounds before his opponent was pulled out by his corner . Fury celebrates with his British and European titles while Chisora is left with a busted-up face and a right eye which is almost shut . Fury lands an uppercut on his way to a decisive victory over Chisora to set himself up for a shot at Wladimir Klitschko next year . Chisora’s face was swollen as a pumpkin by the end of the 10th round and his eyes virtually closed. So the complaints were not against the doctors and his corner deciding to spare him from further punishment. What dismayed the 15,700 capacity crowd – and the referee for that matter – was the manner of what masqueraded as a final eliminator to challenge his eminence Wladimir Klitshcko for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. After a snappy start to proceedings Fury opted to settle into a repetitive pattern rather than finish off Chisora with a burst of aggression. Round after round Chisora came plodding forward and the leaning tower of Manchester picked him off with alternating left and right jabs, plus the occasional clubbing combination. Fury kept doing enough to win the rounds but did not extend himself to apply the knock out which was there for the taking. Referee Marcus McDonnell put an absolute stop to the inaction in the eighth to warn them: ‘Either you fight or we go home.’ The crowd were heading for the exits soon after. Perhaps Fury’s reticence was rooted in the size of the prize at stake. He saw no need to risk a shock defeat which would have snatched the Klitschko bonanza from his grasp. It will not concern him yet that a performance like this would be unlikely to trouble Wlad the Impaler. But the public were not best pleased. When they put a halt to proceedings so predictable that Chisora clearly had no chance of winning, the arena gave a collective sigh of relief. Chisora came out fast but was stopped in his tracks by Fury’s first heavy right of the fight. Chisora was a much fitter proposition for this rematch than in their first encounter three years ago. But then the stakes were higher now. He was working hard to get inside the towering Fury’s long reach. This is as fit of body, sharp of mind and quick and accurate of punch as we have seen Fury. At times he was smiling in admiration of his handiwork. Chisora kept walking forward – into a variety of punches form the challenger for his European heavyweight title. Chisora stumbles forward as he struggled to get any purchase on his punches while Fury throws out his jab . From the first bell, Fury was on top and Chisora failed to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds he was in the fight . Both men were told to come together and fight but it was Fury's long range and his jab which kept him in control . Fury was switching between left and right jabs and starting to land at will. When swayed out of range of a wild swing from Del Boy he turned to the crowd seeking applause for his remarkable athleticism for so huge a human being. Chisora was caught with four big punches in short order and began backing away in alarm at Fury’s power. The first decisive round was massively in favour of the Manchester traveller. There are still times when Fury likes to amuse himself by changing the script even when it is in his favour. So he spent the start of the fourth letting Chisora swarm over him in the ropes. Then he unleashed a barrage of lefts and rights which staggered the Londoner to win another round. Chisora’s face was beginning to swell but he took encouragement from connecting with one of his big right-hand swings. Fury then returned to picking him off. Chisora kept coming – albeit more sluggishly. Fury kept landing the jabs from either wing. The crowd began to get a little restless and sporadic booing broke out as Fury ticked off another round. Fury, in a southpaw stance in these pictures, shows his height and reach advantage which allowed him to dominate all night . Chisora has his eye checked after being forced to take some heavy punishment from Fury's jab over the 10 rounds . The fight is waved off after Chisora's trainer Don Charles told his man that he wanted him to go out on his feet . Fury called Chisora a baby but was himself admonished by McDonnell for flicking Del Boy with the back of his right hand instead of punching correctly. ‘That’s not boxing,’ said the official, By now more of the crowd were in agreement with that sentiment. Although this was child’s play for Fury so far. If Chisora’s ears were closing as rapidly as his eyes he would not have heard the cat-calls. But there was no mistaking the referee’s disapproval for the sporadic action. With Fury seemingly content now just to coast through the fight, McDonnell stopped the action completely and warned them both; ‘Either you fight or we go home.’ So on we went, Chisora peering through slits, Fury landing whenever the mood took him, albeit not often enough to entertain the 15,700 throng in the ExCel. Chisora’s belief was ebbing away and when he backed away Fury opened up a little. But not enough to close the show? At least not by himself. The end of the round brought a medical consultation to Chisora’s corner and they pulled their half blind man out. He had not won a round and clearly had no chance of winning.

"CLICK HERE for all the facts, stats and heat maps from West Ham's 3-1 victory over Liverpool . Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho were all simply woeful as Liverpool succumbed to a 3-1 defeat at West Ham. The Hammers tore Brendan Rodgers' side apart in the opening exchanges, scoring twice in the opening seven minutes as Simon Mignolet, and the entire Reds defence all failed to impress. Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren looked in utter disarray right from the start, with Winston Reid putting the Hammers ahead after less than 90 seconds, before Diafra Sakho made it two with an outrageous dinked chip over Simon Mignolet within seven minutes. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet looks on as Winston Reid slams the opener in from point-blank range . Diafra Sakho chips in West Ham's second after Alberto Moreno failed to close him down . Mignolet stands helplessly after the ball drifted over his head into the top right-hand corner . Not for the first time in his Liverpool career, Mignolet looked utterly lost inbetween the sticks as Stewart Downing sent a free kick high up to the far post, before James Tomkins nodded back across the six-yard box for Reid to finish into an open goal. And just six minutes later the Reds stopper was left in no-mans land again as West Ham's Sakho found the top corner with an outrageous effort from the corner of the area. Only the Senegalese international will know whether he actually meant it or not, but there is no doubt that left-back Alberto Moreno, whilst admittedly not the biggest culprit of sloppy defending on the night, should and could have done more to prevent it from happening. Martin Skrtel made 11 clearances but not a single block during 90 minutes at Upton Park . Mamadou Sakho failed to make a single block, tackle or interception during his 70 minutes on the pitch . Liverpool right-back Javi Manquillo being out-leapt at the far post by Enner Valencia . This was just Skrtel and Lovren's third start together, with their most recent outing alongside each other coming in their 3-1 defeat away at Manchester City. And they simply could not deal with the the power of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho, who were both superb throughout. Rodgers was in no mood to wait around and see if his defensive pair were going to gel during the course of the first-half, introducing Mamadou Sakho for right-back Javi Manquillo after just 20 minutes and switching to a back three. And the move brought immediate dividends as Raheem Sterling brought them back just short of 30 minutes, slamming one home from the edge of the area after Mario Balotelli's blocked shot had fallen into his path. Martin Skrtel vies for the ball with West Ham forward Valencia in the first half . Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho clashed heads during the first half after rising for the same ball . Lovren receiving a lengthy period of treatment after clashing heads with his defensive partner . Raheem Sterling fired one in to bring Liverpool back to within a goal of the Hammers . But at the back there was still no cohesion or organisation whatsoever, somewhat metaphorically reflected by the clash of heads between Mamadou Sakho and Lovren that left the Croatian requiring a lengthy period of treatment - and head injury that perhaps should have seen him withdrawn at half time. Going into the second half at 2-1 down, Rodgers decided the wisest course of action would be to throw caution to the wind and use his second substution to introduce the attack-minded Adam Lallana for Lucas. In attack they looked brighter, but every time West Ham broke away, Liverpool's three-man defence looked hopeless and helpless. With just over 20 minutes to go, Skrtel failed to control a simple backpass and let Diafra Sakho steal the ball off him on the edge of the area. But the Slovakian defender was let off on this occasion as the West Ham forward proved far less clinical with his attempt than he did with his superb finish in the first half. Winston's Reid's opener came from a knockdown by James Tomkins from a Stewart Downing free kick . Diafra Sakho's super second (whether he meant it or not) was a cheeky dink from the corner of the area . Morgan Amalfitono's goal that sealed the result came right through the heart of Liverpool's defence . With just a few minutes to go, however, Mamadou Sakho was not so lucky as yet another lapse at the back really did prove defining. Dragged out to the left-hand side, he prodded a feeble header straight into the path of the onrushing Downing. There was no other way to describe it than as a simply inexplicable moment of ineptitude from the French international. The former England winner then drove right at the heart of Liverpool's haphazard defence, before providing a slide-rule pass into the path of Morgan Amalfitano, who made no mistake with the finish. 3-1. Game over. Skrtel's sliding challenge couldn't stop Morgan Amalfitano putting the game beyond Liverpool at 3-1 . Brendan Rodgers has a lot to think about in terms of defensive organisation ahead of their next game . Liverpool conceded two or more goals in 16 of their Premier League games last season. They managed to wrestle 23 points out of a possible 48 in those games, but it is something that will need to be addressed if they are to challenge again at the Premier League summit this time round. On many occasions last campaign, their sheer potency up front was enough to dig them out of trouble. But in the post-Luis Suarez era, and with Mario Balotelli once again quiet (and Daniel Sturridge out injured), they no longer possess such a luxury. If Liverpool are hoping to challenge again this campaign, their defence is going to have to be infinitely more resolute than it was here. Rodgers and his boys have a lot of work to do.","Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho fail to impress for Liverpool .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke looks like having a lot more success in the second half of his England Commission launched on Friday night than he did before the interval. Dyke's plans for B teams and strategic loan partnerships announced before the World Cup have already been kicked into the long grass through strong opposition from clubs. But his second effort to improve the long-term performance of England's national team by radically improving grass-roots pitches and the coaching of youngsters has met the approval of the Premier League and other stake-holders. Greg Dyke is hopeful that the new plans can boost grass-roots football and help develop England stars . The England team against San Marino included young players but there are too few in the Premier League . Report two acknowledges that the B team initiative of placing new sides within the football pyramid is doomed although talks are still ongoing about the slim possibility of the B teams entering the Johnstone's Paints Trophy or the FA Trophy. But Dyke's grass-roots plans, which are far easier to bring about, are already up and running with the pilot project starting in Sheffield this month - already funded by the FA and the Football foundation - and preparation work underway in Liverpool and then Birmingham. The FA are planning to install football hubs containing the latest artificial pitches (AGPs) in 30 cities in a £230m five-year project paid for by a combination of local authority financing and from football including critical Premier League support. It is hoped by concentrating football in these specific areas , it will be easier to identify top talent coming through and provide the necessary coaching. The likes of Jack Wilshere (left) and Calum Chambers (right) are rare cases of English players in the top flight . Raheem Sterling has broken into the Liverpool and England first teams over the past two seasons . The hubs across each city will be owned and managed by a new local football organisation or Trust whose membership could include the local authority, the County FA and professional football clubs in the area. The number of hubs in each city - between five and 20 - will depend on size and demand . Each hub will differ depending on local circumstances but will typically have 3 AGP's and a turf one, be floodlit and contain changing, classroom and catering facilities. The coaching to go with the hubs will be brought under the control of a new Head of Education reporting to Dan Ashworth, effectively the technical director of the FA. A further 25 full-time FA coach educators will be recruited with the FA also planning over the next three years to triple the number of Youth award Level 3 coaches from 800 to 3,000, triple Advanced Youth Award holders from 200 to 750 and increase Pro Licence holders from 200 to 300. Head of Education Dan Ashworth will run the coaching set-up, to provide Roy Hodgson with more options . England manager Roy Hodgson (right) has had to work with a very small pool of English players . The England Commission was set up to boost the number of English players in the Premier League . Dyke said: 'When I first got this job Arsene Wenger said to me that the trouble with English football is that your boys from the age of 10 are not technically good enough. I am not sure that we buy that but we're looking again at facilities and coaching. 'I went back to the football pitch I used to play on as a kid and it's still the same now. Nothing has changed. So if we can implement our proposals for radical changes, it will make a big difference. 'It's expensive, but if we can find the money, I think we will transform football and the way it is played in those cities.' England's dismal performance at the World Cup has led to questions about the structure of English football . The Premier League will back the proposals which will hopefully produce more young talent like John Stones . Dyke is hopeful of receiving backing from the Government and the Premier League, who have been involved in the process throughout in a rare example of the two warring football bodies working with each other rather than against. Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, said: 'The Premier League and our clubs have a long held commitment to investing in and supporting community sports facilities, sports participation projects, and schools football. 'In the 2013/14 season alone we invested in 52 new 3G artificial grass pitches, our club community coaches delivered 66,000 PE lessons in primary schools, and 20,000 children participated in our competitive schools football programme. 'We were consulted by the FA Chairman's England Commission as part of its research into the provision of grass roots facilities and coaching and welcome proposals to enhance both areas. 'Getting this right is imperative to the good health of the game at all levels – players like Raheem Sterling and Calum Chambers have to start off somewhere. The Premier League and our clubs will keep playing our part to help ensure that the provision of top quality facilities and coaching is delivered where it is needed most and will have greatest impact.' Dyke added: 'They are all interested but waiting to see what the other one puts in. I don't think £50m-a-year for five years is an unreasonable amount of money.' And Dyke, asked how far football's tanker has been turned by his Commission, believes: 'A fair bit' if the stricter rules on work permits and home grown players, the accepted parts of his first report, are added to the facilities and coaches reforms.","Greg Dyke launches second report for England Commission .

"Surveillance video from the lobby of an Atlantic City casino released Friday shows what happened after disgraced NFL star Ray Rice knocked out his wife-to-be. The footage from inside the now-defunct Revel Casino obtained exclusively by ABC News shows a distraught Janay Palmer, Rice's now-wife, refusing to talk to the Baltimore Ravens player after getting punched in the face inside the elevator moments earlier. The woman is seen in the video pushing away the 5-foot-8, 206-pound athlete when he tries to come near her. Scroll down for videos . Aftermath: Extended CCTV footage from inside Revel Casino shows what happened after Ray Rice punched his then-fiancee inside an elevator . Silent treatment: Janay Palmer, dressed in pink and seen from the back, at first refuses to talk to her fiance, who sits at a distance and glares at her . In custody: Ray Rice is seen being led away in handcuffs by police after the elevator attack . All's forgiven? Although Janay Palmer initially appears to be angry at Rice, later in the video she is seen kissing and nuzzling him on the neck (pictured left and right) Security guards at the hotel then come to Palmer's defense and shield her from Rice. Hotel staffers are seen bringing a wheelchair for Palmer in case she has trouble walking after the elevator attack. All the while, Rice is seated to one side glancing anxiously at his fiancee. The 45-minute never-before-seen tape, which has been edited down to just over 2 minutes by ABC, also shows how Janay Palmer's demeanor changes over time, going from furious to emotional, and ultimately to forgiving. When Rice is escorted out of the hotel and casino in handcuffs, his fiancee is seen kissing and nuzzling him on the neck in an elevator. Rice and Palmer were each charged with assault, but the count against the woman was later dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence. The Ravens star was indicted on an an upgraded charge of aggravated assault, but instead of serving time he was allowed to enter a pretrial prevention program, which would allow his criminal record to be expunged. Shocking footage: It comes two months after the footballer was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer  with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino . Knocked out: After this elevator security video of the altercation surfaced in September, the Baltimore Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, before the NFL suspended him indefinitely . According to ABC News, Rice tried to block the new outlet from obtaining the extended surveillance video showing the aftermath of the attack, but ultimately lost. 'This is a time of healing and he, quite naturally, doesn’t want another media showing of what must have been the worst event of his life,' Rice's attorney Peter Ginsberg said. 'What the media ought to be focusing on is the issue of domestic violence and why the NFL never did anything to construct a personal conduct program that works and why the NFL ignored the issue of domestic violence. Showing yet another Ray Rice video is simply a distraction.' Ray Rice was suspended from the NFL indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer on the morning of February 15 with his left fist in an elevator at Revel Casino in Atlantic City. The suspension was lifted last month, clearing the way for the 27-year-old athlete to join any team. 'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore during a charity event Thursday, just one day before the release of the extended CCTV video. United front: Former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice (pictured arriving at court with his wife, Janay Palmer, on November 5) has won his appeal of his indefinite suspension and can return to the field immediately . Suspension: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (left) pauses as he speaks during a news conference in New York. Right, Rice smiles on the sideline during the second half of a game against the San Francisco  49ers . Initially, Rice was sidelined by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancee. However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. On the field: During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice . Couple: In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer (pictured together)- who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome . Last month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband. She told the broadcaster: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him. 'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I ""remember"" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.' After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said.","Ex-NFL star filmed punching his wife Janay Palmer with left fist in elevator .

"President Barack Obama said on Friday that the tragic deaths of two black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City this year sparked a 'healthy conversation' in America that will allow the country to 'come together and to take a practical approach' to solving race relations issues. 'This isn’t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying,' the president said this afternoon at his year-end press conference. 'I think that troubles everybody.' Obama also contended that 'people are basically good and have good intentions,' even though 'sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should.' Scroll down for video . At his year-end press conference, President Barack Obama contended that 'people are basically good and have good intentions,' even though 'sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should' During the wide-ranging discussion with the press that preceded the president's departure for his 17-day holiday in Hawaii, Obama reflected on the 'difficult times' that have fallen on the nation in the past year and shared his vision for the first of his final two years in office. Obama took an optimistic approach to the forthcoming takeover of Republicans in the legislative branch and said he believes 'there are real opportunities to get things done' in the next Congress but again warned Republicans that he won't abandon his principles simply because his party is no longer calling the shots. 'The question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree. I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree,' he predicted. 'If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no,' he said. Showing just how serious he was, Obama added, 'I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions.' The president said Republicans' claims that his utilization of executive authority is what is ruining their working relationship with him was disingenuous and that he's 'never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive' in the recent legislative session. 'There’s no evidence of that,' he stated. 'So I intend to continue to do what I’ve been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I’m going to do it. 'And I will then, side-by-side, reach out to members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let’s work together; I’d rather do it with you.' Potentially foreshadowing future executive orders he may issue during his remaining time in office Obama said, 'the question is going to be I think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage, or equal pay, or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans. 'If they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is: Pass bills. And work with me to make sure I’m willing to sign those bills.' See ya in 17 days: Obama was off to Hawaii for his holiday vacation after the conclusion of his news conference . Likewise, if Republicans want any of their preferred legislative 'initiatives to become law, I’m going to have sign off,' Obama said. 'And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about.' Turning his attention to the racial tensions now rising to the surface of American dialogue, Obama said they 'are not new phenomenon' but are now at the forefront 'in part because people are able to film what have just been, in the past, stories passed on around a kitchen table. 'And you’re not going to solve a problem if it’s not being talked about,' he added. The president said that one aspect of the discussion that's been overlooked is that 'the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing.' 'Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn’t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around,' he admitted. 'But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems.' Obama acknowledged that it's the job of the White House press core 'to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they're popping.' 'But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better,' he insisted. 'The economy has gotten better. Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better. We know more about how to educate our kids. We solved problems,' he said. Obama said that he hopes that the country's track record  will induce 'some confidence' in the New Year that that 'America knows how to solve problems.' 'And when we work together, we can't be stopped,' he said, closing out the news conference on a high note.","'Sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should,' however, he acknowledged .

"While Cristiano Ronaldo was the name on everyone's lips before kick-off, Thomas Muller was the real star of Germany v Portugal - showing his World Cup pedigree for the second tournament running with two first half goals. But the Bayern Munich forward was also criticised for his theatrics which saw Pepe sent off, making his and Germany's task much easier in the Arena Fonte Nova. The 24-year-old former Manchester United target coolly put his side in front after just 11 minutes, slotting a low penalty past Rui Patricio and scored Germany's third with a low left footed strike in first half stoppage time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Muller's Bayern goals from last season . Calm: Muller confidently strokes home the opening goal from the penalty spot in Group G first game . Under attack: Muller appeared to go down easily as Pepe attempted to defend the ball . National villain: But the Bayern Munich man went down heavily under a challenge from Pepe . Conflicting views: And his reaction to the Portuguese defender's retort led to the referee handing out a red card . At the double: Muller tucked home his second goal just before half-time in Salvador's Arena Fonte Nova . His third came in 78th minute, tapping in Andre Schurrle's cross for the match-ball. That trio went some way towards matching his 2010 Golden Boot-winning total of five goals in South Africa, after just one game. But between the two first half goals, Muller made himself an enemy to the Portuguese for the wrong reasons - theatrically collapsing under Pepe's challenge and then drawing attention to the centre back's headbutt. Golden boy: Muller slotted home his third to put him ahead of the field in the race for the Golden Boot . Ronald-who: Muller outshone the Ballon d'Or winner on a difficult day for Portugal's star man . Muller now sits just one goal ahead of Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie, Karim Benzema and Neymar, who all scored twice in their respective openers.

"Billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (pictured) is being sued by a crisis management company . Billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is being sued by a crisis management company that claims he hired it in 2011 to deal with the scandal over his friendship with Prince Andrew. Sitrick & Co accuses the financier of failing to pay £65,000 fees for advising him after the Duke of York stayed at his £30million mansion in Manhattan. Andrew was seen strolling through Central Park with Epstein in a scandal that caused the prince acute embarrassment and forced him to step down from his role as Britain's trade envoy. Sitrick claims Epstein, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution, agreed for the firm to provide 'consulting advice and public relations services' over the friendship. Epstein was one of the wealthiest and well-connected men in America until he was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution. But despite this Prince Andrew stayed friends with him for three more years until they were seen together. The California Superior Court papers filed by Sitrick & Co. say: 'On or about March 11, 2011, Epstein entered an oral agreement with (Sitrick) to provide consulting advice and public relations services concerning Epstein's relationship with Prince Andrew.' Epstein on a pheasant shoot with Prince Andrew, who stayed friends with him even after he was jailed . According to the New York Post, Epstein counter-sued and claimed he has never been properly served as his main residence is the British Virgin Islands, but a judge has ruled that he can be deposed no matter where he lives. Sitrick & Co. are among the highest profile crisis management and PR companies in the US and have represented the likes of Paris Hilton and X-Files star David Duchovny. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles sought their help in 2002 during the abuse scandal. Prince Andrew's close ties to Epstein were made clear when a photograph emerged of him with Virginia Roberts, one of the girls he is said to have used as a sex slave. Some 40 women since then have in total come forward claiming that Epstein abused them too, though almost all settled their cases. Amid further damaging revelations it emerged that the Duke of York stayed at Epstein's home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet . His ex-wife the Duchess of York had even been bailed out by Epstein with £15,000 when she got into debt. Lawyers for Epstein and Sitrick did not return calls for comment.","Jeffrey Epstein has been sued for £65,000 by Sitrick & Co, a crisis management company .

"Here, from Louis van Gaal, came a demonstration of what a good international manager can achieve at a World Cup. Never mind nine points from what was meant to be a difficult group. Never mind the 10 goals. Van Gaal can take a midfielder from recently-relegated Norwich City and turn him into a match-winner — as he did with Leroy Fer only two minutes after sending him on from the bench. And he can take a defence that was fairly shambolic against Australia, despite winning the game, and reorganise them well enough to withstand the considerable pressure imposed by this stylish Chile team.

Booked: Silva. Manager: Jorge Sampaoli 6. Referee: B Gassama (Gambia) 6. Man of the match: Robben. True, the South Americans who have dazzled at this tournament did not play with quite their usual intensity in the knowledge that, like their opponents, they were already into the next round. It was simply a case of trying to win the group in the hope that this would probably mean avoiding Brazil in the last 16. Even so, Van Gaal responded to one bad defensive display in a way that Roy Hodgson did not — even though there were enough warning signs against Italy to demand action before his England side met Uruguay. Van Gaal reminded us how tactically astute he is on this occasion, returning to a back five — complete with Dirk Kuyt at left back — who defended with a high line to reduce the space that Chile like to use. Holland’s second goal — a second of the tournament for the impressive Memphis Depay — was the perfect example of counter-attacking football, the Dutch breaking from a Chile corner and cashing in on the brilliance of the super-quick Arjen Robben. Net gains: Depay wheels away in celebration following his 90th-minute effort . Crest of a wave: Louis van Gaal and assistant Patrick Kluivert have guided Holland to three group victories . Second best: A runners-up finish means Chile will now face Brazil in the last 16 . Fan-tastic: Holland supporters on the Copacabana beach celebrate their victory . Van Gaal did not appreciate being asked why he had played so defensively in the post-match press conference. ‘Could you give a definition of attacking football?’ he replied. ‘That is my question to you. If you are going to ask me questions, I am going to ask you questions. ‘It was a match of the highest level and the cleverest team won. We were able to neutralise Chile. ‘If you look at my CV, you’ll see that I win a lot of matches. I believe that you have to create a strategy to win. If it had not worked you would have chopped off my head.’ With Robin van Persie suspended — and therefore no Van in the Dutch team for the first time since 1996 — Van Gaal was forced to make changes which included the curious selection of Kuyt in a defensive role. It all worked beautifully. Not until the 23rd minute did Chile even threaten, Felipe Gutierrez meeting a corner from the inventive Alexis Sanchez with a first-time shot that flew over. Holland were letting Chile have most of the ball. Almost 70 per cent. But Chile were still becoming frustrated and might have had cause for complaint 10 minutes before the end, when Stefan De Vrij’s elbow appeared to spare Nigel de Jong the ignominy of an own goal and what would have been an equaliser.

With the changes the future  Manchester United manager made came yet more impressive results — Fer meeting Daryl Janmaat’s terrific, 77th-minute cross with a thumping header. Depay then had the legs to keep up with Robben and arrive in Chile’s six-yard box at the right time to convert his perfectly-timed cross. It means an extra day’s rest for Holland.

Police assistant superintendent Nathan Cheghan said rescue workers were being careful for fear of secondary explosions, often timed to kill people who rush to the scene of a bomb blast. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. One hospital worker said he saw at least seven bodies and another said 15 casualties were in intensive care. The kidnapping of the girls two months ago and failure of Nigeria's military and government to rescue them has roused international concern.

"This heart-stopping footage shows a Texas cop's brush with death as a suspect appears to surrender - then pulls a gun and fired four shots at him. A split-second firefight then erupts, in which Andra Gibson, an officer with the police department of Hedwig Village, near Houston, downs Emilio Solis with a series of fatal gunshots. Despite Solis letting off the first shots, and even brushing the officer's uniform, Officer Gibson was left unharmed in the deadly exchange this summer. Hands up: Emilio Solis pulled over his car and made a gesture of surrender - but immediately pulled a gun and tried to kill police officer Andra Gibson . Hedwig Village police released footage of the incident this week, which shows the 17-shot gunfight between Gibson and Solis, who had been stopped after a car chase, according to Fox 26. The footage shows Solis fire several shots towards the patrol car dash cam. Three embedded themselves in the windshield. Another tore through the leg of Officer Gibson's pants, but did not make contact with his body. Pulls a gun: Almost as soon as he raised he hands, Solis spun round and fired at least four shots at Officer Gibson. Three hit the car windshield, and the fourth brushed his uniform but did not injure him . Officer Gibson then returned fire, at which point Solis collapsed to the ground. A backup car quickly arrives, and the lights illuminate Solis laying on the ground not far from his vehicle. He later died on the way to hospital. The policeman had first tired to pull Solis over for making an illegal turn, but the routine stop escalated into a chase. After the firefight: Officer Gibson, seen in front of his car, fatally shot Solis in the confrontation in July this year. Video has just been released . Downed: Solis, shown left, died on his way to hospital. Backup arrived soon after the firefight . Solis pulled over to let out a passenger before speeding off again. At points in the chase he drove the wrong way in an attempt to shake off the officer. It later emerged that Solis was wanted in Los Angeles on drug charges. He was also suspected of being involved in seven aggravated burglaries shortly before he was killed. David Gott, chief of Hedwig Village police, said: 'No doubt about it. God was on his side. 'The officer is also a pastor in his off-duty time. I don't know if that helped. But it certainly didn't hurt.' The start: Gibson started pursuing Solis because he made an illegal right turn on a red light . False stop: The chase appeared to be over soon after - but Solis only stopped briefly to let his passenger, right, make a run for it . Oncoming traffic: At one point, Solis drove the car down the wrong lane of the highway, into oncoming traffic.

Eternal love: After Giuseppe passed away on Saturday, Livia died less than an hour later . Something shocking happened shortly after however, when his bride of 69 years, Livia, passed away less than an hour later. They had both been living together at the Smith House Health Care Center. It was from a 'broken heart' her family members told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'My mother was in shock to hear that my father had just died. She couldn't breathe and she was having a fit, even though she was on oxygen,' said Giuliana DiGeronimo, the couple's daughter. 'At the nursing home, everyone said they were angels.

"Nancy Dell’Olio is  selling her own clothes in the hope of raising thousands of pounds for herself . She once claimed British women are afraid to be feminine and glamorous when it comes to their sartorial choices. Now Nancy Dell’Olio is lending them a helping hand – by selling her own clothes in the hope of raising thousands of pounds for herself. The former girlfriend of ex-England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson is believed to have been living in a North London property owned by friends since losing her home earlier this year over alleged rent arrears. The lawyer, 53, is trying to put any money worries behind her by enlisting a series of leading fashion houses to donate items for her to sell alongside her own personal collection of dresses, shoes and bags at a cash-only auction being held today. Chanel, Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana and Christian Louboutin will all have items available at the event in Mayfair, with reductions of up to 50 per cent. Explaining her decision to downsize her wardrobe, a friend of Miss Dell’Olio said: ‘Nancy believes she is a stylish woman and once wrote an article attacking Kate Middleton’s dress sense. She feels this is a good opportunity for the public to buy a little piece of Nancy and raise money for her at the same time.’ Miss Dell’Olio split from Eriksson in 2006 and has since attempted to forge a career in entertainment, appearing on Strictly Come Dancing and taking a one-woman show to the Edinburgh festival. In May removal men were pictured taking her belongings from her £4million Belgravia home, only weeks after it emerged she was embroiled in a legal battle over alleged rent arrears of £20,400. Her landlord, British Virgin Islands company Pridelands, claimed in court it had served Miss Dell’Olio notice to leave in November 2013 but that she had refused to move out of the property. In an interview earlier this year Miss Dell’Olio denied any suggestion of financial hardship. She said: ‘It was always planned that I was leaving at the end of May. So it was my movers came to take my things. So you have to be precise. Everything was planned. ‘And I left when I was ready, when it was accordingly established to move.’ Asked if she owed £20,000, she replied: ‘I don’t think so.’ She added that she was not broke. Miss Dell’Olio’s last serious relationship, with the theatre director Sir Trevor Nunn, ended acrimoniously within a year of its starting in 2011. Eriksson is her most famous partner, but described her as ‘unbearable’ in his memoir and admitted to numerous infidelities during his relationship with her.","Dell'Olio lost her home earlier this year over alleged rent arrears .

Almeria sacked their manager in midweek after failing to win a single home game so far this season but they made a confident start with Sebastian Dubarbier seeing his shot blocked by Dani Carvajal on the edge of the area. Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey then shot just over as the home side pushed forward but Real were slowly growing in confidence and almost scored when Toni Kroos had a shot by Fran Velez deflected on to the bar. Karim Benzema failed to finish from Ronaldo’s cross and the Frenchman then just failed to reach an over-hit Bale pass. The Welshman was not finding his range but Isco showed him how on 34 minutes when he curled in the first of the game from just inside the area. Despite going behind Almeria did not fold and equalised five minutes later with a goal almost as good as Isco’s. Raphael Varane headed a cross out of the area, Asier Illaramendi was slow to close down Verza who took full advantage to rifle a shot past Iker Casillas. Madrid are not used to going in front only to be pegged back but they responded with a goal three minutes later. It was Toni Kroos’ seventh assist of the season right on to the head of Bale who scored his seventh league goal of the season to give Real Madrid the advantage at the break. On 54 minutes, Real Madrid almost extended their advantage when Bale ran from the halfway line to the edge of the area but when he should have crossed to Ronaldo who had sprinted with him he tried to find the far corner himself with a shot and sent the ball wide. Ronaldo didn’t look happy that Bale had opted to shoot instead of pass. Ronaldo went for goal himself from distance with Real’s next chance but Ruben Martinez made the save. The missed chance nearly cost Madrid when Edgar Mendez won a penalty after tripping over Marcelo’s challenge. The referee pointed to the spot but Casillas saved Verza’s penalty. Real were still making hard work of sealing the win. Ronaldo ran onto the Illaramendi’s pass but shot straight at Ruben again. He then scuffed a volley to the delight of Almeria supporters and was booked shortly after for a foul on Xima Navarro but with his night getting worse by the minute, he scored twice to kill off the game. Karim Benzema broke down the left and pulled the ball back to the Portuguese who scored. He then turned in Carvajal’s cross from the right to make it 25 league goals so far this season – every bit as incredible as 20 straight wins.

"The United States has long been described as an ethnic melting pot - but researchers have created maps showing how the genetic ancestry of Americans changes from state to state. The new Harvard study used data from 23andMe, a Google-backed genetic testing firm. Researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 160,000 African Americans, Latinos, and European Americans, providing novel insights into the subtle differences in genetic ancestry across the United States. The map reveals where self identified white Americans with African ancestry are most likely to live . Researchers analyzed DNA sequence variations called single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans. These individuals actively participate in 23andMe research by submitting saliva samples, consenting for data to be used for research, and completing surveys. 23andMe is a personal genomics company that provides direct-to-consumer genetic testing and services that include the analysis of DNA samples to generate ancestry-related genetic reports. 'Our study not only reveals the historical underpinnings of regional differences in genetic ancestry but also sheds light on the complex relationships between genetic ancestry and self-identified race and ethnicity,' said lead  author Katarzyna Bryc of 23andMe and Harvard Medical School. Over the past 500 years, North America has been the site of ongoing mixing of Native Americans, European settlers, and Africans. Although much of the world has been genetically characterized, the United States has received less attention from population geneticists because of its complex ancestry patterns. Moreover, the relationship between genetic ancestry and self-described racial and ethnic identities in each region of the United States has not been deeply characterized. To address this gap in knowledge, Bryc and her collaborators analyzed DNA sequence variations called single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans. The researchers found that regional ancestry differences reflect historical events such as waves of immigration. For example, Scandinavian ancestry is found in trace proportions in most states but comprises about 10% of ancestry in European Americans living in Minnesota and the Dakotas. They also found that individuals identify roughly with the majority of their genetic ancestry, contrary to expectations under a social 'one-drop rule.' Indeed, more than six million Americans who self-identify as European might carry African ancestry, and as many as five million self-described European Americans might have at least 1% Native American ancestry. 'These findings suggest that many individuals with partial African and Native American ancestry have 'passed' into the white community, thereby undermining the use of cultural labels that separate individuals into discrete, non-overlapping groups,' Bryc says. 'Taken together, our results suggest that genetic ancestry can be leveraged to augment historical records and inform cultural processes shaping modern populations.' These individuals actively participate in 23andMe research by submitting saliva samples, consenting for data to be used for research, and completing surveys for the study, published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, . 23andMe is a personal genomics company that provides direct-to-consumer genetic testing and services that include the analysis of DNA samples to generate ancestry-related genetic reports. The second map reveals the mean proportion of African Americans Across the Us. African Americans in Georgia and South Carolina have the highest average percentage of African ancestry of African Americans in the US. Among her findings were that about 3.5 percent of self-identified European Americans have at least 1 percent or more African Ancestry. It's likely that many of these Americans, who describe themselves as white, may be unaware of their African ancestry, which in many cases goes back between five to ten generations. There are also differences regionally — with the highest levels in the South — so that in South Carolina, at least 13 percent of self-identified whites have 1 percent or more African ancestry, while in Louisiana the number is a little more than 12 percent. In Georgia and Alabama the number is about 9 percent. 'The differences perhaps point to different social and cultural histories within the Sout,' 23andMe said. Kasia's study also found that one in every 20 African Americans have Native American ancestry, while in Oklahoma 14 percent of African Americans carry at least two percent Native American ancestry. All three groups - African Americans, European Americans and Latinos - have ancestry from Africa, Europe and the Americas. Approximately 3.5 percent of European Americans have one percent or more African ancestry. Many of these European Americans who describe themselves as 'white' may be unaware of their African ancestry since the African ancestor may be five to 10 generations in the past. European Americans with African ancestry are found at much higher frequencies in southern states than in other parts of the United States. The ancestry proportions point to the different regional impacts of slavery, immigration, migration and colonization within the United States: . The highest levels of African ancestry among self-reported African Americans are found in southern states, especially South Carolina and Georgia. One in every 20 African Americans carries Native American ancestry. More than 14 percent of African Americans from Oklahoma carry at least two percent Native American ancestry, likely reflecting the Trail of Tears migration following the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Among self-reported Latinos in the United States, those from states in the southwest, especially from states bordering Mexico, have the highest levels of Native American ancestry. Among self-reported Latinos in the US, those from states in the southwest, especially from states bordering Mexico, have the highest levels of Native American ancestry. But among Latinos too there were wide regional differences that also likely reflect the history of migration and intermixing. For example, some Latinos have no discernible Native American ancestry, while others have as much as 50 percent of their ancestry being Native American. Latinos in states in the Southwest, bordering Mexico — New Mexico, Texas, California and Arizona — have the greatest percentage of Native American ancestry. Latinos in states with the largest proportion of African Americans in their population — South Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama — have the highest percentage of African Ancestry. All three groups – African Americans, European Americans and Latinos – showed asymmetrical male and female ancestry contributions, with more European male and more Native American and African female ancestors. This asymmetry is likely a legacy of slavery, unbalanced sex ratios in frontier settings, as well other social factors.","Researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 160,000 African Americans, Latinos, and European Americans .

"More than half of children have used an online social network by the age of 10, according to a study. Facebook tops the list of sites that children sign up to under-age, with 52 per cent of eight to 16-year-olds admitting they had ignored the official age limit, the Social Age report for online safety advisory website Knowthenet found. Other popular sites include WhatsApp, used by 40 per cent of eight to 16-year-olds, BBM (24 per cent), SnapChat (11 per cent) and Ask.fm (8 per cent). Researchers have found more than half of children have used an online social network by the age of 10 . The study found that although 59 per cent of children are social networking by 10 years old, just 32 per cent of parents feel 'very confident' about helping them stay safe online. The poll found 21 per cent of children had posted negative comments, starting from an average age of 11, and 26 per cent had 'hijacked' another person's account and posted without permission. Some 43 per cent had messaged strangers, starting from an average age of 12. The study suggests that children are most likely to post an image or video of themselves online or set up a fake profile for the first time at the age of 11, try Twitter and message a stranger at 12 and try services like SnapChat and Ask.fm at the age of 13. Two thirds (67 per cent) turn to their parents when they experience difficulties online, the poll found. While 63 per cent of parents check their child's internet activity at least once a week, more than a fifth (21 per cent) are not confident they could install parental controls, and just under a half (46 per cent) admit not being confident or aware of the school internet policy. Other popular sites include WhatsApp (right), used by 40 per cent of eight to 16-year-olds, and SnapChat (left) Dr Richard Woolfson, child psychologist and Knowthenet spokesman, said: 'The internet offers wonderful experiences for growing and inquisitive young minds. 'Yet, as social media has removed the barriers between a young person's public and private self, children can become vulnerable, and compulsive online sharing can lead to danger. 'As this study shows, children are gaining access to social media sites at a younger age, which could expose them to content, people or situations that are out of their depth and which they're not emotionally prepared for. 'Parents can no longer protect children by simply trying to limit their online experiences. Instead parents need to maintain an open dialogue and encourage children to share both good and bad online experiences, talk openly and straightforwardly about the risks they may encounter online without scaring them and make sure they keep up with the latest social media crazes and work with their children rather than trying to control them.'

"Eden Hazard offered a further stinging critique of Jose Mourinho's tactical methods after Chelsea exited the Champions League on Wednesday night. The Blues were criticised for defensive tactics employed in the semi-final first leg at Atletico Madrid and in the Premier League win at Liverpool before tumbling out of Europe after a 3-1 home loss.

Unless there is a remarkable final . twist in the Premier League title race, Mourinho is poised to finish . without a trophy for a second successive season for the first time. Assessing . his first campaign back at Stamford Bridge ahead of the closing Premier . League matches with Norwich and Cardiff, Mourinho said he and his . players clung to a dream which disappeared. 'We are realistic, but at the same time we are optimistic,' he said. 'When . things go in a certain direction, there is a moment where you dream and . you think that things are possible, even if things are not. 'And because we did well in the Champions League and in the Premier League, there was a moment where we felt we could do it. 'In the Premier League it was the match against Aston Villa that made me believe that we had no chance to be champions. 'After that we build again the momentum and we were waiting for the Liverpool match to be the title match, but we had another surprise against Sunderland. 'In the Champions League, it's the same. We knew that teams had more potential than us and were more ready than us to win the competition, but because you go step by step and beat Paris St Germain after a 3-1 defeat, you build your dream.

Atletico advanced down the other end and substitute Samuel Eto'o tripped Diego Costa, with the striker coveted by Chelsea converting the penalty before Arda Turan added a third to set up a May 24 final with city rivals Real. 'In one minute, two actions decided the game,' Mourinho said. 'Atletico's goalkeeper makes an impossible save from John Terry's header and instead of 2-1 to Chelsea, a few seconds later a penalty.

"It was one of the most bitter and acrimonious divorces in recent memory between the scions of two of Britain’s wealthiest dynasties. So angry was financier and environmentalist Ben Goldsmith, 34, when he discovered lurid text messages on his wife Kate Rothschild’s mobile phone from the rapper Jay Electronica, that he is said to have slapped her and kicked a toy at her, resulting in a formal police caution. To compound the couple’s subsequent split, the pair then engaged in a very public and undignified spat via the social media site Twitter. Happy couple: Ben Goldsmith, 34, and Jemima Jones, 27, at their high society wedding yesterday . Odd couple: Goldsmith's ex-wife, heiress Kate Rothschild, left him for rapper Jay Electronica, pictured above . But two years on from the unpleasant saga, Goldsmith – brother of Tory MP Zac and Jemima Khan – has found happiness with another woman. Yesterday, he married his girlfriend of two years Jemima Jones, 27, a former lingerie model turned caterer to the stars. The bride wore a dress by Valentino and the pair chose Lord’s cricket ground in St John’s Wood to hold their nuptials, as the groom is a passionate cricket fan. A reception was held afterwards at nearby venue One Marylebone. Among the 30-strong wedding party were Ben’s mother Lady Annabel Goldsmith, sister Jemima, brother Zac and half-brother Robin Birley, as well as Ben’s three children by Kate: Iris, ten, Frankie, nine, and Isaac, six. Other guests included his aunt Lady Jane Rayne and her partner Robert Lacey, Kate’s cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and Lady Carina Frost, widow of broadcaster Sir David Frost, and her three sons, Miles, Wilfred and George. Elegant: Ben Goldsmith's sister Jemima Khan (left) was joined by Prince and Princess Michael of Kent (right) Family: Tory MP Zac Goldsmith (left) poses for a photo with Ben Elliot, nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall . Guests: James Tollemache and his wife Princess Florence von Preussen (L) and James Blunt (R) But of Kate, who divorced Goldsmith in April last year, there was no sign. Goldsmith had branded her ‘appalling’ for her infidelity with the exotically monikered rapper, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, telling her to focus on their children. Miss Rothschild responded by accusing him of cheating on her during their ten-year marriage and of being ‘irrational’. Kate said: ‘Deep down he’s shallow.’ Electronica later warned Goldsmith that he would ‘come see’ him. Accusing him of giving untrue stories to the newspapers, the rapper said: ‘You wanna go public, I’ll go public and you ain’t gonna like it. Stop acting like a bitch.’ Despite saying the New Orleans rapper had ‘saved my life in many ways’, Kate’s relationship with Electronica hit the rocks this summer and he has returned to America. She is living in a cottage next to the Georgian mansion of her former mother-in-law, Lady Annabel.

Sabrina Guniness and her husband Sir Tom Stoppard, left, and Viscountess Gormanston with her husband The Earl Gormanston . Her relations have clearly improved with Ben, as her address would testify, and in October the newly contrite Kate took to Twitter to send her ex-husband a gushing birthday greeting: ‘I’d be lost without you, thank you for being a wonderful father and an even better friend. Lots of love xx.’ Just last month the pair were spotted skating together with their children at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. When Kate married Ben in 2003, it was a union of two of Britain’s wealthiest families. She inherited £18million on the death of her banker father Amschel Rothschild, who hanged himself in a room at the Hotel Bristol in Paris in 1996. Goldsmith, the son of financier Sir Jimmy, inherited as much as £300million. Tender moment: Model Edie Campbell and her boyfriend Otis Ferry were pictured embracing .

Arrivals: The groom's sister-in-law Alice Goldsmith (left) wore a purple dress. Right: David de Rothschild . Their wedding, held at St Mary’s Church in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was billed as the society event of the year. The 600 guests in attendance included Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. In a curious twist, just as Ben was granted a divorce from Kate last year, his older brother Zac married Kate’s younger sister, Alice Rothschild, joining the two wealthy dynasties again. The Goldsmiths have plenty of experience of marriage breakdowns. As well as the late Sir Jimmy’s legendary infidelities (‘When you marry your mistress you create a job vacancy,’ he famously said), Ben’s sister Jemima divorced cricketer Imran Khan in 2004 and later had high-profile relationships with Hugh Grant and Russell Brand. Dynasties: When Kate married Ben in 2003, it was a union of two of Britain’s wealthiest families . Model wife: Jemima Jones, now a caterer to the stars, photographed in a lingerie shoot . So who is the new Jemima Goldsmith? Miss Jones, 27, is the daughter of respected architect Edward Jones CBE, a former visiting professor at Harvard, Yale and Princeton, and she and her sister Quentin, a film-maker, grew up in Primrose Hill. Miss Jones was signed to the Select model agency at 15, and studied media and film at Oxford Brookes University. After graduating she moved to New York and became personal assistant to an actress. She moved back to London around three years ago, saying: ‘I missed healthy living – there was a lot of partying in New York – it gets exhausting.’ Last year Miss Jones joined Tart London, a catering company for high-end photographic shoots and commercials set up by a friend. Their clients include Stella McCartney, Kate Moss, Lady Gaga, Penelope Cruz and Robbie Williams. Miss Jones met Ben on a ‘very romantic’ Greek getaway and he proposed this August with a single solitaire diamond bought from an antiques dealer. Unlike her new sister-in-law and namesake, she has no designs to change the world but has ambitions to open a restaurant. Jemima Khan admitted in October: ‘I don’t fancy being “the other”, “the big” or “the older” Jemima Goldsmith.’ It seems she’d better get used to it.","Ben Goldsmith, 34, married Jemima Jones, 27, his girlfriend of two years .

"She gleefully tortured suspects, falsely claimed the tactics worked, and lost key information that could have prevented the 9/11 attacks. And then she got a raise. This is the CIA's queen of torture. The unnamed detective - who remains a prominent figure of the administration - was mentioned at least 36 times in the CIA's damning report on the use torture as a means of interrogation, according to NBC News's investigative reporter Matthew Cole. But despite identifying other officials, report authors opted to shroud the woman from the public sphere, only revealing that she is 49 years old and formerly the deputy chief of the bin Laden unit. Scroll down for video . Key figure: The now 49-year-old al Qaeda expert was mentioned 36 times in the CIA damning torture report . The 528-page report concluded that none of the confessions drawn from tortured detainees amounted to significant life-saving intelligence. However, one passage recounts how the al Qaeda expert told a Senate committee: 'There's no question, in my mind, that having that detainee information has saved hundreds, conservatively speaking, of American lives.' Her statement came after she had personally waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of al Qaeda's leading operatives who was detained in Poland. And when another detainee stated that Mohammed tried to recruited two Black American Muslim converts in Afghanistan, she falsely told CIA officials he was targeting any US national Muslims. She closed the email with the words: 'i love the Black American Muslim at AQ camps in Afghanuistan (sic). ... Mukie (KSM) is going to be hatin' life on this one'. When she was interviewed about the interrogations in 2003, and claimed they drew life-saving intelligence that led to an arrest, the Senate report stated: 'These representations were almost entirely inaccurate.' By this point, the expert was deputy chief of ALEC Station, also known as the bin Laden unit. She has now surpassed the civilian rank of general. Track record: One passage reveals how she waterboarded alleged 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed . The expert reached this level despite facing a storm of criticism in 2001. A member of her team refused to tell the FBI the names of Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi - two of the 9/11 suicide terrorists. The expert was fiercely condemned for the blunder. Despite CIA's fierce bid to protect the expert's identity, she has been named before, NBC News reveals. According to the station, she was one of a number of women who inspired Jessica Chastain's character in Zero Dark Thirty - the Hollywood retelling of Osama bin Laden's killing. However, the administration implored NBC to refrain from identifying the woman for fear of retaliation. A former senior CIA officer, John Maguire, told NBC: 'She's an extraordinarily capable analyst. 'She has a caustic personality, but she is frighteningly intelligent and knows more about al Qaeda than virtually anyone else at the CIA. 'She's hard to manage but brings a lot to the table... She wasn't afraid to make mistakes.'","CIA report slamming torture tactics identifies senior female expert .

"Former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann feels the club will be better off in the long term without Luis Suarez, a player he believes 'can't be trusted'. Suarez was the Reds' star man last season, notching 31 Barclays Premier League goals to help them finish second in the table. The Uruguay forward was subsequently hit with a four-month ban from all football-related activities for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup - he will learn the outcome of his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Thursday - and Liverpool sold him to Barcelona for £75million. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Liverpool defender Jose Enrique discuss Suarez's absence . Kop hero: Suarez inspired Liverpool to a second-placed finish and Champions League football last season . Fang-tastic: The Uruguayan was banned for four months for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini . The Merseysiders have splashed their cash considerably, bringing a raft of new players in such as Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren from Southampton, Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen and Lazar Markovic from Benfica, and Hamann thinks good business has been done. The ex-Germany international is optimistic about Liverpool's prospects for the new campaign and confident they will not suffer too greatly for the departure of Suarez, whose three and a half years with the Anfield outfit were disrupted by lengthy suspensions for another biting incident and a racial abuse case. Hamann, speaking at a McDonald's and Football Association Community Football Day, told Press Association Sport: 'I think Liverpool have bought well. 'I have always been very critical of Suarez's antics. Big money: Suarez has moved to Barcelona for a huge £75million and Hamann thinks the deal suits Liverpool . Ended in tears: Suarez was the Premier League's best player last season but couldn't lead his team to the title . 'In footballing terms, he is a big loss, but somebody else will score the goals and I think, long-term, they will be better off without him than with him. 'I'd rather have the six or seven players they have now than Suarez, because at the end of the day, if you want to win things, you need people you can trust, and he can't be trusted. 'If he does something stupid again, he could be out for years, or for good. 'Yes, he has been great, there is no doubt about it. But what could have been if he had not missed all the games he did when he was here? Maybe the team would have been in the Champions League a while ago. Better off: Haman (left) who won the Champions League with Liverpool, thinks Suarez is replacable . 'All he has to show from his time at Liverpool is a League Cup winner's medal (from 2011/12). He is not leaving a team that was ruling the Premier League or Europe during that the last few years. 'He is a player who scored goals, but at the end of the day they only got into the Champions League with him last season.' Liverpool exceeded expectation with their finish last term as they comfortably secured their long-awaited return to Champions League football and almost the Premier League title to boot. Hamann - who played for the Reds between 1999 and 2006, and was part of their famous 2005 European Cup triumph - believes they can build on those efforts this season, but is not expecting them to go one place better in the top-flight just yet. 'I don't think last year was a flash in the pan,' the 40-year-old said. 'Mentally, it could leave a scar or two because they missed a huge chance. But I think they can build on it. Partnership: Brendan Rodgers has brought in half a dozen players with the money Suarez earned the club . 'Playing in Europe and then in the league is tough, so that will be a big test they will have to pass. 'I don't think they are title contenders this season - I would take another top-four finish now and qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League. 'That would be a good season.

"It may look like something out of a Mad Max movie, but this home-built tank is the latest weapon in the Syrian rebels' desperate fight against the brutal regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

"Michael van Gerwen is ready to avenge his previous two defeats by Terry Jenkins at Alexandra Palace on Monday, and insists he is a better player than his third-round opponent. The reigning world champion has lost his last two matches against Jenkins, but is adamant he will win on Monday night if he can hit top gear. The world No 1 said: ‘I know I’m a better player than him (Jenkins) when I play my own game and when I’m playing at 100 per cent I am going to beat him. Dutchman Michael Van Gerwen celebrates winning his first round match against Joe Cullen (right) Van Gerwen insists he will not let Terry Jenkins beat him again at Alexandra Palace . ‘But there is a lot of work to do before you can get to that level and you need to concentrate very hard to do that.’ Van Gerwen has been unconvincing in his opening two wins against Joe Cullen and Sascha Stein and admitted to being more nervous this year having become the prize scalp for the rest of the field. He said: ‘I’m a bit more nervous, but I feel really good. I know my top game is inside me and I know I’m going to show it in my next game. ‘He (Jenkins) is playing well and is into the tournament. I’m not playing my best game, but I’ve still won quite easily and that’s a good thing to know.’ Jenkins, meanwhile, almost hit a nine-dart finish in his second-round whitewash of Laurence Ryder and is confident he can cause an upset against the Dutchman. ‘Michael will be out to beat me as much as I will be out to beat him so it should be a good game,’ Jenkins said. ‘You can’t think about who you’re playing against, you’ve just got to go up there and concentrate on winning that game. You know what you’re doing in practice, get your practice right and make sure you’re on form all the time.’ Jenkins believes he is playing some of the best darts of his long career despite scaling down the number of tournaments he plays. ‘It’s my age – I’m getting too old,’ Jenkins laughed. ‘I get tired now.’ Van Gerwen makes his way through the crowd for his second round match against Sascha Stein . Jenkins is confident he can upset the Dutchman for a third time at the World Darts Championships . The 51-year-old added: ‘I’m more relaxed now. When you’re younger you can want it too much. You can over try and put too much practice in and want it too much. Then when you go up there you try too hard. ‘I’m not doing so much practice and when I do go up there I’m a lot keener. ‘Before I was doing a lot of practice and when you get up there I think you’re just tired. You’ve got to get your head right as much as your arm. ‘You can go up there and practice 10 hours a day and not be as good as somebody who practices two hours a day. ‘I still want to win, don’t get me wrong, but I think you learn to cope with it better when you get older and you don’t see many dart players coming through until their late 30s to early 40s and that’s when they start to shine. ‘There are a lot of young kids who are praised up but they fade out and don’t come back until they’re a little bit older.’ Jenkins almost hit a nine-dart finish during his second round victory over Laurence Ryder . England's Andy Hamilton (left) celebrates after beating Kyle Anderson of Australia in the second round . This year’s tournament at Alexandra Palace also sees a return for Jenkins’ famous moustache, which was shaved off by James Wade at a charity evening last year. Jenkins explained: ‘When I had my haircut I always played a load of rubbish in a Players Championship. I think “I wonder if that took a bit of my strength”. I never have my haircut now before a competition. ‘Everybody kept asking where my tache had gone. I said “I’ll grow it back just for the World Championship”, but I’m shaving it straight off after. ‘Some people say they don’t like it, but you can’t please everybody.’","Michael van Gerwen is set to play Terry Jenkins in the third round of the World Darts Championships .

The 27-year-old broke Ferrer in his first service game and dominated the opening set in which he only dropped four points on his own serve. But Ferrer hit back straight away in the second as he started to attack Murray more and immediately earned his first break, which he built on to take the set comfortably. As Murray's game began to unravel Ferrer pressed home his advantage, breaking twice more in the decider while the Briton failed to fashion a single break point opportunity.

"Duty: Hampstead School headmaster Jacques Szemalikowski . A London headteacher reported an A-Level student to police and informed the university he had applied for that the teenager had succumbed to 'violent extremism' after he criticised the school in a blog. Jacques Szemalikowski, the headmaster of Hampstead School, told 19-year-old Kinnan Zaloom never to return to the school grounds again after he set up a website attacking the way it was run. And he informed the school's on-site policemen and Glasgow University, where Mr Zaloom hoped to take a degree, that the student could be 'developing into an anarchist. The Hampstead Trash, which Mr Zaloom started in February, contained a series of colourfully-worded articles that likened the school staff to characters in George Orwell's anti-totalitarian novels - most notably casting Mr Szemalikowski in the role of Animal Farm's chief pig, Napoleon. In a style that he likened to that of the irreverent satirical magazine Private Eye, the young blogger accused the school of failing to push GCSE results any higher, a lack of investment in musical instruments and gym equipment, and of not listening to pupils' views. Mr Szemalikowski confirmed yesterday that he had blocked the blog from school computers in April and condemned the articles as 'mad writings'. He said he had 'major concerns and was duty bound under legal acts for the prevention of violent extremism' and that he was 'erring on the side of caution' in taking action. 'It is fairly worrying stuff,' he added. Mr Szemaliskowski said he was particularly concerned 'that Kinnan has mentioned the ideologies of anarchism and individualism on this blog'. 'I must do something,' he said. 'In the last year he has become more and more enchanted by anti-establishment ways of thinking and has even said that there is an inherent risk that every government is corrupt. 'I am not . an expert in these matters but I had training in how to look for things . that might need a second opinion. I didn’t think it was illegal but the . undertones towards the end made me think - does this need a second . opinion? ""The school claims again and again that . it listens to students needs and that it takes into consideration what . students say and care about. This is utter horses***. So much horses*** . indeed, that findus’ lasagne is bewildered"" Article, The Hampstead Trash . 'I phoned Glasgow to warn them what sort of person they were dealing with, to advise them that this person thinks thoughts like these, and they could then make an informed decision. 'I am duty bound to do that.' The headteacher added: 'I also reported what he had written to the police, and the officer I spoke to said he would pass these mad writings of his on to a colleague.' Neither Mr Szemalikowski nor Mr Zaloom has since heard from police. The north-west London school caters for around 1,300 pupils, with former students including novelist Zadie Smith, women’s England international footballer Rachel Yankey and actress Sadie Frost. The blog is now being updated by another, anonymous student as Mr Zaloom has left the school. Trash: A post from Mr Zaloom's blog, run along with several students, which slammed the school management using the fruitiest of language . In his final post on the blog, Mr Zaloom wrote: 'This past year, I . have become more and more enchanted by the ideology of anarchism and . individualism.' He added: 'I am not hailing anarchism as the only . way of life, just pointing out that any type of government has the risk . of being corrupt and vile.' Mr Zaloom said he had been summoned to the headteacher’s office on his last day and interrogated about his articles, before he was warned . never return to the school site - even to pick up his A-level exam . results - because the work was 'offensive'. One article that caused particular trouble commented that the school was 'playing the school league tables' in terms of how results were presented. It claimed there were tensions among staff members about the way the school was run, outlined in phrases such as: 'So f*** you school management, f*** you.' Another article read: 'The school claims again and again that it listens to students needs and that it takes into consideration what students say and care about. This is utter horses***. So much horses*** indeed, that findus’ lasagne is bewildered' - referring to the scandal earlier last year, when ready meals were found to contain horse meat. School for scandal: Hampstead School in Camden, north London, teaches around 1,300 pupils . The article went on: 'The school magazine is not worth the paper it is printed on and does s*** all to voice student consensus.' Mr Zaloom, who did not get the grades he needed to get into Glasgow and will be studying mathematics at Portsmouth University, said: 'They said I had brought the school into disrepute. I said that was their opinion, but nothing I had done was illegal so why such severe action? 'I was prepared to apologise for the language. But what worries me is if I had been a year younger they said they would have expelled me halfway through my A-levels, and that means they would have been prepared to ruin my education because they didn’t like my thoughts. 'It was useless to call the police because I didn’t break the law. 'I was concerned he’d called Glasgow because I’m worried he would go to those lengths of intimidation to control a student’s thoughts. But I wasn’t too panicked because it turned out I didn’t have the grades to get in there anyway.' ""I phoned Glasgow to warn them what . sort of person they were dealing with, to advise them that this person . thinks thoughts like these, and they could then make an informed . decision. I am duty bound to do that."" Jacques Szemalikowski, Hampstead School headmaster . Mr Zaloom, who co-founded a debating society at the school, compared his treatment to those fighting for press freedom in the Middle East. He said: 'Obviously it’s not on the same scale at all, this injustice is small, I know that. But my family are from Jordan so I know how things work there, and newspapers are not allowed to write what they want. 'Everybody is controlled, and I can see that happening here. It reminds me of Ingsoc[a totalitarian government in the Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four], people must conform or they are out. 'When he blocked the blog from the school’s computers that was bizarre. How does he find the time to go round doing things like that?' Mr Szemalikowski defended his actions, saying: 'He posted lies about the school and I will not tolerate that. 'His posts were scattered with the f-word and c-word and if a student spoke like that in school they would be expelled. So of course I blocked the blog, and told him never to come back. 'He’s right, if he had been younger, he would have been expelled. 'It would have been his responsibility that he ruined his education, not mine.' He added that if Mr Zaloom had not used bad language he would still have warranted an expulsion 'for his mad ideas and ranting'. Mr Zaloom said he wanted to thank 'a lot of the very good teachers at Hampstead School' but felt they were not given the chance to 'teach the way they want to'.

"The Rio protestors’ attack on the ITV World Cup studio during the opening game was frightening enough for those in the booth to believe they were being shot at. The windows of the studio bridging the road along the Copacabana Beach were said to be broken by ball-bearings fired from a catapult but they made a similar sound to gunfire to the ITV team, which included presenter Adrian Chiles and pundits Lee Dixon, Patrick Vieira and Fabio Cannavaro. To add to their understandable concern there were reports of a body lying on the road underneath. This later turned out to be the victim of a traffic accident who had been hit by a bus. No change: The glass was still shattered behind ITV pundit Fabio Cannovaro in the studio on Friday . Frightening: The presenters 'thought they were getting shot at' during the World Cup opener on Thursday . An ITV insider said: ‘Everyone inside the studio stayed very cool but you can image the concern of their friends and family watching back home.’ ITV have demanded that security is increased  and, in the circumstances, their ‘curse’ striking again with their heavily-publicised ITV Player crashing just as Neymar was about to score Brazil’s second goal was regarded as less of a priority. Mike Riley, in charge of the elite referees in the Premier League, was one of the 13-strong FIFA referee assessment panel responsible for choosing Japanese official Yuichi Nishimura to take charge of the opening game, in which he awarded the softest of penalties to Brazil. FIFA insiders say that Nishimura, whose weak performance was heavily criticised by defeated Croatia, was chosen because he represents a different confederation from the teams involved and had a good World Cup in 2010. Controversial: Referee Yuichi Nishimura was heavily criticised after his performance in the Brazil vs Croatia game . Almost the entire 70-plus membership of the England party at the World Cup gathered in the dining room at their Blue Tree Premium Hotel in Manaus to watch the opening game of the tournament. However, it’s safe to assume that the bets weren’t flying around like in the old days — especially in Italia 90 when Peter Shilton (right) was the bookmaker. At last Sepp’s on side . Sepp Blatter’s proposal at the FIFA Congress for managers to appeal against decisions during games might not be as left-field as first thought. Sports technology leaders Hawk-Eye are already testing immediate offside decision-making in the Dutch League. Meanwhile, the unnecessary goalline technology (GLT) replay of Brazilian Marcelo’s own goal, when the ball was obviously way over the line, is understood to have been screened by the host broadcasters because of an agreement to show GLT in action during a game, irrespective of it being needed. The Brazilian-themed Congress opening entertainment included a surprise appearance by a Palestine singer. Surely that wasn’t connected with Blatter’s naked ambition to win a Nobel peace prize, having brokered talks between the Israeli and Pakistan football federations? In the clear? Sepp Blatter is introducing automatic offside detecting technology in Holland . Conspicuous by his absence from the Congress and the opening match was football icon Pele, who is Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s ambassador for the tournament. It seems that Pele has yet to settle his differences with the Brazilian football federation after he fell out with the disgraced former overlord Ricardo Teixeira, who is mired in corruption scandals. It won’t be on the scale of the Brazilian protests that are in danger of overshadowing the World Cup but military personnel will be demonstrating outside talkSport’s London headquarters at noon on next Saturday. This follows the radio station’s failure to respond to the serious upset caused by their pundit Stan Collymore’s offensive tweet about the Falklands. One of the more bizarre sights in Manaus, gateway to the Amazon rainforest, is a fully grown jaguar, one of the big beasts of the nearby jungle, sadly enclosed in a relatively small cage as the showcase exhibit of the zoo in the Tropical Hotel. It’s claimed the Brazilian Institute of Environment has approved all the enclosures.","Protesters catapult stones at ITV studio during the Brazil vs Croatia game .

"Nani is the typical Portuguese boy who played in the streets when he was young – when the digital era was still to come. His streets, however, were one of the poorest in Lisbon, exactly in Bairro Santa Filomena, one of the more problematic neighborhoods in the Portuguese capital. Nanaca, as he’s called by his family, played on those streets barefoot, because his family had no money to buy him soccer shoes. But the foot injuries didn't keep him at home. The soccer ball was everything. High flyer: Nani (right) is expected to be one of Portugal's main players in Brazil . Eyes on the prize: Nani shows off his fancy footwork during Portugal's pre-World Cup training camp . Centre of attention: Nani evades Jose Holebas and Giorgos Samaras during Portugal's friendly with Greece . One day a scout from Real Massamá, a local club, caught eyes on him and convinced Nani and his family to play for them.There he had lunch and dinner everyday, because they knew about his family difficulties. The winger played for the club between 1997 to 2003, when he signed for Sporting, after other proposals from, for example, Benfica and FC Porto. Nani even today is grateful to his first club and he tries to help every time he can. He’s one of the most humble Portuguese football players and that - along with his great skills -  is why he always wins the trust of national coaches. Nani is probably the most technical Portugal player in their World Cup squad and is also in the top three of passing and assists abilities. Handy work: Portugal coach Paulo Bento is a big fan of Nani's skills . In the shadow: Nani is hoping this World Cup will be where he outshines team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Even if he didn’t have a great season with Manchester United, he was never in doubt for the World Cup and was probably the second or the third player that coach Paulo Bento picked - only behind Cristiano Ronaldo and João Moutinho, other key players. He’s made the cut because in these big tournaments he usually does a great job. For example at Euro 2012 he was, for us Portuguese journalists, the best Portuguese player in that tournament alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. We expect a great World Cup from Nani because he arrives in Brazil physically in shape and with few games in his legs, and that can be good for the Portuguese team. More importantly, he became a father last December, so will be full of confidence for this tournament. At the age of 27 this is the right time for him to shine at a World Cup. This will be his first World Cup as he didn't make the 2010 edition in South Africa due to a late injury, and he will want to prove that there is more to Portugal's team than Cristiano Ronaldo.","Manchester United winger has had a frustrating season but comes to the World Cup fresh, determined and full of confidence .

"There are few more frustrating sights than a player who dazzles for his club reduced to a shadow of himself for his country on the greatest stage of all. It is an affliction that players and fans dread: World Cup burnout. Lionel Messi has suffered from it, Wayne Rooney has been plagued by it and even Zinedine Zidane has succumbed to it. It is no coincidence that Argentina, England and France crashed and burned at World Cups when their star men were exhausted and half-fit from their efforts over a long season. There are bound to be players on their knees in Brazil this summer too. But who will be the stars who fail to live up to the hype they have created for themselves? Scroll down to see the distances run by Premier League players heading to the World Cup... Fresh: Alex Oxlade Chamberlain (centre) was full of running against Ecuador . Running machine: Adam Lallana (centre) has covered more miles than any other English player this season . Making up ground: Jordan Henderson's (right) performances this season have put him on the brink of the England starting XI . Sportsmail has analysed performance data - courtesy of EA SPORTS Player Performance Index - from all 90 outfield Premier League players heading to the World Cup to work out who has expended the most energy for their clubs this season and therefore could be at risk of fatigue ahead of the summer showpiece. The man who has run the extra mile for his club this season may raise a few eyebrows, but not outside South London. Mile Jedinak covered an enormous 266.8 miles of turf up and down the country during Crystal Palace’s remarkable and successful survival bid. Good news for Tony Pulis, but potentially bad news for the millions of Australia fans hoping their captain and defensive midfielder can inspire a World Cup shock against Spain, Holland and Chile. The next two players to have run the furthest for their clubs are two Englishmen, Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson, who have covered 255.7 miles and 236.7 miles respectively. Both played in the warm-up win over Peru at Wembley last Friday night, where England looked leggy and lacklustre. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, meanwhile, provided a breath of fresh air for England against Ecuador, invigorating Roy Hodgson’s attack with speed, strength and stamina before suffering an unfortunate injury which could ruin his World Cup.

Data courtesy of EA SPORTS Player Performance Index. Lead your team to glory in EA SPORTS 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. But is it any surprise that the Arsenal . midfielder was so full of beans after running just 43.2 miles for . Arsenal during an injury-interrupted season? Lallana played that night at Wembley on the right wing – the position where Oxlade-Chamberlain started in Miami. While the Southampton star has had a wonderful season, he also has plenty more miles in his legs than his Gunners counterpart. A whopping 212.5 miles more in fact. When Hodgson selects his starting line-up for the opening clash against Italy he might also want to ponder the fact that six of the England squad feature in the top 20 players to have run the furthest in the Premier League this season. As well as Lallana and Henderson, left-back Luke Shaw (211.3 miles) is 11th on the list, captain Steven Gerrard (210.4) is two places below him, striker Rickie Lambert (203.6) is 16th and Leighton Baines (197.2), another left-back, is 18th. Meanwhile, the likes of Jack Wilshere (128.9), James Milner (118.5), Danny Welbeck (109.0) and, surprisingly, Daniel Sturridge (147.7) have burned relatively small amounts of energy, which could mean they hold valuable reserves for the withering heat and humidity of Manaus. Leading the way: Mile Jedinak has run more miles than any other Premier League player at the Word Cup . Powerhouse: Yaya Toure (front) was integral to Manchester City's Premier League triumph . Midfield maestro: Belgium will be looking to Eden Hazard (left) to pull the strings in Brazil . Overcooked? Steven Gerrard and Leighton Baines (right) have put in the yards this season . Some of the biggest stars of the Premier League also have plenty of miles in their legs. France striker Olivier Giroud has covered 221.1 miles for Arsenal, while Yaya Toure – despite the perception of him as a languid midfielder – has run 215.6 miles, and bother are in the top eight in the list. Chelsea and Belgium playmaker Eden Hazard is not too far behind on 206.8 miles. But several household names should still have plenty to give in Brazil, such as Robin van Persie - providing he overcomes an injury scare for Holland – whose limited appearances for Manchester Unietd mean he covered just 120 miles on the pitch last season. Spain striker Fernando Torres (115.1) and Germany forward Andre Schurrle (102.5) should benefit from Jose Mourinho’s rotation of his front players at Chelsea, while Arsenal front man Lukas Podolski (84.7) is another German forward who could have a spring in his step. But who should be the freshest out of every player at the World Cup? According to these statistics that honour falls to Fulham striker Kostas Mitroglou, who ran just 11.2 miles for Fulham last season. Greece expects, Kostas.

"Being gay could be in the DNA. Scientists have found two stretches of DNA linked to homosexuality in men. The confirmation of the existence of a ‘gay gene’ or genes will strengthen arguments that homosexuality is a matter of biology, rather than choice. The confirmation of the existence of a ¿gay gene¿ or genes will strengthen arguments that homosexuality is a matter of biology, rather than choice. Other studies suggests that conditions in the womb also influence sexual orientation. For instance, the more older male siblings a man has, the greater chance he will be gay. Scientists say the phenomenon cannot be explained by the youngest boy being babied and mollycoddled or other differences in the way they are brought up. It is thought that carrying a male baby in the womb triggers an immune response in the mother, creating antibodies that attack part of the unborn child's brain linked to sexual orientation. This response gets stronger the more boys a woman carries, raising the odds of homosexuality. Exposure to hormones in the womb is also likely to be important and some argue that upbringing plays a role in sexuality. However, it also raises the prospect of a genetic test that could be used by insurance companies to discriminate against clients or by pregnant women to abort gay babies. In the study, Chicago University researchers analysed the DNA of more than 400 pairs of gay brothers, recruited at Gay Pride festivals at marches over several years. This revealed flagged up two pieces of DNA that seem to be linked to homosexuality. It is not known which of the many genes they contain are key or how they affect the development of sexual orientation. However, the result, revealed at a science event in Chicago, backs up a contentious 1993 study. That research, the first to find evidence of a ‘gay gene’, created a storm of controversy, which was further fuelled when other scientists failed to find a genetic link. Dr Michael Bailey from Northwestern University in Illinois, who contributed to the latest study, said it is the biggest of its kind. He added: ‘Sexual orientation has nothing to do with choice. Our findings suggest there may be genes at play – we found evidence for two sets that affect whether a man is gay or straight. ‘Although this could one day lead to a pre-natal test for male sexual orientation, it would not be very accurate, as there are other factors that can influence the outcome.’ Despite this, he would not would not object to a prenatal test being developed. He said: ‘Clearly parents should not be allowed to torture or kill babies. But they can currently choose to terminate a pregnancy early on, so they should be allowed to have as much information on the future child as possible.’ Chicago University researchers analysed the DNA of more than 400 pairs of gay brothers recruited at Gay Pride festivals at marches over several years. Qazi Rhaman, a King’s College London psychologist, said that genes are thought account for up to 40 per cent of a person’s sexual orientation is governed by genes, and that it is likely that many genes are involved. This would make developing a genetic test incredibly difficult. He said: ‘There is no real risk of anyone finding a 'genetic test' for sexual orientation based on these or any of the scientific findings about the genetics of sexuality from the past 20 years. ‘The reason is that there is no gay gene.  You are not going to be able to develop a test to find them all.’ Dr Rhaman, who has written a book about sexual orientation, added that all psychological traits involve genetics and people should not be afraid about link homosexuality to genes. Richard Lane, of gay rights organisation, Stonewall, said that while studies into the origins of homosexuality have yet to produce convincing evidence, they do to point to a biological root. He said: ‘The thing that’s consistent across all of them is that they all point to sexual orientation being something fundamental to a person rather than the lifestyle choice some opponents of equality repeatedly suggest.’ Other studies suggests that conditions in the womb also influence sexual orientation. For instance, the more older male siblings a man has, the greater chance he will be gay. Scientists say the phenomenon cannot be explained by the youngest boy being babied and mollycoddled or other differences in the way they are brought up. It is thought that carrying a male baby in the womb triggers an immune response in the mother, creating antibodies that attack part of the unborn child's brain linked to sexual orientation. This response gets stronger the more boys a woman carries, raising the odds of homosexuality. Exposure to hormones in the womb is also likely to be important and some argue that upbringing plays a role in sexuality.","Two stretches of DNA linked to homosexuality in men discovered .

"Louis van Gaal saw his star-studded Manchester United team celebrate the dawn of a new era at Old Trafford and then declared: ‘We can do much better.’ Record £60million signing Angel di Maria scored on his home debut and had a hand in United’s other three goals in a 4-0 win over QPR, but even he was criticised for giving away the ball too often. ‘When you assist three goals and score the first, then you cannot play badly, but he had a lot of losses so can do better,’ said Van Gaal. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal insists there is plenty more to come from his side . Angel di Maria (left) impressed during Manchester United's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers . ‘I am analysing the game and I see things we can improve as a team. ‘When you have a 4-0 result then you can be happy as a coach but you always have points you can improve. The result is fantastic but we can do much better. This is a good start.’ Van Gaal dedicated his first Premier League win to his wife Truus. It lifted United up to ninth in the table and Van Gaal promised plenty more attacking football at Old Trafford. ‘This is special because it is also my wife’s birthday,’ said Van Gaal. ‘She said the biggest present shall be victory. We gave it to her. ‘I have worked (in football) for more than 35 years and I have always [attacked].

"On El Clasico weekend, all sorts of superlatives are used to describe the long-running rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid, and rightly so. But 24 hours later, 1500 miles east in Athens, arguably Europe's fiercest derby will be taking place. Panathinaikos vs Olympiacos is so intense they call it the 'Derby of the Eternal Adversaries' and the 'Mother of all Battles', and the pictures say it all. Both are Greek Gods in their own footballing right, and for decades have battled it out at the top. On Sunday at 5.30pm, they meet again at Olympiacos' Piraeus home. Sportsmail brings you all you need to know in bite size chunks. Greek riot police watch on after a petrol bomb was thrown by Panathinaikos supporters during a game against Olympiacos in 2012 . Some fired up Olympiacos fans are pictured during the Super League match at the Karaiskaki Stadium on November 19, 2011 . Panathinaikos fans breach the barriers to throw chairs at the police during violent clashes with Olympiakos' fans and police . The matches between both clubs are known for the volatile and often violent atmosphere among the rivalling fans . So, why the rivalry? The two sides have won 61 Greek titles between them, so naturally the competitive rivalry is extremely healthy. 'You’ve got Gate 13 who are the fanatics. They’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees. The noise, the smoke bombs, the fireworks. It’s absolutely electric.’ Panathinaikos goalkeeper Luke Steele reflects his summer experience in the 'Mother of All Battles.' But it runs so much deeper. Panathinaikos, formed in 1908 from the higher classes of Athens' make up, preceded Olympiacos by 17 years. The 'newcomers' were from the more working class port of Pireaus, and although the boundaries are far blurrier in the 21st century, the battle to rule Athens often results in violence on the pitch, in the stands and around the capital. As you can expect, both clubs have the biggest followings in the country, and clashes are the result of two of Greek football's biggest egos, year after year attempting to claim bragging rights. How violent can it get? Each picture tells its own story of crowd and player trouble down the years. The bizarre sight of all XI players racing off the pitch as quick as possible when the away side wins tells you just how hostile it is. A lone Panathinaikos supporter cowers in a cloud of smoke as a group of armed Greek riot police try to calm the hostile scenes . Panathinaikos fans throw seats at police after a game in 1998 where ten people were injured in the violence before and after the match . Just last season Panathinaikos manager Yannis Anastasiou fell to the ground after being hit with an object thrown from the crowd during the 3-0 win in Piraeus, and in 2012 the derby was abandoned after petrol bombs were thrown at the Olympic Stadium. Parts of the modern, 70,000 seater stadium, five years after holding a Champions League final, were on fire. Flares are thrown around like confetti, firework explosions will make you jump out of your seat… Oh, and Dimitrios Mavrogenidis was hit by a water balloon to the face while representing Olympiacos in 2003. But the rivalry isn't just centred on football, either. Both clubs have passionately-supported volleyball and basketball teams, and in March 2007 a 22-year-old Panathinaikos fan was stabbed to death in violent clashes between hooligans of the two clubs before a women's volleyball game. Organised crowd violence is a major issue in Greek sport, not just football. A plastic water container hits Dimitris Mavrogenidis in the face in 2003;  the Olympiacos right-back suffered minor injuries . Olimpiacos midfielder Pedrag Djordjevic (left) delivers a cross during his side's 3-0 win in 2003 as Panathinaikos' fans throw missiles . Firefighters battle a blaze in the stands of the Olympic stadium as violence erupts during a night when more than 30 fans and policemen were injured as riot police charged the crowd and made several arrests . Who wins the footballing battles on the pitch? Olympiacos are 41-20 up on league titles and 26-18 ahead on Greek Cup wins. The Red and White also dominate the head-to-head meetings, winning 76 to Panathinaikos' 47. In recent years the trend is similar, with Panathinaikos winning just two of the last 15 meetings. And there isn't any wonder why footballing passions are so high in Athens; the honours board for the Greek Superleague has a particular capital feel to it. Incredibly, all but five of the last 92 champions have been from Athens. What can we expect from this derby? Olympiacos, winners of the last four titles, are third in the division after four wins from six, trailing the leaders from Thessaloniki PAOK by three points. They're coming off the back of a fine 1-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League, and they're unbeaten at home in the league since that defeat to Panathinaikos in March. Christian Karembeu (second left) leaps with Nikos Liberopoulos (second right) on a night when hooligans ran riot in the Greek capital .

The Shamrock are sixth, three points behind their rival, and got a hard-fought 1-1 draw at PSV in the Europa League in the week. They have former Manchester United goalkeeper Luke Steele between the sticks, the 30-year-old choosing to continue his career in Greece rather than move to another Championship club in the summer. You'll also remember former Fulham man Milan Petric, Panathinaikos' front man along with Swede Marcus Berg. Another former Fulham star, Patjim Kasami, scored the winner against Juventus for Olympiacos, with Eric Abidal and Ibrahim Afellay also on their books.","Real Madrid vs Barcelona may be the El Clasico, but in Athens it will be far more fierce .

"Anti-discrimination campaigner Lord Ouseley has hit out at the Football Association for allowing Nicolas Anelka to serve the remainder of his ban for a 'quenelle' gesture. The suspension will mean the Mumbai City striker will miss the start of the inaugural Indian Super League. Anelka was fined by an FA appointed independent panel and handed a five-match ban after it was decided that the gesture he performed after scoring for West Brom at West Ham on December 28, was 'abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper, and that included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief'. Nicolas Anelka plays for Mumbai City in a friendly, with the striker banned for the first three matches of the Indian Super League following a quenelle gesture made while playing for West Brom last season . Anelka was suspended and eventually sacked by West Brom. With those sanctions still in place, the 35-year-old has since been allowed to join Mumbai ahead of the start of the Indian Super League on Sunday. The FA confirmed on Friday evening the player is deemed to have already served a two-game ban while still effectively employed by West Brom before the termination of his contract. Had Anelka moved to any other club abroad outside the governing body's domestic jurisdiction, the guidance would have also been the same, while any education course can also not be implemented unless the player returns to England. Anleka trains with a team-mate for Mumbai as the inaugural Indian Super League begins on Sunday . Anelka was banned for five matches by the Football Association for making a quenelle gesture after scoring in a Premier League match at West Ham for West Brom last December . Lord Ouseley, chairman of the Kick It Out campaign, has been left less than impressed by the whole saga. He said to Telegraph Sport: 'It is almost typical of what you would expect at the FA. 'It is almost a case of, 'Good riddance, he is off our hands, we are not interested any more', when, in fact, world football should be interested in such an outrage. You are almost lost for words. 'That is not real justice and that is not serving the intentions of zero-tolerance with racism because it encourages people to find a way round a fairly lukewarm ban as it was.' Anelka, who claims he made the gesture in support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a French comedian who has been convicted seven times of anti-Semitic crimes, looks set to miss the opening three matches instead of five.","Nicolas Anelka has had a five-match ban from the FA reduced to three .

"Former Chelsea star Gianfranco Zola believes his old club have improved considerably as a result of 'clever' summer spending. Chelsea, boosted by the signings of Spain duo Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, are the early favourites for the Barclays Premier League after winning their opening three games. Costa, a £32million buy from Atletico Madrid, has been an instant hit with four goals in three games while former Arsenal midfielder Fabregas, £30million from Barcelona, has also shone. Good business: Diego Costa has hit the ground running after joining Chelsea . Zola said: 'I think it was very clever the way they used their money. They have a strong team, in every position they are very good. 'The quality of the football has been made better and I believe that Fabregas has a lot to do with that. 'Chelsea look like they will be one of the teams to beat - but the Premier League is long and the tough moments will come.' Zola was speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester where he was part of a panel discussing the summer's transfer business around Europe. Midfield maestro: Cesc Fabregas has been in fine form since his switch to Stamford Bridge . Statistics produced by marketing firm Prime Time Sport to accompany the talk underlined the spending power of the Premier League. For the first time, combined spending by English clubs topped the one billion euros mark (£800.5million). Of those, Manchester United spent the heaviest, with their £157million new signings including club record £59.7million transfer Angel di Maria. Zola believes United had to play catch-up but is unsure whether it will pay off. Record buy: United splashed £59.7million on Argentine Angel di Maria . The Italian, 48, said: 'Only time will tell. Obviously the intentions are good, they know the competition in this country is big. 'They wanted to make sure they had the quality in the squad to face the challenge. 'Manchester United want to make sure they are competitive in the next few years. 'The potential is there but football can be affected by many things. I hope for Manchester it will go well.' Yet while United's transfer spending may be eye-popping, Prime Time's figures also reveal that the club - despite the departures of Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley - still boast the highest number of homegrown players in the Premier League with seven. Speaking out: Gianfranco Zola has had his say on the summer transfer activity . Arsenal and Aston Villa both have six, Liverpool and Newcastle five while QPR, Hull and Sunderland have none. United's seven are Ben Amos, Jonny Evans, Tyler Blackett, Rafael, Darren Fletcher, Jesse Lingard and Adnan Januzaj. Former United assistant boss Mike Phelan has said he feels the club have lost some of their identity with the £16million sale of academy graduate Welbeck to Arsenal. But Zola hopes manager Louis van Gaal will still give opportunities to those who have come through the system. He said: 'Van Gaal is the type of manager if he has a good young player, he will play him. 'He is known for that. The young players will have to raise their standards but the quality of the players they have bought is high.' Perfect fit: Mario Balotelli has all the attributes to be a big hit at Liverpool, according to Zola . Another player to have moved in the recent transfer window is Zola's former protege Mario Balotelli. Balotelli, the controversial striker who played under Zola for Italy Under-21s, joined Liverpool from AC Milan for £16million. Zola said: 'I believe Mario technically and tactically is the perfect fit for Liverpool. 'I think it will depend a lot on Mario's attitude towards it. 'I think it is very important for him. I believe it is a massive opportunity for him to make a step forward in his career and his knowledge of football. 'I hope Mario takes the chance very well and Liverpool can have a lot of benefit from it.'","Blues legend says his old side have got value for money this summer .

"A newlywed who pushed her husband of eight days to his death from a cliff, is appealing her own guilty plea and 30-year prison sentence. Jordan Linn Graham, 22, from Montana, was sentenced to 365 months in federal prison, with no . possibility of parole after U.S. District Judge Don Molloy did not believe she was remorseful . for the killing. Graham's lawyers filed documents on Thursday, the deadline for an appeal, at Missoula district court. They claimed that the prosecution and Judge Molloy reneged on a plea deal where the 22-year-old would plead guilty to second-degree murder. Jordan Graham, pictured leaving court last year, has filed court documents through her lawyer claiming that the prosecution reneged on a plea deal . Graham admitted to killing Cody . Johnson, 25, by pushing him to his death from a 300ft cliff in Glacier . National Park on July 7 last year. His body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker. After she was sentenced . last month to the maximum of 30 years, Graham tried - and failed - to . withdraw her guilty plea - despite the fact her attorneys asked for a . 10-year sentence in exchange for change of plea. Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe had . previously said in a motion that her ‘extremely reckless but . unintentional act’ only warranted 10 years in prison. Her . attorney's filing this week claims that Judge Molloy failed to take . into account that accepting the plea meant she had not premeditated her . new husband's death. Graham's defense team also claims that the judge made improper calculations when deciding on her sentence. Details on how Judge Molloy calculated the 22-year-old's sentence were sealed. Before he accepted her plea in December, the judge asked Graham to tell him what happened. Graham . said she was having second thoughts about being . married so young and that she and her husband went to the park to talk about it. Unsure: Prosecutors said she pushed Cody Johnson because she was having doubts about their marriage . They went over a retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred feet to a ravine. There, . facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and she believed she should not be married, . she said. They . argued and it escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham . said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when . she became angry. 'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.' She . said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one . hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over the edge. Hidden doubts: An image from the couple's wedding on June 29 shows Johnson just days before his death . It . wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an . extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car . was parked. She drove back home to Kalispell, . about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to . friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work. Graham . initially told investigators that Johnson left their house on July 7 with . friends.

"Aleksandar Kolarov's fantastic free-kick denied France their second win in a week as Les Bleus were held to a 1-1 draw in their international friendly against Serbia in Belgrade. The Manchester City defender's 25-yard strike flew past helpless France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris 10 minutes from time as the hosts warmed up for their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a fine result against the competition hosts. Didier Deschamps's men took an early lead through Paul Pogba's strike but could not follow up victory against Spain on Thursday with another win at Stadion FK Partizan. Celebration: A scorching free kick from defender Aleksandar Kolarov earned Serbia a 1-1 friendly draw . Tough: Kolarov put in a strong display for Serbia despite Dick Advocaat's unconvincing 4-2-3-1 formation . Down: Loic Remy sits on the pitch crestfallen after France lost their 1-0 advantage over Serbia . Serbia XI: Stojkovic, Ivanovic, Stefan Mitrovic, Nastasic, Kolarov, Gudelj (Kuzmanovic 61), Matic, Zoran Tosic, Tadic (Djuricic 61), Markovic (Ljajic 82), Djordjevic (Aleksandar Mitrovic 75) Subs: Brkic, Basta, Jojic, Tomovic, Dusko Tosic,   Ignjovski, Rukavina .

Bookings: Cabaye, Pogba . Goals: Pogba 13 . Pogba's strike from close range punctuated a slow opening, with the Juventus midfielder finding space at the back post to smash high into the net from Remy Cabella's corner. The visitors continued to control the tempo but were given a let-off when Zoran Tosic curled wide from just outside the area following a fluid Serbia counter-attack. Serbia came even closer in the lead up to half-time as Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic crashed a header against the bar from Tosic's free-kick, while Dusan Tadic fired inches wide after France had failed to clear a corner. However, having been under pressure, France nearly doubled their advantage as Cabella saw his strike on the edge of the box palmed away by Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. Serbia thought they had levelled proceedings when Kolarov fired past Lloris but the effort was quickly chalked off for offside, while at the other end Pogba saw his effort punched away by Stojkovic, who then denied Loic Remy's poor finish from close range. Kolorov saw two long range efforts kept out by Lloris but he would not be denied by his Premier League compatriot a third time as his stunning left-footed effort levelled matters. Morgan Schneiderlin upended Tosic 25 yards from goal and Kolorov, following a lay-off, stepped up to fire low into the corner past Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris. France desperately tried to get back into the ascendancy but found themselves lacking a decisive touch, with substitute Karim Benzema just as ineffective as Remy had been in the opening hour of the contest. Indeed, it was Serbia who nearly nicked a winner at the death as Ivanovic was once again denied by the woodwork. The defender was once again in the thick of the action from a set-piece as he headed against a post from Tosic's inswinging corner as both sides settled for a draw. Good start: France took an early lead in the 13th minute via former Manchester United player Paul Pogba . Strike: The goal fired the Euro 2016 hosts ahead on Sunday but France could do little to hold on to their lead .

"Minister for the Disabled Mark Harper has been labelled a 'hypocrite' after it emerged his own office isn't wheelchair friendly. The Tory MP recently criticised businesses around the country for not making it easier for the disabled to get in and out. But critics pointed out that the minister's own constituency office in Cinderford, Gloucestershire is on a steep hill with a large step from the pavement to the front door withno handrail. Constituents have attacked Mark Harper, Minister for the Disabled, after it emerged he criticised 'inaccessible' shops and restaurants - despite his own constituency office being 'difficult to get into' Local Labour councillor Max Coburn branded the MP was a 'hypocrite', adding: 'It's a bit rich criticising people when he doesn't do it himself. 'It's an awkward slope up to the door and you think he would have done something since he moved but he hasn't.' Mr Harper, member of Parliament for the Forest of Dean, hit out earlier this month after a survey he commissioned discovered around a fifth of shops and a third of restaurants lack facilities to allow access for wheelchair users. In response he said: 'This isn't just about doing what's right. Businesses are missing a trick by not doing more to tap into this market. 'Everyone deserves to be able to go Christmas shopping or enjoy a festive meal or drink with their friends or colleagues. Improving accessibility is a no-brainer.' Mr Harper recently railed against shops with bad accessibility and insisted that improving it is a 'no-brainer' Critics say the large step and lack of rail in front of his office's front door make it difficult to enter . He has now shrugged off criticism of his  office, claiming only a small number of constituents visit him in person and insisting he's willing to meet them elsewhere. He said: 'Any constituent can use either the phone or email to reach my office. 'If anybody wishes to meet me to discuss an issue in person at a surgery then I hold these on a regular basis in accessible venues around the constituency. 'If a wheelchair user was to do so, then we do have a ramp available.' His original comments came after a government audit of more than 30,000 shops and restaurants branded access for disabled people  'shocking'. The report found only 15 per cent of restaurants and shops had hearing loops and three quarters of restaurants did not cater for those with visual impairments.","Conservative MP for the Forest of Dean is Minister for the Disabled .

"No mass: Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols has announced that gay-friendly Catholic services in London's Soho have been scrapped . The Catholic Church has scrapped gay-friendly Masses in the central London church that has held them for the past six years, London's archbishop announced yesterday. Our Lady of the Assumption, an 18th-century church in Soho, the heart of London's gay scene, has been hosting the twice-monthly masses with the support of the local Church hierarchy. But Archbishop Vincent Nichols said in a statement that gay Catholics should attend mass in their local parishes rather going to separate services. 'The mass is always to retain its essential character as the highest prayer of the whole Church,' Nichols said, stressing there would still be pastoral care to help gay Catholics 'take a full part in the life of the Church'. The move has been blasted by Stonewall director of public affairs Ruth Hunt, who is Catholic. She told the BBC: 'Given what's happened over Christmas, where there were vitriolic and mean messages from pulpit about same-sex marriage, there has never been a more important time to provide a safe space for gay Catholics to pray.' Archbishop Nichols has previously attacked the government's gay marriage Bill, labelling it 'undemocratic' and a 'shambles'. The Vatican teaches that gay sex is sinful but homosexuals deserve respect. The decision on the 'Soho Masses' came after sharp criticism of same-sex marriage by Pope Benedict and bishops in Britain and France, where the governments plan to legalise gay nuptials. Nichols has spoken out in recent weeks against same-sex marriage but Church officials and a spokesman for the Soho gay congregation said the decision to stop the Soho Masses was not explicitly linked to that debate. 'We don't see any direct cause and effect,' said Joe Stanley, chairman of the Soho Masses Pastoral Council. London's approved gay-friendly masses were launched in early 2007 while the Vatican's top doctrinal official was Cardinal William Levada, the former archbishop of San Francisco, a city with a large gay community and several gay-friendly churches. Holy: Our Lady of the Assumption Church in Soho, London. It hosted gay-friendly masses twice a month for the past six years . Nichols reaffirmed his support for them last February. Since then, Levada was replaced by Archbishop Gerhard Mueller, who German Catholic media have said wanted to clarify the apparent contradiction between them and Church teaching on homosexuality. The Our Lady of the Assumption church will now become a parish for disaffected Anglicans who became Catholics in protest against moves in their churches towards allowing female and gay bishops. Conservative Catholics in Britain have long complained to the Vatican about the Soho Masses, saying they flouted Church teaching on homosexuality, and small groups sometimes protested outside the church during the services. The archbishop's office declined to comment on his statement or any discussions with the Vatican. Opposed: Archbishop Vincent Nichols has criticised government proposals to allow gay marriage in the UK .","Archbishop ends gay Masses in London's Soho .

"Brazilian author Paulo Coelho says the Sony hack threatens us all if society doesn't enforce important values: our individual and collective freedom of expression and an unwavering refusal to negotiate with anonymous terrorists. The best-selling author said Friday that he was prepared to make himself an example — even if it meant inviting criticism and potential threats — if Sony Pictures had taken him up on his $100,000 offer for the rights to its cancelled film. Defending these values is a matter of the highest concern for 'everyone on the planet, everyone who believes in freedom of expression,' he said, drawing parallels with the plight of fellow author Salman Rushdie, who spent years in hiding after his novel The Satanic Verses drew death threats from the Iranian government. Scroll down for videos . Buyer: Paulo Coelho has revealed that he offered Sony $100,000 for the film rights to The Interview . No release: Sony execs decided on Wednesday to not distribute The Interview at this time . His plan was to release the film on his blog in the unlikely event Sony took him up on his spontaneous offer via Twitter for the controversial film The Interview that Sony cancelled after threats from anonymous hackers. 'I thought that they could take the offer so as not to lose face,' Coelho said. 'You know, ""In a gesture of good will, we are going to accept $100,000 even if we put $44 million in this movie because we believe in freedom of information."" ... Tomorrow the film would be there.' The author of The Alchemist acknowledged he would have been afraid if he had released the film, particularly because he travels and could be vulnerable, but he would have been more ashamed of himself if he didn't at least try. 'So live with fear or live with shame? Better to live with fear,' he said at his luxury Geneva home, where his phone and Internet service were mysteriously out of service in an apparent attack directed at him. 'In the name of something that is more important than I am, as a physical person.' Sony defended its decision after President Barack Obama said during a press conference that the studio had 'made a mistake' in dropping The Interview, a satirical film about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader, and he pledged the U.S. would respond 'in a place and manner and time that we choose' to the attack that led to the withdrawal. The FBI blamed the hack on the communist government. Sony said the cancellation happened only because the country's top theater chains pulled out. 'This was their decision,' Sony said in a statement. Vocal: The Brazilian author said in an interview that the hacking of Sony threatens everyone . Coelho made clear he wasn't defending the movie itself but rather that he decried the 'culture of fear' and apparent willingness to 'negotiate with terrorists' that he said undercuts people's freedom of expression and the principle of not negotiating with terrorists. He also expressed admiration for actor George Clooney's attempt to highlight the same values of sticking one's neck out to defend our freedom of information by putting forward a petition for Hollywood bigwigs to sign — though none did. Clooney said the entertainment industry should seek release of The Interview online, telling the trade site Deadline that he urged Sony to 'do whatever you can to get this movie out. Not because everybody has to see the movie, but because I'm not going to be told we can't see the movie. That's the most important part.' Coelho said he was unable to reach any executives to discuss the decision not to screen the film before a projected December 25 release, but he thinks the studio ignored his offer because of fear that more Sony hacked e-mails would be divulged. 'What I'm doing here is much more a kind of political statement: fight for you rights,' he said. 'We live in a moment where fear rules, and this cannot continue.'","Paulo Coelho has revealed that he offered Sony $100,000 for the film rights to The Interview .

"President Obama and the First Family have landed in Hawaii tonight for a 17-day holiday together. The family flew overnight in Air Force one, direct from Maryland to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. They are not expected to return to  Washington D.C. until January 4. 'On Friday, December 19, President Obama and the First Family will travel to Honolulu, Hawai’i. The arrival of Air Force One is open to pre-credentialed media and closed to the public,' the White House said in a statement.

Family time: Obama gave a wave as he made his way down from Air Force One after the lengthy flight. The family will stay in Kailua . It is not yet known exactly where the Obamas are staying this year, though it will be somewhere in Kailua on Oahu island, where they have stayed for the past three years. During their year-end trips to the Hawaiian islands the Obamas typically lounge around their rental home, venturing out only on occasion for  shaved ice and dinner with their friends. First Lady Michelle Obama revealed on Monday that it's her Christmas wish to spend this year's holiday sleeping in late. The Obamas, including dogs Bo and more recently Sunny, have spent every Christmas since Barack was elected to president visiting the his birth place, Honolulu, which is coincidentally located in the beautiful Hawaiian islands. In addition to culinary excursions the president generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base. He and the first lady usually make a special trip to the base to to wish the troops stationed there a Merry Christmas and to thank them for their service, as well. Last year the Obama family also went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip. Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013. Taxpayers picked up the tab for as at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in, however.

A 2012 trip cost even more - $7 million - Watchdog.org found, after the president accompanied his family to Honolulu, Hawaii, for five days, then rushed back to Washington to help negotiate a deal to keep the country from falling off the 'fiscal cliff.' After spending several days at the White House, Obama then returned to Hawaii to pick up his family and finish out his vacation. Earlier this year the president's two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard was interrupted by a series of domestic and international crises and the president ended up having to work on many days set aside for relaxation on the Massachusetts island. He also returned to Washington, D.C. for two days during that getaway, without his wife, for meetings at the White House. This year's winter vacation promises to be much less stressful, as Congress has already approved a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year.

The first lady said on Monday that she's looking forward to getting a good night's sleep while on her upcoming holiday. Obama was at the Washington, D.C. medical center to read children the classic Christmas tale Twas the Night Before Christmas and to answer their questions on Monday when a patient asked her what she wanted this year, according to CBS News. 'I don’t really have a long wish list for Christmas, because I pretty much have everything I need,' she responded. 'I just want everybody to be happy, and I want to sleep in. That’s what I want for Christmas. I want to sleep late. Maybe I’ll get that,' she continued. After the first lady's initial answer another child inquired as to whether she had Christmas-themed sleepwear. 'Maybe that’s what I should put on my Christmas list,' Mrs. Obama said told the group that had gathered to listen to her read at Children’s National Health System hospital. 'OK, Mr. President, if you’re watching, I think we could use some Christmas pajamas. That’s a good idea,' she said. Earlier that day her husband had admitted that he struggles with buying her gifts she'll like - particularly clothes - while talking to radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest . Years gone by: President Obama is pictured above in 2011 with his daughters Malia, to his left, and Sasha, to his right, while they return from a visit to Sea Life Park in Waimanalo . 'Michelle is hard to shop for,' he told the American Idol host during a radio interview that was taped Friday but aired on Monday. 'She's very fashionable and she looks good,,' he said, per USA Today. 'So I'm worried about buying her clothes because she'll, on Christmas Day, look at it and say, ""That's really sweet, honey,""  and peck me on the cheek -- and I never see her wear what I bought.' President Obama has finished the year on a memorable note - by only answering questions from female reporters at the final press conference of 2014. In a presidential first, he called upon eight women in the last press meeting of the year and fielded questions about Cuba policy, the Sony hack and the state of race relations in the U.S. Reading the reporters' names from a pre-prepared list, he called upon Carrie Budoff Brown from Politico, Cheryl Bolen from Bloomberg, Julie Pace from Associated Press, Lesley Clark of McClatchy, Roberta Rampton from Reuters, Colleen M. Nelson of the Wall Street Journal and Juliet Eilperin from the Washington Post. Although he had said Eilperin would ask the last question, reporters continued to shout out more - as is tradition - and Obama clearly ignored a question from a male reporter about his new year's resolution. Instead, he called upon one more woman - April Ryan of American Urban Radio. President Obama buys a a shaved ice from Island Snow at Kailua Beach Center in Kailua, Hawaii, on December 31, 2013.

"A teenager has become the first ever openly gay head boy to be given the role at one of the country's elite group of public schools. Will Emery, 17, who came out to his family three years ago, was voted in by more than 1,000 pupils and staff at Brighton College in Sussex, one of the most successful schools of its type in Britain, with boarding fees starting at £27,000 a year. Emery, the son of a banker, said: 'I don't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen, but in other periods, when people had to hide their sexuality, it could have been a different story.' The new head boy appointed at Brighton College is an openly gay teenager. It is the first time a top public school has made such an appointment . Headmaster Richard Cairns said there was a huge round of applause when the announcement was made and said teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 see sexuality as a 'so-what' issue. He added: 'He was a very popular choice - the rugby players voted for him along with many others - but I bet if I wrote to the old boys and said our head boy was openly gay, some of them would think it's very strange indeed.' Mr Emery has used his new position to speak critically of schools that use policies that stopteachers from discussing homosexuality. Gay rights campaigners have highlighted 40 schools that use sex education policies that forbid 'promoting' homosexuality, similar to the controversial section 28 of the Local Government Act implemented by Thatcher's government. 'I don't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen, but in other periods, when people had to hide their sexuality, it could have been a different story' - Will Emery . Section 28 made it an offence for a local authority to 'intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality' or to 'promote the teaching in any maintained school the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship'. It has since been repealed. The teenager's stance is supported by Mr Cairns, who described the schools' actions as 'outrageous'. Mr Emery, speaking to The Sunday Times, said the root of the issue lies with the attitudes of those running the schools. He said: 'They grew up in a society where homosexuality wasn't spoken about. Their views need to be changed.'","Will Emery was voted in by pupils at £27,000-a-year Brighton College .

"Russia coach Fabio Capello praised his team for reacting quickly to the embarrassing setback they suffered in their 1-1 World Cup draw with South Korea. The Russians had looked shaky at the back for some time during a Group H clash with South Korea and, in the 68th minute, goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev flapped wildly at a speculative effort from Lee Keun-ho to concede the opener. But Capello threw Alexandr Kerzhakov into the mix from the bench and was soon rewarded for making the switch as the Zenit St Petersburg striker forced a 1-1 draw in Cuiaba.

His equaliser arrived from a goalmouth scramble - only six minutes after Akinfeev's gaffe - and Italian tactician Capello was pleased his players had managed to stay focused on securing a positive result. He told the BBC: 'It was a good game, they ran a lot in the first half and then felt tired. You saw the goal they scored, it was not easy to react. 'But the players were really good and most important for me was the reaction. We also twice had a chance to score a second goal. 'I know Kerzhakov did well, he's a fantastic player. He always offers us a way to score goals.' The Akinfeev incident will have given Capello, the former England boss, unpleasant flashbacks of Rob Green's mistake against the United States at the 2010 World Cup. Italian job: Former England manager Capello was pleased with his team's response . Despite watching victory and two valuable points slip away in the final minutes, South Korea coach Hong Myung-bo was able to praise his team for tightening up at the back. The fall-out from last week's final warm-up game, a friendly against Ghana in Miami, sent South Korea off to the World Cup finals in a fog of depression as the Black Stars had plundered an easy 4-0 win. Hong told SBS after Tuesday's match: 'The heavy defeat against Ghana was not important as it was just part of the process. Point gained: Kerkhakov wheels away after equalising late on for Russia .

"The Pentagon has been briefed on an investigation into Sgt Bowe Bergdahl's disappearance from a base in Afghanistan five years ago. Details about the probe's conclusion have been closely held. But they are likely to lay out whether Bergdahl deserted his post or was 'absent without leave' or AWOL. And it could include recommendations on whether Bergdahl should be charged with any criminal violations or forced to leave the Army.

Officials said Army Secretary John McHugh could send the case to a military commander who would decide whether it should go before a court martial and what, if any, charges would be filed against Bergdahl. Bergdahl disappeared on June 30, 2009, reportedly walking away from his unit after expressing misgivings about the U.S. military's role — as well as his own — in Afghanistan. He was captured by the Taliban and held by members of the Haqqani network, an insurgent group tied to the Taliban that operates both in Pakistan and Afghanistan. On May 31, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. special forces in Afghanistan as part of an exchange for five top Taliban commanders who were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After spending about two weeks recuperating at a U.S. military hospital in Germany, Bergdahl was sent to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston on June 13. He is now doing administrative duties at the base, awaiting the conclusion of the case. Officials suggested that the report's findings may not be made public any time soon. 'Sometimes investigations are used in follow-on judicial processes, and therefore are not released until those judicial processes are complete,' said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary. Bergdahl's former platoon leader, Sgt. Evan Buetow, and Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, a frequent Fox guest, joined Fox News' Sean Hannity to discuss the Army's announcement that it had not reached a verdict yet, even though the general conducting the investigation has finished his report . 'There's no way that they can conclude this investigation without the truth,' Buetow told Hannity. The truth, he said, is that Bergdahl deserted. 'There's not one person [from his platoon] who disagrees,' Buetow claimed . He added that Hagel's briefing is 'informational' and the Pentagon chief is not expected to have input into the investigation or make any decisions on the case. 'The secretary is not going to do arm twisting' in the case, said Kirby of Hagel. 'There's no role for him in the process to modify the investigation.' An initial U.S. military investigation in 2009 concluded that Bergdahl deliberately walked away, based on evidence available at the time. Since his release, some former soldiers who served with him have labeled him a deserter and said he should be held accountable for leaving his post. Others have suggested that troops were put in danger, and even killed, as they tried to find Bergdahl. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is pictured here in an undated photo provided to reporters by the Army. If Bergdahl is cleared of desertion charges, he'll receive $200,000 in back pay and stands to gain another $150,000 in compensation for his ordeal . But there are also those who contend that even if Bergdahl deliberately walked away, his five years in captivity were more than enough punishment for the soldier. Shortly after Bergdahl was released, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, left open the possibility that an Army investigation could result in desertion or other charges. Dempsey was briefed on the results of Dahl's investigation earlier this week and Hagel got a similar briefing on Friday afternoon. Maj. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl was tasked to conduct an exhaustive investigation into the matter, and spent months interviewing unit members and commanders, and meeting with Bergdahl and his attorney, Eugene Fidell, a military justice expert who is also a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School. He submitted his report in mid-October, setting off a lengthy legal review on his report and how the Army can legally proceed in the case. The deal to swap prisoners with the Taliban, meanwhile, enraged members of Congress who complained the administration violated requirements to inform lawmakers of any such transfer 30 days in advance. A report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon broke the law by not telling Congress and using nearly $1 million of a wartime account to make the transfer. Hagel told Congress that the Defense Department 'acted lawfully in the operation to recover Sgt. Bergdahl, a judgment that was supported by the Justice Department.'","The Pentagon, including Chuck Hagel, briefed on investigation to determine is Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was 'absent without leave' or AWOL .

"Former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu left Romanian club Petrolul Ploiesti on Friday and is poised to join FC Pune City in the inaugural Indian Super League (ISL). 'Petrolul decided to terminate Mutu's contract and the 35-year-old player is free to join any team he wants,' the Ploiesti-based club said in a statement. Much-travelled Mutu is set to join the likes of Frenchmen Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet as well as World Cup winning Italian duo of Alessandro Del Piero and Marco Materazzi in the ISL. Adrian Mutu is set to join the Indian Premier League after featuring for the Romanian national team . Co-owned by Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Pune, who also have a technical partnership with Mutu's former club Fiorentina, have confirmed their ongoing negotiation with the Romanian player.

"Pope Benedict XVI hopes that 2013 will be a peaceful year despite the threat of terrorism and 'unregulated financial capitalism'. Around 10,000 worshippers converged on St Peter's Basilica today for the Pontiff's New Years Day Mass and to mark the Catholic Church's World Day of Peace. In his homily, Pope Benedict said that despite today’s terrorism, criminality and the inequality between rich and poor, he is convinced the 'numerous works of peace, of which the world is rich, are testimony to the innate vocation of humanity to peace.' Scroll down for video . New Year Mass: Pope Benedict XVI gives mass to 10,000 worshippers at St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican in Rome today . He cited 'unregulated financial capitalism' as evidence of an 'egotistical and individualistic mentality' that is rife in the world. His address was no doubt aimed at the front pews: diplomats accredited to the Holy See, who next week will attend the pope’s annual address about the plight of the world’s poor and its war-torn regions. The 85-year-old Pope compared the New Year to a journey and prayed that it 'may lead on a path to peace for every person and every family, for each country and for the whole world.' Later, Benedict appeared at his studio window overlooking St. Peter’s Square to wish crowds of tens of thousands of people below a Happy New Year.

Greeting: Pope Benedict XVI gestures during his Sunday Angelus from the window of his private appartment overlooking St. Peter's square after the solemnity of Mary the Mother of God mass and during the church's World Day of Peace . But his New Year greeting was overshadowed by a man who scaled scaffolding around St Peter's Square and draped a banner calling on the Pope to 'Stop terrorism'. The man identified himself on the banner as Julian Jungarean, a Romanian who has previously scaled the colonnade around the piazza. Witnesses say uniformed officers were speaking with him from the ground and a nearby roof. After a few hours of police negotiations, he came down and was escorted away. The protest didn’t appear to cause the pope any disturbance.

"When Jack Colback smashed Sunderland’s third into the top corner of the Gallowgate End goal to crown last season’s 3-0 victory, Alan Pardew spun on his heels, sickened. He had also just identified his first summer signing. Four months later, Colback was joining his hometown club on a free transfer. The bitter Black Cats tweeted a picture of his celebration at St James’ Park and a statement was released expressing their ‘dismay’ at his decision to quit the club who had ‘nurtured him’. Colback and his new employers kept their counsel. Until now. The 25-year-old is the feature interview in tomorrow’s matchday programme and the cover carries an artist’s drawing of the black-and-white-clad midfielder with his hand on his heart. Jack Colback joined Newcastle on a free transfer this summer after leaving Sunderland . Midfielder Colback (centre) has impressed since during his early Newcastle career . An illustration of Jack Colback with his hand on his heart will be on the front cover of Newcastle's programme . The Newcastle players are put through their paces during Newcastle's Friday morning training session . Behind him rests a snow-covered Tyne Bridge. Newcastle’s message is clear: Jack’s back home. Pardew has added to Sunderland’s sense of loss by admitting that Colback's man-of-the-match showing on Tyneside was the motivating factor behind their summer steal. ‘Jack’s performance in the derby was one of the reasons I signed him,’ he said. ‘The way he played on those big occasions told me a lot about the player. When I like a player and he performs in the big games it ticks a lot of boxes for me. ‘He has been a major thorn in our side in these fixtures so I'm just pleased he's not playing for Sunderland if I'm honest.’ The United boss added: ‘I think he feels a bit aggrieved about the way it ended at Sunderland. ‘But I think he's handled the move impeccably because he took a bit of criticism after it and he didn't respond, which I think is the right thing. Alan Pardew has added extra spice to the Tyne-Wear derby by praising Colback's performances this season . Pardew will be hoping to end his run of three successive defeats against Sunderland . Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season . ‘His performances for us have been fantastic. He has grown in terms of having a different role here. I couldn't be more delighted with him and I'm sure Gus would mirror that.’ Does, then, Poyet mirror that affection? ‘He helped me a lot and I will remember that and I wish him well,’ said the Sunderland head coach. ‘Tomorrow (Sunday), I hope he has a stinker. But his character shows that he could have a special game. ‘My first few games here when I started playing him in the middle of midfield – they’d been playing him left-back – he got man-of-the-match and was stood there with a big bottle of champagne – he was enjoying it. ‘Of course, I would be happier for him now if he was somewhere else. It was a massive decision he took.’ Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009 . Colback will come up against his former team-mates for the first time on Sunday . Newcastle have come a long way since a legion of French players led to their manager being dubbed Alan Depardieu last season. Pardew could start five Geordies in the Tyne-Wear derby tomorrow, their most ever in the Premier League. Sunderland, on the other hand, are likely to field only one local lad — Sunderland-born Adam Johnson. STEVEN TAYLOR . Born in London to a Newcastle family and relocated to the North East just weeks after his birth. Joined the esteemed Wallsend Boys Club before joining Newcastle’s youth academy. SAMMY AMEOBI . While older brother and former Newcastle man Shola was born in Nigeria, Sammy was born and bred in Newcastle. He joined United’s academy in July 2008 and within three months had featured for the reserves. PAUL DUMMETT . The defender joined Newcastle aged eight and worked his way through the academy, captaining the reserves on several occasions. After loans at Gateshead and St Mirren, Dummett made his breakthrough last season. Jak Alnwick is set to be one of five local lads in the Newcastle starting line-up on Sunday . JAK ALNWICK . Born in Hexham, just outside Newcastle, Alnwick did not head straight for his local club. With big brother Ben at Sunderland, Alnwick followed suit before swapping for rivals Newcastle in 2008. JACK COLBACK . Another to take the long road to Newcastle. The midfielder spent his formative years progressing through Sunderland’s youth academy but joined Newcastle on a free in June after his contract had expired. Poyet, though, remains upset by Colback’s defection. And, in what could be considered a sly attempt to cast doubt over the player’s decision, he questioned the wider perception that Newcastle is a bigger club than Sunderland. ‘From the outside, for some reason, Newcastle are apparently a bigger club than Sunderland, but when you are here, you realise there is no difference,’ he said. ‘Maybe it’s because of the publicity Newcastle gets, the city centre or maybe even the airport, Sunderland does not have one. ‘It is easier to talk about Newcastle than Sunderland.’ Talk will turn to Sunderland, however, should they win a fourth straight derby for the first time in the fixture’s history. Gus Poyet said he hopes his former player Colback has a 'stinker' on Sunday . Poyet said that he would prefer it if Colback was playing for a different team . Poyet, with two victories of his own, has certainly absorbed the sense of separation in the region. ‘I agree with Roy Keane because you have to live it to know it,’ he said of the rivalry. ‘It is the cities. Mostly derbies are teams from the same city or two teams from different ones, really far away. This is different. We are near, almost connected to each other, but very different. Two different cities. ‘It is special. So close, yet unique. And the passion is really special.’ There has been an effort by both clubs to channel such passion onto the pitch, as opposed to vitriol in the stands and on the streets. Pardew is cheered by the progress in this respect. Rather, his concerns lie with one of his players. Steven Taylor once said that no Sunderland player would get in Newcastle’s side and has been a target of supporters who once sang, ‘Steven Taylor, we wish you were dead’. Poyet's Sunderland did the doule over Newcastle last season, including a 3-0 win at St James' Park . Manager Poyet insists that Newcastle are not a bigger club than his Sunderland . Taylor, who was sent off in his last home game against Chelsea, has already been called into the manager’s office for a quiet word. ‘I will be looking at one or two who maybe get emotionally involved,’ said Pardew. ‘Probably the one who worries me the most is Steven Taylor. He wears his heart on his sleeve and he plays like that sometimes in this fixture. ‘I've spoken to him about it. I think this time around he will be a lot calmer and if he plays he will be in better shape (to deal with the emotion).’ Sunderland have their own firebrand in the form of Lee Cattermole, who was red carded on his last appearance at St James’. Alan Pardew said he has had a word with Steven Taylor about keeping his emotions in check on Sunday . Papiss Cisse keeps himself warm with a personalised snood during the session . Poyet, though, feels that characters such as Taylor and Cattermole define the intensity of the derby. ‘We normally try to motivate players but it is with a limit. Characters like Taylor and Cattermole, sometimes you need to bring them down,’ he said. ‘But it’s all part of this game, if Taylor and Cattermole weren’t there it would be a different game. It would be too soft – they add to the occasion.’ With Pardew and Poyet, Cattermole and Taylor, and not forgetting Colback, there is certainly no doubting the sense of occasion this time.","Newcastle welcome Sunderland to St James' Park on Sunday .

"All along they were adamant that Alastair Cook would captain England at the World Cup. That his painfully long run without a decent 50-over score would come to an end and that everything would be fine once he got to Australia on harder, faster pitches. Now all that has dramatically changed. What an extraordinary U-turn the England selectors performed on Friday night in snatching the captaincy away from the man they have invested so much in. What a last-gasp change of heart before the biggest tournament in one-day cricket. Misfiring England captain Alastair Cook plays and misses at one in Colombo during another poor innings . Cook looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final ODI of the series against Sri Lanka . Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook . It will be portrayed as a brave decision, one with the best interests of Cook at heart, but in truth it is embarrassing that England have been forced to take drastic action just weeks before February’s World Cup. Only this week, the day before England slumped to the final defeat in their 5-2 loss to Sri Lanka, managing director Paul Downton said that he would be ‘very surprised’ if Cook was replaced. Three days later he has gone. They were supposed to have four years to plan for this. Four years to make sure that this World Cup will not be as miserable for England as the last five when they have fallen woefully short of the 50-over standards now required. Now, in little more than two weeks, England will be leaving for Australia and the triangular series that precedes the World Cup with a new captain and seemingly little idea of their best way to spring a monumental surprise. How did it come to this? Well, in truth England have never been as sure that Cook was the right man to lead the one-day team as they were that he should captain them in Test cricket after the tumultuous events of the last year. Cook's form was horrendous as the England captain hadn't scored an ODI century since June 2012 . Cook after the defeat by Sri Lanka, his final match as England one-day captain . Cook, after all, is predominantly a Test batsman, just as Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss were when they led England into World Cups. It has always been the English way to put Test cricket first and then have a think about what used to be known as the hit-and-giggle stuff. But Cook is widely respected in the dressing room and has created, along with coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace, the more positive team culture that England felt was woefully lacking when they were thrashed 5-0 in Australia. So, any reservations England had about Cook’s one-day form — which has been dismal since the last of his five 50-over centuries two-and-a-half years ago — were shelved when they considered what was ahead. The two new white balls used in one-day cricket and the back-foot conditions that await in Australia would play, they believed, to Cook’s strengths. Yet he has been unable to reproduce the form that saw him confound the doubters when he took over from Strauss after the last World Cup and led England to the top of the one-day rankings and the Champions Trophy final. Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake (right) celebrates with  Angelo Mathews after taking the wicket of Cook . Now it seems that England will be heading to the World Cup with a captain in Eoin Morgan who has been in even worse form than Cook and looks a shadow of the man who became one of the best one-day batsmen in the world. Personally, given that England would probably have little hope at this World Cup even if they had a captain with the talent of Don Bradman and the tactical acumen of Mike Brearley, I would have plumped for Joe Root. After all, there is little for England to lose and, I understand, the plan was always to replace Cook with Root at the helm of the 50-over team at the end of this World Cup, just as Mike Atherton, Alec Stewart, Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss have all departed as one-day captains after the biggest tournament. Now Cook’s departure has been spectacularly brought forward and England feel it would be asking too much of such an inexperienced captain to step into the breach in the most important one-day show of them all. And one of England’s best ever batsmen has been forced to accept that he will never get to play, let alone be captain, in a World Cup. And that is a shame apart from anything else for a decent man and world-class performer. England captain Cook leaves the field after being dismissed by Senanayake of Sri Lanka on December 11 .","Alastair Cook dumped as England one-day captain on brink of World Cup .

"The media were banned from entering the FIFA ExCo hotel in Marrakech after the BBC started filming in the lobby, but the German TV station which did gain access later may be a lot more troublesome. It was German station ARD — who have just revealed a serial doping culture in Russian athletics that has caused tremors within track and field’s ruling body, the IAAF — and they had two of their top officials operating inside La Mamounia hotel. ARD, who have the International Olympic Comittee, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IAAF all mounting probes into the drugs allegations, are planning a documentary about FIFA and the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. TV station ARD are making a documentary about Franz Beckenbauer (right), who is under investigaion . Beckenbauer originally declined to talk to Michael Garcia (above) before changing his mind . The central figure within the ARD probe is expected to be German legend Franz Beckenbauer, the former FIFA ExCo member who remains under investigation by FIFA for alleged breaches of ethics codes in the bidding process. Beckenbauer initially refused to speak to the Garcia investigation before changing his mind. He has had close links with the Russian bid team since the campaign in 2010 when Sports Agenda first mooted he would become an ambassador of Russian energy giants Gazprom. They have since become major sponsors in football. The biggest surprise in Michael Garcia’s resignation statement was his astonishing claim that the FIFA ExCo had reported him to the disciplinary committee for supposedly breaking ethics codes by speaking out that his report should be made public. ..........................................................................

FIFA’s Club World Cup fails to register in the UK even when Real Madrid — with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale part of a full strength side — are playing in today’s final. However, FIFA’s individual Ballon d’Or is regarded by the world’s best players as definitely worth winning. .......................................................................... Gill needs training up . The FIFA circus in Marrakech this week has seen British vice-president Jim Boyce inundated with media requests which the affable Northern Ireland football administrator always does his best to accommodate — even waiting for 40 minutes while Channel 4 tried to sort out an interview link from London yesterday. Certainly, England’s David Gill, almost sure to replace Boyce after the UEFA Congress election in March, will have to change his typical anti-Press attitude and needs media training to prepare him for the role. .......................................................................... Rio Ferdinand’s ever-increasing media profile has been enough to persuade Robbie Savage to join him in the management stable of Jamie Moralee, the former Watford player still unkindly described by fan groups as the club’s worst-ever signing. .......................................................................... The FA board were remarkably sanguine at their meeting this week about the commercial department’s abject failure to find a sponsor for the FA Cup by the third round. Sympathy of the sort shown by the FA directors about the difficult market conditions certainly would not have been seen at Daniel Levy–run White Hart Lane, where heads tend to roll in the Tottenham Hotspur commercial department for failure to achieve targets. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is known to be rather more cut-throat than the Football Association seem to be . It is expected that the upcoming Premier League TV rights bonanza, that could reap an astonishing near £5billion from the domestic market with a £10million-a-game valuation, will galvanise campaigning about lowering the price of match tickets.

"Phil Taylor breezed through his first-round match at the World Darts Championship on Friday and then headed straight home to be with his ill mother. The 16-time world champion brushed aside Jyhan Artut 3-0 before dashing up the motorway in the early hours to see his mum in hospital, who is suffering from a severe lung infection. After his win, Taylor said: ‘My mum will be on the phone now, she’s so demanding. I’ll get a phone call on the way out with her asking “when are you coming to see me?” I will be there at 9 o’clock in the morning. Phil Taylor celebrates his routine first round victory after what has been a difficult week . The 16-time champion has had to put Darts second this week after his mum fell ill . ‘Mum is settled now, she has got a nice little care home and she’s lovely.’ But despite his personal issues and lack of practice, Taylor was in cruise control as he averaged 100.57 and checked out 60 per cent of his doubles. ‘Practice has been in second place,’ he admitted. ‘These things happen in life, but it is very tiring. ‘We will get through it. We have got a lovely family. My daughter Lisa and my son Christopher, they have been an absolute rock and, along with my son in law Justin, they’ve been with my mum ten out of 12 hours a day we could visit.’ Taylor’s victory against Artut, the world No 58 from Germany, was one of his most straight forward at Alexandra Palace. Jyhan Artut was blown away as Taylor averaged over 100 and checked out 60 per cent of his doubles . 'The Power' left straight after his comfortable victory to return to his mother's side in hospital . He reeled off the first six legs of the match to race into a two-set lead before the German realised what had hit him. Artut put up more of a fight in the third set as he finally won his first leg and, when trailing 2-1, he checked out 95 to break Taylor’s throw and save the match. But in the deciding leg of the set, the 16-time world champion hit a 180 to leave 125 before setting up double 16 on his next visit to win the match. Taylor's performance showed why he is up there with the favourites for this year's title . In the first match of Friday’s session, Andy Hamilton fought back from 2-1 down to beat Canadian Dave Richardson and win his first match in a premier event since the World Matchplay in July. The 2012 World Championship finalist won the opening set before Richardson responded by taking the next two to leave Hamilton reeling. But Hamilton found his form when it mattered most, winning six legs in a row to claim a 3-2 win and avoid a first-round upset. He said: ‘In the last three or four tournaments I haven’t been playing bad but I just haven’t had results. Andy Hamilton celebrates his comeback victory after struggling in the first round against Dave Richardson . Richardson had led after three sets, but Hamilton stormed back with six consecutive legs to win the match 3-2 . ‘I have been playing well and been having games where I’m losing 6-5 and that knocks you down and takes your confidence. ‘Hopefully this will give me that much more confidence for the next game and I can go on from there. I’m going to enjoy Christmas now.’ In the final match of the evening, Sascha Stein upset No 32 seed Stuart Kellett 3-1 having earlier come through a preliminary round match.","Phil 'The Power' Taylor beats Jyhan Artut 3-0 in first round .

"Javier Hernandez will not be leaving Real Madrid in the January transfer window, according to the striker's agent. The on-loan Manchester United forward has failed to hold down a regular place in Carlo Ancelotti's side, with much of that down to the superb form of Karim Benzema. Therefore it has been mooted that the 26-year-old's season-long loan will be cut short earlier than expected, suggestions which have been rejected by Eduardo Hernandez. Javier Hernandez has struggled for regular playing time since joining Real Madrid on loan . The 26-year-old will not be returning to Manchester United in January despite reports in the press . He told AS: 'Sometimes the media speculate too much and assume situations. He (Hernandez) will not leave the club [in January]. 'He is eager to play more minutes but he knows that hard work will open up more opportunities. He has his future ahead of him. 'Real Madrid are a team full of impressive players and obviously to earn a spot is difficult, but Javier has a great quality in working hard, like he has since the first day, and this is his quality.' Hernandez pictured in training for Real Madrid on the eve of the Club World Cup semi-final earlier this week . No decision will be made on Chicharito's long-term future until the end of the season, with Madrid undecided if they will exercise the option to sign the Mexican on a permanent basis. 'If Madrid do not exercise the option to buy it will not be until the end of the season,' the agent added.

"Anger: Rector George K Martin slammed the Rolling Stone's gang rape article as drive-by journalism . The chairman of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors ripped into Rolling Stone magazine Friday, saying the magazine unfairly tarnished the school's image with a piece of 'drive-by journalism'. At a special board meeting on campus, Rector George K. Martin gave his most expansive comments since doubt was cast on a Rolling Stone article that described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article, published last month, described in graphic detail an alleged gang rape at a fraternity house on campus. Its publication set off a frenzy of recriminations at the school, one of the top public universities in the country. U.Va. suspended fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointed an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handed the case over to the Charlottesville police. But problems with the story became apparent after publication. Many of the students described in the article have since said the magazine's account is misleading and wrong. The magazine has since apologized for what it calls discrepancies. 'Like a neighborhood thrown into chaos by drive-by violence, our tight knit community has experienced the full fury of drive-by journalism in the 21st century,' Martin said in his opening remarks. 'Our great university's reputation has been unfairly tarnished.' Martin pledged that the campus would not respond in anger, but would continue to work on sex assault prevention efforts and try to learn from the entire episode. He said Rolling Stone's 'catastrophic failure of professionalism' should 'teach us to be less quick to judge.' U.Va. President Teresa Sullivan said the Rolling Stone article provided the school an opportunity to be a leader in increasing the 'culture of reporting' sexual violence and eliminating the stigma that victims of sexual assault may feel. She said the article had prompted many campus community members to come forward with their own stories of sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Controversy: The article by a former student claiming she was raped turned out to be baseless . 'We are in the spotlight, so we have the opportunity to lead,' she said. She added that while the school's culture was 'generally good' there was room to improve student attitudes on sexuality. Sullivan updated the board on the school's efforts to combat sexual violence, many of which she stressed had been underway years before the Rolling Stone article was published. Those efforts include trying to curb underage drinking; hiring new investigators and counselors; installing new surveillance cameras and improving lighting around campus; and increasing police patrols near where students live.","Rector George K Martin gave most expansive comments since incident .

"LIVERPOOL’S CONFIDENCE CRISIS . The defenders have been a bag of nerves. That comes from the pressure of playing for Liverpool and their run of bad results. Last season Kolo Toure was caught up in a number of mishaps — this from a good defender, one of Arsenal’s Invincibles, but he was misunderstood. Liverpool wanted a vocal leader where Kolo leads through performances. Now he has fought back and is playing like the player we expected. Dejan Lovren should take a leaf out of his book. Lovren was excellent for Southampton but looks a different player in Liverpool red. He was signed to answer their defensive prayers but there was no quick fix, it is all about the group. Brendan Rodgers needs to work hard now to restore his confidence. THE CENTRAL ISSUE . Liverpool are not the only team guilty of this, but too often their full backs don’t tuck in and the centre backs don’t pick up in the box. There are wild clearances and mistimed headers which makes me wonder how often defenders actually practise these things. Goalkeepers spend all week punching and taking crosses —defenders should too. We can be too protective of them when really they need full-blooded training. That way in a match situation you can be confident of clearing your lines. Brendan Rodgers needs to bring a confidence back to his Liverpool side and sort out his defence . The Reds manager needs to select his best XI - last year he had consistency in the team he put out . Liverpool have managed to reach the semi final of the Capital One Cup after beating Bournemouth in midweek . SELECTION HEADACHES . One of Rodgers’s biggest issues has been picking his best XI. Last season you knew his team would be the same for every game. This time there has been too much change. That creates confusion and makes it hard to build confidence. It’s time for Rodgers to back his players and trust the ones he believes in. ARSENAL ARE LOSING TOUCH . A feature of the goals conceded by Arsenal this season is allowing opposition players too much freedom in the box. Defending is all about partnerships and on occasions Per Mertesacker has been too detached from his fellow centre backs. When crosses are put in defenders need to be touch tight with the attackers. Not grappling all over them, but aware of their position and within reach so they can put in a block or a tackle. Arsenal have been too loose with that this season. Arsenal have given away too much space and Per Mertesacker (left) has been detached from fellow defenders . Laurent Koscielny, who has been a big miss for Arsenal this season, visits children at The Whittington Hospital . Alexis Sanchez (left) despairs as Arsenal concede two late goals and lose to Swansea in November . THE MISSING MAN . The absence of Laurent Koscielny has been a big blow for Arsenal. Over the past two or three years he has grown into one of the best all-round defenders in the league. His mobility is his biggest asset and Arsenal have missed his pace. He seeks out danger and snuffs it out. SWITCHING OFF . To keep clean sheets, you have to remain focused at all times. Even if the opposition have a throw, you have to deny them space and make sure their wingers don’t get the ball in to feet. At Swansea, Jefferson Montero was allowed to receive the ball to feet and Calum Chambers had little protection in front of him. It’s all about communication between the full back and the midfield to squeeze the space and make sure nobody switches off, even for a second.","Brendan Rodgers need to restore confidence in his Liverpool side .

"Sony may have done as the hacking group Guardians of Peace wanted and cancelled the release of the upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview, but the leaked emails seem to keep on coming. The latest batch have to do with Adam Sandler, and how much the studio does not care for the star, especially in the wake of his recent string of box office flops. Things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges. Scroll down for video . Friends no more: Amy Pascal  called Adam Sandler (above) an 'a**hole' on two occasions in new leaked emails . Not good: The first time Pascal called Sandler (above with Jennifer Aniston) an a**hole was after a meeting where he wanted to make a movie of the board game Candyland . The emails, obtained by The Daily Beast, first have to do with a film version of Candyland that Sandler wants to do, and his desire for the studio to give him$200million right off the bat to make that film. Pascal is not okay with this. 'Adam is an a**hole and this is more his fault than anyone’s but what we did was not communicate with each other and make assumptions,' Pascal says after the meeting in an email. The studio again seems to have big problems with Sandler when he wants to get more money for his producing partner on the upcoming Hotel Transylvania 2. Bad blood: Pascal again calls Sandler an 'a**hole' when he asks the studio for more money for his producing partner . Sandler reportedly wants Allen Covert, who produces and does voices on the film to get an extra $100,000. Raimo Kouyate, president of production for Sony Pictures Animation, says they will not pay more as they are already at the maximum they pay for executive producers, $500,000. When he tells this to Pascal, she says of Sandler and Covert, 'They are such a**holes.' Luckily, Sandler has left Sony for Netflix where he will now be working on four new films for the online streaming site. He does however have two films left to be released at the studio, Transylvania and the upcoming Pixels, a film about video game experts who fight classic arcade villains when they try to take over New York City.","A new set of emails have been leaked in which Amy Pascal calls Adam Sandler an 'a**hole' not once, but twice .

"Michael van Gerwen was relieved to avoid the biggest upset in World Darts Championship history after coming from a set down to beat Sascha Stein while playing with a toothache. The world No 1 was in trouble when he dropped the first set, and was fortunate to take the second after Stein missed three darts at double top to force a deciding leg in which he had the throw. But the German couldn’t maintain his high standard beyond the first two sets and soon began to tail off, allowing Van Gerwen to take control. Defending champion Michael van Gerwen through to the third round of the PDC World Championship . Sascha Stein took the first set but missed three darts at double top as he failed to take the second . The reigning world champion finished with an average of 99.87 and hit eight 180s in sealing a 4-1 victory to set up a last-16 clash with Terry Jenkins. After his win, Van Gerwen said: ‘I have to go to the dentist at 11 o’clock tomorrow because my tooth broke off while I was on the phone around 1pm. ‘It’s a little bit painful, but it is alright. It is a bit sharp, but I wasn’t sharp tonight. ‘Two years ago I had an infection on my heels, last year I had gout, and now a tooth had broken off so it is a tradition for me. Every year something happens - maybe next year I will break my hand.’ The world champion added: ‘For a qualifier he (Stein) did really well in this tournament, especially in the first two sets against me and put me under pressure.

I’m not playing the next two days and just need to make sure I prepare for the next one against Terry because I lost to him last time.’ Third favourite Gary Anderson, meanwhile, came from 3-1 down to beat Jelle Klaasen in a thrilling final match of the evening. The Scot averaged 103.02 to see off the Dutchman, who himself averaged 100.72, but admitted he thought he was out when he fell two sets behind. Gary Anderson celebrates after beating Jelle Klaasen in the second round of the World Darts Championship . Klaasen was the youngest ever champion when he won the competition in 2006 . He said: ‘The first two sets I played really well and he pinched one. At 3-1 down, I tried speeding up and slowing down because he is a machine when he gets going. ‘At 3-1 down I was gone, but he tired and started to slow down a bit and that suited me. I thought if I could win a set I could make it look good.’ Anderson hit 14 180s in his win over the former BDO world champion, and took out a crucial 126 checkout in the third leg of the final set before closing out the match in the next. One man who didn’t avoid an upset was No 8 seed Dave Chisnall, who was beaten by Benito van de Pas in the first match of Saturday night’s session. Chisnall led twice after taking the first and third sets, but he was powerless to stop an incredible comeback from his Dutch opponent and was beaten 4-2.

"It was a demolition; a day that ‘scarred’ Arsene Wenger and provided the blueprint for how Liverpool’s life under Brendan Rodgers can be. Go back to lunchtime on February 8 this year and you will remember the shock of the events that were unfolding at Anfield. One goal then another quickly followed by two more. In 20 blistering minutes, Arsenal heads were scrambled and Liverpool were catapulting themselves into a title race. So good was the performance, BT made an advert about it: Rio Ferdinand, watching on his iPhone, declares as the fourth goal from Daniel Sturridge speeds in that ‘I can’t believe what I’m watching’; Jose Mourinho, upon hearing the news, remarks with a shake of the head: ‘Unbelievable.’ Last time Arsene Wenger (left) visited Anfield he was 'scarred' by the performance of Brendan Rodgers' team . The intensity of Liverpool's play resulted in Rodgers' side leading 4-0 after just 20 minutes at Anfield . The Anfield scoreboard displays the final score at Anfield where Rodgers' style of football shone through . And it was. Intense, dynamic, a sea of red shirts swarmed all over Arsenal to win 5-1. How Rodgers craves to see his team play that way once more, when the midfield diamond sparkles and everything clicks into place allowing games to be wrapped up before they have started. But without the injured Sturridge and Luis Suarez, now of Barcelona, Liverpool have been unable to play that vibrant style this season; the closest they came to getting within the same vicinity was the 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham in August. Evidently, it is frustrating Liverpool’s manager. He has tried a number of formations to get the campaign up and running and, in the last two matches at Manchester United and Bournemouth, he feels he has found a blend to get Liverpool moving forward - 3-4-3 could finally bring some improvement. Rodgers’ mood on Friday, however, was dark as he held court at Liverpool’s Melwood training retreat. His time with the broadcasters was an unusually short four minutes and 33 seconds, his time was similarly brief when the cameras were off. ‘If you look at the team the other night against Bournemouth, having the pace of Raheem Sterling in the central area of the field was key,’ Rodgers said. ‘First of all, it allows you to press and it means that your game can be much more aggressive. Rodgers' mood was dark on Friday as this season has posed many problems compared to the last campaign . The Liverpool manager's job has even been under threat having dropped to 11th in the Premier League table . Rodgers' side did  the semi final of the Capital One Cup after defeating Bournemouth 3-1 on Wednesday night . Things could have been a whole lot different had Liverpool replaced Luis Suarez with Alexis Sanchez . ‘You press the ball in the high areas of the field and if you looked at us in the opening 20 minutes of games, because of that pressure and suffocation of opponents, we can get the ball back higher up the field. It gives you more chances of a goal if you are winning it higher up the field. ‘I have technical players. They have the skills to deal with the ball in tight areas, but we haven’t had that without Sturridge and Suarez. We brought in Mario Balotelli, who has had an opportunity to play in that pressing role, but that isn’t his game. Rickie Lambert has also come in. ‘He was brought here for a reason and he has great qualities but that pressing isn’t what he does. When you don’t press high up the field, your starting position to attack is much deeper. You cannot break at speed and flood forward like we did last year because we are not that explosive.’ He continued: ‘The other night (at Bournemouth) a British coach playing 3-4-3? People could think he has probably thrown the team together, he has played seven midfielders. If it was a foreign coach? It would probably have been a wonderful tactical idea.’ There was then a shake of the head. Rodgers has been under tremendous scrutiny as Liverpool have failed to live up to expectations and it was impossible not to think how different things might have been had they successfully signed Alexis Sanchez. ‘He was identified for us as someone who would have been a key signing,’ said Rodgers ‘He would have rolled on to what we had with Luis Suarez. So to not get him was bitterly disappointing, but once he was gone that was it. We just had to focus on what we had.’ So did Sanchez make the right decision? ‘It doesn’t matter,’ came the pointed reply. ‘He will probably give you that answer in 20 years. He made his decision. The best option for him.’","Liverpool's 5-1 win over Arsenal in February displayed Rogers' style of play .

"Saracens and Bath are being investigated by Premier Rugby for alleged breaches of the controversial salary cap system which could see them hit with hefty points deductions and fines. Sportsmail has learned an inquiry is under way following ‘whistleblower’ testimony. It appears to substantiate allegations that clubs are flouting rules aimed at maintaining financial stability among top-flight teams. Saracens, backed by a consortium of South African-based businesses, mounted a pre-emptive public relations campaign calling for the abolition of the £5.5million annual cap. They claim it is ‘outdated’ and ‘possibly illegal’. Saracens are facing heavy fines and point deductions over alleged breaches of salary cap regulations . But it has emerged a whistleblower — understood to be a disgruntled player’s agent — has complained to Premier Rugby’s recently appointed salary-cap auditors about the way Saracens structure payments to overseas players. Under scrutiny is how Saracens’ South African players are recompensed, with allegations that payments are routinely made into offshore accounts to avoid the cap. ‘Saracens have been backed into a corner and that’s why they’ve come out and said what they’ve said at this particular time,’ said one source. ‘A whistleblower has dished the dirt. It could be messy.’ The investigation into Saracens is also understood to focus on the deal to bring the former Scotland lock Jim Hamilton to Allianz Park. Bath have also drawn attention to themselves after a number of large offers made to recent targets . Bath have drawn attention because of a number of recent big-money offers made to transfer targets, including Wales and Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland and South Africa back-row star Duane Vermeulen. The recommended sanctions for breaches of the cap are severe. Clubs found guilty of exceeding it by £75,000 face a four-point deduction, but that figures rises to a maximum of 40 points for a breach of more than £250,000. There are possible fines of £3 for every £1 over the cap, rising to £10 per £1 for a third offence, which could see a club incur a potentially crippling £2.5m fine for breaches of over £250,000. The scale of the alleged breaches is yet to be established. Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths said the cap had to go for English teams to compete in Europe . A Premiership Rugby spokesman said: ‘Premiership Rugby cannot comment on whether investigation proceedings are taking place or not. Any such investigation would be done under the salary capping regulations 2013-14.’ Saracens indicated they have the backing of six other Aviva Premiership clubs — although a Sportsmail investigation failed to find significant support. Saracens, widely viewed as a commercial pioneer for English professional rugby, have long since objected to the salary cap. The London club believe the cap is a restraint of trade. They say it hampers clubs’ ability to compete with rich French giants like Toulon and Racing Metro — who this week signed All Black Dan Carter on a deal worth around £800,000 per season. Jonny Wilkinson lifts the Heineken Cup trophy for Toulon, who defeated Saracens 23-6 in the final . Bath have received huge financial backing from their new millionaire owner Bruce Craig in recent seasons. ‘The salary cap has served its purpose,’ said Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths. ‘It would be a pity if the world’s top players light up the World Cup on English soil and then leave to play club rugby in France. 'If the salary cap is left to forbid the required investment, it will kill any hope of growth.’ A Premier Rugby statement read: ‘The salary cap ensures the financial viability of the member clubs and underpins the sustainable growth of the competition for all stakeholders. ‘In addition, the salary cap provides a level playing field for all clubs, ensures a competitive Aviva Premiership Rugby competition, promotes homegrown players and supports the performance of the England team. ‘It allows the recruitment of elite players from other countries through the excluded players provision.’ Saracens’ claim that they have significant support appeared unfounded. Dan Carter, who has just agreed to sign for Racing Metro, chose France over the Aviva Premiership . Exeter chief executive Tony Rowe said: ‘We believe at Exeter that the salary cap should be higher than it is but we don’t think it should be abolished. We’d support it being raised to around £7.5-£8m to put us on a par with a lot of the French clubs.’ Leicester, whose 24,000-capacity Welford Road stadium and large fan-base sees them generate the highest revenues from ticket sales in the Premiership, also appear to be against an abolition. A club insider said: ‘The club is already stretched to the maximum by paying up to the salary cap. There’s no appetite to abolish the cap. It would be disastrous for Tigers.’ Harlequins distanced themselves from Saracens while Wasps are understood to have told Premier Rugby they have no interest in scrapping the cap. Dan Carter will become rugby's highest-paid player in the world when he joins Racing Metro .","Saracens and Bath are being investigated by Premier Rugby .

"Former Barcelona and France defender Eric Abidal has announced he will be retiring from football, with his last match against Kalloni AEL this weekend. The Frenchman joined Greek champions Olympiacos in the summer after spending a second spell at Monaco back in his native France. Abidal revealed he has had offers of non-playing roles with Olympiacos and Barca, the club he was playing for when he suffered a liver tumour in 2011 which affected the latter part of his career. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eric Abidal announces his retirement from football . Eric Abidal will play his final match of his professional career this weekend for Olympiacos . Abidal has played just seven games for his new side, but insists the time is right to retire . The most successful time for Abidal's was with Barcelona, with two Champions League titles the pinnacle . ""I depart for personal reasons, as I have said. Only a professional player knows when and how he has to retire,"" Abidal said. ""I have had a lot of very happy moments in my career. ""Two months ago I talked with the president and told him, 'In December I will leave because the time has come'. ""I will relax with my family and my friends. I have two offers, from Olympiacos and Barcelona, and I will think about these and take my decision."" 2000: Abidal Joins Monaco from amateur side Lyon Duchere in his home city. 2002: Follows boss Claude Puel to Lille, where he stays for two seasons. 2004: Returns home to Lyon and wins three consecutive league titles. 2007: Joins Barcelona for six trophy-ladened years, playing through liver problems. 2013: Returns to Monaco after 11 years. 2014: Joins Olympiacos but plays just seven games before announcing retirement. Abidal began his top-level career in 2000 when he signed for Monaco from French lower-league side OL Duchere. He then joined Lille before moving in 2004 to his hometown club Lyon, helping them win three Ligue 1 titles in succession, as well as reaching the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue final. Further success followed with Barca, with four Spanish titles and Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011, beating Manchester United in the final on each occasion. While those honours - along with helping France to the 2006 World Cup final - feature highly among Abidal's career highlights, he is grateful simply to have had the chance to play professionally both before and after his illness. ""One of the best memories is when you lift a trophy but the best moment is passing from the amateur level to become a professional footballer,"" Abidal added. ""Your dreams are coming true and then you have to work every day to remain a professional player."" Abidal joins fellow countryman Thierry Henry in hanging up his boots this week . Abidal played a key role in what was one of Barcelona's most successful eras in their history . He returned for Barca after his health problems and was given the captain's armband by regular skipper Carles Puyol after the 2011 European final to allow him to lift the trophy. ""It was a very great moment in my career,"" Abidal said of his return to action. ""In football you have positive moments and negative moments and when a negative moment occurs, you have to be determined. March 2011: Barcelona announce news that Abidal has tumour on his liver. May 2011: Plays full 90 mins in CL final win over Man United, and lifts trophy as captain. April 2012: Undergoes liver transplant surgery after problems with previous treatment.

"Millions of New Yorkers ride the subway every day, most of them not bothering to look one another in the eye as they shuffle by lost in thought. A photo exhibit by Danny Lyon called 'Underground: 1966' that the MTA Arts & Design has installed at Atlantic Av-Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn, New York zooms in on the Subway riders of 1966, zooming in on ephemeral moments in an ever-changing city. It will be on display for one year. According to MTA.com Lyons has had a long career as a photographer and filmmaker who documented the civil rights movement of 1962 in the South and was in a motorcycle gang in Chicago. Lost in thought: A woman sits pensively on the subway,clutching her purse in front of one of the underground maps . Just another day: Two women sit side by side looking off to a corner of the train each sporting 1960s style jackets . Sailor: This sailor gazes into the camera as he waits for the New York City Subway to take him to his desired destination . Lyon made his way back to New York in 1966 as his mother advised him. 'If you’re bored, just talk to someone on the subway,' she told him. Lyons took that advice to heart and made it the subject of his art. 'Brooklyn is changing very rapidly and so many newcomers have joined long-time residents among the 40,000 people who use the Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr station every day. ‘Underground: 1966’ is a great opportunity to show them how it used to be, and to show off the work of a ground-breaking photographer who was born in Brooklyn,' said Lester Burg, Senior Manager of MTA Arts & Design. '“Underground: 1966” comprises eight large-scale photographs that show a lone woman standing on the platform; two women bundled up from the elements; a dapper reveller; a lone sailor, and two teenagers waiting on an elevated platform,' says the MTA website. The standstills evoke a feeling that each subject is lost in thought as they travel through the city of millions. 'There is something about taking the work to where the people are that makes for a different viewer connection from visiting a museum to see an exhibit,' said Lyon who expressed his delight with the fact his work can be viewed on the subway. To capture the New York moments, Lyon used a Roliflex camera with Kodak safety film slides. He didn't use a tripod during long exposures so some of the figures appear ghostlike in nature. MTA Arts & Design’s light box project exhibits photography at four locations within the transit system. Vintage look: The trains of 1966 have a vintage feel when compared to the modern Subway system in New York today . Staples of the past: The photograph shows the types of machines that lined the subway back in 1966 and one could get their horoscope . Peekaboo:Two young boys ride the New York Subway in 1966 just a few years after the Civil Rights movement . Read the sign: A woman leans against a sign that reads, 'Do not stand here' back in 1966 on a New York Subway platform .

"Arsene Wenger might feel like his judgment has been criticised at every turn in recent weeks, but no-one has dared to doubt the value of his swoop to beat Liverpool to the signing of Alexis Sanchez. With 14 goals in 24 games since his £30million move from Barcelona, Sanchez has often seemed like the only thing separating Arsenal’s depleted side from the mid-table ordinariness which has plagued Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool since the exit of Luis Suarez. How the teams would have coped if the Chilean had opted for Mersey- side instead of North London will never be known, and Wenger was taking no chances as he turned on the charm during the World Cup, stressing key factors like Arsenal’s style of play and their continuous presence in the Champions League. Arsene Wenger believes Alexis Sanchez chose Arsenal for their style and consistency in Europe . Wenger revealed that he told the former Barcelona player the the style of football Arsenal play would suit him . Brendan Rodgers had also been in the market for Sanchez in the summer but the Chilean chose Arsenal . Sanchez (centre) celebrates with teammates after scoring in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Southampton . Later, he became conscious that Liverpool might steal an edge as they went deeper into the Suarez deal with Barcelona. ‘I thought Liverpool was a serious candidate because they had Suarez going there,’ said Wenger. ‘You could think that’s an easy way to do the deal. It could happen. But, at the end of the day, every great player today has a choice to go where he wants to go. He has chosen us and we are very happy for that. ‘There were other clubs in for him as well. Transfers at that level always take time to get every detail right, so you think always that somebody else can come in, like Paris Saint-Germain or Bayern Munich, to do the deal as well.’ Wenger, who was at the World Cup working for television, added: ‘I met his agent in Brazil a few times and we could talk about the transfer. Former Barcelona star Sanchez (left) escapes Chelsea's John Obi Mikel in the Champions League semi final . Sanchez starred for Chile in the World Cup this summer but was knocked out by hosts Brazil on penalties . Rodgers has been under pressure after losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury . Liverpool did secure a place in the semi final of the Capital One Cup with a midweek win over Bournemouth . ‘I just tried, like every manager, to convince the player that you can help him develop the quality of his game and that the way we play football would suit him. ‘I think that’s why he has chosen us in the end. As well, we have continuity. All the players want to play in the Champions League. It’s quite simple, and we have good continuity on that front.’ Gary Neville claimed earlier this season that Sanchez would have been the ‘ideal replacement’ for Suarez, who scored 31 goals as Liverpool finished runners-up in the Barclays Premier League last season and cost Barcelona £75m. Having missed Sanchez, Liverpool turned to Mario Balotelli, who has yet to score a league goal since his £16m move from AC Milan. After returning from injury, he will miss tomorrow’s game as he serves a one-match ban for a racially offensive Instagram post featuring Super Mario. With Daniel Sturridge injured, Wenger does not fear a repeat of his last trip to Anfield, in February, when his team were four down after 20 minutes and lost 5-1. Wenger compared the situation to Arsenal's attempts to lure Luis Suarez away from Liverpool in 2013 . ‘Liverpool scored over 100 goals last season in the Premier League and they were very good going forward,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘This season they’ve scored 19, so they are not on the same trend offensively. They started off the blocks very strong that day and we were too late to get into the game. ‘Every defeat hurts. Every defeat is a scar in your heart forever. We also have very good memories at Liverpool. We won many games at Liverpool. Even last year, after we lost against them, a week later against the same team we won 2-0 at home in the FA Cup.’ Despite Liverpool’s problems, Wenger refused to rule them out of a top-four finish and was wary of wading into the Balotelli debate. ‘He is a very sensitive subject,’ smiled the Arsenal boss. Why? ‘Because it is an interesting subject.’ Another wry smile, then he added: ‘I don’t know him at all.’ Suarez stayed and scored 33 goals for Liverpool before moving to Barcelona in the summer transfer window . This hardly solved the enigma, but Wenger was more emphatic as he tried to quash the idea that he has also considered signing Balotelli last summer. ‘No, you linked him with me,’ he told reporters. ‘We have the type of presence up front with Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo. We have players of that calibre.’ Sanchez has gone two games without a goal for the first time since September and Arsenal will try to protect him through his first experience of the packed festive schedule, even though he has adapted well to the Premier League. ‘It looks like he is made for the English game,’ said Wenger. ‘He’s settled very quickly, but Sanchez has a kind of game that is instinctive and tough. ‘Last year, we were interested in Suarez and they have similarities. They are South Americans, both provocative players, who run with the ball. They are very determined as well. ‘But the history of every big club is made up of many big players that you missed. I wanted to play Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka together. Maybe if Anelka had stayed Henry would not have become the player he became. Sometimes it’s coincidence that decides your destiny.’","Arsene Wenger says Alexis Sanchez chose Arsenal over Liverpool in the summer because of their style of play and consistency in Europe .

"Former Manchester City Mario Balotelli has used his Twitter account to finally admit he is the father of his baby daughter Pia after a bitter bust up with his ex-partner. Balotelli, 23, used his account to write in English: 'Finally the TRUTH :-) ??...PIA... Sweet child of mine !!! your Dad.' Sources close to Balotelli said the message was in English underlining the fact the baby was conceived in England when he was playing in the Premier League - and also a tribute to his favourite band Guns N' Roses. Proof: Mario Balotelli (pictured left in September 2011) had refused to acknowledge that Pia was his child despite his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico, right, confirming he was . The American rock legends had a hit called Sweet Child O' Mine in the late 1980s and it reached No.6 in the British charts. Initially Balotelli, who now plays for AC Milan, had refused to acknowledge that Pia was his child despite his ex-girlfriend, Italian showgirl Raffaella Fico, 26, confirming he was. The two fought out a bitter and public battle in the Italian media giving interviews with each accusing the other of bad behaviour and cashing in. Announced: Balotelli wrote on his Twitter account that he had finally learned of 'the TRUTH' Joy: Balotelli, left, pictured receiving an award by former Italian player Simone Perrotta last week, told of his joy at being confirmed as his daughter's biological father . In December, Balotelli failed to attend . a paternity hearing in Milan regrading the case and Raffaella then . launched legal action against his parents after they were dragged into . the bitter war of words. Pia . was born in December 2012 and six months earlier she had called . Balotelli while he was playing for Italy in the European Championships . in Poland to tell him he was to be a father. Acknowledgement: Balotelli, pictured in Cagliari last week, has a new role as father . At . first he was said to be delighted but then the couple had their falling . out and he announced that he would take on his role as 'father when . it's proved the child is mine'. She hit back and accused him of being an 'irresponsible father' who was shirking on his duties. As a result Balotelli has not even seen Pia, yet after his announcement he is expected to meet her this weekend when AC Milan travel to Naples - where Raffaella lives - for a league match. She has yet to comment publicly but in another dig aimed at Raffaella, Balotelli posted on his account a few minutes later: 'What was the point of all that wasted time telling lies about me on television and in the newspaper? And what did it achieve?' Raffaella and Balotelli, who left Manchester City in January for AC Milan, split in April 2012 after around 18 months together. They parted after she learned of his womanising ways and she flew to Britain to confront him at his Cheshire home but he refused to see her and police were eventually called. Balotelli has since found new love with model Fanny Neguesha and has posted pictures of the two of them on his Twitter account as well as one showing 'his and hers' football shirts with their names on the back and he has given her a £100,000 diamond engagement ring. Meanwhile in recent weeks Balotelli has been linked with a move back to the Premier League with Jose Mourinho's Chelsea said to be interested.","AC Milan player had refused to acknowledge that Pia was his child .

"Comedian Andy Zaltzman, pictured, made a joke on Radio 5 Live suggesting there could be a referendum about whether the Queen should be beheaded . A guest on BBC radio made an 'outrageous' joke live on air suggesting there should be a referendum to decide whether the Queen should be beheaded. The shocking comment was made by comedian Andy Zaltzman  during the Christian O'Connell Manifesto show on Radio 5 Live. The remark, played out live at 10am on Saturday, came after the high-profile beheadings of three hostages by ISIS militants and prompted a number of complaints to the broadcaster. A video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines - the third western and the first Briton to be beheaded by the extremists - was released on September 14. The first victim, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August. Weeks later, a video showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff was also released by the Jihadist group. Another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, is still being held hostage by the militants. Zaltzman - described at the start of the show as a 'super satirist' - was one of three guests who were invited on the show to discuss the independence vote in Scotland. The debate, which also included presenter Dougie Anderson and comedian Lucy Beaumont, involved Mr O'Connell - who also presents a show on Absolute Radio - asking the guests what else there could be referendums about. Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded. The excerpt has been removed from the repeat of the show on BBC's iPlayer. Listener Becky Robbins, from London, said: 'It was a completely outrageous thing to say, it really is shocking. 'It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but jokes about beheadings are also insensitive and totally inappropriate. The timing could not be worse. 'This was a live broadcast on a Saturday morning. The BBC really needs to look at itself and take much more care.' A blurb about the show on the BBC states that the presenter and his guests 'rant, cajole, debates and discuss how to make things better, tearing up rules and inventing new ones along the way'. The comment was made on the Christian O'Connell Manifesto, a hour-long show presented by Mr O'Connell, pictured, at 10am on a Saturday . It adds: 'This week's Manifesto is a Scottish independence referendum special - now the results are in, how can we make Scotland better?' After the incident, a BBC spokesman said: 'The Christian O'Connell Manifesto is a light-hearted entertainment programme. 'The comment was made by a guest - comedian Andy Zaltzman - and we have received five complaints.'","Andy Zaltzman made joke on Radio 5 Live's Christian O'Connell Manifesto .

"NYPD supporters flooded the streets wearing black hoodies branded with the words 'I CAN breathe' in a sickening pun on Eric Garner's last words. Anti-police protesters adopted the phrase 'I can't breathe' as a rallying call in reference to the moment officer Daniel Pantaleo killed father-of-six Garner in a chokehold. But on Friday night, 100 people hit back at the demonstrations outside City Hall in the controversial customized clothing and confronted anti-cop protesters. Scroll down for video . Controversial: More than 100 people sported these t-shirts to confront demonstrators on Friday night . Twist: The customized shirts twisted Eric Garner's last words, 'I can't breathe', to read 'I can breathe' Facing off against the 200 people crying for justice for Eric Garner, they shouted: 'don't resist arrest'. It comes after an Indiana police officer caused outraged offering t-shirts for sale with the legend 'Breathe Easy: Don't break the law' on the front. The t-shirts were produced by Corporal Jason Barthel of the City of Mishawaka Police in Indiana who owns and operates the South Bend Uniform Company. The t-shirts, which cost from $7.95 are seen as a play on the final words of Eric Garner who died after being restrained by the New York Police Department.

Deep-rooted issues: The failure to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo revealed severe racial divisions in New York . 'Above the law': The crowds slammed police officers for exploiting their role . Garner, who was restrained in a choke-hold after he was spotted selling single cigarettes in New York told officers 'I can't breathe', before slipping into unconsciousness. Corporal Barthel said criticism of his t-shirts is misunderstood. He said on his company's Facebook page: 'For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan ""Breathe Easy"" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you! 'We are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender. We are all in this together. The police are here to protect and serve. 99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts.

The 'I can't breathe' slogan has been used widely across America since Mr Garner's death last month. A number of celebrities, including basketball star LeBron James have worn t-shirt with the slogan. South Bend District Council President Oliver Davis told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that people should be able to breathe easy no matter what they're doing. Police should not take the right to breathe into their own hands.' Commenting on the controversial t-shirt, Mr Davis said: 'It has a strong message to people to let them know that justice is not fair. People need the right to be able to breathe easy no matter where we are in life and the justice system should be the ones to deal with that, not just the police officers.' Adam Duckworth posted on the company's Facebook page criticising the t-shirt. He said: 'This company exploits death, tragedy and ignorance for profit and publicity under the guise of supporting local law enforcers. 'Contrary to the implications of their merchandise, DEATH DOES NOT = JUSTICE. If you bought the ""breathe easy"" shirt, you are basically agreeing that appropriate use of force when dealing with any and all petty criminals and even remotely ""suspicious"" people is to skirt the justice system entirely via immediate deployment of the death penalty.'","More than 100 police supporters accosted demonstrators in the t-shirts .

"The world's only known albino gorilla looked the way he did because of inbreeding, a new study has claimed. A vial of frozen blood taken from Snowflake the gorilla - who lived at Barcelona Zoo for 40 years until his death in 2003 - discovered he inherited the gene from his parents. After tracing this gene, Spanish scientists discovered his parents were closely related - sharing 12 per cent of their DNA - which suggests they were uncle and niece. Snowflake was born with albinism - a genetic mutation that causes a loss of colour pigments in skin and hair. He lived for 40 years before dying of skin cancer in 2003. Spanish scientists have discovered that his albino gene was . inherited from this parents, who shared 12 per cent of DNA suggesting they were uncle and niece . Snowflake's celebrity status was enhanced when he featured on the Basement Jaxx album Rooty in 2001 . Snowflake was famous for being the only known albino gorilla in the world. A western lowland gorilla, he lived at the zoo until his death from skin cancer in 2003. He was born in the wild with albinism - a genetic mutation that caused him to lack colour pigments in his skin and hair - but was captured by villagers in Equatorial Guinea in 1966. His iconic colouring also put him on the cover of Basement Jaxx's 2001 album, Rooty. Before he died, a vial of blood was taken and frozen to preserve it and the genome was sequenced in 2012. As reported in the journal BMC Genomics, the researchers, led by Tomas Marques-Bonet at the University of Pompeu Fabra, in Spain, were then able to take this sequencing and compare it to non-albino gorilla genomes to find the cause of his genetic mutation. The scientists isolated Snowflake's albinism to a single gene called SLC45A2. Snowflake inherited this mutation directly from his parents and when the researchers delved further into the DNA of his mother and father they discovered stretches of Snowflake's DNA from both parents were identical. They were able to determine that his mother and father shared 12 per cent of their DNA and concluded that this likely made them uncle and niece. Albinism is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin, hair and eyes. Snowflake was born in the wild but was captured by villagers in Equatorial Guinea in 1966. He then spent the rest of his life in Barcelona Zoo, until his death in 2003 . Albinism comes from the Latin word albus which means for 'white'. It is also known as achromia. Albinism is a is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin, hair and eyes. It is caused by a lack of tyrosinase in their genes - an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Melanin is what causes skin colour and an increase in melanin is what causes skin to tan. A . human or animal with complete absence of melanin is called an albino, . while someone with only a small amount of melanin is called an albinoid. Lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers. Snowflake the albino gorilla died of skin cancer in 2003. It is caused by a lack of tyrosinase  - an enzyme involved in the production of melanin, which is what causes skin colour and an increase in melanin is what causes skin to tan. A human or animal with complete . absence of melanin is called an albino, while someone with only a small . amount of melanin is called an albinoid. Lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers, which is what killed Snowflake a decade ago. The findings are the first evidence of interbreeding in western lowland gorillas. However Marques-Bonet told LiveScience that some gorilla subspecies with small populations will mate with each other to preserve the species, or due to a lack of options. The study concludes: 'We envision that the analysis of whole genome data of endangered species will be a standard in future conservation and management studies and will make available relevant information that has been missed in previous studies.' Spanish scientists were able to isolate the cause of Snowflake's albinism using genome sequencing. As shown in the left-hand chart, the SLC45A2 was the prominent gene that Snowflake had which the non-albino gorillas Kamlah and Kwan didn't. The right-hand chart shows where these genes overlapped in each gorilla .","Snowflake the albino gorilla inherited the gene that caused him to be born without colour pigments in his skin and hair .

"Louis van Gaal is expected to be appointed as the new manager of Manchester United before next Wednesday, according to a Dutch football expert. Thyce Sleggers was speaking on talkSPORT about the possible arrival of the Holland manager at Old Trafford. And he claims that Van Gaal is keen to sign on at Old Trafford before the Dutch begin their 'first trials' for this summer's World Cup. Imminent? Thyce Sleggers says Louis van Gaal will be appointed Manchester United manager in the next week . Preparations: Van Gaal has a World Cup to focus on with the Netherlands and won't want to be distracted . 'It's not signed, but I expect it will be done before next Wednesday (first trial stage for World Cup),' Sleggers said. 'It must be done before he starts.' 'I know Van Gaal well and I'm sure he won't want to hear United's name after his preparations kick-off.' With club captain Nemanja Vidic leaving for Inter Milan this summer, one key decision Van Gaal may have to make if given the role is deciding who should lead the team. Wayne Rooney is the favourite to take on the armband, though Sleggers revealed that Van Gaal is much closer to United striker Robin van Persie - who he made Holland skipper - than first thought. 'Van Gaal and Van Persie are big friends. In the last month, they visited a few top Dutch league games, and next to him was Van Persie. 'The wives, Truus and Bouchra, shop together in London. The two families are truly getting along very well.' Ryan Giggs is the current interim manager at United after David Moyes was sacked last week and led his team to a 4-0 win over Norwich in his first game in charge.

"Organisers of England's match against Italy appear to have tried to cover up dry grass at the Arena Amazonia by painting the brown patches green. On Wednesday pictures emerged of the Manaus surface in a shocking condition thanks to over-fertilisation. The grass was dry and brown patches scarred the surface, which will play host to England versus Italy on Saturday night. VIDEO Scroll down for Gary Cahill: We are as prepared as possible for the Italy game . Cover up: Ground staff appear to spray green paint on to patchy areas of the pitch at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus, where England are set to play Italy in their opening World Cup match on Saturday night . Green and serene: Members of the ground staff walk up and down the penalty area spraying the pitch . Spray and play: A member of the ground staff treats the pitch in an attempt to remove a barren patch . Treatment: Ground staff prepare to paint the lines and spray the pitch as they try to rescue the surface . On Thursday evening, despite an overnight thunderstorm, brown lines and patches were still visible. A man with a cannister on his back appeared in the morning spraying what looked to be paint on the affected areas. FIFA refused to comment on the idea that the brown patches had been painted, but they did confirm the pitch had undergone 'treatment' ahead of Saturday's first Group D match in the northern city, which is located in the Amazon rainforest. A FIFA spokesperson said: 'The pitch in Manaus has been undergoing treatment in preparation for the FIFA World Cup. Over the last three months, mitigation procedures have been put in place and there continues to be, significant improvement. Barren: A close-up of one of the penalty areas at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus just two days before England play italy there in their opening World Cup encounter . Bumpy: England and Italy may struggle to make headway in this penalty box, which has been covered in strips of sand . Waiting for action: The Arena da Amazonias will host four games at the World Cup, starting with England vs Italy . No diving: This close-up of the six yard box suggests the goalkeepers may find making saves a little uncomfortable . Replacement: Turf is piled up outside the Arena da Amazonia . Mudbath: A large puddle of rainwater on the approach to the stadium in Manaus . 'Pitch experts from FIFA and the LOC (Local Organising Committee) are satisfied that the pitch will be ready for training and the matches, and have been based in Manaus to ensure that all proper procedures are in place.' The Football Association said earlier this week that it had asked FIFA for updates on the situation. One of England's backroom staff visited the stadium on Thursday to have a look at the surface. In a fresh twist to the pitch debacle, the international players' union FIFPro condemned the state of the pitch at the £173million stadium, which holds 39,118 people. 'The players deserve a quality playing surface and conditions that reflect what is meant to be the world's premier football event. This is simply not the case in Manaus,' a FIFPro statement read. 'Nobody wants to see the players and the spectacle in general suffer.' Messy: Rubbish and debris is strewn outside the entrance to the arena in Manaus . Colourful: All looks fine from the exterior view at the Arena Amazonia . England landed in Manaus on Thursday ahead of their first Group D match. Temperatures exceeded 30 degrees centigrade and humidity levels touched 60 per cent. The same conditions are expected on Saturday. FIFPro is concerned that players' welfare will be put at risk during the World Cup, despite the fact that drinks breaks can be introduced if temperatures exceed 32 degrees Celsius. On our way: Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart lead the England players across the tarmac to their plane as they head to Manaus . 'FIFPro's concerns stretch to parts of Brazil, including Manaus, where heat and humidity can reach dangerous levels at this time of year,' the statement continued. 'Putting a player in harm's way is shockingly irresponsible and not how the game ought to be run. 'Cooling breaks are important - but when and how often they're introduced during a match is also open to interpretation in order to ensure optimal protection for the players.'","Workers at Arena da Amazonia in Manaus tried to cover up dry grass by painting brown patches green .

"A paeodphile teacher at a school attended by BBC journalist Robert Peston was allowed to run a hockey club for a year after his arrest, it emerged last night. Andy Adams, 69, was held by police in August 2012 after a former pupil revealed he was regularly taken to the PE teacher’s house for sex. But officers and council officials deliberately chose to keep details of the abuse under wraps until Adams was sentenced. Worries: Mr Peston, the BBC's economics editor, expressed concern over secrecy surrounding the abuse . Because of the secrecy, the pervert was able to stay on as chairman of the Winchmore Hill and Enfield Hockey Club until September 2013. The club has a number of adult teams but also coaches children from the age of eight. At a club meeting in March 2013, Adams describes how the young players were doing well. His personal details – including his email address – remained on Enfield Council’s website as the main contact for the club until May this year. It remains unclear whether the club or Enfield Council knew about his arrest before he retired from the hockey club. Both declined to comment last night. The news comes a day after Mr Peston, the BBC’s economics editor, expressed concern over the secrecy surrounding abuse by his old gym teacher, who was jailed for 12 years last month for repeatedly sexually assaulting a boy under 16 in the 1980s. A child protection expert has now launched an independent inquiry into the handling of allegations against Adams, who worked at Highgate Wood School in North London for over 30 years and was also assistant head. His victim has questioned why Haringey Council – which was also at the centre of the Baby P scandal – kept the abuse secret from parents for months after the claims came to light. Questions: Haringey council has come under the spotlight for not altering children's parents to concerns about Adams as soon as they came to light . It was not until he was sentenced that current Highgate Wood headmaster Patrick Cozier informed parents about the case in a letter. He said Adams retired from the school in 2004, but failed to mention that he had continued to visit for about four weeks each year until 2010 to help arrange work experience placements for students. Liz Morris, the Lib Dems’ lead member for children on Haringey Council, said there was ‘no reason for months of secrecy’ after Adams’ arrest. ‘Indeed, there were many reasons for Haringey Council to be open – importantly, to allow others who could have been abused to come forward,’ she added. ‘The letter sent to parents seemed deliberately evasive, implying Adams had had no contact with the school since 2004, when in fact, he had been working with pupils until 2010, although not as a teacher.’ Scotland Yard confirmed it has received several calls about the school since the case, but has launched no new investigations. Haringey Council said it was shocked about the ‘appalling’ case. A spokesman added: ‘We take our responsibility for safeguarding very seriously and work closely with all of our schools to ensure good awareness of safeguarding and robust procedures for reporting and investigating any concerns that may arise.’","Andy Adams, 69, was arrested in August 2012 after revelation from ex-pupil .

"Former pupils of a paeodphile teacher who allegedly abused up to 60 boys at a leading private school spoke last night of their shock at learning of his depraved lifestyle. William Vahey, 64, is said to have held a . ‘cookie race’ at bedtime in which children as young as ten were . encouraged to eat as many as they could, unaware they had been drugged. Once the pupils passed out, some were assaulted. Details of the calculating schemes of the predator emerged as the extent of his offending became clear yesterday. Vahey, pictured with his wife Jean, killed himself at a US motel last month as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008 . The revelations prompted 'complete shock' in Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela. She said: 'It’s so sad, and it’s the first time where I’ve thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy.’ She said she remembered Vahey as being a 'nice, shy sort of guy', but that her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the possibility they were his victims. Document: An FBI affidavit revealed the extent of Vahey's crimes around the world . FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward since news broke yesterday that the married American had taken pictures of himself attacking up to 60 sleeping students from the elite Southbank International School in Westminster during class trips abroad between 2009 and 2013. The sickening images depicted children aged ten to 14 at the international school, where he taught history and geography and led trips to Jordan, Nepal and Venezuela. Another 30 children, who also appeared to be unconscious or asleep when the assaults took place, were pictured from other schools he worked in during a 40-year career spent teaching at ten American international schools in nine countries. Southbank International School, which is favoured by diplomats and foreign executives, has 758 pupils and charges fees of £25,000 a year. Vahey committed suicide at a motel in the US last month as the FBI were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing the graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008. The father of two plunged a knife into his chest two days after confessing that he had abused boys throughout his life using sleeping pills. Police later removed items from his £1.8million apartment in Maida Vale, west London, where he is alleged to have kept large amounts of sleeping pills. Miss Salmon, now a broadcast journalism student in London, was 11 when she enrolled at the elite English-language international school Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas where her father was working for oil giant Halliburton. She told Sky News the revelations about the popular American history and geography teacher had come as a ‘complete shock’. It has been claimed Vahey would sprinkle crushed sedatives into Oreo cookies and feed them to his pupils . A former student taught by Vahey at the Jakarta International School in Indonesia in the 1990s, who did not want to be named, told the Mail she could not reconcile the ‘great teacher’ with the predatory monster now revealed. Yesterday a British mother of two, whose teenage sons went on several school trips with Vahey, said he used to hand out Oreo cookies and tell pupils that they could be the lead character in his bedtime story if they won the cookie race. The mother, who did not wish to be identified, said he ‘groomed’ pupils and parents: ‘The boys would sit around and were handed Oreos. He would tell them to go and he would drop his hand to start the race. Spanning the years, and the globe: William Vahey, pictured, committed suicide after allegedly confessing to molesting young boys 'my whole life' ‘Then the first one who had the Oreo, the higher up they would be in the story and so on. He would have been able to split the Oreos apart, ground up the stuff and sprinkle it in the middle.’ The mother was once a friend of Vahey and his wife Jean, 66, who is the executive director of the European Council of International Schools. An FBI affidavit obtained by the Daily Mail showed how he catalogued the abuse by time and location in folders on a USB memory stick entitled ‘Panama trip’, ‘Costa Rica trip’ and ‘Basketball trip’ and ‘Spring 2013’. The document says: ‘These images depict minor males in various states of undress... The minor males appear to be asleep, unconscious or possibly drugged.’ Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images. She was sacked but later passed the USB stick to administrators at the American School in Managua, who dismissed Vahey after recognising his hand in the images. Vahey taught at the elite £25,000-a-year Southbank International School in Westminster, London, pictured, right up until last year . In 1970, while studying for a teaching degree, Vahey was jailed for 90 days after pleading guilty to molesting boys at a swimming pool where he was working as an instructor in California. He was required to register as a sex offender for life, but after graduating from college in 1972 failed to sign the register. In 2010 an inspection report had warned of a weakness in staff vetting measures at Southbank International, but Sir Chris Woodhead, chairman of the governors said yesterday that it was ‘irrelevant’ in Vahey’s case as he was not on the sex offender’s register. Sir Chris said there had never been a complaint against Vahey, although there was one incident where a boy was ill on a trip and Vahey took the boy into his room to look after him. A school investigation subsequently found ‘nothing untoward’.","William Vahey, 64, allegedly abused up to 60 boys at leading private school .

"A drunk Ford Transit driver was racing a car in a scene witnesses likened to 'The Fast and the Furious' films when he mounted the kerb and killed a 16-year-old girl, an inquest has been told. Grandfather Stephen Tilbury, 51 - who also died in the crash - had drunk four pints of beer in less than an hour before getting behind the wheel of his van in Dagenham, Essex on June 28 last year. Tilbury was almost three times the drink-drive limit and had started swerving wildly while racing an unidentified silver car when he suddenly lost control and crashed into beauty student Lauren Brown. Tragic: Grandfather Stephen Tilbury (left) had drunk four pints of beer in less than an hour before crashing into beauty student Lauren Brown (right) in Dagenham, Essex on June 28 last year . Witness Barbara Walker told the inquest she had been driving behind Tilbury at the time of the crash. 'He was swerving and he and a silver car started overtaking each other', she said. 'It was like The Fast and the Furious,' Ms Walker added. Investigating officer PC Alex Hewitt of the Metropolitan Police said both deaths could have been prevented if Tilbury had been driving inside the 30mph speed limit. Miss Brown, who had been studying health and beauty at Havering College in nearby Hornchurch, was walking less than half a mile from her home in Crow Lane, Dagenham when she was knocked down at around 10pm on a Friday night last June. Tilbury, from Romford in Essex, was driving home from nearby Crowlands Heath Golf Club when his van hit a kerb at more than 40mph. PC Hewitt said Tilbury's Transit bounced 'like a billiard ball' across the road and crashed into the teenager as she walked on the path. Miss Brown was rushed to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel but died around three hours later at 12.50am as a result of severe bruising to her brain. Tribute: Since the crash, flowers and messages from grieving friends and family have been left at the scene . After crashing into the student, Tilbury careered through a fence before plunging down an embankment. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene. Speaking at the inquest, Miss Brown's mother Karen Armstrong said her daughter had a 'strong, bubbly personality.' Mrs Armstrong said she was a 'beautiful, family-orientated girl who had everything to live for'. 'Lauren was always smiling... Everybody loved her and she loved her friends,' Mrs Armstrong added. Senior East London coroner, Nadia Persaud, recording her narrative verdict, said it was possible diabetes-sufferer Tilbury had blacked out due to low blood sugar levels but it was 'not a probability.' Detective Sergeant Helen Lambert, the leading investigating officer, said Tilbury would have been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and driving under the influence of alcohol had he survived. Since the crash, flowers and messages from grieving friends and family have been left at the scene. Reckless: Witnesses likened Tilbury's drunken race with the unidentified silver car to a scene from the film The Fast and the Furious (pictured) - which features illegal street racing . Miss Brown's best friend, Molly Galvin-Law, 17, said 'Everyone loved Lauren. If you were feeling down, she would be there to cheer you up. 'I have spent almost every day with her for the past seven years. I don't know what I'm going to do without her... I can't believe this has happened,' she added. Tilbury left his wife Linda as well as his two children and three grandchildren. Tilbury's daughter Louise said after his death: 'He was a loved husband, dad, and grandad. We are absolutely devastated by his death... We are also grieving for the young girl's family.' In a poignant message left at the scene of the crash, Tilbury's wife Linda wrote: 'So, so sorry that your life has been taken so young. A double tragedy. Hope you both get to heaven together and he can tell you what happened - cos I don't know why.'","Grandfather Stephen Tilbury, 51, drunk four pints before getting into van .

"Rio Ferdinand was given a warm reception on his return to Old Trafford but endured a miserable afternoon against his former club. The 35-year-old spent 12 years with Manchester United, who made him the world's most expensive defender when they signed him for £30million from Leeds in 2002. Despite recently criticising the club over the way they handled his summer departure, Ferdinand was given a warm reception by United's players and fans as Sir Bobby Charlton presented him with a pre-match gift.

Unfortunately for Ferdinand, that was as enjoyable as his afternoon got. Angel di Maria scored his first goal for the club before Ander Hererra repeated his team-mate's feat. Wayne Rooney then added a third before half-time. While the former Leeds defender could not shoulder all of the blame for QPR's porous defence, he undeniably played his part in a collectively poor defensive display. A second half goal from Juan Mata then compounded the miserable afternoon, and this time Ferdinand's age was on show as his poor positioning played Spaniard on side.

"Tens of thousands of people could be helped to buy newly-built homes worth up to £500,000 after the Government said it would use £1billion of taxpayers’ money to ensure they get mortgages with just a 5 per cent deposit. Prime Minister David Cameron today launched a scheme that is designed to guarantee risky mortgages for all home buyers in a bid to kickstart the flagging property market. The move heralds the return of 5 per cent deposits rather than the 20 per cent typically demanded by lenders since the credit crunch. It could save buyers £34,000 on the average house. But MPs were warned that the NewBuy scheme, which could allow people to put as little equity as £11,000 into a £228,000 house, could spark another credit crisis. Help: David Cameron, seen meeting aspiring home owners today, launched the NewBuy Scheme to enable such couples to buy homes with a deposit of 5 per cent, rather than the 20% figure most have to find . Labour MP David Crausby said that by . allowing  may reinflate the housing bubble which burst at the start of . the financial crisis. Once again this could lead to banks . repossessing homes and families being forced from their houses as they . failed to make repayments, the member for Bolton North East said. During a Commons debate, he said: . 'While we all want house building to get moving again and get first-time . buyers on the housing ladder, is it not true that 95% mortgages and . even higher were what went wrong with the housing market in the first . place? 'Won't any attempt to artificially prop up house building with Government subsidy just come back and bite us?' Laura and John Concanon are typical of thousands of homeowners who find themselves unable to move up the housing ladder. The . couple, pictured below, bought their two-bedroom terrace home in Epping, Essex, in . August 2007, and while they have been happy there, Laura, 33, a vet, and . John, 34, a civil servant, would like more room for a growing family. They have a son, 22-month-old Finn, as well as a dog and a cat. Laura . says: ‘We paid just under £250,000 for this house, but similar . properties are on the market for about £230,000 to £235,000. ‘When . you factor in moving costs and how much we’d have to pay to move up to a . three-bedroom home, even in a cheaper area, we’d need to have a deposit . and moving fund of about £50,000. And at the moment, saving that sort . of sum is completely out of our reach.’ Hollingworth . says: ‘If you are stuck in this position, your first step should be to . talk to your present lender and see what it might be prepared to do.’ Some . lenders might relax their borrowing limits slightly if they are dealing . with a customer who has a good record of repayments. Others have a . range of incentives aimed at trapped homeowners. Lloyds . runs an equity support scheme for existing borrowers, including those . with Halifax and Cheltenham & Gloucester mortgages. Under the NewBuy scheme, which is . open to aspiring as well as actual home owners, the Government will . stump up 5.5 per cent of the value of a mortgage on a home worth up to . £500,000. And the housebuilder will put up 3.5 . per cent to help guarantee mortgage lenders against any losses and . stimulate a wave of fresh lending. Buyers would still be required to . come up with the 5 per cent deposit and pay off the full loan in time - . worth up to 95 per cent of the value of their home. But if they defaulted, the house builders' and Government's money would be kept by the lender. Barclays, . Nationwide Building Society and NatWest Home Loans said they are ready . to start lending under the scheme, while Santander aims to make products . available by the middle of the year and Halifax is expected to follow . suit. Barratt Developments . said the scheme is already proving popular and nearly 20,000 people have . registered interest on its website. Currently, most prospective buyers . are expected to have saved twice their annual income to have enough cash . to put down a 20 per cent deposit -worth £45,665 on an average £228,385 . house. But, if lenders will provide a mortgage with a 5 per cent deposit, they would only need to have saved £11,419. However, the project, which could help up to 100,000 people, has been derided by . critics as a gimmick that will help the construction industry rather . than struggling home buyers. They say such deals are pointless . unless they are cheaper than other 95 per cent mortgage offers that are - . despite most deals vanishing after the  credit crunch - open to some . bank customers. Dominik Lipnicki, of Your Mortgage Decisions, said: 'You can already . obtain 95 per cent mortgages with comparable interest rates of 5 per cent plus. 'It's more of a gimmick. It's a great headline and it will help some but . mainly the construction industry. 'All this will do is encourage people to . buy new properties but old property won't be sold and the chain will stop.' Also, there are fears that a . widespread return to home buyers requiring only 5 per cent deposits . could trigger another crash if currently low interest rates were to rise . significantly. Before the credit crunch, loans of up to 125 per cent of home value were possible. Jonathan Samuels, . CEO of Dragonfly Property Finance, said: ‘The Government's NewBuy . guarantee scheme, like many such schemes over the years, smacks of . desperation. ‘The property market will come back when it is ready to come back and schemes like this are mere tinkering around the edges. ‘If the Government thinks this scheme will kickstart the property market then it is in Cloud Cuckoo Land. ‘The concern is that NewBuy is intrinsically leveraged, and we know where leveraging got us in the past. ‘People should buy when they are genuinely in a robust position to do so, not because a bank says they can buy.’ Housing minister Grant Shapps said criteria for lending were much stricter since the credit crisis. He added: 'The problem was sub-prime lending, not 95 per cent mortgages, which operated perfectly well in this country for many decades. 'The problem was lending to people who simply couldn't afford to pay back the mortgages.' Separately, . two million occupants of social housing will be offered subsidies of up . to £75,000 in the biggest extension of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship . right-to-buy policy for decades. Drop: The graph shows how the number of new houses being built has plummeted since the credit crunch . Ministers say that for every home . sold, the Government will provide a new ‘affordable’ home, the majority . of which are expected to be newly built. As well as helping buyers to get into . the market, the scheme is intended to support 50,000 jobs in . construction and related industries. The Prime Minister said: ‘Strong . families and stable communities are built from good homes. That’s why I . want us to build more homes and I want more people to have the chance to . own their own home. ‘We are acting today across the board to make this happen. ‘We’re re-booting the right to buy scheme to increase discounts for two million tenants in social housing in England. ‘And we’re delivering on our promise . to offer affordable mortgages to buyers who might otherwise not be able . to raise the money to buy a newly-built home. It’s no good hoping people . will climb the property ladder if the bottom rung is missing. Affordable properties and available mortgages are vital.’ Chancellor George Osborne will use his . Budget later this month to signal a major housebuilding programme, with . plans for around 500,000 new homes and a relaxation of planning laws. The right-to-buy scheme was . introduced by Baroness Thatcher in 1980, but Labour put the brakes on . the programme when it came to power. Currently right-to-buy . discounts are capped at £16,000 in most of London, and £38,000 in other . parts of the country. Under the Government’s plans, they are expected to . be doubled. Currently, banks are reluctant to lend more than 75 per cent of a property’s value, . so the Government has had to underwrite the risk to persuade them to . take part. Following in her footsteps:  David Cameron has pledged to 'reboot' Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy scheme by offering council tenants discounts of up to £75,000 . But under the NewBuy scheme, the deals mean that rather than typical buyers saving a £40,000 deposit, they will now only need £10,000. Jack . Dromey, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: ‘Today’s announcement . is too little too late, but at least it’s something from a Government . that has done virtually nothing to tackle the worst housing crisis in a . generation.’","£1bn of taxpayers' cash to be used to guarantee loans for new-build homes .

"Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has today denied allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series. In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. The allegations, reported in the Mirror, come just weeks after Clarkson was accused of racism over referring to a 'slope' on a bridge in an episode filmed in Thailand. Scroll down for video . Contrast: Mr Clarkson, pictured above using the 'N' word in an unused scene in Top Gear, was not sacked . But Mr Clarkson this morning took to Twitter to deny the allegations, telling his 3.29m followers: 'I did not use the n word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time.' According . to the Mirror, Clarkson uttered the n-word during filming of the third . episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota . GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount. Telling . viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the . two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting . rhyme. David Cameron today distanced himself from Jeremy Clarkson, a fellow member of the exclusive 'Clipping Norton set'. The two men are often seen together at events in Oxfordshire. But today Downing Street sought to prevent being dragged into the row over the n-word. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'Usage of that word would be quite wrong. If there are reports and allegations I am sure that is something the BBC would want to look at.' Asked if the PM would use the n-word, he added: 'Certainly not.' Audio forensic . experts studied the clip and confirmed to the newspaper that, in their view, Clarkson . had used the word, which is deemed highly offensive. In the version of the show which aired in February 2013 he was heard to say 'teacher'. Legal . experts have said that if the presenter used the word, he could have breached equality . legislation, depending on the context in which the word was used and . whether a crew member had been offended by what was said. 'If it had been brought to the attention . of the police they would have considered whether an offence had taken . place and whether it was in the public interest to prosecute,' said . solicitor Lucy Scott Moncrief. 'All . employers and programme makers have policies on discrimination and I . would have thought that this kind of language would have been a breach . of those and could have led to disciplinary action.' A BBC spokesman said the corporation wanted to establish the facts before commenting. MailOnline has also contacted Mr Clarkson's agent but there has not yet been a response. Clarkson was also accused of racism after he tweeted a picture of his black . West Highland terrier and revealed he had named it after Ivory Coast . footballer Didier Drogba. Last week the . executive producer of Top Gear admitted Clarkson . had called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction . of a bridge in Thailand during an episode. There was outcry when he used the word, a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, during the show's two-part Burma special, screened in March this year. Producer Andy Wilman said he regrets the . 'light-hearted' wordplay and realises 'that it can be considered . offensive to some here and overseas'. Mr Wilman made the . statement after Indian-born actress Somi Guha instructed lawyers to make . a formal complaint about the use of the word, which she described as . 'casual racism'. 'When we used the word ‘slope’ in the . recent Top Gear Burma Special it was a light-hearted word play joke . referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man . who was crossing it,' he said. Last night, Clarkson put out a contrite statement that he 'loathed' the N-word and would never, ever, use it . Chelsea fan Jeremy Clarkson pictured as his team played Atletico Madrid in the Champions League second leg semi-final on Wednesday night . This is not the first time that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments. In March, Indian-born actress Somi Guha, 36, threatened to sue the BBC for up to £1million after Mr Clarkson allegedly used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - in the Top Gear Burma special. In . the series finale, the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and . Jeremy Clarkson - are tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai . in Thailand. After . completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope . on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge. A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action. On . April 21, Jeremy Clarkson was accused of racism yesterday for naming . his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea . star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast. Clarkson, . who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name . our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’ Clarkson later used his Twitter account . to respond to the allegation, and said: 'I'm not a racist. I am . currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales.' In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in . front of their families'. Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'. In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson . wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the . ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains. He went on: 'We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word 'slope' is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA. 'If we had known that at the time we would not have broadcast the word in this context and regret any offence caused.' In the show, presenters Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May build a makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. As the challenge came to a conclusion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment – but there’s a slope on it.' Richard Hammond replies: 'You’re right, it’s definitely higher on that side.' At the same time, an Asian man is seen walking across the bridge towards the two presenters. Ms Guha, 36, later claimed that broadcasting Clarkson's comment amounted to unlawful discrimination by a public body. Her lawyers, Equal Justice, claimed her . action could cost the BBC £1 million in punitive damages under equality . laws unless it apologised and took the hit motoring show off the air. They said . she was one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and so . sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism . allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother. Clarkson . later used his Twitter account to respond to the allegation, and said: . 'I'm not a racist. I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives . quite near Wales.' Today James May, who features on Top Gear with Mr Clarkson, tweeted his support for his colleague. After news of the controversy broke, Mr May - also known as Captain Slow - wrote: 'Jeremy Clarkson is not a racist. He is a monumental bellend and many other things, but not a racist. I wouldn't work with one.' He then used the hashtag #ThatIsAll to make his point. Richard Hammond, who also works on the show with Mr Clarkson, echoed Mr May's statement. On Twitter earlier today, he wrote: 'I 2nd May's comments re Clarkson. I can list a million things wrong with him, but he is absolutely not racist. An idiot, yes.' Earlier this month, Mr Clarkson was also criticised after tweeting the picture of the dog, named Didier Dogba. He asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’ Twitter . user Gbolade Oguntomole said: ‘It’s racist man! Casual racism! You . should be ashamed of yourself. I like you Jeremy Clarkson but this is . wrong!’ Others, . however, defended the television host, saying that the name was funny . and labelling Clarkson a racist was an over-reaction. Last week the executive producer of Top Gear admitted Clarkson had called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode . Clarkson recently hit back at Twitter users who accused him of racism after he tweeted a picture of his black West Highland terrier and revealing he had named it after Ivory Coast footballer Didier Drogba .","Top Gear presenter reportedly used term in unaired footage .

"Cristiano Ronaldo was an isolated figure, and here is his heat map . Another spell-binding afternoon to further light up this thrill-a-minute World Cup. In the end, though, it is hard to conclude that this one taught us much we didn’t already know. Germany remain the consummate tournament team. When weren’t they? This was their seventh consecutive victory in opening matches at the World Cup. On five of those occasions they have scored four goals. Really, we should not be surprised. Portugal, meanwhile, are a skittish collection of individuals. Some are talented and some really are not. It was ever thus. At the heart of their ordinary defence is Real Madrid’s thuggish Pepe. Sent off here, we may not see him again this tournament and we shall not miss him. VIDEO Scroll down to see Muller does demolition job on Portugal .

Referee: Milorad Mazic (Serbia) Match ratings by IAN LADYMAN . It appears Cristiano Ronaldo’s dream . year will not be capped by a rampage across Brazil. He was modest at . best yesterday but it was hard to blame him. Any talent — no matter how . divine — needs a platform on which to function. He . is a diamond surrounded by some pretty ugly rocks and even if Portugal . do recover to beat USA and Ghana it is hard to imagine them moving . beyond the last 16. That . cannot be said of Germany. This was a remarkable performance on a . devastatingly hot day. Certainly they were helped by Pepe’s dismissal, . delivered by Serbian referee Milorad Mazic for a mindless butt on Thomas Muller. Portugal manager Paulo Bento appeared to question the referee’s objectivity in deciding to send Pepe off. That was rubbish. Germany . were already two goals to the good by that time, anyway. All Pepe’s act . of madness did was allow them to ease off a little with almost an hour . left to play. Such was the . German superiority that Sami Khedira was able to play 90 minutes when . the plan had been to take him off after 45. He was superb — so, too, . Mario Gotze and, of course, Muller. Germany . played with purpose and identity. As he did four years ago, Joachim Low . — their splendidly understated coach — appears to have brought them to . the start line in prime condition. Not much in it: Thomas Muller (left) is caught by Pepe's flailing arm duirng the first half . Over-reaction: Muller goes over the top after being caught by Pepe's flailing arm .

Squaring up: Muller angrily reacts after the Portugal defender's act of violence . Off you go: Pepe (second right) is sent off as Muller (left) is held back by team-mate Toni Kroos . Early . on, Portugal briefly threatened. One scamper down the left by Ronaldo . allowed Hugo Almeida to shoot tamely at Manuel Neuer, while another . break saw the Portugal captain drive in a low effort. Bento’s team never seemed to settle across their own back line, however, and they almost gifted Germany the lead very early on. A . back pass which Pepe played without looking took goalkeeper Rui . Patricio away from his line. When his hurried, scuffed clearance landed . at Khedira’s feet 35 yards from goal, the Real Madrid midfielder struck . the ball first time only to see it pass outside the post by a few . inches. Soon afterwards came . Germany’s opening goal. Perhaps Gotze was leaning in to Joao Pereira a . little as the two men tussled in the area, but the Portuguese defender . did seem to have a grip of his opponent. After Gotze fell down, Muller . stepped up to stroke the penalty in. Three and easy: Thomas Muller (centre) lashes home Germany's third and put them in total control .

Out of reach: Portugal keeper Rui Patricio dives but can get nowhere near Muller's penalty . Foul: Mario Gotze (centre) is brought down by Joao Pereira (right) for Germany's early penalty . So . early in the game, it already looked a long way back for Portugal and, . in their own half at least, things quickly deteriorated. Gotze . looked about to score in the 31st minute as he moved on to Mesut Ozil’s . low cross, only for Pereira to divert the shot over with his knee. It . was a fine block but one that was rendered irrelevant within 30 seconds . as Mats Hummels rose above Pepe to thump in a header from the resulting . corner. Two down now, Portugal certainly seemed doomed. By half-time they were. Twice . in a minute they came close to scoring as Fabio Coentrao inexplicably . chose not to shoot when clear and then substitute Eder — on for the . injured Almeida — headed a corner over. Almost immediately Pepe . contributed his piece of madness and Germany were left with a man . advantage. Perhaps the arm . in the face of Muller was not quite enough to put the German on the seat . of his pants. But Pepe is no stranger to a bit of method acting himself . and the decision to follow up with a nudge of his head was ridiculous. Within seconds he was back in the dressing room. Isolated: Ronaldo cuts a frustrated figure as Portugal collapse in the first half . Keeping him out: Hummels (right) goes to block a Ronaldo shot on goal .

Muller was able to score his third when Patricio couldn’t hold an Andre . Schurrle effort with 15 minutes left.

"Some of the world's greatest players will be in Brazil and match-winners will be plentiful. Jamie Redknapp picks his 10 to watch at the World Cup. HE must be hurting with people saying he’s not the best player in the world anymore. I’ve never seen him walk around the pitch as much as this season at Barcelona — he needs to up his tempo. If he does, he can do what Maradona did and win the tournament for his country. Rumour has it he’s been saving himself for this — let’s hope it’s true. Up the tempo: Rumour has it Lionel Messi has been saving himself for the World Cup - he must deliver . I was unsure about the Brazil star for a while, but he had a fantastic Confederations Cup last summer, devastatingly good. There is more pressure on him than any other player at the World Cup: he’s the pin-up, the home talent, the hope of a nation. It’s not a vintage Brazil side but he is the one man who can produce a moment of genius. Pin-up: There is a lot of pressure on Neymar and he will hope to repeat  his Confederations Cup displays . The player of the year’s confidence will be sky high after winning the Champions League. If he catches fire, Portugal have half a chance of doing very well. The Real Madrid forward can score any way — left foot, right foot, headers and free kicks — and is backed up by an organised Portugal side that is used to the heat. Sky-high confidence: And if Cristiano Ronaldo catches fire, Portugal could do very well . Yes, he dives but Robben has so much ability and skill. Louis van Gaal wants to play him centrally instead of on the wing and he could thrive there. Good players need to be in the game, not peripheral figures on the wing. Playing in the middle will allow him to produce more magic. Central figure: Holland might play Arjen Robben through the middle so he can influence games . If he’s fit, he will terrorise England and anybody he plays against. He’s an absolute phenomenon who is capable of doing things no-one else can. It will be a real shame if he’s not quite right as the World Cup needs him on fire. But I’ve had knee operations and know it  can take a while to feel 100 per cent. Phenomenon: The World Cup needs a fit-and-firing Luis Suarez, who is capable of doing outrageous things . I love watching him. He makes Spain tick with his ability to outpass or outdribble his opponent from midfield. Manipulates the ball so well, seeing a different game to everybody else. Is a step  ahead of everyone. If Diego Costa is fit and Iniesta can feed him, Spain will be so dangerous again. The manipulator: Andres Iniesta makes Spain tick and will be the main supply line to Diego Costa . I was never a fan of his at Manchester City because he was poison in the dressing room. In some ways, I’m not sure why I’m picking him on this list. But the AC Milan striker is still box office and you never know what he is going to do. His pace and power will cause trouble for England’s defenders and Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill will be hoping he is not in the starting XI. Was Italy’s star when they reached the Euro 2012 final and will either destroy his own team or the opposition. Watch this space. Pace and power: Mario Balotell is capable of destroying opponents... and his own side . He is either going to set the tournament alight or get dropped. This is the biggest tournament of his England career. Rooney has never scored at a World Cup and  that’s not good enough for a man of his ability. He can produce the magic England will need to  get out of such a tough group. No middle ground: Wayne Rooney will either set the World Cup alight or be dropped by England . Croatia have got lots of good technical players, but Rakitic is the best of the bunch. A skilful playmaker, he dribbles well and was hugely impressive in the Europa League final for Sevilla. He will surprise people in Brazil and could earn himself a big move after the World Cup. Best of the bunch: Playmaker Ivan Rakitic is Croatia's star and may surprise some people in Brazil . Hazard started the season looking like a world beater and ended it fading away and falling out with Jose Mourinho. The Chelsea playmaker needs to bounce back and inspire this very exciting Belgium team. He has the ability to go from standing still to sprinting in the blink of an eye, which makes him horrible to play against. One criticism would be that he needs to add more goals to his game — he only managed one from open play in his last 16 games of the season. Now is a good time to start. Bounce back: Eden Hazard was brilliant at the start of last season but faded away towards the end . Lionel Messi (Argentina)......................7/1 . Neymar (Brazil)......................................12/1 . Sergio Aguero (Argentina)................14/1 . Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)................14/1 . Fred (Brazil)..........................................20/1 . Luis Suarez (Uruguay)...........................22/1 . Gonzalo Higuain (Argentina)............22/1 .

"Izzy Brown struck a late equaliser as Chelsea began their Premier League Under 21 International Cup campaign with a draw against Borussia Monchengladbach. The Blues had trailed when Mario Rodriguez scored from close range to give the Bundesliga side the lead just after the hour mark. But England Under 19 striker Brown equalised with a looping header in the dying seconds to earn Chelsea a deserved point. Izzy Brown celebrates scoring Chelsea's late equaliser as they opened their International Cup campaign . Brown managed to jump at the perfect moment to guide the ball over Monchengladbach keeper Bolten .

Scorer: Rodriguez 61 . Booked: Ritter . Attendance: 252 . This was the opening fixture in Group A of the inaugural International Cup and Chelsea also have Porto and Norwich City in their pool. Their manager Adi Viveash fielded a strong line-up at Staines Town, with the likes of Nathan Ake, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker involved. The visitors from Germany enjoyed the game's first opening when Kevin Holzweiler fired over the bar but it didn't take the hosts long to click into gear. Loftus-Cheek, who featured in Chelsea's Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon last week, was found by John Swift's right-wing cross but he couldn't control. Reece Mitchell fired in a dangerous cross from the left that neither Swift nor defender Ake could get a touch on. Baker, the England Under 20 international who has also featured for the first team, fired a 20-yard free-kick a fraction over the bar as the first 45 minutes ended goalless. Another Baker set-piece early in the second period failed to trouble goalkeeper Niklas Bolten but the Monchengladbach man did well to push away Mitchell's curling effort moments later. However, against the run of play, the visitors took the lead on 61 minutes. A quick counter-attack caught Chelsea out and, after Mitchell Beeney had saved an initial shot from a goalmouth scramble, Rodriguez bundled home. Chelsea's John Swift tries to evade the slide tackle of Monchengladbach's Christopher Lenz . Chelsea forwards Izzy Brown breaks clear of Christopher Lenz during the match at Staines Town FC . Chelsea's response was positive and Brown met Jeremie Boga's free-kick with a looping header that bounced off the top of the crossbar and out of danger. Monchengladbach were pushed further and further back as the clock ticked down and ultimately the pressure paid in the 89th-minute. Brown was initially denied by Bolten's legs but the ball spiralled up into the air and the striker outjumped the goalkeeper to nod into an empty net.

"Mitchell Johnson and Chris Rogers played key roles as Australia wrapped up a four-wicket victory over India within four days of the second Test in Brisbane. The tourists had resumed on 71 for one in their second innings, but Johnson claimed four wickets and crucially sparked a middle-order collapse which saw India eventually bowled out for 224. Shikhar Dhawan provided some resistance for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men with a stubborn 81, despite battling a wrist injury he sustained in the practice nets before the day's play. Mitchell Johnson is congratulated after leading Australia to victory in the second Test with India in Brisbane . Australia lost six second innings wickets, but Johnson (left) and Mitchell Marsh saw them home . Johnson had earlier inflicted damage with the ball, here celebrating the wicket of Umesh Yadav . Johnson celebrates after taking the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane, one of four Indian batsmen he dismissed . But Johnson's brilliance and India's demise left Australia needing 128 for victory, and a half-century from opener Rogers set them on their way to a resounding win and a 2-0 series lead, despite losing six wickets along the way. India's troubles began even before play had started when Dhawan was unable to resume his innings having been struck on the wrist in the nets. Things then went from bad to worse as Johnson quickly turned the contest in Australia's favour. His first victim of the day was Virat Kohli, bowled for a single, with Ajinkya Rahane (10) and Rohit Sharma soon following, the latter edging to wicket-keeper Brad Haddin for a duck. Dhoni had also failed to trouble the scorers when he was removed by Josh Hazlewood just three deliveries later and India looked more than precarious on 87 for five. Australian opener Chris Rogers marks his half-century as Australia chased down the 128 needed . Rogers' innings helped Australia take a 2-0 lead in the series, which resumes in Melbourne on Boxing Day . Mitch Marsh and Mitchell Johnson celebrate after steering Australia home at The Gabba . Cheteshwar Pujara, who had been watching the debacle unfold at the other end of the crease, and Ravichandran Ashwin (19) managed to steer the tourists past the 100-run mark but the latter then became Mitchell Starc's only scalp with Haddin pouching another catch. When Pujara's resistance was also ended, by Hazlewood on 43, it seemed as though India were spent but Dhawan returned to the middle and joined forces with Umesh Yadav to finally get the runs flowing. The pair put on an eighth-wicket stand of 60 as India marched past the 200-mark before Nathan Lyon's straighter delivery had Dhawan trapped lbw, ending a brave display from the left-hander. Lyon's second wicket soon followed with the dismissal of Varun Aaron while Johnson and Haddin combined once more to end Yadav's stay on 30 and leave the paceman with figures of four for 61. Steve Smith is run out by Umesh Yadav as Australia stumbled in their second innings run chase . Smith made 28 runs from 39 balls, helping Australia secure a 2-0 series lead . Wicket-taker Ishant Sharma (second right) celebrates with his team after removing David Warner for six . Sharma took three wickets for 38 runs to give India hope of pulling off an unlikely victory . India celebrate after taking the wicket of Shane Watson (centre) for a duck, caught MS Dhoni bowled Sharma . Australia's target of 128 - with one and a bit sessions remaining - looked simple enough, although they did it the hard way as the wickets tumbled. Two of those fell to Ishant Sharma before tea, with David Warner (6) and Shane Watson (0) the men to depart. More worryingly, Warner's fitness is now a major concern for the third Test after he was struck by Yadav during his short stay at the crease and suffered a thumb injury. It was left to Rogers to get Australia's run chase going and his swashbuckling 55 from 57 balls, including 10 boundaries, was just what the Brisbane crowd needed to settle any nerves. Rogers' dismissal, again by Sharma, left the hosts on 85 for three while Shaun Marsh (17), first-innings centurion Steve Smith (28) and Haddin (1) also departed in a messy spell, but Mitchell Marsh eventually hit the runs which saw them across the line.","Australia beat India by four wickets in second Test match in Brisbane .

"'This should be fun': Former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, 64, has been signed by Channel 4 to host its General Election night coverage on 7 May next year . Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman will host Channel 4's General Election night coverage next year, it was announced today. The outspoken broadcaster was one of the BBC's biggest stars before he quit earlier this year after 25 years as host of the corporation's flagship current affairs show. Now Paxman, 64, will go head to head with former colleagues including David Dimbleby and Huw Williams when he anchors Channel 4's election night coverage on 7 May next year. The veteran inquisitor said: 'There are new and interesting questions to ask about the way we choose our government. 'This should be fun.' Channel 4's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, said: 'Jeremy is a compelling presenter and makes truly unmissable TV for those big political moments. 'His sense of mischief and danger make him a fantastic fit with Four.' A spokesman for the channel said that Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow would continue to anchor election coverage for news, saying: 'As in previous years, Jon will be the key anchor for C4 News during the election period'. At the last General Election, Channel 4 won critical acclaim for its 'alternative' broadcast hosted by presenters including David Mitchell, Lauren Laverne, and Jimmy Carr, which it claimed outperformed ITV's coverage. Signing Paxman, who spent his entire working life at the BBC before he presented his last Newsnight in June, to sign next year's election night is something of a coup for the broadcaster, which would not disclose how much he will be paid for fronting the election as a one-off. Scroll down for video . Paxman's departure from Newsnight came amid reports he had not been happy with the BBC, and in particular with Newsnight under new editor Ian Katz, for some time. Earlier this month Katz, who joined Newsnight from the Guardian, told the Evening Standard about his working relationship with Paxman, saying: 'He’s dyspeptic about pretty much everything. Ideas are flattened. 'Almost everything you suggest Jeremy will think is ""preposterous"", or ""infantile"" or an otherwise ""completely lamentable"" idea, and that’s a challenge because you have to sell it to him.' Critics suggested the current affairs show appeared more lightweight under Katz's tenure, with stunts including presenter Kirsty Wark dancing to Michael Jackson's Thriller on Halloween last year, and a long interview with comedian Russell Brand. BBC stalwarts David Dimbleby, 75, and Huw Edwards, 53, will host the General Election coverage next May . Paxman left Newsnight amid reports he was unhappy with new editor, Ian Katz's, tenure there - it was accused of dumbing down with stunts including presenter Kirsty Wark dancing along to Michael Jackson's Thriller . Earlier this year Paxman admitted he wanted to tell viewers that Newsnight wasn't worth watching, saying he'd like to tell them 'I'd go to bed if I were you'. And he got into trouble with Radio 1 bosses over comments he made to another newspaper saying that his 'idea of hell' was getting into a BBC lift 'which has Radio 1 Extra plumbed into it - I don't quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1 Extra'. The BBC's election night coverage will be anchored by David Dimbleby from the close of polls at 10pm until the following morning, when Huw Edwards will take over from 7am to 10pm. Dimbleby, 75, presented his first General Election coverage when Margaret Thatcher swept to power in 1979, while Edwards, 53, has presented several election specials, as well as Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011. BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Evan Davis, 52, will take over as Newsnight's new 'lead anchor' next week . James Harding, the BBC's director of news, said: 'This election is likely to be one of the most complex and closely fought in recent times and we are delighted to have such an experienced team to lead our coverage.' Newsnight is now presented by a team including Emily Maitlis, Kirsty Wark, Laura Kuenssberg, and, from next week, BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Evan Davis will join as 'lead anchor'.","The 64-year-old former Newsnight host has been signed by rival Channel 4 .

"Raheem Sterling has been named the 2014 European Golden Boy - an award given to the best youngster on the continent. The 20 year-old helped Liverpool come within a whisker of the Premier League title last season as they finished second behind Manchester City. And he has also become an integral part of the England national set-up in 2014, playing during the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 European Championship qualifiers. Raheem Sterling named as the 2014 European Golden Boy - an award for best youngster on the continent . Liverpool tweeted their congratulations to Sterling after he received the award on Friday . Sterling took to Twitter to reveal his delight at receiving the award on Saturday . Although mainly being used wide on the right for the Reds throughout 2014, in recent weeks Sterling has been deployed as a central forward and scored twice in a magnificent display during Liverpool's 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday. Sterling took to Twitter to reveal his delight at receiving the award, accompanied by a picture of himself with the trophy. He said: 'Walk boldly through the doors God opens for you, and don't become discouraged when He closes one.' After receiving the accolade on Saturday, Sterling told Liverpoolfc.com: 'It's a great achievement to win such an award. 'It's a really happy feeling for me and my family, of course. Sterling (centre) scored twice for Liverpool in the 3-1 win against Bournemouth on Wednesday . The Englishman (right) scores Liverpool's opening goal against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup . 'Something I've always wanted to do is to work hard playing football and try to be recognised. I'm really grateful that people have shown me this recognition. 'It's down to hard work. I'm really happy that people are recognising that I'm trying to work hard and do my best for this football club. I'm really grateful for this award.' Liverpool themselves tweeted a message of congratulations to Sterling. It read: 'Congratulations @sterling31, who was today announced as the winner of the prestigious 2014 European Golden Boy award.' Raheem Sterling is one of five English players nominated for the 2014 European Golden Boy award . Manchester United's Luke Shaw, Everton's John Stones, Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier and Arsenal's Calum Chambers also joined Sterling on the 40-man shortlist, but the Liverpool forward has claimed the award. In all, there were 10 Premier League-based players nominated, with Chelsea's Kurt Zouma, United's Adnan Januzaj, Spurs' Nabil Bentaleb and Liverpool's Lazar Markovic and Divock Origi also put forward. Ahead of Liverpool's key clash with Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, Sterling added: 'There's always room for improvement. At this moment in time, I should have a few more goals, but I've not taken some of my chances. But I'm young and learning all the time. 'This award just shows that hard work gets you where you want to be, and that I'm on the right track for where I want to be in my career. Hopefully I can just keep working hard and try to take my game to the next level.' Tottenham's Eric Dier and Everton's John Stones (right) also made the 40-strong shortlist for the award . Arsenal's Calum Chambers and Manchester United's Luke Shaw (right) also made the 40-strong shortlist .

There were also seven players nominated from other European nations. All nominees for the Golden Boy award must be under the age of 21 and play in one of the big European leagues. There have been 11 previous winners of the award since its inception in 2003 - when Italian newspaper Tuttosport originally created the prize and determined Dutchman Rafael van der Vaart to be Europe's next best thing. Paul Pogba was voted last year's Golden Boy by journalists in Europe and Wayne Rooney is the only previous English winner (2004) before Sterling. In order to determine the eventual winner, each of the 30 publications with a vote nominates five players from the shortlist and 10 points are awarded to their first choice, seven for their second, five for their third, three for their fourth and one for their fifth. Sterling was chosen by the journalists and becomes the first Reds player to win the award - although Mario Balotelli claimed the prize while at Manchester City in 2010.

"Daniel Crowley's penalty guided Arsenal into the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup following a hard-fought win over Reading on Friday night. The 17-year-old midfielder, who signed his first professional contract with the club back in August, fired the spot-kick into the bottom corner to settle the tie on 65 minutes. It was Crowley's ninth goal of the season and set up a match against non-league Royston Town in the next round - but only after Reading missed a stoppage-time penalty.

The young Gunners, coached by Frans de Kat, have been struggling in the league and were winless in seven games entering this fixture at Meadow Park in Boreham Wood. But they were motivated after reaching the semi-finals of the competitions last season, only to be knocked out over two legs by eventual winners Chelsea. Among the other talents named in the Arsenal team were Gedion Zelalem, who made his first-team debut earlier this year, and Stephy Mavididi, who scored two goals in the group stage of the UEFA Youth League. Reading started the match the brighter, with Tennai Watson and then Noor Husin missing chances inside the opening 10 minutes. Eventually, Arsenal began to control proceedings and Crowley forced a fine save out of Lewis Ward. Mavididi then jumped highest to head Crowley's cross against the bar. The pressure only increased as the first-half wore on, with Zelalem sending a low drive just wide of the post and Chris Willock drawing a good stop from Ward just before the break.

"Louis van Gaal, while a coach at Barcelona, once visited the home of Gerard Pique’s grandfather, Amador Bernabeu, a director of the club. Pique, a 14-year-old centre-back for Barcelona’s youth team, was ushered forward to be introduced to the manager of the senior squad. Van Gaal sized him up, and pushed him to the ground. Looking down at Pique, the Dutchman said: ‘You are not tough enough to be a centre back.’ What Van Gaal wouldn’t give to have Pique at Manchester United these days. Louis van Gaal (right) pictured during his time as Barcelona manager with Jose Mourinho in 1997 . Gerard Pique (right) played for Manchester United for four years before leaving for Barcelona in 2008 . Van Gaal could do with Pique these days as the Barcelona defender is pictured hugging Lionel Messi . Dec 20: Aston Villa (away) Dec 26: Newcastle (home) Dec 28: Tottenham (away) Jan 1: Stoke City (away) Jan 11: Southampton (home) Jan 17: QPR (away) Jan 31: Leicester City (home) That display of tough love from a disciplinarian probably serves as an amusing anecdote around the dinner table for 6ft 4in Pique. He spent four years at Old Trafford from the age of 17 before returning to Barcelona in 2008, where he has won four La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies. Defence is but one of the reasons Van Gaal is not quite challenging for the Barclays Premier League title against Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. Not this year. Some argue they are. Six consecutive wins, eight points shy of Chelsea, five of Manchester City, winnable games to come. But, as they occasionally ride their luck, they should simply concentrate on the top four, and go from there. Van Gaal has had four months to warm to his Old Trafford hot seat and here, Sportsmail delves into the numbers to assess whether they  really measure up to the title favourites. Van Gaal has had four months to warm to his Old Trafford hot seat since arriving from 2014 World Cup . GOALKEEPER . Mario Balotelli gave one of those smiles, where you've got to laugh or you'll cry. Once the final whistle went, the grin was gone,  the Liverpool striker's drought continued, and it was all down to the Manchester United goalkeeper. The debate at the pub afterwards was whether David de Gea is the heir to Edwin van der Sar and Peter Schmeichel's throne,  or whether he is currently the best in the Premier League. In terms of goalkeepers with a minimum of 10 saves in the penalty area, he is. De Gea's 71.74 per cent save ratio is a smidgen better than Sunderland's Costel Pantilimon and Aston Villa's Brad Guzan. Mario Balotelli (right) smiles at Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (left) as he was denied a goal . Percentage of stops from goalkeepers in the penalty area (minimum of 10 saves) 71.74% - David de Gea . 71.43% - Costel Pantilimon . 69.81% - Brad Guzan . 65.85% - Ben Foster . 64.71% - Joe Hart . Most stops made by goalkeepers in the last six Premier League matches (since November 8) 21 - David de Gea . 19 - Brad Guzan . 19 - Costel Pantilimon . 18 - Robert Green . 17 - Lukasz Fabianski . De Gea did not allow Liverpool to score and has been in fine form during their last six consecutive wins . But better than Joe Hart? Thibaut Courtois? Simon Mignolet? Wojciech Szczesny? De Gea makes more saves per game than the rest but that tells more about a bandaged-up defence allowing shots through. He averages 2.44, far more than the other four candidates. Yet the rest of the numbers swing Hart's way: in clean sheets (0.40 to 0.31), goals conceded (0.80 to 1.06) and saves per goal (2.80 to 2.29). But the last six games are when they have looked more like Manchester United circa the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Since November 8, De Gea has made more saves (21) than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League. He looks nothing like the man that let four in against MK Dons on August 26, and has been instrumental in keeping three clean sheets in the last six - as many as Hart and Courtois. But optimists beware. You can only ride your luck so far, and the reliance on De Gea is evident.

De Gea stops Balotelli from nabbing his first Premier League goal of the season since signing for Liverpool . DEFENCE . Quite often, it's held together by duck tape or, more recently, Michael Carrick. United have had 48 injuries since Van Gaal's first press conference on July 16 - 18 of which were to defenders. Carrick did a job against Liverpool. The 33-year-old was a catalyst at centre back (as his heat and pass maps below show) and escaped with a near-perfect 90.4 per cent passing accuracy, too. They have won every  match in which he has played 90 minutes this year, and has done an adequate patch-up job in defence. Who needs a Pique, right? Michael Carrick's heat map (left) and pass map (right) showed the 33-year-old's influence against Liverpool . Michael Carrick has done an excellent patch-up job as centre-back with Van Gaal's defensive woes . The 33-year-old was a catalyst at the back for United, though Liverpool threatened to score against De Gea . Wrong. The club’s defensive frailty has been no secret. They’ve conceded more (17) than Manchester City (14) and Chelsea (13). They lead the way with defensive errors (16), too. Van Gaal has felt this before as manager. In 1997 Barcelona had one of the worst defences in La Liga. They conceded 56 in 38 matches - their most since 1951 - and their highest since seasons containing 38 fixtures were introduced a decade before. Yet they won La Liga by nine points. But that was then, this is now. They remain a few cards short of a full deck, and are awaiting the cavalry to arrive from the treatment table or the January transfer window. United (far left column) are forced to make more interceptions, blocks and clearances than their rivals . United remain a few cards short of a full deck and must wait for the cavalry to arrive from the treatment table . MIDFIELD . They say the mark of a good team is to play badly and win. Well, Manchester United were average against Arsenal, and won 2-1. They weren't breathtaking against Liverpool, either, yet they won 3-0. And yet, in between, Van Gaal is getting performances from players we never knew possible following David Moyes' tenure. Marouane Fellaini, for example, was done for. He was photographed on crutches in August and a collective sigh swept across Manchester because it meant the Belgium midfielder wouldn't be leaving Old Trafford for Napoli. A comparison of his season this year and last (shown below) demonstrates a rise in goals, tackles, chances created, aerial duels won and key passes. He, of all people, has improved. Marouane Fellaini has improved between this year and last in goals, tackles, chances, aerial duels and passes . So, too, have Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia. They could  easily have been included in the defensive bracket but, as left and right wing-backs, they've adapted to the 3-5-2 system. Their percentages of successful take ons have risen. Last year, Young's 39.39 per cent and Valencia's 45.90 were mediocre. This season, they have an identical record of 65 per cent. It's a start, a sign of life after Moyes. But not title worthy. Not when Eden Hazard has made 72 successful take ons compared to Young and Valencia's collective 26, as unfair a comparison that may be. But, with new additions such as Daley Blind and Ander Herrera, the Champions League suddenly doesn't look as unrealistic as it did by the end of August. Ashley Young (left) and Antonio Valencia (right) have been deployed down the wing and given licence to run . Young's heat map against Liverpool (left) and Valencia's heat map for the same match (right) as they won 3-0 . A comparison of Young and Valencia this year and last shows they're improving but having less shots . FORWARDS . Against Southampton, Manchester United had three shots, the lowest by a Premier League side this season and the least the club has managed since Opta was born 11 years ago. Of those three shots - two were on target, and Robin van Persie scored both. Against Liverpool, they scored with their first two shots. Clinical, to say the least. Dare we mention the 'L' word? Luck certainly comes with it, though their ruthlessness in the last six games is apparent when compared to their first 10 matches (shown right). Their shot conversion has gone from 14.95 per cent to 25.49, their shooting accuracy from 43.95 to 49.02 and their goals per game from 1.6 to 2.2. Robin van Persie has been clinical recently and remains United's top scorer after his latest against Liverpool . 7 - Van Persie . 6 - Rooney . 5 - Mata . 3 - Di Maria . 2 - Fellaini & Herrera . 1 - Blind, Falcao & Smalling . That is primarily down to their flying Dutchman. His minutes per goal ratio, accordingly, has gone from 252.67 to 126.25. But he, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Angel di Maria, are starting to deliver. Radamel Falcao, on the other hand, is doing little to convince  he is worthy of becoming a permanent fixture at Old Trafford. Van Gaal is working his magic. All hope that seemed lost last year has returned, though it would be misplaced in  a title challenge. They've rode their luck, hard at that, and have 18 points from 18 since November 8. A Champions League return is in their grasp and, if that is what their Dutch master can bring a year into the job, there's no saying he can't go one further next. Manchester United have rode their luck but a Champions League spot would go a long way towards next year .","Manchester United sit third in the Premier League after six straight wins .

"Alastair Cook has been sacked as England one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, the ECB confirmed on Saturday morning. Only a few days after insisting Cook would lead the team at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February, England have performed a spectacular U-turn and removed him. He has paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50-over form, which has seen England lose six of their last seven one-day series. Alastair Cook after the defeat by Sri Lanka, his final match as England one-day captain . Cook's form was horrendous - he hadn't scored an ODI century since June 2012 . Eoin Morgan is set to replace Cook as England's 50-over skipper despite his own poor form . Questions were again asked of his leadership as England slumped to a 5-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka over the last few weeks. Cook's form has dropped off dramatically, with the opener averaging just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike rate of 73. A statement released by the ECB on Saturday morning read: 'ECB today announced that Eoin Morgan has replaced Alastair Cook as England One-Day captain with immediate effect. 'England selectors met yesterday to pick a 15-man one-day squad for the tour to Australia and the ICC Cricket World Cup. 'Selectors recommended to Managing Director England Cricket Paul Downton a change in captaincy which has now been approved by the ECB Chairman. Cook will continue as England Test captain. 'Morgan has captained England’s one-day side on eight previous occasions. The 28 year old left hander, who made his England debut in 2009, will lead the side in a tri-series against Australia and India in January ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand beginning in February. 'James Whitaker, National Selector, said: 'We spent a considerable time yesterday discussing the make up of a squad that gives England the best possible chance of success at the World Cup which begins in less than two months. 'Having reviewed the recent series against Sri Lanka we came to the conclusion that there was no place for Alastair Cook amongst our strongest 15 one-day players and therefore recommended Eoin Morgan be appointed One-Day captain.' 'Paul Downton, Managing Director England Cricket, said: 'I have complete confidence in the decision made by the selectors and having spent time with Alastair yesterday he accepts that it has been made in the best interests of the one-day side. Alastair Cook admitted he was 'gutted' to be left out of the World Cup squad . Eoin Morgan described his appointment as a 'huge honour' but has plenty of work to do . Snatching Cook's captaincy away was not a brave decision... the selectors should be red-faced . 'Eoin has held a senior role in our limited overs teams for some time and has impressed on the occasions he has led the side. I would like to congratulate him on the appointment and wish him, Peter Moores and the rest of the squad all the very best over the next three months. 'Alastair remains an integral part of England cricket and continues to have a vital role in developing our emerging Test side. I would like to thank him for his leadership of the one-day side since 2011, a period which saw the team reach number one in the world. 'Alastair led the team to more wins than any previous England captain and also make the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. 'Alastair will now focus on an exciting and challenging year of Test cricket beginning with a series against West Indies followed by an Ashes summer culminating in a series against South Africa next winter.' Cook looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final ODI of the series against Sri Lanka . Eoin Morgan said: 'It is a huge honour to captain England and I am delighted to be leading the one-day side. I firmly believe that with the players currently involved in the one-day set up we have the makings of a very good one-day side, a young side that can surprise people at the World Cup. 'We all recognise we still have a lot of work to do on our one-day game but the potential of this group of players is huge and it is now up to us as players to turn that potential into consistent performances on the international stage starting next month against Australia and India.' 'Alastair Cook said: 'I am gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment. That said I wish Peter, Eoin and the lads all the best for the World Cup. I would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me during my time as One-Day captain.' Cook plays and misses at one in Colombo during another stuttering innings . Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook . Yet the decision still comes as a shock to many, especially after the ECB stuck with Cook through a traumatic year for English cricket. Last Sunday England coach Peter Moores, who has backed Cook emphatically since replacing Andy Flower in April, said ahead of England’s last one-day international in Sri Lanka: ‘If you ask my opinion, Cook will be captain at the World Cup.’ Then on Monday, just before England’s last defeat in their 5-2 series loss, managing director Paul Downton added: ‘I would be extremely surprised if he’s not captain at the World Cup.’ Now, with England leaving for a triangular series against Australia and India ahead of the World Cup in just over a fortnight, the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in Cook. Moores met fellow selectors James Whitaker and Mick Newell at Loughborough on Friday, while Angus Fraser joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in Barbados and Downton sat in as a non-voting presence. They ultimately reached their decision because of Cook’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven-match series in Sri Lanka even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him. And the sense of England being in a state of one-day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace Cook with a batsman in Morgan who has a worse one-day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds. At least Irishman Morgan, such a key performer in England’s one-day batting, seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one-day captain. Cook, nothing if not a stubborn fighter, was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in Australian conditions. Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake (right) celebrates with  Angelo Mathews after taking the wicket of Cook . He was under extreme pressure when England lost to India in the second Test at Lord’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three Tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one-day cricket. Cook, who has never played in a World Cup, leaves the post having led England to more one-day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one-day rankings in 2012 and the Champions Trophy final a year later. It was the way Cook confounded his one-day doubters after succeeding Andrew Strauss in 2011 that convinced England he was still their man but they agonised over Cook’s future when he lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer. They stood firm then but have lost their nerve now. Now, as well as Morgan, the beneficiaries of Cook’s misfortune look sure to be Ian Bell, who will compete with Alex Hales to become Moeen Ali’s opening partner, and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was left out of the Sri Lankan squad. England had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on Friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper Morgan in Sydney. Whitaker, the national selector, will confirm the World Cup squad at Lord’s that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it. Bell, dropped after two matches in Sri Lanka, Ballance and the fit-again strike bowling pair of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will all form part of a 15-man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one-day tournament of all. England captain Cook leaves the field after being dismissed by Senanayake of Sri Lanka on December 11 . Cook, who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild England from the ashes of their 5-0 defeat by Australia, has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm. The news may be a blow to Cook, but it should ensure that he is in better condition, both mentally and physically, at the start of a run of 17 Tests in little more than a year which begins when England tour the Caribbean in April. A refreshed Cook will be integral to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes next summer which, whatever anyone in English cricket says, remains far more important than competing in a 50-over tournament. England, who have not been World Cup contenders since 1992, have had to replace their one-day captains immediately after failed World Cup campaigns going back to Mike Atherton in 1996 and continuing with Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Strauss. The only difference this time is that the axing has come before a World Cup failure rather than after one.","Eoin Morgan to replace Alastair Cook as England one-day captain .

"Will England qualify for the knockout stages? Will England qualify for the knockout stages? Now share your opinion . Italy recorded an astonishing 93.2 per cent passing accuracy during their 2-1 win against England on Saturday night which is the highest ever recorded in a single World Cup game since 1966. With players like Andrea Pirlo, Marco Verratti and Daniele De Rossi patrolling midfield in the heat of Arena Amazonia, it's no wonder Italy recorded such a high figure. Italian maestro Pirlo showed his class once again, making 108 passes and only misplacing five of those while his partner Daniele de Rossi made 99 of his 105. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Neil Ashton discuss England 1-2 Italy . Intricate: Claudio Marchisio (left) Daniele De Rossi were key to Italy's passing game . Off the park: Juventus star Andrea Pirlo (right) made 41 more accurate passes than Steven Gerrard . This, when compared with the 62 passes made by England captain Steven Gerrard gives an insight into how difficult the Three Lions found it to make an impact in Manaus. England's midfield looked overrun at times as Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard battled to interrupt the Azzurri's flowing football. Italy's opening goal may have indirectly arrived from a corner, but even that involved several intricate passes and a sumptuous dummy from Pirlo before Claudio Marchisio rifled home in the 35th minute. Everywhere: Pirlo (left) made 103 of his 108 attempted passes during Italy's win against England . Overall Cesare Prandelli's side made 561 passes from 602 attempts as they quite literally passed England's spirited performance into the ground. It's no wonder that it was the England players slumping to the ground, complaining of cramp and picking up slight injuries towards the end of the game as chasing shadows in the South American evening heat started to catch up with Roy Hodgson players. As the English players tired, Italy's substitutions came on and fitted seemlessly into their team's passing game. Paris Saint Germain midfielder Verratti spent an hour finding space and nipping between the lines while recording 93.90 per cent before his replacement Thiago Motta came on and failed to misplace a pass for the final 30 minutes. On his own: Wayne Rooney struggled to make an impact on the Group D clash, starting from the left of midfield . Hit and miss: Daniele De Rossi's touch map shows the Italian was more involved than Steven Gerrard (right) 26 - Second half substitute Thiago Motta replaced Verratti in the 57th minute and completed every one of his 26 passes . England tired and began to lose possession far too easily in the closing stages, Wayne Rooney shooting wildly and Raheem Sterling hitting crosses into the crowd. The Italians on the other hand looked so assured with the ball at their feet that after Mario Balotelli headed past Joe Hart in the 48th minute, only one team looked as though they could pick up all three points. For all the energy that the England youngster possess, the likes of Sterling and Henderson will have learned a huge lesson in the importance of being patient on the ball thanks to the Azzurri. Second fiddle: Gerrard (right) had a pass accuracy of 92.5 per cent, but only completed 62 passes .

"First, San Francisco-based commuters to Google Inc got buses with plush seats and free WiFi. Now, they are getting security. In recent days, men with earpieces have closely monitored passengers boarding Google commuter buses at the site of at least one bus stop in San Francisco's Mission District. Their presence comes a few weeks after Google buses were targeted by protesters who blame tech-industry employees for rising city rents. Unhappy residents: People dressed as inspectors hold 'Stop displacement now' and 'Fine 71 total fine billion' signs in front of a Google bus. A 71 fine for blocking a bus zone is rarely enforced against the tech buses . Search engine: Google shuttle bus arrives at 18th and Dolores streets to pick up employees in San Francisco . Tech bus: Google workers wait to board a Google bus in San Francisco . Gone are the days when mentioning Google as an employer gave young technology workers a certain counterculture credibility. As the company has expanded well beyond its Web search-engine roots to become a behemoth encompassing advertising, smartphones, finance and social networking, it has gone from scrappy start-up to a Goliath that many resent for its power. In San Francisco, many long-time residents believe the influx of richly compensated workers at Google and other big technology companies such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc has pushed rents to unaffordable levels in neighborhoods that once were homes to the working class. Technology companies have grown more aware of the tensions. They recently reached an agreement with the city of San Francisco governing the use of municipal bus stops. Google recently began to experiment with a privately chartered boat that can transport some of its employees living in San Francisco to its offices. And Google may be taking extra steps to protect its workers at the bus stops it uses in San Francisco. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. On two successive days this week, a pair of young men stood on a San Francisco street waiting for the special 'Gbus' that ferries Google staffers to the Internet company's Mountain View headquarters 34 miles to the South. Protests: Demonstrators blocked a tech bus in San Francisco for the second time in two weeks in December . Dressed casually in jeans and wearing black ski hats or hoods, the two men did not stand out from the dozens of other young tech workers waiting for the Google bus. On close inspection, each sported the curly wire of an earpiece, and one occasionally jotted notes down on a yellow stick-it pad. Instead of boarding the bus with everyone else, the two remained in the same spot, watching intently as a succession of Google's white corporate shuttles arrived for the morning pick-ups. In one instance, the bus driver waved to one of the men, who waved back. Asked if they were security guards for Google buses, one of the men replied 'Can I see your badge?' likely referring to the Google identification badges that employees of the company use to board the bus and enter buildings on the Google campus. The other man denied working as a security guard for Google, but declined to provide any information about his identity or his employer. A Google employee who commutes on the buses said he does not recall previously seeing any type of monitoring at the bus stops. Surrounded: Google employees work on a MacBooks as people dressed as inspectors from the 'San Francisco Displacement and Neighborhood Impact Agency' surround a Google bus . In December, the window of a Google bus in Oakland was shattered and a photo taken by one of Google's employee passengers showed two people in front of the bus holding a profane anti-Google banner. Other protests have been peaceful but disruptive, with activists temporarily blocking the corporate buses. One other Google bus in Oakland was targeted in December, plus a third bus at the same stop where the men with earpieces were observed this week.Another commuter bus, believed to be taking employees to Apple Inc, was also targeted in December.'They're bound to take steps to protect their workers,' said Mike Danko, a personal injury lawyer in San Mateo, California, a San Francisco suburb. Opposition: Many San Francisco residents' are concerned that an influx of affluent technology workers is driving up costs in the city . 'What would escalate the matter is any kind of violence,' he said. 'Usually the presence of a security person is going to keep a lid on violent conflict.'Ron Roth, the executive director of private security firm Corporate Security Service Inc said he did not know which security firm is working with Google.'If they are having security at the bus stops it's probably only eyes and ears, and to act as liaison to the police, and probably not to take any action,' said Roth.While private security officers can be armed in California, providing they have the proper licenses, Roth said it was highly unlikely that anyone working on the bus detail would be armed.'As a security company you really take on a liability if your officers are armed,' he said.","San Francisco Google-workers travel to the office in plush buses with free games and wifi .

"President Obama is set to back sweeping FBI proposals to overhaul surveillance laws making it easier for them to wiretap people communicating via the internet rather than by traditional phone services. Since 2010 the FBI has pushed for a legal mandate requiring companies like Facebook and Google to build into their instant-messaging and other such systems a capacity to comply with wiretap orders. To date the proposal has failed to get passed with technology companies raising objections that tougher laws would block Silicon Valley innovation. President Obama is set to back sweeping FBI proposals to overhaul surveillance laws making it easier for them to wiretap people communicating via the internet . FBI director Robert Mueller III has argued that the bureau’s ability to carry out court-approved eavesdropping on suspects is ‘going dark’ because it hasn’t been able to kept up with the fast evolving world of communications technology, reports the New York Times. The agency believes tougher laws are necessary to help it combat threats to U.S. security such as last month's bombing of the Boston Marathon. The White House is currently reviewing a revised version of the FBI’s proposal which focuses on fining companies that do not comply with wiretap orders. Lawyers for the technology sector are warning that the laws will make communications less secure and more open to hackers and that technology innovators may go abroad because of too stringent laws. FBI director Mueller says his agency needs tougher laws relating to the wiretapping of people using the internet to communicate . According to the FBI, the proposal is aimed only at preserving law enforcement officials’ longstanding ability to investigate suspected criminals, spies and terrorists subject to a court’s permission. The new proposal would enable judges to fine communications providers - $25,000 a day - who fail to comply with FBI request for access to user's information. Currently, such orders instruct recipients to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, leaving wiggle room for companies to say they tried but could not make the technology work. Foreign-based communications services that do business in the United States would be subject to the same procedures, and would be required to have a point of contact on domestic soil who could be served with a wiretap order, officials said. The FBI says its ability to carry out court-approved eavesdropping on suspects is 'going dark' because it hasn't kept up with technology .","The White House is set to back FBI proposals to overhaul surveillance laws .

"This is the five-year-old girl who died along with her grandfather when she was swept out to sea by a freak wave. Lara Lewis, described as a ‘magical’ and ‘charming little lass’, was playing with seashells when she was engulfed by a 10ft wave on a Portuguese beach. Her grandfather Brian O’Dwyer, 66, and his wife Jill, who live in Portugal, tried to rescue her but Mr O’Dwyer drowned. Mrs O’Dwyer, pulled from the water by fishermen, was ‘screaming and crying’ as she saw lifeguards trying in vain to revive her granddaughter and husband. She has since been discharged from hospital after being treated for shock. Scroll down for video . Torn apart: Lara Lewis with her mother Sian, 36, who was sunbathing on the beach with her husband when the terrible accident took place . Close-knit family: Mrs Lewis's parents Brian and Jill O'Dwyer were walking with their two grandchildren on the beach when the freak wave dragged them into the sea. Mr O'Dwyer died while his wife was saved . Desperate efforts: Firefighters prepare to move the bodies after trying unsuccessfully to revive five-year-old Lara for an hour . Lara’s devastated parents, Philip Lewis, 46, a professor at University College London, and his wife Sian, 36, were sunbathing on the beach nearby, but were unable to reach them in time. The accident happened shortly before 2pm on Tuesday. Yesterday Lara’s paternal grandmother Sara Lewis, 72, told how her son called her later that day to break the news. ‘He could hardly speak,’ she said. ‘I knew something terrible had happened by the sound of his voice. He almost couldn’t bring himself to tell me and I couldn’t make it all out, but I knew I didn’t want him to repeat it. ‘He was talking about a wave, and how it had overcome Lara. He told me she had drowned along with her grandfather. ‘Brian, who was a wonderful and brave man, tried to rescue her. He swam out so that he could save Lara, but they both couldn’t make it.’ Mrs Lewis recalled how a few weeks earlier Lara had been ‘laughing and playing’ at her fifth birthday party. She added: ‘Lara herself was a magical little girl. So full of happiness and life. She was always smiling. It’s a terrible tragedy. The family is just devastated.’ Adored: Lara and her grandparents were dragged into the rough sea by a 10ft wave, and only her grandmother survived . Devastating: The five-year-old's father Professor Philip Lewis is a leading expert on electromagnetic radiation, based at University College London . Tragedy: Lara Lewis at home with her family before she and her grandfather were dragged into the sea while on holiday . Loved: The five-year-old and her grandfather died while her horrified parents stood helplessly on the beach . A paramedic supports the relatives of the pair that drowned. The tragedy happened shortly before 2pm at the Salgado beach in Nazare, 80 miles north of Lisbon . Mr Lewis’s two sons from a previous relationship, Harry, 17, and Dylan, 18, were also heartbroken, she said, adding: ‘How does somebody move on from such a tragedy? I just don’t know. It’s terribly, terribly sad.’ Commander Antonio Albuquerque Silva, head of the maritime police in Nazare, said: ‘The little girl was playing with some shells in the sand, near the sea but not in it, when she was surprised by a very big wave which dragged her out to sea. ‘Her grandparents followed her in an attempt to rescue her but tragically they were unable to do so and the grandfather died in the attempt. ‘It is a very dangerous beach outside of the lifeguard zones.’ Lifeguard Nuno Carreira, 19, said: ‘The waves were very, very powerful and up to ten feet high. We put the red flag up to tell people to stay out of the sea because it was too dangerous. ‘We only cover a small area of the beach, and the grandparents took the little girl for a walk further up the shore. They were about 400 yards outside the area we monitor when the tragedy happened. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but it seems the girl was swept away by a big wave, and the grandparents then tried to save her. ‘My colleague and I ran as fast as we could. When we got there I saw a fisherman on the sands with the little girl in his arms, but she wasn’t breathing and was very pale. ‘I started doing first aid, trying to restart her heart. My colleague dived into the sea and pulled the grandad out but he was also not breathing either.’ Mr Carreira said he then saw Mrs O’Dwyer in the sea and he pulled her to shore. ‘She was crying and screaming for her husband and granddaughter,’ he said. ‘It was very, very sad. We did our best to save all three of them but only managed to save one.’ The tragedy happened at Salgado, a spectacular four-mile white beach, near Nazare, a former fishing village 80 miles north of Lisbon. The second lifeguard, David Branco, 18, said: ‘We spent more than an hour trying to revive the girl because we just didn’t want to give up.’ An investigation is being carried out by the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a matter of routine. Lara had just started at Rushmore Primary School near the family’s home in Clapton, North London. Headmaster Ian Mullaney said: ‘She was a delightful young girl from a lovely family and this has come as a huge shock to the whole Rushmore community. ‘Lara was a bright, friendly and positive girl who was well liked by her teachers and classmates. 'It is a tragedy and the news is just sinking in for all of us.' Mrs Lewis was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, along with two of her brothers, Corin, 34, and Terence, 33. Her husband is an expert on the study of the Earth’s surface through electromagnetic radiation. He has a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Queen Mary College, London; an MSc from Imperial College; and he obtained his Doctorate at University College in 1996. He has been based at UCL for 24 years. Friends and colleagues of Prof Lewis spoke of their sadness yesterday after learning that his daughter and father-in-law had drowned. One of his colleagues in the Department . of Geography at University College London, said : 'I had no idea his . daughter was the little girl involved in this tragedy. 'Everyone here will be totally shocked. My heart goes out to him and his family at this sad time.' Professor Jon French, head of the department, said in a statement: 'All of us at UCL are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic drowning, in Portugal, of Lara Lewis, daughter of Philip Lewis, professor of remote sensing in the Department of Geography. 'The loss of Lara and of her grandfather, who was also drowned in this same incident, is a truly heartbreaking tragedy and our deepest condolences go to Professor Lewis and his family.' Neighbour David Mason, a translator, said he had known Lara since she was a baby and described her as 'absolutely charming'. The 69-year-old said: 'I remember them bringing her home in her dad's arms and they were such a happy family. 'I used to see her come out of the house with her mother and she was always cheerful and would always say to me, ""Hello, Dave"". She was very friendly. 'This is terribly sad news and for a lot of people it's still sinking in. 'They were well known across the community and a lot of people are very upset by the news.' Holiday: The children had been holidaying in Portugal with their parents who were sunbathing elsewhere at Salgado beach when the tragedy unfolded . He added: 'You expect young children to be almost invulnerable. She was so full of life. 'People will react in different ways. We just all wish it hadn't happened. 'We will all have to work out how to deal with it but anything they want or need as a family, we will do for them.' A neighbour who lives opposite the family and gave his name only as Tony, said: 'She was a smashing little girl. She always looked happy walking with her mum. 'It's dreadful what's happened. Everybody on the street is shocked by it.' He added: 'I haven't spoken to the family yet so don't want to say anything else right now. I want to respect their wishes.' In pieces: Neighbours described the family as 'lovely' and 'happy' Another neighbour said: 'They are a lovely family. She was a lovely child and will be sorely missed within the whole community. 'We are a very close-knit community around here and everyone knows everyone else’s children. It’s going to be really hard.' He paid tribute to Lara’s grandfather as a 'lovely man,' adding: 'Everyone will be very sad.' Pictures of the scene showed . firefighters crouching down in the sand in the afternoon sunshine, about . to move the victims, and the rest of the family collapsing in each other's arms. Mr O'Dwyer's body was covered in a blue . sheet. One report said the 66-year-old drowned trying to save his granddaughter’s life. A spokesman for the Foreign Office . said: ‘We are aware of reports of the deaths of two British nationals in . Portugal and are in touch with the local authorities.’ Salgado . beach, which stretches over 3.5 miles, is popular with surfers and body . boarders attracted by the rolling Atlantic breakers, but its tides are . known locally to be dangerous and swimmers are warned to take great . care.

"Miraculous: A mother declared clinically dead in October after suffering a brain hemorrhage has given birth to a baby boy in Milan . A mother declared clinically dead in October after suffering a brain hemorrhage has given birth to a baby boy nine weeks after doctors agreed to keep her on a life support machine to save the child. The 36-year-old woman, who has not been named, was 23 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to Milan's San Raffaele hospital. Tragically doctors were unable to save her life. But they agreed to keep her alive with equipment to control her breathing and maintain her blood flow - while a tube to her intestines fed the growing fetus. When the woman reached the 32nd week of pregnancy yesterday, doctors performed a cesarean section, La Stampa reported. The baby boy was born weighing 1.8 kilos and in good health, The Local reports. A medic at the hospital said: 'Behind this joy, we can't forget the pain the family is feeling over the loss of this young woman.' Although it is rare, the astonishing procedure has succeeded in the past. In 1993, a baby boy was born more than three months after his mother was shot dead in the US. Trisha Marshall, of California, was just 17 weeks pregnant when she was killed in a botched robbery attempt after trying to threaten an armed amputee with a meat cleaver. Doctors kept the fetus alive for more than 100 days in her womb before disconnecting her ventilator after succesfully delivering the baby, The Baltimore Sun reports. In a similar case in Ireland this week, a pregnant woman, who has also been pronounced clinically dead, is being kept on life support, but against the wishes of her family, according to the Irish Independent. The 36-year-old woman, who has not been named, was 23 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to Milan's San Raffaele hospital (above) Rare technique: The woman was kept alive with equipment to keep her breathing and maintain blood flow - while a tube to her intestines fed the growing fetus . Doctors have so far refused to back down due to a ruling that gives the rights of mothers and their unborn children the same status. The woman had suffered a catastrophic internal injury resulting from a blood clot and was transferred to a specialist unit in Dublin - but doctors were unable to revive her. She was then taken back to the hospital she was first admitted to, which is now understood to be seeking legal advice on whether it can grant the parent’s request and turn her life-support machine off. Sources quoted by Irish media say the woman’s parents are also now considering mounting a legal challenge - against the decision not to switch off life-support. If the case proceeds to court, the state would be required to provide representation for the foetus .","Woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to hospital in Milan .

"Everton and Burnley are tracking Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod as they weigh up possible bids in the January transfer window. The Barclays Premier League clubs have both paid close attention to Macleod’s progress at Ibrox this season – which led this month to a Scotland call-up - and view him as a player with the potential to develop further south of the border. Goodison manager Roberto Martinez has enjoyed success recruiting from the Scottish scene in the past, signing James McCarthy and James McArthur from Hamilton during his time at Wigan. McCarthy followed him to Everton in a £12million deal while McArthur has since moved to Crystal Palace for £7m. Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod could be heading to the Premier League in the January transfer window . Macleod scores for Rangers against St Johnstone in the Scottish League Cup quarter-final . The 20-year-old's form for the Ibrox club this season has led to a first call up by Scotland . It’s understood the Merseyside club would look upon Macleod as one for the future should they decide to push ahead with a bid when the transfer window opens in the New Year. Burnley have also received glowing reports on the 20-year-old and could seek to lure him south to bolster their battle against the drop. Manager Sean Dyche has relied on UK talent after winning promotion from the Championship and already has former Falkirk midfielder Scott Arfield on his books. Back-to-back wins have recently lifted the Turf Moor outfit off the foot of the table and generated fresh hope of another season among the elite. Everton boss Roberto Martinez (left) has a good record of signing players from Scotland . Martinez brought James McCarthy (left) and James McArthur (right) from north of the border to Wigan . Macleod signed a five-year contract with Rangers in 2012, but the perilous financial situation at Ibrox could leave them vulnerable should offers be forthcoming. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has loaned the club £3m to plug the gap in the short-term, but it is not yet clear where the necessary fresh funding will come from at the end of the year. Ibrox manager Ally McCoist would be anxious to try to retain the star graduate of the club’s youth system, especially as Rangers now trail Hearts by nine points in the Championship standings after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat at Tynecastle. Burnley manager Sean Dyche is an advocate of giving young British talent a chance . Danny Ings scores against Stoke to give Burnley their second Premier League win of the season . Speaking earlier this month about potential interest in Macleod, however, McCoist admitted the money-men would have the final say. ‘Lewis is playing every week, enjoying his football and he is clearly developing and it goes without saying we want that to continue,’ he said. ‘I will be dictated to by the board and people who make decisions but certainly from a footballing point he is doing absolutely smashing and he is a key member of our squad.’ Meanwhile, Hearts defender Kevin McHattie is out until the new year after scans confirmed he had suffered a tear of his knee medial ligaments following Kenny Miller’s robust challenge in the weekend win over Rangers. The 21-year-old had been bracing himself for three months on the sidelines after being stretchered off in the 49th minute of Saturday’s 2-0 victory. Rangers Kenny Miller (third left) is cautioned for a robust tackle on Hearts' Kevin McHattie (right) As a result, McHattie has been ruled out until the new year with ligament damage . But boss Robbie Neilson admitted the prognosis could have been a lot worse and revealed the left-back will be out of action for nearer six weeks. ‘It is not good news but it is better than we had feared,’ he said. ‘We knew it was quite a bad one. No surgery is required, though, with rest being needed. He will be in a brace to begin with and will be missing for six weeks.’ Rangers striker Miller, who had already been booked, escaped further punishment from referee Craig Thomson. But the former Scotland star was immediately substituted by McCoist with the Ibrox side already a man down following Stevie Smith’s first-half red card for a reckless tackle on Callum Paterson.","Lewis Macleod is a target for Premier League sides Everton and Burnley .

"Former Liverpool FC player and manager Kenny Dalglish was questioned about drunk and ticketless fans 'prone' to violence . Former Liverpool FC player and manager Kenny Dalglish was questioned about drunk fans 'prone' to violence who would try to get into grounds without tickets when giving evidence at the Hillsborough inquests today. In a heated exchange, the barrister representing former Hillsborough match commander Superintendent David Duckenfield repeatedly asked Mr Dalglish about fan hooliganism. John Beggs QC quizzed the former manager about what he had written in his autobiography about ticketless fans 'bunking in' to games – prompting angry scenes at the inquests. Mr Dalglish was the team boss on the day the tragedy unfolded in April 1989 and broadcast a message to fans asking for calm at the request of South Yorkshire Police. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died from the crush at the Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way. Mr Beggs pointed out that in Mr Dalgish's 2010 book My Liverpool Home, he spoke of 'Scousers' climbing through windows and using ropes to get into Wembley Stadium. He write that the fans were 'bunking in to the most famous stadium in the world for the final of the oldest trophy in football' for the Liverpool v Everton FA Cup Final in 1986. Mr Beggs read another passage in which Mr Dalglish gave his reaction when the official attendance was given at the game - 98,000. 'I just laughed, as there must have been 110,000 crammed in, beneath the twin towers.' The barrister told the court, here was an 'icon' of the game of football, and especially to Liverpool fans, 'laughing at the fact they broke the law' by gaining entry to a football ground without tickets. Mr Dalglish said he laughed at the official attendance figures - not people allegedly 'bunking in'. Mr Dalglish was the team boss on the day the tragedy unfolded in April 1989 and broadcast a message to fans asking for calm at the request of South Yorkshire Police . Mr Beggs then moved on to a post-match Home Office report about the FA Cup Final in 1989, another all-Merseyside final, a month after the Hillsborough disaster. The report spoke of the 'sheer scale' of attempts to bunk in from fans from Merseyside, which was 'troubling'. Mr Dalglish said the 'clamber for tickets' for the all-Merseyside Cup Final was 'overwhelming' to 'show their unity and support for the families who had lost loved ones at Hillsborough'. The witness was then asked about what he had written in his book about the Heysel disaster of 1985 involving Liverpool fans in which 39 rival Juventus fans were killed. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died from the crush at the Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way . Mr Dalglish had written that only 'chicken wire' separated the groups of 'passionate' supporters which was inadequate. Mr Beggs continued: 'Are you not acknowledging that within the Liverpool supporters there was a cohort of supporters prone to violence?' 'No,' Mr Dalglish replied. Rajiv Menon QC, representing some of the families of victims of the disaster, also questioned the former manager about the behaviour and reputation of Liverpool fans in the 1980s. Mr Dalglish replied saying: 'I think Liverpool football fans, with that one exception, were very highly respected and revered. I think they were well known for the support they gave the team.' Pete Weatherby QC, also representing families, asked the witness if, in his opinion, there was 'no connection whatsoever' between what happened at Hillsborough and the Heysel disaster. Mr Dalglish replied: 'Heysel, it's people fighting and people have been arrested and charged and jailed.' Wearing a suit with a red and white striped tie and a '96' badge, Mr Dalglish also told the inquests there was no way he would have objected to a request to delay the kick off. The jury heard that Mr Dalglish arrived with his team at 1.30pm on the day and went straight to the dressing room where he remained until just before kick-off. When asked by Christina Lambert, counsel to the inquests about the six minutes between kick-off and the referee stopping play, Mr Dalglish said his focus was on the game. 'We were watching what we were doing during the game and making sure that we were organised and we were doing our job properly,' he said. He described the 'mayhem' at Hillsborough during the disaster. 'Nobody knew what was going on,' he told the inquests. 'There were stories coming from every angle.'

"England’s dramatic World Cup match with Uruguay was the most-watched TV programme of the year - although many viewers will wish they hadn’t bothered after our boys lost 2-1. Some 13.9million people watched the game on ITV1 in June, and it was followed by BBC1 shows The Great British Bake Off in October with 13.5million, and Sherlock in January with 12.7million. Also scoring highly for broadcasters were Britain’s Got Talent for ITV1 in April with 12.4million, and Germany’s 1-0 win against Argentina in the World Cup final in July on BBC1 with 12.1million.

England crashed out of the World Cup in Brazil one day after their defeat to Uruguay, whose two goals came from Luis Suarez, including an 85th-minute winner after Wayne Rooney had equalised. It was the first time England had been knocked out in the group stages since 1958, with their elimination confirmed a day after the Uruguay defeat, when Costa Rica beat Italy in another game. The figures on most-watched TV programmes came as it was revealed ITV viewing figures slumped more than any other channel this year as audiences deserted big hitting shows like The X Factor. A disastrous 2014 saw 8 per cent of its peak time viewers leave the channel, with it faring even worse two years ago when it had the excuse of the BBC’s London 2012 Olympics coverage. Hit talent show: Britain's Got Talent on ITV1 in April was fourth in the 2014 ratings list with 12.4million viewers . Victory: Germany’s 1-0 win against Argentina in the World Cup final in July on BBC1 had 12.1million viewers . In the jungle: I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here brought in 11.9million viewers for ITV1 last month . This year’s nosedive comes despite traditional ratings winners such as the World Cup, Coronation Street and I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Figures from trade body the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) for the journal Broadcast showed ITV was the big loser in audience ratings for the year to December 7. BBC1 and Channel 5 remained stable, while BBC2 and Channel 4 both recorded falls. ITV’s average audience across all hours was just 1.4million viewers, a 15.7 per cent share of the available audience. This is down 8 per cent on the 1.51million viewers - representing a 16.3 per cent share - in 2013 when it seemed to have recovered from the damage done by BBC coverage of the 2012 Olympics. This year’s X Factor audience averaged 8.5million and a 33.2 per cent share, compared to 9.2million and a 34.8 per cent share last year when Sam Bailey won. However, an ITV spokesman defended the channel’s performance, telling Broadcast: ‘In 2014 ITV broadcast 99.3 per cent of commercial programmes that attracted audiences over five million viewers. ‘We also had the most watched new drama series in Cilla, the most watched soap in Coronation Street, the most watched entertainment series in Britain’s Got Talent, and the highest rating comedy in Birds of a Feather.’ BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said: ‘Whoever would have thought a show about baking would be the highest rating show of the year outside of the World Cup?’","13.9m viewers watched England lose 2-1 to Uruguay on ITV1 in June .

"Most people pride themselves on trying to keep their homes - and themselves - clean and tidy. But new research undertaken by the Rug Doctor has suggested that we are perhaps not as house proud and sanitary as we would like people to think. Their new study of more than 2,000 people has shown that when it comes to making our beds over half of us will leave our dirty sheets on for weeks. The Rug Doctor has revealed that our houses are not as clean as we think they are with traces of horse and fox poo being found on the carpets of those surveyed . What's more, one third of people have said that they don't wash their hands after going to the toilet which directly increases the spread of germs around your property. The Rug Doctor also swabbed 30 carpets and shoes from a cross section of homes and found some pretty astonishing - not to mention disturbing - results. In fact you might want to put down your lunch before reading this. The carpets were found to contain traces of horse manure, fox poo, urine, vomit and tar as well as human and pet hair, pollen and traces of skin. The shoes that were swabbed were found to have high levels of bacteria as well as traces of animal and human gut and faecal bacteria. One third of us don't wash our towels every week, even though they can harbor harmful bacteria . The survey also found that one in ten don't wash their towels weekly and the same number do not brush their teeth twice a day. And only half of us - 53 per cent - shower or bathe once a day. Almost a third of pet owners admit they let their furry friends sleep in the bed with them, with more than 40 per cent saying they let them up on the sofa. Dr Pixie McKenna who presents the Embarrassing Bordies series revealed that she was shocked by the results of the Rug Doctor's survey . Dr Pixie McKenna from Embarrassing Bodies explained her horror at the results. She said, 'Rug Doctor's work to assess the nation's hygiene habits has thrown up some shocking stats, particularly how little care people take to remove bacteria and grime within their homes. 'Men are the worst offenders at not washing their hands after going to the toilet (38 per cent). 'But more worrying, is the fact that dangerous bugs like pneumonia and E Coli are being brought into our homes on the soles of our shoes. 'These are then trampled into the carpets by us not removing our shoes at the door. In fact, 41 per cent of people say they still don't intend to remove their footwear at the door, even though Rug Doctor has revealed the nasties lurking in their carpets. 'This is no laughing matter people of the UK poor hygiene at home risks your health!' Not only is it a case of dirt being brought into the house, but spills, stains and mishaps are adding to the ground-in grime in our carpets. More than a quarter - 28 per cent - of the UK's population has had a pet be sick on the flooring and 24 per cent have had a pet leave their mess. Furthermore nearly a third - 30 per cent - have had a baby or someone else be sick on their carpet and a quarter - 22 per cent - admit to having had sex on the floor. The Rug Doctor is a professional level carpet cleaning machine which wet cleans your floors getting deeper into the pile than a normal hoover clean would. They recommend that you wet clean your carpets at least twice a year in order to prevent the spread of germs.","Survey by the Rug Doctor reveals shocking truth about our dirty homes .

"Bum-bags, jelly shoes and thick glasses. There have been some surprising style revivals over the past few years and yet one trend remains baffling and that's the penchant for socks and sandals. For years they have been judged the lowest of the low when it comes to style mistakes and were recently voted the number one summer style faux pas in a poll by Swimwear365. However, thanks to certain sandal-and-sock-sporting celebrities (we mean you, Rita Ora, and you Bruce Willis), the trend is slowly trickling into the mainstream . Bruce Willis was spotted on the streets of LA in a pair of sturdy sandals and grey socks this week . Bruce was spotted this week wearing a pair of sensible suede sandals paired with rather woolly grey socks as he spent quality time with his daughter Mabel. And even celebrities without the dad status to defend their sock and sandal combo are happily jumping aboard the trend. Rita Ora is a repeat offender, seen rocking the trend on more than one occassion. Mary-Kate and Ashley Oslen arrived at JFK airport, New York in March this year in matching sandal and sock combos. Repeat offender: Rita Ora has been seen stepping out in the controversial trend on more than one occassion . Justin Bieber, David Beckham, Jake Gyllenhaal have all championed the style. And where celebrities lead, the rest of us follow - at least if new sales figures from a major department store are to be believed. High street retailer Debenhams, has seen a 68 per cent increase in sales of socks and sandals - though quite how they know they are being worn together is unclear - while purchases of bright short-sleeved shirts have soared by 72 per cent, completing the sad-dad ensemble. Two of a kind: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen took the trend one step further when they wore matching sandals and socks at New York's JFK airport in March . Grungy: The famously trendy Elle Fanning stepped out in the trend at this year's Sundance Film Festival (left), and Uma Thurman does a sloppy take on the look (right) This trend could simply be explained by the issue of comfort says personal stylist, Alain Mehada of Debenhams. 'We didn’t see it coming, but perhaps we should have done as let’s be honest there are fewer things more comfy than a solid well-made sandal and a soft pair of socks to stop them rubbing on bare skin. 'As for the shirts, who can resist a smile when someone walks past in a garishly bright short-sleeved top. It brightens up the day and reminds people of holidays and beach-side fun, even if they are stuck at home'. Alain added that female celebrities have helped to transform the fashion faux-pas into a true style staple. 'Teaming socks and sandals together provides comfort and style but the girls have taken this trend to the next level. 'Pastel socks with metallic sandals and printed socks with neutral sandals reflect the autumn winter 14 catwalk style as seen in runway shows such as Dior, Burberry and Hermes'. Hermes' ready to wear autumn/winter 2014 collection featured the infamous sandal and sock combo .","Known as the 'sad-dad' look, socks and sandals are making a stylish return .

"Getting arrested on shoplifting charges is no laughing matter, but a pair of friends from Florida have found something to smile about while posing for their booking photos. Cassandra Brown, 22, and Stephanie Brown, 23, were collared by police Thursday after being caught stuffing merchandise into their purses at the Ocala Wal-mart. According to police, after the two suspected thieves were ushered into the backseat of a squad car, they burst into a fit of giggles and continued sniggering the whole way to jail.

Shopping spree: The two women were caught trying to carry out more than $300 in merchandise stolen from a Florida Walmart . The arrest took place at around 16.30pm Thursday after the happy-go-lucky duo allegedly tried to leave the premises of the Wal-mart on Southwest 19th Avenue Road. Cassandra and Stephanie were stopped at the door by a loss prevention officer who allegedly discovered $313.30 worth of stolen items inside the women's bags. According to an arrest report cited by WKMG, Cassandra Brown at one point made an unprompted confession to the crime and explained her strange reaction to the arrest. The 22-year-old Ocala woman told police that she and her friend 'were not trying to be rude or come off as if they didn't care, but that they stole and now they were in trouble so there was nothing else to do other than laugh.'

"A marine clock used to help sailors take Charles Darwin around the world as he formed his theory of evolution has sold at auction for £100,000. The marine chronometer helped Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy navigate the HMS Beagle around the tip of South America and onwards to the Galapagos Islands during its 1831 to 1836 voyages. It was during this trip that Darwin, a budding naturalist, formed his  theory of evolution after noticing variations and similarities between living animals and what he believed were fossils of their extinct ancestors. The marine chronometer (pictured) was owned by Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy, who used it to sail across the world while his passenger Charles Darwin formed the theory of evolution . The clock (pictured) was used by the ship's captain to accurately calculate longitude in addition to latitude . The clock, mounted in its gimbled mahogany box case, was sold by at auction by Bonhams for £100,900. Its maker was the highly-regarded Robert Molyneux, a pupil of clockmaker Thomas Earnshaw who was famed for simplifying the production of chronometers. The revolutionary timepiece enabled sailors to accurately calculate longitude in addition to latitude - this allowed a level of accuracy for the British Admiralty ship not previously possible. It measures 3.25inches high, by 6.25in wide and 6.25in deep. The previously unrecorded marine chronometer performed so well during HMS Beagle voyages that the Admiralty purchased it from Vice Admiral FitzRoy in 1837. It was recorded as being used onboard HMS Irresistible when she was sunk by a mine in Turkey in 1916. It was later listed as lost. It then re-emerged during World War II onboard a ship used by the Russians on the Pacific route between the US and Vladivostok under the command of Anna Shetinina, said to be the first female commander of an ocean-going ship. The vendor’s uncle served as a radio operator and was given the chronometer at the end of the war. In turn he presented it to the current owner on his entry to the Vladivostok Marine School of Engineering in 1975. Darwin's book On the Origin of Species - written based on his findings during the five-year trip on the HMS Beagle - is considered the founding work of evolutionary theory. Published in 1859, it suggested that species with common ancestry evolve into diverse life forms over long periods of time. The clock was used by Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy (illustrated) during multiple voyages in the HMS Beagle. However, it was the ship's second trip which achieved the most fame, due to the research conducted by Darwin while on board . James Stratton, head of Bonhams’ clock department, said: 'This is a fine example of a 19th century chronometer in its own right, but its association with HMS Beagle and Darwin’s epic voyage makes it even more significant and desirable. 'It sold very strongly and we are delighted with the outcome.' The marine chronometer is the only surviving one from the Beagle voyages made by Robert Molyneux, a well respected chronometer maker. Chronometers was a technical breakthrough at the time as they allowed mariners to tell the time over long sea voyages by determining longitude by celestial navigation. The HMS Beagle (illustrated left), was used to take Charles Darwin (right) across the world in a five year voyage that formed the basis for his landmark theory of evolution . However, the value of the marine clock pales in comparison to that of Swiss firm Patek Philippe's 'Supercomplication', a 1925 timepiece that broke records when it sold last month for £15.1million. In total, the timepiece — with two clock faces, one on each side — has 24 complications. One shows the phases of the Moon, others the times of sunset and sunrise in New York and even the pattern of the stars each night above Mr Graves’s apartment in the city. There are complications revealing the days of the week, an alarm, a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar. The watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made, the ‘Holy Grail of Horology’. The 'Supercomplication' (pictured) is considered the most important watch ever made. It sold at auction last month for £15.1million .","The clock was used by Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy on board the HMS Beagle .

"A glimpse of what life was like for soldiers on the front line over the festive season has been revealed in a display of historic Christmas cards. The iconic Regimental cards were sent home to the UK by soldiers and highlight the pride and humour of the First World War over the festive period. The 100-year-old cards have gone on display today  at York Castle Museum as part of a Christmas display. Scroll down for video . A card wishing 'Hearty greetings', from 1917, features a snowy view from  the prisoner of war camp and was sent as propaganda to the families of prisoners back home- the cards were produced because people running the camps wanted families in Britain to think the prisoners were being treated fairly and humanely . The festive cards were professionally printed and highlight the pride, humour and propaganda of the First World War over the festive period . And the quintessentially British greeting cards include images such as a British bulldog, 'Somme pudding' and Father Christmas delivering alcohol. And one of the cards, which was sent by a prisoner of war, even seems to try and portray a positive slant on spending Christmas captured behind enemy lines. Another card shows a British soldier going over the top declares 'By Gum! Father Christmas!' with a large bearded man delivering bottles of alcohol. While one features a soldier marching to Berlin with the caption: '21 Division, Born 1914, still going strong - Christmas 1917.' Faye Prior, collections facilitator at York museums Trust, said: 'Regimental cards were not new to the First World War, but the growth of the regiments and the recruitment of Kitcheners' new armies meant the market for regimental cards grew exponentially. 'These cards often portrayed the dark humour and 'stiff upper lip' attitude which were strongly associated with British trench warfare. 'Cards were also produced by German prisoner of war camps, to try to convince British families that imprisoned soldiers were being treated well. The regimental cards, which were sent home to the UK by soldiers fighting one hundred years ago, have gone on display today at York Castle Museum including this showing a British soldier going over the top declares 'By Gum! Father Christmas!' with a large bearded man delivering bottles of alcohol . They were professionally printed and would have been sold to soldiers all over the world with slogans such as 'Born 1914 and still going strong' These historic Christmas cards show the humour and pride of the British troops despite the horrendous conditions many of them faced . 'In both cases the cards portrayed images that each side wanted to be put into the public domain.' The regimental cards were professionally printed and would have been sold to soldiers all over the world. Some of those on show include a British Tommy and a French soldier holding a circular bomb in the snow with the caption 'Somme' Pudding. There is also a British Bull Dog under the Union Jack with the caption 'And our Banner unfurled, Shall proclaim to the world, That there's life in the Old Dog yet.' The cards from the prisoner of war camp were produced by, or for, the camps, and were sent as propaganda to the families of prisoners back home. The cards were produced because people running the camps wanted families in Britain to think the prisoners were being treated fairly and humanely.

"A mother-of-four has been charged in Malaysia with the capital crime of drug trafficking, but her lawyers insisted she was duped into carrying a bag that appeared to contain only clothing. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 51, was on Friday provisionally charged with carrying 1.5kg of crystal meth in Kuala Lumpur airport, which carries a mandatory death sentence if she's convicted. Lawyers for the Sydney suburban mother say she is an innocent victim and her actions don't add up to that of a drug courier. Scroll down for video . Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, centre, escorted by the police as she leaves the lawyer's room after meeting her legal team at the magistrate court in Sepang, Malaysia on Wednesday . Despite the seriousness of her situation, Mrs Exposto appeared calm in court, dressed in a white shirt and denim overalls. Lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters her chance of acquittal was 'more than 50 per cent' because of evidence she had no knowledge of the drugs in the bag. The bag was handed to Mrs Exposto at the last minute as she was leaving Shanghai by a friend of her boyfriend, a US soldier serving in Afghanistan. She was there to execute documents for her boyfriend's retirement from service and was to return to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. When she looked inside the bag she saw only clothes. The drugs were stashed inside a secret compartment, and weren't heavy enough for her to notice a discrepancy, her lawyer said. She was travelling on Malaysian Airlines flight 387 when she was arrested last week at Kuala Lumpur airport . Exposto is accused of having 1.5kg of the drug ice in a backpack, an offence that could see her hanged . Exposto smiles after leaving her lawyer's room at Magistrate Court  in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur on Friday . 'She didn't have to put it through the scanner. If you have been through KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), not everybody is asked to put their bag (forward). Normally customs will select at random or on suspicion,' Mr Shafee told reporters. 'She wasn't even asked. 'If she was a person conscious of the contents, she would ... probably put the bag that was without the drugs.' Mrs Exposto was extremely concerned about the charges she faced. 'Her remark to me was, 'but I'm innocent',' he said. 'Very clearly, she said 'I'm innocent', and she exhibited a very good demeanour of a responsible mother. 'And she told me one thing, she said, ""I cannot be involved in this because I've told my children"". Even when they were growing up, if they ever got involved in drugs, she would personally kill them. She said that.' A relative of Mrs Exposto revealed the family's shock at hearing the news she had been arrested. Joao Noronha said the grandmother is his wife's auntie, and he and his family lived in her Cabramatta West home, in Sydney's south-west, for a year with their children. Mr Noronha refuses to believe Mrs Exposto willingly smuggled any drugs. 'It's not like her, the Maria that we have known for more than 20 years is not a drug user and not a drug dealer,' he told Daily Mail Australia from his home in Dili, East Timor earlier this month. 'I believe that my auntie is just a victim in this case. 'I believe that she does not even know types of drugs at this time like the 'ice',' he continued adding that he had never heard of the methamphetamine either. Exposto, 51, (C) sits in the lawyer's room in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur on Friday . The family of Exposto said they don't believe she knowingly tried to smuggle drugs out of Malaysia . Mrs Exposto has a 'nice, quiet' husband and four sons, who Mr Noronha described as 'good boys'. He described her as 'easy going, very friendly' and someone with many friends who enjoys making jokes. The grandmother-of-two stays with Mr Noronha and his wife Ladhy in their East Timor home when she comes to visit, and is very close to their family. 'Maria is very close to us in Timor, every time she comes to Timor she lives with us.' The lawyers had also received a petition from the woman's friends in East Timor, where she had worked for a group advocating against human trafficking. The Sydney woman will be held in a women's remand centre before her next court appearance on January 23 when the charges will be formalised. The last Australian to be executed in Malaysia for drug offences was Michael McAuliffe in 1993. Mr Noronha also said he doesn't think the grandmother even knows what the methamphetamine 'ice' is . The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers that she was innocent and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs .

"John Carmody and his dog Bruiser which the Royal Mail claim was spotted loose on the street. He claims his dog is always kept in a fenced off garden . A group of residents will go without Christmas deliveries this week after the mail service to their street was suspended because of a dog attack that occurred 17 months ago. Royal Mail has said residents of Copley Avenue, Meltham, must go to their nearest post office to collect their mail after it was claimed the dog responsible for the attack in 2013 was seen loose in the street. It is the second time deliveries to Copley Avenue have been suspended after postman Jason Lee was attacked. It closely resembles the situation of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, where mail deliveries have only just been restarted after a five-month suspension. Residents in the street were left fuming after having to trek to the nearest post office to collect their mail. John Carmody, 32, the owner of the dog in question on Copley Avenue, hit back at the suggestion made about his dog while labelling the actions of Royal Mail as 'ludicrous'. 'I have had my dog for over 10 years and he has never attacked anyone,' said Mr Carmody, whose dog, Bruiser, is an Irish Staffordshire cross bullmastiff. 'The incident was a one off and was probably preventable had the postman not pushed his post bag in his face. He has barked at the postman all his life, like many dogs do, but he has never even growled at people let alone attacked anyone before. 'It had been a warm summer day and we had all the doors and windows open when the postman came. I was told by the postmaster that he had only spoken to his staff to be more vigilant around houses with dogs that same day and to not enter if the door is open.' Despite the one-off incident, Royal Mail has again suspended its deliveries after it was claimed Mr Carmody's dog was seen roaming in the street. Mr Carmody said: 'He is never allowed to roam the streets and is always in a fenced-off garden. I am baffled by their decision. Why do it so close to Christmas? It happened well over a year ago and he is really not a nasty dog. Scroll down for video . Pictured is John Carmody  with his dog Bruiser (bottom right) and a group of neighbours whose Royal Mail services have been suspended . John Carmody and his son Alfie, 7, with Bruiser - who the Royal Mail claims was seen spotted loose . Mr Carmody added: 'He has been brought up with young children around him and has never bothered anyone. Royal Mail should have contacted me about this but I have not heard anything from them.' Mr Lee, however, was forced to undergo plastic surgery after suffering an injury to his arm following the attack on Copley Avenue. But as the dog and Mr Lee were on private property, no charges were ever brought against the animal's owner. As well as the stoppage in deliveries, residents are infuriated about having not been told about the decision by Royal Mail and only found out from an article in the local newspaper. Carol Morris, 52, a resident on the street for 34 years, said: 'I have been wondering where my post is. I had no idea deliveries had been stopped but it makes sense now. I have been awaiting important bills to pay. I just don't understand why they have decided to do this. 'John's dog is really nice and friendly. To be honest, we don't even see him a lot as he is not often out. I was shocked by what happened last year and I could not believe it was John's dog that was involved. It was just one unfortunate incident.' Residents on Copley Avenue (pictured) are infuriated after only discovering their mail had been suspended through an article in the local newspaper . A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have temporarily suspended deliveries to a number of addresses in Copley Avenue, Meltham, due to the threat of a dangerous dog being kept at a property being loose on the road. 'This dog has previously attacked a postman, leaving him with serious injuries, and is not currently being kept securely at the address. 'We have asked the dog owner to take the necessary steps to ensure the dog is kept securely within grounds of the property and is not able to roam free. We want to restore services to customers as soon as possible and will do so when as soon as this is addressed.' Jason Lee (pictured) had to take nine months off work after he was attacked by the dog in July last year . Mr Lee, 42, was left with a four inch gaping wound on his right arm and requiring stitches in his buttock after the dog pinned him to the ground and started 'tearing chunks' out of him while he carried out his daily round. After undergoing plastic surgery to repair his arm injuries, Mr Lee had to take nine months off work to recover. Mr Lee, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, a postie for 20 years, said: 'I knew about this dog and I'd been wary of it before because it looked dangerous and acted aggressively. 'I remember looking through into the living room where the dog's owner was and he was just lying on his sofa, relaxing. 'Then, as soon as I approached the door I saw this gigantic dog come around the corner and it just came flying towards my head. 'It wrestled with me and pinned me down on the floor and it was so big and strong that I couldn't move at all while it was tearing chunks out of me. 'I then felt the teeth sink into my buttock and I started shouting for help. It was the most painful thing that's ever happened to me. 'The owner then came out and startled the dog so I managed to run to safety. 'It all happened so quickly that I didn't even get a chance to think about what was happening. 'I just thought that this was the end and I wasn't going to survive.' These pictures show the horrific injuries sustained by Huddersfield postman Jason Lee following the attack .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Discredited vocational qualifications that teach basic career planning and even how to claim benefits will today be downgraded to push more students into traditional subjects.

She said it was ‘unimaginable’ they had been deemed equivalent to an AS-level in subjects such as physics or maths. Exams: Discredited vocational qualifications that teach basic career planning and even how to claim benefits will today be downgraded to push more students into traditional subjects (stock photograph) Schools and colleges have been encouraged to enter children for easy exams to boost their own performance rankings, leaving youngsters ill-equipped for the workplace. Mrs Morgan told the Mail it was ‘frankly ridiculous’ that personal effectiveness still existed as a stand alone qualification. She added: ‘I’ll strip out every poor-quality course to ensure [children] have access to the highest standard of qualifications.’ 'Frankly ridiculous': So-called ‘personal effectiveness’ courses will be removed from the list of approved qualifications by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) Personal effectiveness courses cover topics such as citizenship and work-related learning. Courses previously excluded from league tables include: .

"These pictures prove that it is not only humans that enjoy a rich and varied diet. Hidden cameras captured these remarkable images among the treetops of sea eagles dining on lamb, rabbit, fish and even a gosling. As part of the Forestry Commission project nearly 7,000 covert images were taken of the nest in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland during the 2014 breeding season. Despite their name, the birds of prey feasted on only seven fish during the seven month period, but brought back a total of nine lambs  for dinner. Dinner time: A pair of sea eagles enjoy a fish super in their treetop nest . The hidden camera captured the sea eagles eating a tiny baby gosling . During the 2014 breeding season the birds of prey were captured dining on nine lambs . The sea eagles brought 117 prey items back to the nest between January and July. The images were captured by a hidden camera installed among the trees as part of a Forestry Commission project . After looking at thousands of photographs it was confirmed that the sea eagles returned to their nest with 117 prey items between January and July. Analysis confirmed that 67 items were unidentifiable, 21 were mammals, 14 were birds, seven were fish, and  up to nine were lambs. The Scottish sea eagles were close to extinction in the late 19th and early 20th century, but following a reintroduction programme in 1975 there are now thought to be more than 80 breeding pairs. The research appears to confirm farmers' concerns about the extent to which sea eagles are preying on lambs. In 2008 farmers on the Gairloch peninsula, in the Scottish Highlands, claimed 200 lambs were taken in just one season. But conservationists have insisted sea eagles preying in lambs in a rare occurrence. The findings were revealed at the first meeting of the sea eagle stakeholder group, which was set up after repeated complaints about the birds from farmers. Lachie Maclean, interim chair of the group, said: 'This is a useful piece of research which will help feed into the wider discussions about managing sea eagles in our area. 'The survey gives us a better idea of when lambs are more likely to be part of sea eagles' diets.' The hidden cameras were disguised under a piece of pre-prepared bark and rubbed with mud. A spokesman for the Forestry Commission Scotland, which led the undercover camera project, said he believed it was the first time images like these have ever been taken in Scotland.","Hidden camera captures 7,000 images of sea eagles in their nest in Argyll .

"Vladimir Putin mistakenly thought that a journalist who has survived two strokes was attending a press conference drunk, it has emerged. Vladimir Mamatov slurred his words slightly as he spoke to the Russian president during the televised event in Moscow today, prompting Putin to quip that he had been drinking. But it was later reported that Mr Mamatov is a stroke victim, and had suffered a head injury. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Mamatov (left) slurred his words slightly as he spoke to the Russian president during the televised event in Moscow today, prompting Russian president Vladimir Putin (right) to quip that he had been drinking . Speaking at the leader's annual press conference, the reporter asked Putin about why kvas - a mildly alcoholic fermented drink - could not compete with other soft drinks in local supermarkets. In response, Putin joked, 'I see you've already partaken in your kvas,' according to journalist Alec Luhn, prompting the audience to erupt with laughter. Mr Mamatov, who is from Kirov, a region known for its production of the drink, explained that he wanted to bring some of the drink in for Putin to taste, but that security would not allow it. He said: 'I got it. You do not have a taster. My question is this. We make a lot of this kvas, we make it well and for long time.' Speaking at the leader's annual press conference, the reporter (pictured) asked Putin about why kvas - a mildly alcoholic fermented drink - could not compete with other soft drinks in local supermarkets . In response, Putin  joked, 'I see you've already partaken in your kvas,' according to journalist Alec Luhn, prompting the audience to erupt with laughter. It was later revealed the man speaking was a stroke survivor . 'Yes, I see this', Putin said, chuckling. He then went on to praise the journalist's question. But Russian media was quick to correct the president, with Russia Today tweeting a correction to his comment about Mr Mamatov's drinking. Posting on the news channel's official Twitter account, it said: 'Correction: Kirov journo who asked #Putin about #kvas NOT drunk - survived multiple strokes'. Russian news sites LifeNews and Gazeta also reported, after an interview with a colleague, that the journalist in question was not drunk, but the survivor of two strokes and a head injury. But Russian media was quick to correct the president (pictured) with Russia Today tweeting a correction to his comment about Mr Mamatov's drinking. Putin also spoke about his love life at the conference . Also at the press conference, Putin admitted he is in love, fuelling rumours over a relationship with Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva. Denying he had 'completely gone wild' in his romantic life, the divorced strongman revealed  that he 'loves' and is loved in return, but refused to disclose the identity of his mystery partner. The subject of Putin's private life has been seen as taboo in Moscow but today he was asked by a journalist  if he had time for the opposite sex.","Vladimir Mamatov slurred his words slightly at Moscow press conference .

"A virtually unseen Paul Cezanne painting owned by Henry Ford's son Edsel has sold for a high of $100 million. The early 20th century oil work titled La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir, which depicts a mountain range in the south of France, was snapped up by a private collector who chose not to be named. It was part a private collection at the former residence of Edsel Ford and his wife Eleanor in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, which now operates as a non-profit museum. Going, going, gone: This virtually unseen Paul Cezanne painting titled La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir, owned by Henry Ford's son Edsel, has sold for a high of $100 million . According to The Detroit News, tax forms listing the sale show the couple originally bought the painting for $242,000. It has reportedly only appeared publicly outside the Ford House twice in the past 60 years - once at a 1978 exhibition in Paris and later in a 1990 show in Edinburgh, Scotland. Edsel & Eleanor Ford House president, Kathleen Mullins,  told the Detroit Free Press that the board of trustees received an unsolicited offer for the painting in mid-2013 but turned it down. However, the buyer came back with other proposals and the Ford House's board, which includes Ford descendants and the family's lawyer, gave the idea more consideration. 'This was really a once-in-a-lifetime offer,' Mullins said. 'The family thought it was a way to guarantee the estate would be taken care of the way Eleanor would have wanted.' Eleanor Ford, who died in 1976 - 33 years after her husband - wanted their property be used for 'the benefit of the public'. Former home: This undated photo provided by the Edsel & Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, shows the Cezanne painting on display . It was the former home of Edsel and Eleanor Ford (pictured) and now operates as a museum - proceeds from the Cezanne sale will be used to create a special endowment for preservation, conservation and restoration . Mullins said the Cezanne sale was done within the legal terms of Eleanor's will and the board is not selling more art. The buyer of the Cezanne painting also reportedly wanted a watercolor by the French artist in the Ford collection but the board said no. The 2013 La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir deal was kept secret to help protect Detroit-owned artworks under threat during the city's bankruptcy trial. In the end, a $800 million promise from foundations, major corporations and the state helped protect art from possible sale. The Ford House, which is on solid financial footing and carries no debt, is using proceeds from the sale to create a special endowment for preservation, conservation and restoration. It includes the 87-acre estate of auto industry pioneer Henry Ford's only son on the shores of Lake St. Clair as well as furnishings and objects inside the mansion. The cultural institute, which draws about 60,000 visitors a year for tours and events, has a separate operating endowment of $86 million.","The early 20th century oil work titled La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir, depicts a mountain range in the south of France .

"The widow of a British gemstone expert has spoken of her agony after her 71-year-old husband was stabbed to death by a hired mob armed with clubs, spears and bows and arrows in Kenya. Judith Bridges’ husband Campbell Bridges was attacked by a horde of up to 30 armed assassins in a dispute over mining territory at his ranch near the town of Voi, 170km (110 miles) north of the Kenyan port city of Mombasa. He was knifed in the chest by the mercenary thugs on a dirt road in front of his son Bruce, who took a blow to the neck from a machete as he fought desperately to protect his 71-year-old father. Judith with her husband Campbell Bridges in 2009. Four of his killers have at last been sentenced . Mrs Bridges addresses the court in Mombasa where the family finally got justice for the death of her husband . Left to right: murderers Mohammed Dadi Kokane, Alfred Njuruka Makoko, Samuel Mwagainia and James Mwita are sentenced to a total of 160 years in prison by Judge Maureen Odero on Friday . Campbell Bridges was stabbed in the chest after he was set-upon by an armed mob . After a five-and-half year battle for justice, hampered by the same politicians the Bridges family accuses of involvement in Campbell’s killing, four of the gang were on Friday each sentenced to 40 years in prison for Campbell’s murder on August 11, 2009. The family say they were put up to it by local politicians keen to muscle-in on Campbell's lucrative mining operations First Green Garnet Mining Company and Bridges Exploration Limited. These figures resented the success of a ‘muzungu’, or white man, even though he was known for treating his workers well. In the lead-up to the attack jealous 'claim-jumpers' had been digging illegal trenches on Campbell's land, looking to mine the gems for themselves. On the day itself father and son were travelling in a pick-up truck along with four guards when they were ambushed by a heavily-armed posse in the grounds of Campbell's 600-acre ranch. Brandishing sticks, spears and machetes, the mob set upon Campbell, who managed to dodge a blow from a spear but was then stabbed by another knife-wielding attacker. The first thug with the spear was about to try and stab Campbell again but Bruce hit him with a club. Bruce then parried a blow from another man armed with a machete but sustained a gash to the neck. Finally the killers ran off but it was too late for Campbell, who lay dying from a gaping wound in his chest. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Judith broke down as she wrestled with her still raw anguish at the brutal loss of the man to whom she was married for nearly 40 years. Speaking from Kenya, where she still lives for half of the year, the grandmother-of-two said: ‘When I remember him it’s hard, the pain never goes away. It’s very lonely. ‘I miss his curiosity, his enthusiasm and his creativity. ‘He wrote music, he wrote lyrics or he could write a lovely article for a magazine. Campbell Bridges' son Bruce (third from right) was present to see his fathers' killers sentenced . The bridges leave court with their lawyer Philip Murgor in the foreground . ‘He always saw something beautiful in nature and everywhere he went he could find something positive.’ Campbell was born in London to a Scottish mother and an English father, who was chief geologist for the Central Mining and Investment Corporation in South Africa. This lifelong connection to the continent deepened when Campbell went to study at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg before going to work in Tanganyika's gemstone mines. His case has sparked fears for other legitimate foreign business-owners in Kenya at a lack of protection from police and local authorities when corrupt politicians go after their interests. Though they denied murdering Mr Bridges Mohamed Dadi Kokone 42, Alfred Makoko Njuruka 58, Samwel Machala 49 and James Chacha 56, were sentenced to a total of 160 years in prison on Friday. Judith said: ‘If it sends a message to the people in the country and the cartels that bully and intimidate and kill people that have legitimate businesses because they want to take them, my husband would have been pleased. ‘There has to be accountability in any society otherwise the gangsters are going to run it. ‘That is one thing Kenya is struggling with, to bring people to book and making it stick. ‘Otherwise the people who are creating things and doing things to build society like my husband are annihilated.’ Campbell was well-known in geological circles for discovering the green Tsavorite gemstone in 1967 in bushland on the Kenyan border with Tanzania.","Judith Bridges’ husband Campbell Bridges was stabbed to death in 2009 .

"Two Latvian men accused of exploiting migrant workers have been found guilty of taking part in an illegal gangmastering operation. Ivars Mezals, 28, and Juris Valujevs, 36, allegedly used fear and debt to control workers who sometimes received less than £1 for a week for 'back-breaking' work picking vegetables in Cambridgeshire. The migrant workers, who were mainly from Latvia and Lithuania, travelled to the UK voluntarily, but signed up for Mezals and Valujevs under the promise of well-paid work, decent accommodation and the 'hope of a better life', prosecutor Gregory Perrins told Blackfriars Crown Court. But instead they were forced to live in cramped and dilapidated homes, paid fines for 'fanciful' reasons including smoking and were threatened if they complained, he added. Ivars Mezals (left) and Juris Valujevs (right) have been convicted of taking part in illegal gangmastering operation in relation to farm workers in Cambridgeshire who were allegedly paid as little as £1 a week . Work was distributed at the whim of those in control, and the workers fell into debt, the court heard. Mezals and Valujevs were each found guilty yesterday of acting as a gangmaster without a licence between January 2009 and October 2013, though for legal reasons the verdict can only be reported today. The jury cleared Mezals of a charge of conspiracy to breach UK immigration law by arranging sham marriages. But it could not reach verdicts against Valujevs, Valujevs' wife Oksana Valujeva, 33, and their friend Lauma Vankova, 26, on that charge. Mezals, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and Valujevs, Valujeva and Vankova, all from King's Lynn, Norfolk, were arrested in October last year in raids led by Cambridgeshire Police. Jurors in the nine-week trial have been considering their verdicts since last Thursday. Judge David Richardson ordered that Mezals and Valujevs should be found not guilty of a charge of fraud. The jury could not reach verdicts against Lauma Vankova (left) and Valujev's wife Oksana Valujeva (right) Describing the vegetable picking set-up, Mr Perrins said: 'Debt was used as a means of control, preventing [workers] from leaving or living elsewhere. 'When work was provided, it was hard and back-breaking. Even so, wages were withheld on the basis that it went to clear the purported debt. 'Workers were typically left with £20 a week, even after working all week in the fields. Sometimes people were given less than a pound for a week's work. 'Women's purported debt often appeared to be higher than their male co-workers. Such women were offered the opportunity to clear their debts if they entered into sham marriages.' One woman was fined £100 a day when she was unable to work because her child was ill, the court heard. Migrants who complained about their unfair debt were told if 'you don't pay, your life will be ended like Alisa [Dmitrijeva's]'. Workers were allegedly told they would 'end up like Alisa Dmitrijeva' if they did not pay their debts. Alisa was found dead on arable land  near Sandringham in January 2012 . It was a reference to the Latvian teenager found murdered on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, in 2012, the jury heard. Since 2005, potential gangmasters must obtain a licence to supply workers to businesses, which are usually agricultural farms in need of casual and cheap labour at short notice, and must oblige by a code of ethics. Mr Perrins said: 'However, this case is not simply about supplying workers without the requisite licence. 'At its heart, this case is about how these workers were treated. It is the Crown's case that they were deliberately and systemically exploited, manipulated and intimidated. 'They were treated without dignity, without respect and without compassion. The defendants saw them solely as a mean of making money. And large sums of money at that.' During the opening of the trial, the jury heard that Valujevs denied any involvement with gangmasters or the exploitation of migrant workers, while Mezals claimed he put friends coming to the UK in touch with legitimate gangmasters. All denied the accusation about sham marriages. Mr Perrins said the prosecution may apply for a retrial on the conspiracy charge. Detective Chief Inspector Donna Wass, who led the investigation, said: 'Valujevs and Mezals ran an illegal operation that left many people in abject poverty and debt and a feeling there was no way out of their situation. 'The defendants promised their victims a better life in the United Kingdom with well-paid work, but instead placed them in overcrowded accommodation and controlled their work and debt. 'They ruled through fear - playing on their reputations to ensure their workers stayed in line and did not seek outside help - and approached the exploitation of people as a business opportunity. 'I hope the outcome of this case shows how seriously we take these matters and will encourage other victims of exploitation to contact police.'","Workers came to Britain legitimately before being snared by Latvian pair .

Kevin Campbell  was ordered to stay away from Lynsey McGarrigle, 30, as part of his  bail conditions following the allegations of assault and threatening behaviour. But the court agreed to lift the order just in time for the big day and the couple tied the knot in Greenock, Inverclyde earlier this week. Kevin Campbell (right) was ordered to stay away from Lynsey McGarrigle (left) 30, as part of his strict bail conditions following the allegations of assault and threatening behaviour . Sheriff Ian Fleming agreed to waive the ban, with a warning to Campbell to 'behave' after hearing the couple were desperate to see each other. Drug addict Campbell, who describes himself as ‘self employed' on his Facebook page, told the Daily Record he was 'over the moon' to finally marry his girlfriend who describes herself as a ‘full time lazy b****.' 'I got the conditions lifted so we could get married. I'm very happy,' added the 36-year-old who said the couple were now hoping to honeymoon in Spain. But he did complain the bail conditions were 'too much.' 'The sheriff hasn't been good to me at all,' he added. But the court agreed to lift the order just in time for the big day and the couple tied the knot in Greenock, Inverclyde earlier this week (pictured with the caption 'Geez a winch baby') Pictures of their big day on  Cambell's Facebook page had captions such as 'really happy' The couple began dating in March this year. But in May, Campbell, who is on a high-dose methadone programme, was arrested for the alleged attack on her. Campbell was charged with threatening Lynsey and pushing her onto a sofa before punching her repeatedly in a row at her flat. He is due to stand trial on the charges of assaulting and threatening her in March. Campbell denies both charges. Despite the allegations, the couple had been unable to keep apart and police found him at her flat on two occasions - once hiding under a mattress. He was sentenced to 12 months' community supervision and 70 hours' unpaid work for the breaches. Since breaching the order, Campbell last week requested his bail conditions to be relaxed to allow him to marry. Prosecutor Pamela Brady said: 'The Crown doesn't wish to be standing in the way of a marriage but it is somewhat difficult given the nature of the charges. 'There is a difficult balance to be struck. 'The court can clearly see the nature of the charges.' Lifting the ban, Sheriff Fleming said: 'Yes, but I understand the court has imposed a bail condition that the complainer doesn't want.'

"Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was given 18 months over the ill-treatment of four patients at Roundstone Care Residential Home in Filey, North Yorkshire . A care home boss branded a female 'Darth Vader' for turning the lives of dementia sufferers into a 'nightmare' was today jailed for 18 months. Sentencing Siobhan Koralewski, 30, Judge Howard Crowson warned that patients mistreated in care homes were becoming Britain's 'voiceless victims'. Ms Koralewski was last month found guilty of five counts of neglect and ill-treatment of four patients in the Roundstone Care Home in Filey, North Yorkshire, where she worked as a senior carer. Ms Koralewski bit one 88-year-old man between the legs and pulled a 'wedgie' on another patient in the care home which promised specialist treatment for dementia sufferers. Judge Crowson said her behaviour towards the various patients had been 'disgraceful, demeaning and persistent'. He hoped conditions of her release would prevent her working in the care industry ever again. Judge Crowson added he was concerned there are still no guidelines for dealing with those who betray the trust of relatives and abuse vulnerable people in care. He said to determine his sentence he had to rely on previous cases where care workers had been jailed for abuse - which involved 'short lived' ill-treatment of patients. Judge Crowson told Ms Koralewski: 'It seems to me your behaviour exceeded any of these cases.' He added: 'These victims are essentially voiceless.' The mistreatment came to light after Ms Koralewski's brother, Jeremy, had raised the alarm over the mistreatment at Roundstone Care Home where he worked as a cook. Judge Crowson told Durham Crown Court: 'He bravely informed against his mother and sister and destroyed his parents' dream of running a care home to do the right thing.' Ms Koralewski's mother, Margaret, 67, was also accused of the ill-treatment of the four patients but was cleared of all five charges. During her original trial at Teesside Crown Court, a jury heard how dementia sufferers were mocked, humiliated, and physically abused by Siobhan Koralewski in 2012. In one case, the court heard she decided to 'take revenge' on Kenneth Pinkney, 88,for striking her 67-year-old mother, Margaret, and breaking her shoulder. She ripped her top off and danced around him in a vest 'waving her breasts in his face' before hauling him out his chair and biting him between the legs, the jury heard. Later, Ms Koralewski forced Mr Pinkney in the passenger seat of her car and drove him to Cross Lane Psychiatric Hospital in Scarborough. She had fastened his seatbelt tight and had the window fully open  so he got cold. Ms Koralewski then kneed him in the back of the legs to force him to walk in front of horrified nurses. She often forced another dementia sufferer, Elizabeth Hall, 59, to down a cocktail of the dregs of her daily tea. Siobhan Koralewski (pictured to the right), accompanied by her mother Margaret, 67, at Durham Crown Court today. Margaret was also accused of mistreating the four patients but was later cleared of all the charges . Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was found guilty of subjecting dementia patients to physical abuse at care home . When Ms Hall screamed in protest, Ms Koralewski put a hand over her mouth and told her to 'shut up' before pulling a 'wedgie' on her to force her to move. Ms Koralewski then pushed Ms Hall along the floor hard with her foot to the patient's bedroom door. On another occasion, she stuffed toilet paper she found in her trousers in Ms Hall's mouth to make her shut up. In another act of ill-treament, Ms Koralewski walked a trembling stroke victim Harold Waller, 91, by using her knee to move him while she held him up. Ms Koralewski was also seen dragging Joan Normington, 92, out of her chair and 'frogmarching' the patient to her room. Jeremy Koralewski, right, with his partner Jennifer Price, has revealed he has lost everything since reporting his sister for her cruelty to patients at the family-run care home where he worked as a chef . Margaret Koralewski had acquired Roundstone Care Home with her husband Raymond in 2004. Their daughter Siobhan worked there as a senior carer and deputy manager. In a statement read out in court  by Amanda Marshall, whose father Kenneth Pinkney was ill-treated by Ms Koralewski, she said she only learned about his mistreatment after his funeral. Ms Marshall told Durham Crown Court: 'The nature of the abuse will stay with me all my life - especially since he was moved into that home to keep him safe and out of danger because they were dementia champions.' Margaret Koralewski, 67, was cleared of all four charges against her but has cut contact with son . Another victim statement by Miss Hall's sister, Bessie Grainger, said the decision to place her into care had been 'agonising'. After learning how her mother was mistreated in Roundstone Care Home, which has since closed, she said she was still tormented by guilt. Ms Hall is now resident in another home. Ms Grainger said: 'We have struggled to come to terms with what Elizabeth has suffered. The trauma in unimaginable.' She added: 'I desperately want this to be a nightmare which never happened.' Siobhan and Margaret had both denied a total of nine charges involving ill-treating the four residents. Siobhan was found guilty on five counts at Teesside Crown Court last month. Margaret was cleared of all four charges against her and appeared in court on crutches yesterday following a fall to see her daughter sentenced at Durham Crown Court. There was applause from the victims' families who packed the public gallery as Ms Koralewski was led away. Mrs Grainger shouted 'thank you your lordship'. Ms Hall's niece, Jan Thompson, 50, said outside the court: 'She is an animal.' Another niece, Julie Harrison, 57, added: 'Elizabeth was brought up by a loving family and this woman has ruined it all. 'We have been to hell and back.' Det Sgt Mike Moorhouse, who was involved in the police investigation, said: 'She was a Darth Vader-type character within the home to residents and staff who were not in favour with her. 'She was quite a menacing character. This menacing conduct spilled over into assaults and degrading behaviour towards the residents. He praised the whistle-blowers - Jeremy and his partner Jennifer Price, who was a care worker. Det Sgt Moorhouse added: 'It's important to acknowledge their bravery and courage. It was at great cost to themselves personally that they ensured the safety and welfare of the residents.' Paul Newcome, defending Ms Koralewski, told the court: 'My client worked as a carer for seven years before there was any difficulty. 'During that time we would submit she was completely devoted to the residents and committed many acts of kindness to those residents apart from their daily care.' In November 2012, police went to the Roundstone Care Home and arrested both Siobhan and Margaret. Both denied a total of nine charges over the ill-treatment of patients. Margaret was cleared of all the charges. During the seven-day trial in Teesside Crown Court, Siobhan showed no emotion - and continued to chew gum in the dock both before and after the jury found her guilty on five counts. Det Sgt Mike Moorhouse said after the verdicts: 'The evidence suggests she was a Darth Vader-type character within the home to residents and staff who were not in favour with her. 'She was quite a menacing character. This menacing conduct spilled over into assaults and degrading behaviour towards the residents.' He praised the whistle-blowers - Siobhan's brother Jeremy, who worked as a cook at the home, and his partner Jennifer Price, who was a care worker. Both lost their jobs and ended up at loggerheads with the Koralewski family after raising the alarm. Det Sgt Moorhouse added: 'It's important to acknowledge their bravery and courage. It was at great cost to themselves personally that they ensured the safety and welfare of the residents.'","Siobhan Koralewski, 30, given 18 months for mistreatment of four patients .

"A pet refuge in Utah has said it wants to adopt Bela, the dog whose owner willed him to be put down after her death. But Connie Lay's cousin, the executor of the estate, hasn't decided to spare the German shepherd's life, WXIX-TV reports. In the meantime, volunteers and workers at the PAWS Humane Center have fallen in love with Bela - but are powerless to save him if Lay's cousin decides he should die. Cruel fate: Bela is due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month . When Ms Lay died at her home in Aurora, Indiana, she stipulated in her will that Bela should be given to her cousin, who is the executor of her estate. If the cousin didn't want to take him, then he should be sent to the Best Friends Animal Society in southern Utah. Ms Lay's cousin has no interest in keeping Bela, Doug Denmure, the attorney in charge of the will, told the Cincinnati Enquirer. And Ms Lay neither contacted Best Friends refuge nor did she set aside money to send her pet to the shelter. So now Bela is in danger of falling victim to the final provision of Ms Lay's will - that he be euthanized and cremated and his ashes mixed with Ms Lay's. The Best Friends Animal Society issued a statement to WXIX on Tuesday saying: 'We want to save Bela's life and bring him to our sanctuary, but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands. Bela is currently being boarded at the PAWS Humane Center while he awaits his fate. Several families have offered to adopt him . 'The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley's will and we are hopeful that she will agree. Please be patient as we educate her about Best Friends life-saving mission and demonstrate that Bela will be in good hands.' Ms Lay's cousin still hasn't decided to send Bela to the shelter. Hundreds of people have tweeted out with the hashtag #savebela since the story of his plight went public. Dozens of families have offered to adopt the pooch. However Mr Denmure, Ms Lay's lawyer, says only the executor of her estate has authority to decide his fate. 'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' Doug Denmure told WCPO-TV. 'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.' Under Indiana law, pets and other animals are considered property. Owners must treat them humanely, but otherwise get allowed to decide whether they live or die. Lay died on November 25 - but before her death she made arrangements with her lawyer and a close friend to 'dispose' of all her property  - including Bela. Mr Denmure told WCPO that the dog is aggressive and that Ms Lay kept a record of his aggressive behavior before she died. When she passed away at her home, Bela fiercely guarded her body and would not let anyone enter the house. However, volunteers who have worked with Bela since he was taken to the shelter say that he hasn't shown signs of being overly aggressive, according to WXIX-TV.","Connie Lay died on November 25 and stipulated in her will that her dog Bela be euthanized, cremated and his remains mixed with hers .

"First steps, first words, first birthdays. One camcorder captured every little moment of Mark Christini's young Pennsylvania family from 1995 to 1998. When he left it - and a bag of tapes - on a New Jersey beach during a holiday, they consigned themselves to the fact that all was lost. But now, 16 years later, every single tape has been discovered in the disused attic of office owned by Jenkinson's Boardwalk, the beach. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"Alex Salmond's Scottish Nationalist MPs could vote on English laws to prop up a Labour government. The former First Minister has hinted that the SNP would be prepared to ditch the long-standing convention that its MPs do not vote on laws that only affect England. Instead they would take part in Commons votes to help Ed Miliband pass laws if Labour falls short of an overall majority in next year's election. Alex Salmond suggested SNP MPs could vote on English laws to prop up a Labour government . Mr Salmond formally stepped down as SNP leader and First Minister last month after voters in Scotland rejected his dream of independence in September's referendum. He announced earlier this month his bid to return to Westminster and was unveiled as a candidate for the SNP nomination for the Gordon constituency in Aberdeenshire. Mr Salmond hopes to steal the seat from the Liberal Democrats, with current Lib Dem MP Sir Malcolm Bruce retiring in May. Some polls have put the SNP on course to win dozens of seats from Labour, leaving Mr Miliband with a rump of just a handful of MPs north of the border. Such a result would shatter his hopes of securing a majority in May next year, forcing him to rely on other parties for support. However, with the Conservatives likely to have the most MPs in England, it would be difficult for a Labour government to pass laws without the support of the SNP – whether in a coalition or a confidence and supply deal. Such an arrangement, which could see SNP MPs rethink their practice of abstaining in English-only legislation at Westminster, would be on a 'vote by vote' basis. Polls suggest Ed Miliband could be left with a rump of just a handful of MPs north of the border . Mr Salmond pointed to two pieces of legislation not directly affecting Scotland which he opposed when he was an MP: the introduction of foundation hospitals and tuition fees. He told The Independent: 'There will be many things that come across the Westminster desk that would be of little moment to Scottish people, but will be of great moment to the government of the day.' Mr Salmond said he would 'lay odds' on a balanced parliament, also known as a hung parliament, which occurs when no party secures an absolute majority of seats. 'That's an opportunity to have delivered to Scotland what we have been promised,' he said. Last month, Mr Salmond formally stepped down as SNP leader and First Minister following September's independence referendum result. He announced earlier this month his bid to return to Westminster and was unveiled as a candidate for the SNP nomination for the Gordon constituency in Aberdeenshire. Mr Salmond hopes to steal the seat from the Liberal Democrats, with current Lib Dem MP Sir Malcolm Bruce retiring in May. The former first minister told the Independent that a 'barrel-load' of SNP MPs would win seats at the 2015 general election. He added that the SNP's key objectives in any negotiations at Westminster after the election would be to ensure the UK's political leaders keep their pledge to transfer powers to Scotland. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he could do a deal with Labour after the election . Nigel Farage has made it clear that he would be ready to do a deal with Labour if Ukip holds the balance of power after next year's general election, but said 'It wouldn't be easy'. The Ukip leader has previously said that he would 'do a deal with the devil' in order to secure British exit from the European Union. Speaking on LBC radio, he made clear that any agreement to go into coalition or support a minority government would depend on the parliamentary arithmetic produced by the election next May, rather than by his political sympathy with either of the major parties. While insisting that he disagreed with Labour leader Ed Miliband on most subjects, Mr Farage said he would be ready to 'do a deal with somebody that I otherwise wouldn't normally do' if it meant restoring the UK's ability to govern itself. 'We are facing, in four-and-a-half months' time, the most uncertain general election that we've seen for many, many decades in this country,' said Mr Farage. 'All the balls are up in the air, chiefly because of the effect Ukip has had on politics. 'Either the Conservatives or the Labour Party will emerge as the biggest party after that election. 'Given our constitutional history and precedent, the monarch would expect the larger of the two parties to attempt to form either a formal coalition or some kind of support mechanism or deal where you can actually have a government there that can get a Budget through Parliament. 'If we find ourselves - and it's an if, of course it is - in a position where we actually do hold the balance of power, whilst everybody thinks it's more likely that it's David Cameron who would need Ukip support, it's not absolutely impossible that it could be Ed Miliband. 'But I disagree with almost everything Mr Miliband stands for and it wouldn't be easy.'","Former First Minister suggests SNP could ditch convention to avoid votes .

"Plans for a 4,000-seater stadium in the exclusive Sandbanks resort in Dorset has sparked uproar among its furious millionaire residents. The £12million arena, which would host beach sports like volleyball and football, would be on prime development land in what is one of the most expensive places to live in the UK outside of London. Property developer and former Bournemouth FC chairman, Eddie Mitchell, is behind the project, which will include shops, beach studios, restaurants, offices and a 450-space car park. Scroll down for video . The millionaire residents of Sandbanks have expressed their fury over plans for a 4,000-seater stadium . The £12million arena would host beach sports like volleyball and football as well as a 450-space car park . Mr Mitchell, 60 said he came up with idea for the stadium after years of under-investment of public facilities on the Sandbanks peninsula, in Poole Harbour. The area is reputed to be the fourth most expensive place in the world to buy real estate, behind New York, Moscow and London and some waterfront mansions have sold for up to £10million. Its high-profile residents include Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden and Body Shop investor Ian McGlinn. Earlier this year Mr Mitchell revealed plans to turn the same area of council-owned land into an ultra-modern holiday destination like a 'mini-Dubai'. Those plans included a 33-storey sports tower for abseiling and bungee jumping, a hotel shaped like a seagull, a marina and a helicopter landing pad. Property developer and former Bournemouth FC chairman, Eddie Mitchell, is behind the project . But now he has back-peddled and said that his stadium plans were a more realistic goal. Mr Mitchell, who has built more than 100 homes on Sandbanks and the surrounding districts, said the stadium would be for general use year-round and an ice rink could be housed there in winter. 'The stadium is modest in size and would fit exactly where the current pavilion sits at the moment,' he said. 'It was built in 1922 and is in a poor state of repair. It has no architectural value in my opinion and it's about time something was done with it. 'Beach football is a growing sport and we have one of the best locations in the country, and even the world. Beach volleyball is very popular too. 'If we had a permanent base which facilitates these sports, events would probably be held more often,' he said. 'It's a fantastic opportunity for the area.' 'Ten acres of that site is currently tarmac, this is a well-thought out scheme and the revenue we would bring in would help towards the infrastructure needed in the area. 'With the previous plans, I never said I was in a position to do that, I just wanted to gauge reactions to something happening here. 'If we don't keep up with the times Sandbanks will fall behind. 'This plan is realistic and can be built. I can build it and I would love to build it. It would be a wonderful project.' Mr Mitchell said the stadium would take up under an acre of the ten-acre site and if the planning process goes smoothly he would hope to start building next autumn and open in spring 2016. However, Sandbanks residents have expressed their fury over the plans and say the idea of a huge car park will be a blight on the landscape. The plans for the stadium also include shops, restaurants, offices and beach studios on the exclusive resort . Mr Mitchell said the stadium would be for  use year-round and an ice rink could be housed there in winter . Terry Stewart, chairman of Southern Poole, a board of ten residents associations, said 'We don't support multi-storey blocks that would be a real visual carbuncle. 'Beach sports are fine but they don't require a large amount of building and actually Mr Mitchell's plans would be illegal under the Poole Corporation Act, an act of parliament that limits development on Sandbanks.' Local resident Peter Stebbing said: 'I think it's a very bad idea. The beaches should be for children to play on. 'People have difficulty finding somewhere to park in the summer and the car park is jammed by 8am. Sandbanks residents say the plans are a 'bad idea' as the area is already overcrowded with tourists . Terry Stewart, chairman of a local residents associations, says a car park with be a blight on the landscape . 'We don't need more tourism, the place is overcrowded as it is. 'I would be very much against it. Poole council's planning department confirmed an outline planning application had been submitted. Richard Gengem, planning and regeneration manager at the council, said: 'We can confirm that an outline planning application for a Sandbanks Beach Arena has been received. 'This proposal will now be checked for validation and subsequently considered by officers. 'We are aware that the proposals relate to land owned by Borough of Poole and appropriate notices have been served by the applicants.'","The £12million arena would host beach sports like volleyball and football .

"Another actor who portrayed the rugged Marlboro Man in cigarette adverts has died a smoking-related death. Eric Lawson who played the iconic cigarette-puffing cowboy during the late 1970s passed away aged 72 from respiratory failure earlier this month. Lawson appears to be the fifth actor or model who pitched Marlboro-branded cigarettes to have died of some form of lung disease. Others include the 1950s Marlboro Man, David Millar, who died of . emphysema in 1987, and David McLean, who died of lung cancer in 1995. Another who pushed the brand, Wayne McLaren, died before his 52nd birthday in 1992 and Dick Hammer, who was better known for his role as Captain Hammer in the TV show Emergency! passed away from lung cancer in 1999, aged 69. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cowboy killer: Eric Lawson, pictured, portrayed the famously manly smoker from 1978 to 1981. He died of a smoking related illness on January 10 . Lawson succumbed to the illness at home in San Luis Obispo, California, on January 10, according to his wife, Susan Lawson. Lawson, who had smoked since the age of 14, played the smoking cowboy in the Marlboro adverts from 1978 to 1981. The iconic figure, used from 1954 to 1999, was portrayed in a natural setting with only a cigarette. It was initially conceived by Leo Burnett as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes, which at the time were considered a feminine commodity. Other ex-Malboro men include Christian Haren, Darrell Winfield and Brad Johnson. During his career, Lawson also featured in hit US TV shows as . Baretta and The Streets of San Francisco. He also performed in Charlie's Angels, . Dynasty and Baywatch, before injuries sustained on the set of a Western . film ended his career in 1997, according to Mrs Lawson. Revolutionary: The smoking cowboy, shown left in Darrell Winfield's depiction, was portrayed in a natural setting with only a cigarette. He was initially conceived as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes (right), which at the time were considered feminine. Winfield is still alive . Tragic: Former professional rodeo rider Wayne McLaren, pictured, posed for Malboro and died of lung cancer . Dying: McLaren, pictured in a documentary less than a year prior to his 1992 death, spoke of his regrets at promoting cigarettes . He later . appeared in an anti-smoking commercial that parodied the Marlboro man, . and an Entertainment Tonight segment that discussed the negative effects . of . smoking. Mrs Lawson said her husband was proud of the interview, even though he smoked . at the time and continued the habit until he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which caused the fatal respiratory failure. COPD is the name for a collection of . lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic . obstructive airways disease - all of which cause difficulty breathing. People who smoke a lot, or have smoked for a long time, are more likely to develop the condition. 'He knew the cigarettes had a hold on him,' Mrs Lawson said. 'He knew, yet he still couldn't stop.' In addition to his wife, Lawson is survived by six children, 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Sad: Dick Hammer, a real life firefighter who was better known for his role as Captain Hammer in the TV show Emergency! than his days as a Marlboro Man, passed away from lung cancer in 1999, aged 69 . Not the first: Another Marlboro Man, David McLean, pictured, died of lung cancer in 1995. David Miller also suffered a similar fate . Wayne McLaren also took a stance against smoking in later life, testifying in favor of . anti-smoking legislation at the age of 51, just prior to his death. During this time, Marlboro denied that he ever appeared in a Marlboro ad, a position it . later amended to maintain that while he did appear in ads, he was not . the Marlboro Man. In . response, McLaren produced an affidavit from a talent agency that had . represented him and a pay check stub asserting he had been paid for work . on a 'Marlboro print' job. The former rodeo rider promoted the brand in 1976. In 1996, David McLean's widow and son filed suit for wrongful death against Philip Morris, the umbrella tobacco company that owns Marlboro, claiming that the firm encouraged or even required cigarette smoking, which caused his lung cancer. A fictitious version of these events were featured in the comic novel Thank You for Smoking.","Eric Lawson portrayed iconic cigarette-puffing cowboy from 1978 to 1981 .
