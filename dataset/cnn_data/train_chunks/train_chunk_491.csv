Mad Men, with its influential Sixties style, was overlooked for an Emmy Award nomination on Thursday for costume design for the first time in its five-year run. And while fans expressed shock about the snub, the fashion world has already embraced another nominee: Downton Abbey. Snubbed: Despite the impact of the mid-Sixties looks in the latest season of Mad Men, worn to great effect by Jessica Pare as Megan Draper (pictured), the series failed to get an Emmy costume design nomination . Style with substance: From 'Fat Betty' (left) to Peggy Olsen's more senior position and eventual departure from Sterling-Cooper-Draper-Pryce (right), the costumes in Mad Men's fifth series told the story of each character . Episodes of Boardwalk Empire, The Borgias, Game of Thrones and Once Upon a Time also received nominations, but the likelihood of the masses finding their closets influenced by medieval Italians or mythical adventurers seems slim. The British aristocracy of the early 1900s featured in Downton Abbey, however, is already making its mark. Recognition: Downton Abbey, starring Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley (left) and Zoe Boyle as Lavinia Swire (right), was given an Emmy nomination for costume design . Inspired: Ralph Lauren took heavy inspiration form Downton Abbey for his fall 2012 collection, even sending models down the catwalk to the hit PBS show's theme music . Ralph Lauren paid homage to the show in . the preview of his fall collection earlier this year, with models . walking down the runway to the soundtrack. Expect more glamorous and embellished looks inspired by the show to take over store racks over the next few weeks, says Brooke Jaffe, director of fashion accessories at Bloomingdale's. 'There is a return to opulence,' Jaffe says. Stylist George Kotsiopolous, co-host for E!'s Fashion Police, noted that gentlemanly looks, for men and women, come from the Downton Abbey pre-World War I period. Historically accurate: The attention to detail in the outfits for Boardwalk Empire, starring Steve Buscemi (left) and Kelly Macdonald (right), won the HBO series an Emmy costume design nomination too . 'Designers are influenced by the same things as stylists: movies, TV, music, art - whatever is the zeitgeist,' he says. Costume party: The designs for Game of Thrones won the series an Emmy nomination . For the past few years, it had been the . chic, sophisticated Mad Men look that dominated the fashion . conversation, and the show had a wildfire ability to turn back the clock . on contemporary style to embrace the clean, refined lines of the early . 1960s. Countless designers, including Michael Kors and Peter Som, cited its influence, and Banana Republic launched a Mad Men-branded collection. 'The shape had been the same for a while - the shaped waist, the va-va-voom look,' Kostiopolous says. When it became common from Mad Men, he says, 'it becomes less interesting to fashion people.' He doesn't think the look will go away altogether, though. 'Women looked good in the Fifties and Sixties because the clothes were universally flattering, and any guy looks great in a suit.'

A legal executive has been jailed for stealing money from her employers to 'buy friends' with lavish outings - including two trips to see singer Neil Diamond in one week. Ruth Turner, 46, siphoned off £205,000 from Kundert Solicitors in Coventry between February 2009 to September 2011. The extensive fraud went undetected by colleagues at the firm's Bell Green office until Turner confessed to police last year. 'Social outcast': Ruth Turner, pictured dressed as a nun for a company charity fundraiser, stole money from her employers to pay for meals, shopping sprees and concert trips . Turner was jailed for three years at Coventry Crown Court for fraud by abuse of position. Using the completion of house sales as cover, she transferred around £10,000 at a time into her bank accounts. The most taken at once was £21,000. The court heard she used the money to pay for home improvements and 'buy friends' with shopping sprees, meals and concert trips. Prosecuting, Ian Ball told how Turner committed the crime because she found it a struggle to pay spiralling debts and had felt a social outcast most of her life. Mr Ball said: 'She found by taking friends to lavish events, shopping, meals, that she was suddenly popular. 'The money was going out as quickly as it was coming in, spending some money on the house, taking friends out and going to live concerts including Neil Diamond twice in one week.' Excessive? Turner's splurges included two trips in one week to see singer Neil Diamond . He explained how she fled the firm's second office in Station Square in September last year, after an outburst that colleagues put down to personal problems. Turner returned to work the next day but turned herself in at a police station the following Monday. The court heard she'd handed over bank statements as proof of her fraud and told police she’d stolen about £400,000. However, lack of evidence meant she could only be charged for £205,000. Turner, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, has a son at university and was the primary carer for her 75-year-old mother. She joined the firm as a secretary in 2006, rising to conveyancing executive on an annual salary of £36,000. Graham Russell, defending, painted a picture of a woman 'driven to desperation' against a background of an abusive relationship, financial problems and mental health issues including depression and compulsive behaviours. He said his client felt so ashamed of what she had done, she attempted suicide before handing herself in to police. Jailed: Turner was sentenced to three years for fraud by abuse of position at Coventry Crown Court . Mr Russell said: 'Many people who suffer depression find themselves engaging in some form of compulsive activity. 'I would suggest, having in mind the abusive relationship she was in, having in mind that she was having difficulty with compulsive eating and compulsive drinking, that would go some way to explaining the compulsive stealing and compulsive spending.' Sentencing Turner to three years in prison, Judge Richard Griffith-Jones described it as a 'serious abuse of trust' which in a tough economic climate put the company at risk and colleagues’ jobs in jeopardy. On top of the loss, Kundert Solicitors has been left with doubled insurance premiums and a £100,000 investigation bill. The judge said: 'You were doing it out of greed, and you weren’t really being as generous as you felt when you were treating friends with this extravagant lifestyle because it wasn’t your money to be generous with.' A Kundert Solicitors official who attended the hearing declined to comment.","Ruth Turner, 46, took funds from Kundert Solicitors in Coventry .

A screaming Ukranian man is said to have disrupted a flight and damaged the airplane by running up the aisle and attempting to open an emergency exit . Baranovich, who was carrying a Ukrainian passport and U.S. visa, said he thought the aircraft's wing was on fire and was trying to warn others, according to a complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court. After the plane touched down, he got up from his seat and ran to the back of the aircraft, then tried to open the emergency exit door as a flight attendant ordered him to stop, it is claimed. The door jammed and caused an emergency inflatable slide to malfunction, which caused 'extensive damage' to the plane's fuselage, the FBI said. Several passengers tried to wrestle Baranovich to the ground while he attempted to open another emergency exit door. One passenger forced him to the floor and held him until the plane taxied to a gate, where law enforcement and medical personnel had been called. Baranovich told agents that he had been visiting family in Ukraine and was headed to Portland, Oregon, after a stop in Salt Lake City. He said he had consumed alcohol while traveling but did not specify when or how much, according to the authorities. Baranovich is scheduled to appear in court in Salt Lake City today. Officials say they do not believe he posed a terrorist threat.","Anatoliy N Baranovich arrested on suspicion of interfering with flight .

Swan, who also serves as treasurer and is his center-left Labor Party . government's ranking finance minister, took aim at the Tea Party during a . speech to a business forum, breaking a convention among Australia's . major parties to steer clear of U.S. domestic political debates.

He . said it was imperative that Congress reach an agreement to support . growth and avoid a 'fiscal cliff' of deep government spending cuts and . higher taxes in January, which he said could push the U.S. economy back . into recession.

Questioned by police, the former University of Colorado student mentioned his mother’s will and said his ‘definition of right and wrong may be different from what others think,’ according to an affidavit. Scroll down for video . Federal radar: Accused killer Ari Liggett, seen left after his arrest on Oct 17 and right in 2010, was on the FBI watch list and suffered bipolar disorder and Asperger syndrome according to a family friend . Tragic end: The body of Liggett's mother, 56-year-old Beverly Liggett, seen centre after her recent graduation from nursing school, was found in her SUV driven by her son last week . After found driving his mother’s SUV with her remains on October 17, friends of his mother, 56-year-old Beverly Liggett reacted saying the recent nursing school graduate lived in fear of her son after a previous arrest and threat but that she loved him too much to put him away. 'She loved her son very much and went out her way to protect him,' her neighbour Lisa Davis told Our Centennial News. 'So much that she eventually gave her life for . him.' According to police, Liggett had a history. Arrested in 2010, Ari was found welding a homemade silencer and mixing dangerous chemical's in his home's backyard that eventually led to the evacuation of a homeless shelter. Threatening to kill his mother and his sister, his family took him to an unsecured facility and was placed on the FBI's watch list while expressing antisemitism remarks, despite his own Jewish heritage, the Denver Post reports. Motive: Liggett told police his mother Beverly Liggett, pictured, had recently cut him out of her will . Family's home: The family's home in Centennial is pictured where in 2010, Liggett was found welding a homemade silencer and mixing dangerous chemical's in its home's backyard . With his latest arrest he told officers his 'definition of right and wrong may differ from what others think, but he knows what society and the law consider to be right and wrong,' according to the affidavit obtained by the Post. Ms Davis, who said she heard directly of the woman's troubles, said Liggett had been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and Asperger syndrome. She said the family had tried to find Liggett help but, 'couldn't find a place that would take him.’ 'It's just really sad so much more money was spent on police and bomb squad and hazmat,' she said of the spectacle outside the family's home, 'when really it could have been better spent on helping this kid.' 'I saw that Beverly was trapped in this situation,' her boyfriend of five years Seth Masia told 9News. 'The resources didn't exist to extricate her, one way or another it was not going to have a happy ending.' Living in fear: Friends of Beverly Liggett say she lived in fear of her son after his previous arrest and threat but that she loved him too much to put him away . He said he just never though it would get this out of control. 'It's just tragic, it's just tragic,' Mr Masia said. 'We were planning to grow old together. We were going to have a good life. She deserved a good life.' - Seth Masia, boyfriend of Beverly Liggett . Recently having graduated from nursing school with honours, Mr Masia said she worked with handicapped children and loved what she did. 'Her patients loved her,' he said. 'Her employers loved her. She loved her patients.' Having first met on JDate.com, Mr Masia said 'we were so happy together. She made me laugh. I made her laugh.' They planned to marry one day. 'She deserves to be remembered with love and admiration and she will be,' he said. Liggett was arrested two days after he and his mother were reported missing by concerned family members. Bright future: Beverly Liggett's boyfriend of five years, Seth Masia, pictured with her at her graduation ceremony, said the couple planned to marry . Unexpected loss: Mr Masia said that Beverly cared deeply for her son and they never expected he could be capable of such a deadly and gruesome act . Searching the family's home, court documents revealed authorities find of traces of human blood in the freezer and bathtub along with a hand saw and large kitchen knife on the top rack of the dishwasher. They reported nicks and chips along the edge of the bathtub. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson confirmed that the body parts in Liggett's gold Honda CR-V was his mother, a registered nurse. Family called police to perform a welfare check on the home on Monday evening. There was no one at home but police were able to verify their whereabouts after tracing credit card transactions. The car was then apprehended on Wednesday and the 24-year-old was arrested after a police chase which resulted in Liggett crashing the car. He fled the scene on foot but was captured a short time later, according to the Denver Post. Liggett, being held in the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office Detention Facility, has his next court appearance scheduled for December 19. When police searched the home, they found potassium cyanide which is one of the most fast-acting poisons known. Sheriff Robinson said: 'A preliminary test of that liquid showed a positive for potassium cyanide. It changed our perspective dramatically. 'A detailed missing person's investigation became a complex hazardous material investigation combined with a very complex homicide.' In 2010, Liggett was arrested and accused of smuggling an unknown substance into a homeless shelter which caused it to be evacuated for seven hours. The chemical was not able to be identified and he was not charged with a hazardous-material violation. He was, however, charged with possession of a dangerous weapon after he was found with the silencer a short time later.

The 32-stone teenager - who regularly downed over 20 pints of bitter in the pub over an evening - had just broken a pair of weighing scales. Doctors told him he would be eligible for gastric band surgery and a tummy tuck on the NHS, but the Stoke-On-Trent biscuit factory worker, now 22, determined to lose the weight without anyone's help, and declined the offer. Half the man I was: Martin Jones, who shed 16 stone, poses with the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink every night . He spent the next three years working industriously to shed the weight, immediately cutting out takeaways and alcohol from his diet, then taking up weight training. But rather than miss out when his friends went to the pub, the previously morbidly obese teenager decided to swap the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink each night with just one solitary glass of orange squash. Mr Jones said: 'I used to go out drinking with my mates every weekend - the most I . ever drank was 24 pints in one night, but I’d come close to that every . time I went out. 'And after a big night out, I’d always have a kebab before I went home, and never thought anything of it. I work in a biscuit factory, moving around custard creams on the forklift trucks, so temptation was constantly in front of me.

A four-year-old girl denied an operation that could help her walk because of an NHS postcode lottery will now have the procedure - after well-wishers raised £30,000. Evie Tucker suffers from cerebral palsy - causing painful spasms in her legs - and can only shuffle a few steps at a time in her walking frame. She will be unable to walk without a £30,000 operation, equipment and physio which is only performed at one hospital in Britain - which happens to be just 12 miles away from her home. Evie Tucker, 4, suffers from cerebral palsy and can only shuffle a few steps at a time in her walking frame. She will be unable to walk without an operation costing £30,000 - the amount well-wishers have raised . But her local NHS Trust ruled that Evie's case was not strong enough to justify the cost. Her determined family ploughed straight into fundraising for the four-hour operation themselves in a bid to help Evie walk before she reaches school in September. Her story was featured on MailOnline in January and the money was raised in just seven months. Evie's mother Karissa Skidmore, 28, said she was so grateful to the fundraisers and looking forward to Evie dancing and playing like her friends. She said: 'It's brilliant, amazing. I can't even describe how it feels to know we have got the money now and are just waiting for a date. 'I didn't think we would be able to do it so quickly and thought it would take about a year. Everyone has been amazing and I don't think there was an event we had to plan for ourselves. 'People just rang us and said they were doing this and doing that and took over all of it, which was really helpful. For people to take that stress away from us was wonderful. 'There have been people we don't even know who have donated a lot of money and we cannot thank them enough.' Evie, 4, with her mother Karissa Skidmore, 28, in the park near their home in Bristol . Thank you: Dan and Karissa with children Jack and Evie. Evie will now have surgery after the family managed to raise £30,000 . Accounts worker Karissa, who . lives in Avonmouth, Bristol, with partner Dan Tucker, 31, their son Jack . and Evie, said people had held cake sales, sponsored walks and cycle . rides to raise money for the operation. Evie . has already had her assessment and knows that the operation will . involve neurosurgeon Kristian Aquilina 'taking out the bad bits' in her . legs. She will then . have to remain in Frenchay Hospital for three weeks as an inpatient and . will need a further two or three weeks of recovery. The . extra £5,000 will help fund equipment to help Evie after her surgery, . as well as additional physiotherapy, costing £50 an hour. Evie, pictured on 1st March 2008, was born 10 weeks early . Karissa added: 'More and more often Evie wakes with pains in her legs and for us the main thing is about taking that away. 'She goes to bed with tight fabric wrapped around her legs and she had to wear splints every day, which is not good when it is hot. 'We have done this to get rid of all that and make her more comfortable. We have always said that whatever the operation does on top of that is a bonus. 'We are looking at about six weeks out of school but at least she will get to start and get to know everybody else before, as it will be a lot to deal with getting used to the new feelings in her legs.' Hopeful: Karissa hopes that the selective dorsal rhizotomy will give Evie better use of her legs following physiotherapy . Evie was delivered ten weeks early after Karissa suffered a fall and she spent the first seven weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit. Brain scans at Southmead Hospital in Bristol showed she had cerebral palsy. The operation - called a selective dorsal rhizotomy - can be carried out on children aged four to 11 and involves cutting some of the nerve fibres between the muscles and spinal cord. A neurosurgeon goes in through the back of the patient while they are under general anaesthetic and tests the nerves with electrical impulses. Any nerves acting abnormally are then cut. Patients who have the operation require physiotherapy costing around £10,000 for several months afterwards. Although the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence says the procedure can be provided by the NHS it says parents should be warned the procedure is irreversible. There is also a risk of complications and patients could experience a deterioration in walking ability or bladder function. The operation has been available at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol - just 12 miles away from Evie's home - since last May. Consultant neurosurgeon Kristian Aquilina has since performed the operation on 12 patients at the hospital and recommended it for Evie two years ago. A further 14 children have been assessed by Mr Aquilina and had funding for the operation refused by their local NHS Trust. NHS Bristol's exceptional funding panel considered Evie's request for the surgery but refused it in December last year. The trust said they: 'had not been supplied with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Miss Tucker has the potential to benefit over and above other patients with a similar condition for whom this treatment is also not currently available.' It is estimated that 1 in every 400 . children in the UK is affected by cerebral palsy and 1,800 babies are . diagnosed with the condition each year.","Evie suffers from cerebral palsy and can only shuffle using a walking frame .

Emergency crews were called to the property in St. Helens where a 25-year-old man had also been repeatedly stabbed but Miss Dyer was declared dead at the scene. Sadly missed: Heather Dyer knifed to death in a double stabbing over noise at a party . The other victim, who has not been named, is in a serious but stable condition in Whiston Hospital. Heather is thought to have attended the party held in an apartment in a  £90,000 terraced property when people became enraged at the noise going on late into the night. Paul Lyon, 44, also of St Helens, was last night charged with the murder of Heather Dyer and the attempted murder of the 25-year-old man. Lyon was remanded in custody to appear at St Helens Magistrates’ Court today. Amanda Jones, 38, who lives opposite the victim, spoke of her horror as the tragic scenes unfolded in the street where she has lived for two years. The mum-of-seven today told how she watched a man run around the street wielding the knife while the injured man stumbled to her doorstep after being stabbed. She gave the man a towel to help stop the bleeding and said his attacker was chasing after other people in the street with the weapon. Mrs Jones said: ‘He started chasing other people around the street, there must have been about five or six people. It was like Scream, it was like a horror film. This is not supposed to happen on your own doorstep.’ The alleged attacker was eventually stopped by a group of people. Mrs Jones said the 25-year-old male victim had been stabbed twice in the stomach. Fun Loving: Heather enjoyed parties with friends . ‘He came to my door step and asked me to phone the police.

For decades, the promise of sunny . weather, a family-friendly lifestyle and affordable property has driven . hundreds of thousands of Britons to make the move to Australia. But it seems, for many, their dream life Down Under has turned into something of a disappointment. A record number of Britons left . Australia last year, many bored with  their ex-pat life and keen to . spend  more time with family in the UK, research has revealed. Britons celebrate Christmas Day on Bondi beach in Sydney. But for many the Australian dream has faded - the attractions that led them to start a new life on the far side of the world just aren't enough to keep them there . Ahh, picnic on the beach: A couple enjoy an overcast summer's day on Brighton beach. Many expatriate Britons admit they miss this weather . Nearly 107,000 people arrived there from the UK between 2005 and 2010. But more than 30,000 Britons left over . the same period. And last year a record of more than 7,000 Britons . departed Australia permanently. Researchers Mary Holmes, a senior . lecturer in sociology at Australia’s Flinders University, and Roger . Burrows, of the University of York, studied why so many ‘ping-pong Poms’ are returning home. They said: ‘A better life is not about good jobs, sunshine or bigger houses. ‘What is most important is  feeling close to family and feeling “at home”.’ The researchers added that ‘pursuing this dream life can result in disappointment’. Spacious: Australian properties tend to be large and offer good value for money when compared with British homes . Cramped: British houses tend to be smaller and older... and cost a lot more . Exotic land: Researchers agreed that some Britons who returned home could fairly be described as 'whinging Poms' A number of returning Britons left . because of ‘boredom’ in Australia, the pair found, complaining of . stressful daily routines such as three-hour commutes on hot, crowded . trains. Dr Holmes and Professor Burrows said . that while some who left could be described as ‘whingeing Poms’, . complaining about the heat and insects, most had better reasons, with . family being a common one. Many wanted their children born in Australia . to get to know grandparents and other relatives in the UK, even if it . meant sacrificing a better quality of life. And for others, not ‘feeling at home’ in Australia was a crucial factor in their decision to leave, the research showed. One Briton who had left Australia said: ‘Coming back has been a bit like slipping into an old pair of shoes.’ Another told the researchers that since returning to her old home town she had ‘come alive again’ despite having to move into a smaller house, drive a smaller car and having less money. She said: ‘I love walking everywhere, wrapping up warm, politeness, greenery, quality TV.’ However the researchers did note  that some who returned kept their options open by obtaining Australian citizenship before doing so. One Briton told them: ‘That way, when your duty to your children and grandparents is finally done you are free to go back to make your home in Australia.’","Many are returning because they find Australia 'boring'

This is the one-year-old girl who can only eat fish fingers - because her mystery illness means almost anything else could kill her. Imogen Elliott, from Coventry, is severely allergic to grass, pollen, animal fur, polyester, plastic, cosmetics, chemicals and even sunlight. Almost any food can trigger a life-threatening reaction, so the 20-month-old child's mother Kirsty sustains the sensitive girl on an unchanging diet of gluten-free fish fingers. Finger food: Imogen Elliott survives on an unchanging diet of gluten-free fish fingers - because she could have a life-threatening reaction, right, if she eats anything else . Highly sensitive: Coming into contact with grass, pollen, sunlight or almost any food can cause her to break out in an itchy, painful rash . Upsetting problem: As a baby, Imogen struggled to keep her milk down and her distraught mother was even accused of making her daughter sick . Doctors believe the problem is down to an underlying condition - but as yet they have no idea what that could be. Until Imogen's illness is diagnosed, her mother Kirsty has to be constantly on the alert for a potentially fatal reaction. If Imogen eats or comes into contact with something she is allergic to, her skin erupts in painful, . itchy sores and she is often violently sick. Last year, the toddler's family gave her some tuna - which she had always been able to eat before. The youngster immediately went into anaphylactic shock, her throat swelling up and cutting off her oxygen supply. Her terrified mother rushed her to hospital, where doctors were fortunately able to save her life. Had she got there any later, Imogen might not be alive today. Mrs Elliott, 30, said: 'It was a really scary day. I could have lost her. Protective: Parent Mark and Kirsty and four-year-old sister Alyssa are constantly on the alert in case the toddler goes into anaphylactic shock . Pulling through: It has been a difficult journey for Imogen and mother Kirsty, who works part-time as a carer in between looking after her little girl . 'Some children can build up tolerance to foods but the more exposure Imogen has, the worse her reactions get. 'I always keep fish fingers in the freezer. She loves fish fingers. 'Her diet does worry me. I have to give her multi-vitamins and calcium supplements.' As a baby, Imogen struggled to keep her . milk down and her distraught mother was even accused of making her daughter sick. It . was only as she got older that doctors realised the extent of her . allergies. Mrs Elliott and husband Mark, 35, have now spent all their savings on buying an uncontaminated new house and . spent three months researching before they bought any furniture. They have also invested around £5,000 in special allergy-free carpets and even grass. Unlike other toddlers, Imogen cannot go . to nursery, because it would be too dangerous, and she will have to be . home-schooled when she is older. Cared for: The 20-month-old's family ensure she takes multivitamins and is covered up when she goes out in the sun - which she can only do for a few minutes at a time . If she does go out, she has to be protected from the sun and can only spend a few minutes at a time outdoors. Imogen's hyper-sensitivity, although rare, is not completely unheard of. A 19-month-old was recently diagnosed with rare disorder eosinophilic colitis, which meant he could not eat anything but chips. Douglas Husband's family found that meat, fruit and any vegetables except potatoes left the toddler writhing in agony because too many white blood cells were being produced in his intestine. Imogen's mother, who has set up a support group for parents of children with severe allergies, admits . she sometimes finds it difficult to cope. She works part-time as a carer in between caring for Imogen and eldest daughter Alyssa, four. She said: 'I would love nothing more than to watch her enjoy food and not be restricted. Distressing: Imogen's parents have bought a new house and furnished it with carefully chosen furniture and non-allergic carpet . 'We don't eat in front of Imogen. It wouldn't be fair because she's too young to understand. 'I have to watch her 24 hours a day. 'A few months ago, I was out shopping . and Imogen was sat in the seat in the trolley. A man playfully touched . her cheeks, like you would with any little baby. 'She had a rash around her face, she was wheezing and her lips swelled. 'It was only later I realised the man's . hands were covered in paint. He must have been painting his house and . the chemicals caused her to have a reaction. 'We went to a soft play centre and had . only been there an hour when she started screaming. She was hysterical . and I couldn't calm her down. 'She was covered head to toe in a red rash.' The little girl cannot go to nursery, because it is too dangerous, and will have to be home-schooled later on . Medics have been left baffled by Imogen's allergies although experts believe she could be suffering from a rare condition. Kirsty, who wants to train to become a . dietician to better understand her daughter's allergies, is hoping to be . a referred to a specialist in London to get a diagnosis. For now, she must keep her daughter on a restricted diet. Very occasionally, Imogen can eat small . amounts of fruit, vegetables and gluten-free cereal bars but her body . cannot tolerate these on a regular basis. Despite her debilitating allergies, Mrs Elliott says Imogen is still a happy little girl. 'She likes playing with her sister and drawing,' said her mother. 'We just have to be careful she doesn't eat the crayons. Join the spud club: Douglas Husband, pictured with mother Beverley Ward, is also allergic to almost every food - but his case the exception is chips . 'Imogen has to experience things so I try to balance everything. I try to give her a bit of normality in her life.' Lindsey McManus, deputy chief executive . officer of Allergy UK, said: 'True food allergies are rare, affecting up . to eight per cent of children in the UK. 'Sufferers can react to . even the tiniest amount of the trigger food, making life extremely . difficult for parents of highly allergic children.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 25 January 2012 . Baby ban: The 2012 organisers have said every child, including babes-in-arms, must have their own ticket . Babies who do not have tickets for the Olympics will be excluded from the Games - even if they had not been conceived when their parents bought seats. Parents who bring their infants to the Games without a valid tickets for them will be refused entry, in a move which has sparked anger among new and expectant parents. The 2012 organisers have said every child, including small babies carried in their parents’ arms, must have their own ticket or they will not be allowed in. A press spokesman admitted the Olympics helpline had received calls from pregnant women and expectant fathers whose babies will just be a few weeks old when the Games commence. They have been told they can try and buy an extra ticket for their chosen event, otherwise the infant will be prevented from entering the venue. The issue has attracted fury on the Mumsnet website in the last few weeks, with parents saying they are being forced to pay full price for babies not yet born. Some are doubting whether extra tickets will be available for the popular events they are attending. One woman described it as the 'biggest rip-off in the history of London' while others wondered what to do with babies they will be breastfeeding. Another said: 'The whole thing is ridiculous, there are people who bought tickets before their babies were even conceived - how are they supposed to know to buy a ticket for a child that doesn’t exist yet? 'There should be more complaining about this policy. It’s nuts.' Another woman described the policy as 'bloody stupid'. The Olympic stadium in east London. A spokesman admitted the Olympics helpline had received calls from pregnant women and expectant fathers whose babies will just be a few weeks old when the Games commence . She added: 'The baby isn’t taking up a seat, and if they’re worried about fire regulations or whatever then it’s not as if the baby isn’t going to be with you at all times - essentially you should be counted as one person. 'The baby’s not using the facilities on its own.' One 'fuming' pregnant woman wrote: 'I’m shocked by the conversation I just had with the London 2012 ticketing people. 'My husband and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the horse jumping in August. Our baby is due 2 June, so was inquiring about what I need to do about tickets for the new baby. 'They said everyone needs a ticket - fine. Children’s tickets are £1 - fine. 'I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling' 'But there are no children’s tickets for the horse jumping so I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling! 'They said the only alternative was to re-sell my ticket or give it to someone else.' Another accused the organisers of discrimination, saying women could not have been expected to bid on extra tickets in case they got pregnant. 'It is generally accepted that a new baby is an adjunct of its mother, especially if breastfeeding.' Another described the 'anti-baby policy' as 'completely unreasonable', adding it 'clearly shows that mums were not involved in devising this policy. 'I attended several hockey games and opening ceremonies at the Vancouver games with a three-month-old (their policy was you could bring a 0-2-year-old, no problem). 'It was NOT a problem. As a rule, there were diaper changing facilities in all restrooms. And I had bought the tickets before the baby was even a sparkle in his mum’s eyes.' One woman on Mumsnet said she is likely to miss out on the Olympics as a result of the policy. She said 'it does feel like discrimination', adding she has four tickets for sailing. 'We will apparently need another ticket for a baby not even born yet and certainly not conceived when we bid for tickets.' She said she would bid for another ticket but did not hold out much hope. 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I. Outrage on Mumsnet: 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I' 'I normally keep well clear from the . breast v bottle discussions, but this does feel like discrimination . against those people who are breastfeeding. 'And those unable/unwilling to leave a very small baby in the care of someone else.' Another woman said she objected to the . fact that she needed 'to get another ticket that in all probability . won't exist... Stopping me and potentially my family from going. 'It . will be a while until I know if I can even get another ticket (April, . provided the website is working by then), regardless of the cost, and . probably too late by then to be able to re-sell any tickets we are . subsequently unable to use.' Anyone wishing to re-sell their tickets must submit their request to Olympic organisers by a February 3 deadline. A second wave of ticket re-sales will occur in April.

George Osborne has pledged to ‘come down like a ton of bricks’ on wealthy property buyers who avoid paying stamp duty on their huge houses. The Chancellor said he would use this week’s Budget to make it illegal for rich people to register ownership of their homes to companies in order to avoid paying stamp duty, denying the Treasury hundreds of millions every year. He said it was part of a drive to ensure that ‘all sections of society are paying their fair share’ Rock stars Mick Jagger and Ringo Starr are among many who have taken advantage of the loophole. This morning Chancellor George Osborne promised an 'aggressive' attack on the property tax dodge by the super-rich. It involves transferring ownership of a property to an . off-shore company so when it comes to be sold the buyer purchases the . company as a whole assuming de-facto ownership of the property. Because the deal is classed as a . corporate transaction as opposed to a property sale there are no stamp . duty obligations involved. This means that while a family buying a . home costing £400,000 would pay £12,000 to the Government, a . multi-millionaire buying a luxury pad could pay nothing. The savings involved can be vast. Someone who purchases a £50million property though an off-shore company . would avoid paying the treasury £2.5million. Most of the transactions involve central London properties which are currently seen by the super-rich as a safe haven. In . exclusive Cornwall Terrace in North London, where the average asking . price is £35 million, every single home has been transferred to a . company on the Isle of Man. Former Beatles member Ringo Starr owns an estate in Surrey which was transferred to a Jersey company in 2009 and Lakshmi Mittal transferred his Kensington home into a British company eight years ago . Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr show Mr Osborne pledged to 'come down like a tonne of bricks' on wealthy . people who sell properties through offshore companies to to avoid stamp . duty. 'People want to make sure that all sections of society are paying their fair share,' he said. 'On this specific issue of stamp duty avoidance, rich people - often . foreigners who come to this country but also people here in Britain - . who put homes into companies to avoid stamp duty, that is completely . unacceptable and we are going to come down on that practice like a tonne . of bricks. 'We are going to be extremely aggressive in dealing with it and people are going to face a very punitive charge. Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning. Mr Osborne promised an 'aggressive' attack on the property tax dodge . Exclusive: In Cornwall Terrace in North London every single home has been transferred to a company on the Isle of Man . 'People have had their warning: they have got to pay stamp duty on the homes they live in.' A . Sunday Times investigation found that rich homeowners have registered . properties worth £200billion in 122 different locations around the world . to avoid the taxman in Britain in the past 12 years. The most popular is the . Isle of Man, with 23,147 properties registered since January 1999. Other . popular places include the U.S., Uganda and Libya as well as  The . Republic of Ireland, Netherlands and Germany. Jagger signed a 99-year lease on his Chelsea home in west London in 2008 through a company based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Late Beatles guitarist George Harrison's Oxfordshire home was transferred to a company in 2005 . His spokesman told the newspaper he gained no tax benefits from this and registered the company abroad for security reasons. Meanwhile, the newspaper said former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr's Surrey estate was transferred into a company in Jersey three years ago and the late George Harrison's Oxfordshire home was transferred to a company on the same island in 2005. Britain's richest man Lakshmi Mittal, who owns a £57m home in Kensington, west London, transferred the ownership of the property to a British company eight years ago but a spokesman for the tycoon said stamp duty had been paid. He is among many overseas tycoons who have taken advantage of the loophole, alongside the wealthy Hinduja family, worth £6bn, and Rasha Said, the daughter of billionaire Wafic Said. Repeated crackdowns on stamp duty . dodgers have been announced by the Government, but the wealthy are still . regularly avoiding paying it. Stamp duty on homes above £1m was raised to five per cent in April, meaning a buyer would pay a minimum of £50,000 in tax. In November, it was revealed that even middle class home-buyers are exploiting the loophole to avoid paying stamp duty. A clutch of financial services companies . have sprung up in recent months promising savings of thousands of pounds . in house-moving costs through Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) mitigation . schemes.

November 18 last year for the 2009 murder of Heather Catterton, 17, and has been held at . Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. Eruption: Shellie Nations, Randi Saldana's sister, screamed 'You killed my sister' at Danny Hembree who is on trial for her murder in Gaston County, North Carolina . He was back in court today accused of the murder of Randi Dean Saldana, 30, who was also murdered in 2009. During the murder trial for Miss Catterton, Hembree said he had strangled . Saldana in the basement of his mother’s Gastonia, North Carolina home, but that it was . an accident after a marathon of sex and crack cocaine. Miss Saldana's burnt remains were found lying in a dirt road in Kings Mountain State Park. Hembree is also believed to have killed Deborah Ratchford, 30, whose body found in 1992. During a police interrogation, Hembree admitted to killing two other women, though he now says that he was . lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes. Sickening: At the end of his first murder trial in November, over the killing of 17-year-old Heather Catterton, Hembree blew a kiss to the courtroom . The court proceedings ended in disarray today after the prosecution questioned the Death Row inmate about a letter he wrote. According to Wscotv.com, . Hembree said: 'What I am wondering about is are you going to show the . letter about the sexual relationship between me and (Assistant District . Attorney) Stephanie (Hamlin) that the attorney general sent in here the . other day?' He claimed that Ms Hamlin was biased against him because he left her for Heather Catterton's sister. ADA Hamlin said the story is a lie. However Hembree’s defense attorneys withdrew after the allegations today and the judge declared a mistrial - to which the prosecution objected. Murder trial: Randi Saldana had a two-year-old child at the time of her death in 2009 . Hembree then objected saying he was having problems with his attorneys. According the TV station, Miss Saldana's sister Shellie Nations then screamed out across the court room: 'Well I object to you killing my sister!' She was removed from the room by officers. Earlier this year, Hembree sent a letter to a . local North Carolina newspaper boasting about his 'life of leisure' behind bars. Taunting his Miss Catterton's family, . Hembree wrote: 'Is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder . taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim?

Prince of Wales has over government legislation has been laid bare in . letters between ministers and Clarence House. They reveal how permission has been . sought from Prince Charles before passing laws in at least a dozen . separate areas during the past five years, from road safety and energy . reforms to gambling and planning. The papers shed light for the first . time on how the Royal has been consulted on Bills that may affect his . estate before they are debated in Parliament. Influence: Documents revealed the Prince of Wales indicated he was 'content' with the Bill . In November 2008 Huw Irranca-Davies, then a Labour minister, wrote to the Prince’s Private Secretary Sir Michael Peat to consult him on the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, according to the Daily Telegraph. The letters include two copies of the Bill in its draft form and a detailed summary of how it could affect the Duchy, the Prince’s private estate. The Private Secretary responded two months later, thanking Mr Irranca-Davies and replying: ‘I can confirm that the Prince of Wales is content with the Bill’. The response reveals the level of influence the Prince appears to wield in matters of legislation and appears to suggest he sees his role as going further than that envisaged by ministers. The requirement for ministers have been forced to seek permission stems from a little-known constitutional right for the prince to effectively veto legislation in areas which might affect his private interests. Although it is known the Prince's permission has been sought in the past, the newly released correspondence is the first time light has been shed on the process, as Government and Clarence House have refused to comment. Correspondence: The letters between Sir Michael Peat (left) and Huw Irranca-Davies (right) reveal how the Prince of Wales is able to veto legislation . The documents were released by the Information Commissioner, after an initial application by John Kirkhope, a public notary and graduate law student at Plymouth University, was turned down by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The Commissioner ruled that part of the correspondence could be released as it concerned the Prince’s role as landowner rather than heir to the throne. Other documents still remain secret. Mr Kirkhope said it was clear there would be other unpublished cases where the Prince may have raised objections. ‘The real issue is about those Acts where there are changes made to the Act as a result of representations made by the Prince,’ he told the paper. A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commented that the Prince’s consent relates only to the aspects concerning the Duchy, although it was ‘expressed to be to the Bill itself’. But the revelation about the Prince's power of . consent could add to concerns the heir to the throne may be overstepping . his constitutional role. The Prince's role in government . matters has been criticised in the past, with him facing accusations . of unconstitutional ‘meddling’ in politics. Documents . released under a Freedom of Information Act last year revealed Charles . held at least nine private meetings with ministers during a ten-month . period from May 2010. They show he appeared to focus on . ministers responsible for his ‘hobby horse’ issues, such as global . warming, conservation, architecture and agriculture. The . published diaries of Alastair Campbell also claimed Tony Blair became . so exasperated by the prince’s high-profile interventions while he was .

A single mother dubbed 'Ma Baker' after she let her three feral young children run wild on a housing estate has been run out of town. Karla Walker, 32, was evicted from her rented home in Prestwich, near Manchester, after her out-of-control sons, now aged 11, 12 and 13, brought misery to neighbours for three years. They invaded gardens, jumped on cars, vandalised fences and smashed windows. One neighbour was wrongly branded a 'paedophile' while another’s pet rabbit was mauled to death by the family dog. Police were inundated with complaints of loud music, late night parties and the youngsters hurling foul mouthed abuse. But Walker - named after the iconic mother Kate 'Ma' Barker who fiercely protected her four gangster children in the 1930s U.S. Midwest - defied a string of legal warnings about her sons' behaviour. And today she hit back at the eviction saying her sons got the blame for all crime in the neighbourhood and she should have had 'more support' from the authorities to curb her children’s behaviour. She was taken to Manchester county court after fed up locals compiled a diary detailing their ordeal. During one 11-month period the children breached a court order telling them to behave 25 times. A judge then gave Walker a month to leave her house on the Polefield estate before finally evicting her when she failed to leave. She and her family are now in a hostel. Today Walker said her sons got the blame for all crime in the neighbourhood and claimed she should have had 'more support' from the authorities to curb her children’s behaviour. But one neighbour, 53, a fork lift truck driver who asked not be named for fear of reprisals said the behaviour of the children cost him his job and almost wrecked his marriage. He said: 'I’m just so relieved that that family have gone because they gave us years of hell.

Their infamous crimes, which included armed robbery and murder, gripped America then and continue to fascinate now. Depite claims that she was the mastermind behind the criminal activities, her role was to protect her sons, Herman, Lloyd, Arthur, Fred, and Willmer, and their criminal accomplices. Ma Barker certainly knew of the gang's activities, however there is no evidence to suggest she took part in any of the crimes themselves or involved herself in the planning. But she would take care of gang members, who apparently often sent her to the movies while they committed crimes. Alvin Karpis, the gang's second most notorious member, later revealed: 'She wasn't a leader of criminals or even a criminal herself. There is not one police photograph of her or set of fingerprints taken while she was alive. 'She knew we were criminals but her participation in our careers was limited to one function: when we traveled together, we moved as a mother and her sons. What could look more innocent?' It has been suggested that the myth of Ma Barker as a criminal mastermind was encouraged by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to justify the killing of an old lady. Her story was immortalised in the Boney M song 'Ma Baker'. The band apparently changed the name because 'it sounded better'. 'She was given a number of chances to make sure her kids behaved but she seemed to think it was not her responsibility. 'I just couldn’t reason with her and I don’t think she could control her kids. I asked her politely to keep the kids off the property but they made my life an absolute misery from the noise and the bad language and most of the time it occurred when they should have been in school. 'We could not sit in the garden because of the bad language. They would say typical things like ""f*** off"" they even called me a “paedophile.” 'My wife is a teacher and they used to taunt her. They damaged the car and threw dog dirt on my car. There was constant noise, music, shouting. It was in the early hours but culminated throughout the day. 'They had a dog which was let loose on a neighbour’s rabbit and apparently it killed it. How she allowed her children to get away with it I just don’t know. 'It put a strain on my marriage and I had to pack my job in because I wasn’t sleeping at night and I was getting up for work and was absolutely exhausted. I had to explained to my manager I wasn’t only a danger to myself but others too. 'I was suffering from stress it was just a total nightmare. I have been here almost 25 years and we even looked at moving. 'But how could we sell our house knowing what the neighbours were like and you have to tell the potential buyer? I still suffer from anxiety and stress. It’s affected me mentally. At last we’ll get a bit of peace and quiet.' Another neighbour said: “One or two people used to call her Ma Baker because he seemed to be so protective of her sons. She let them get away with anything. 'They were constantly running in and out of gardens and were little beats. Some people lost count of the number of times their car windows were smashed.' The judge said whilst Ms Walker did not physically stand by her sons while the incidents took place, she had not put into place any 'rules or boundaries' for her children. Her sons were described as being 'devoid of any sense of responsibility and that their behaviour had pushed them along the path towards prison.' Walker claimed other children on the estate caused problems. She said: 'My kids have been difficult but all of the children used to congregate near our driveway. 'Yet the complaints were always about my kids. There were other kids doing just as much. I'm not saying my boys are angels - but they’ve got behavioural and emotional problems.'

While a soup slurper or sandwich chomper be irritating to most, for 19-year-old Emma Riehl, everyday noises are unbearable. She suffers from a rare disease known as misophonia, in which she simply cannot tolerate noises like chewing, swallowing, and breathing. The neurological condition, which literally means ‘the hatred of sound,’ means that many of its sufferers are forced into a life of quiet solitude. Scroll down for Ms Riehl's video diary . Hatred of sound: Emma Riehl finds it difficult to go to class because of the distracting noises, which often make her angry . Ms Riehl currently attends university and feels a sharp anxiety any time she has to go to lecture. ‘Immediately after hearing one of my triggers, I become enraged, I become very hot, tingly, anxious,’ she explained in her video diary assigned by ABC News’ 20/20. ‘There are about 25 kids in this class, and five of them have colds, so it’s pretty hard for me to deal with.’ Those who suffer from the affliction are often driven into lives of quiet and solitude, simply because they cannot stand to be around people who make these simple noises. Triggers: Common noises like typing and texting can trigger misophonia in its sufferers . Help: While there is no cure for misophonia, ear plugs and white noise machines can help . Even the sound of texting and feet hitting flip-flops could send a misophonia sufferer over the edge. Simple eating noises such as chewing, crunching, sucking, and swallowing can trigger feelings of anxiety and rage in some, while pops in the letter ‘p’ and ‘s’ or fillers such as ‘uh and ‘um’ send others in a blind fury. Even household noises such as plastic bags crinkling or silverware hitting plates can put someone over the edge. Source: misophonia.info . There has been little study into the causes of misophonia, though experts say that the condition worsens at the advent of adolescence. Neuroscientists Aage R. Moller, who works at the University of Texas at Dallas, told the New York Times last September that there is ‘no known effective treatment,’ though Ms Riehl said she better contains her anger when she exercises frequently and keeps to a schedule. The Times noted that misophonia is quite different from hyperacusis, which is the over-sensitivity to the loudness of a sound. While there is no cure for misophonia, many recommend using earplugs to lessen everyday noises. Noise generators can also help reduce the offending noises. Those with the condition can also go to behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy, according to Misophonia UK.

The iconic British MGB sports car that brought affordable sports car motoring to the masses is to be reborn in the 21st century – designed by Britons but built in China. The new MG Icon was unveiled as one of the undoubted stars of the Beijing Motor Show and is a modern take on a much loved classic which is still seen widely on the road today. It was unveiled by the MG company which is now part of the giant Shanghai Automotive industry Corporation (SAIC) which also owns Rover following the collapse of MG Rover under the controversial stewardship of the ‘Phoenix Four’ led by John Towers. Back on the road: MG's Chinese owners showed off the company's new sports car, the Icon, at the 2012 Beijing motor show . The modern-day take on the classic British sports car is expected to be launched in 2014 . Its British design team said they had taken cues from the original MGB to create a modern take on the sports car. Although the show model is a coupe, a soft-top roadster is also set to follow. But the Chinese love of British sports cars carried through to the MG stand itself which proudly bore the company badge. Alongside mini-skirted Chinese girls were references to ‘Morris Garage’ from which the letters are said to derive, pictures of the company’s founder Cecil Kimber and a giant map of the United Kingdom painted as a patriotic Union Flag in red white and blue. There were even photographs of Spitfires on the walls. Insiders say the car is likely to go on . sale around 2014 at a price of around £16,000. Although it will be . manufactured in China, it is possible that some could be sent to the UK . in kit form for final assembly at MG’s Longbridge factory in . Birmingham. Interior: Although the model on show was a coupe, a soft-top roadster is also set to follow . Rear view: According to the car's British designer the rear haunches were inspired by the firm's 1955 model the MGA . Pledge: Although it will be manufactured in China, it is possible that . some cars could be sent to the UK in kit form for final assembly at . MG's Longbridge factory in Birmingham . The MG Icon project’s chief designer, Birmingham born Steve Harper, 53,  who started as an Austin Rover apprentice and also worked on the MG Metro and MGF sports car during his 35 year career, said: ’MG in China is seen as a young person’s brand. It’s also a global brand. 'We didn’t want to create a retro car. But we wanted to show how the MGB would have developed had its production not been ended in 1980. It’s sporty, small but practical. 'There are two seats in the back if you need to take the kids. We’re showing a coupe. But why not a roadster?’ And Anthony Williams-Kenny, 37, who is global director of design for all of the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) said: ’We set out to create a modern car, not a retro car. Southampton-born father of two Mr Williams-Kenny, who studied automotive design at Coventry University and worked himself for seven years for the MG Rover group at Longbridge, added: ’Since we took the covers off we’ve had so many people from around the world come up to us and say ""we used to have an MGB"". It’s struck a chord', he said. Head turner: The car was one of the undeniable stars of the Beijing Motor Show . Sleek: An artist's impression of what the interior of the new roadster version will look like . Unlike the original the roadster will offer ample space for four and a generous boot . The original MGB  was launched as a soft-top roadster in 1962, with a fixed-head coupe following three years later in 1965. It was built until October 1980 at MG’s factory at Abingdon in under the umbrella of MG,  the British Motor Corporation and its successors, British Motor Holdings and British Leyland Motor Corporation. More than half a million were built altogether over the 18 year lifespan, of which more than 125,000 are the hard-topped MGB GT coupes. Work on a successor for the MGB had been undertaken as long ago as 1968, but British Leyland had pulled the plug on that project by the end of 1970. When the Abingdon factory finally closed in the autumn of 1980, British Leyland did not replace it. But second hand versions of both the GT and Roaster versions of the MGB continue to provide affordable sporty motoring for many and sell for between £1,500 and more than £9,000 depending on condition. MG cars were the creation of Cecil . Kimber, general manager of Morris Garages in Oxford, who, in 1923, . fitted special sports bodies onto standard Morris chassis. After . years as part of British Leyland and its many incarnations, it has . undergone a tumultuous few years - having been sold to Germany's BMW; . who then offloaded it with the blessing of the last Labour Government' to the infamous  'Phoenix Four' directors led by John Towers, before it . went bust, sparking a major scandal inquiry. It was then snapped up for a song by the . Chinese and is now owned by the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation . (SAIC)  which also owns Rover, which it has renamed ‘Roewe’  for the . Chinese market, and runs the MG factory at  Longbridge in Birmingham . which assembles some cars such as the MG6  from kits supplied from . China.

MG and Rover were bought for just £10 after BMW, which bought it in 1994, decided to off-load the loss-making company in 2000 following six years of controversy and  rising costs and after a  potential sale to venture capital company Alchemy - opposed by unions and many Labour MPs - fell through. Ministers were pleased by the rival Phoenix consortium deal because it kept Rover alive in the run up to he 2001 General Election at a time when its failure would have been acutely damaging in key West Midland marginal seats. When the firm finally went bust with a loss of 6,300 jobs in April 2005 just before that year's General Election - and with dozens of marginal seats at risk - the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown rushed to Birmingham to appear hands-on during the crisis which saw the Chinese picking up the company for a song from the receivers. MG was initially bought from the administrators in 2005 by Nanjing Automotive Company (NAC) which in turn was taken over by Shanghai Automotive in a merger 'encouraged' by the Chinese Government. The Phoenix directors made around £40million from their stewardship of the car firm  but have always denied charges of 'asset-stripping'. But one senior BMW boss described the 'Phoenix Four' directors as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. The Longbridge  factory sprang back to life under Chinese ownership in August 2008 to re-start production of a two-seater MG sports car, the two-seater MG TF LE500 sports car.","Chinese owners to offer new model in 2014 from £16,000 ."

Britain enjoyed the hottest temperatures so far this month today – officially the first day of summer - before three weeks’ worth of rain fall overnight and damp weather ruins the rest of the week. The mercury soared to 22.5C (72.5F) in Northholt, west London this afternoon – topping this month’s previous high of 21.9C (71.4F). Other hotspots included Pershore in Worcestershire, which warmed to 22.1C (71.8C) and Cardiff, where it hit 21.6C (71.1F).

"By . Jill Reilly . UPDATED: . 03:45 EST, 4 June 2012 . Lovechild? Georgina Ray has claimed to be the daughter of Sir Jimmy Savile and has said she will take a DNA test to prove it . A woman who claims to be the secret love child of Sir Jimmy Savile is using a DNA test to lay claim to his millions. Georgina Ray, 40, says her mother had a brief fling with the TV star while working as a waitress in the 1970s. In December blonde Mrs Ray, who bears a striking resemblance to the late presenter, is understood to have told lawyers that she was ‘not after any money’. But now she is waiting for the results of a DNA test which she believes will prove she is related to Sir Jimmy, who died last October aged 84. If the results do conclude that she is his daughter, she could be entitled to his fortune, even though she has never met him and he specified most of his money went to charity. Sir Jimmy Savile’s niece and next of kin Amanda McKenna, 50, said the family are awaiting the outcome of  ­Mrs Ray's claim. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'We have been told she has put in a claim on my Uncle Jimmy’s estate and everything is on hold until it’s ­resolved. It’s in the hands of the executors of the estate and they are dealing with it.' She is reported to have facilitated a DNA test by using a strand of Sir Jimmy's famous white hair found in his flat. At the time of his death, Sir Jimmy . was worth £7.8million - his fortune was made up of £4.3million in his bank . account, a £2.5million property portfolio and £1million in assets. Apart from £600,000 which was placed in a . Trust fund to be shared between six of his closest friends and family, . ­including Ms McKenna. He also set aside £1,000 each for 18 other friends. But he requested that the vast majority of the cash was donated to his charity the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust. His other charity, the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville ­Hospital Trust, had £1.6million to its name. Father: Georgina Ray says she was born after Sir Jimmy had a two-week fling with her mother, a cafe waitress, in 1970 . Those benefiting from his will are understood to have ­received a letter ­saying a claim had been made. It was put forward under the Inheritance ­(Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975 which means any child has a right to make a claim on their ­parent’s estate. The funds in the  two charities’ bank accounts are currently the only money which is protected from her claim. Mrs Ray has not outlined how much she is contesting and if she was proved to be his daughter she would need to prove to a court that whatever amount she wanted was ­'reasonable maintenance.' This means it would be enough to cover her outgoings minus any salary she earns. Merchandise . representative Mrs Ray was born after her mother had a two-week fling . with the DJ, a well-known womaniser who died in October aged 84. Visit: Friends also say that Mrs Ray travelled to Leeds to see Sir Jimmy¿s coffin, which was put on display in a hotel for three days after his death in October . At . the time of the affair, her mother Christine Oakes was 19 and working . as a waitress in a greasy spoon cafe off the A5 in Cannock, . Staffordshire. She is said . to have been ‘awestruck’ when the Top Of The Pops host walked in to the . cafe, ordering six eggs sunny side up and two mugs of tea. Sir Jimmy is said to have later ‘carried Christine out of the cafe caveman-style’ and taken her to his camper van. Their . affair was over in only two weeks. But nine months later, Christine – . who now uses her married name Rumford – gave birth to Georgina. Christine, now 59, is said to have . told her daughter when she was seven years old that Sir Jimmy was her . father but forbade her from contacting him. Mrs Ray is understood to have obeyed . her mother’s request until two years ago, when following a difficult . divorce from her husband Ian she decided to write a letter to the TV . star revealing that she was his daughter. After receiving no response she is said to have travelled to his luxury flat in Leeds to confront him. But the ageing DJ is said to have spoken to her over the intercom pretending to be someone else, saying: ‘He’s away.’ He then refused to come to the door.

The two scooters used by the gang, who had all been wearing black crash helmets in the raid, were stolen in London and later found abandoned nearby. The gang were eventually caught after a joint investigation involving Suffolk, Northamptonshire and London Metropolitan police forces. Dwayne Marsh, 34, was last week found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery following a three-day trial at Ipswich Crown Court. During his trial Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said Marsh had not been in Bury St Edmunds when the robbery took place but played an important role in the crime by hiring a van in which the two scooters were moved to Suffolk. Marsh accepted he had hired a van but told the jury it had been on behalf of a man known only to him as ‘Martin’ and with no knowledge that it was going to be used in connection with the robbery. He will be sentenced on a date yet to be fixed with four others, who have already pleaded guilty to the robbery.","Michael Graver took on the four men in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, when he confronted them in the doorway of a jewellers .

The floatation of Facebook is facing a federal probe amid allegations that underwriter Morgan Stanley kept some investors in the dark over forecasts that the stock would tank. A subpoena has been served on the investment bank in Massachusetts and the federal Securities and Exchange Comission is reviewing the allegations. It has been reported that Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter on the deal, shared information with its major clients, institutional Wall Street investors, that suggested the stock would fall - while keeping small investors unaware. Reuters reported that in the run-up to Facebook's historic $16billion IPO on Friday, the bank unexpectedly delivered negative news to major clients: A  reduction in revenue forecasts for the company. Scroll down for video . Falling flat: Top U.S. financial regulators said the issues around the initial public offering of Facebook should be reviewed . Two investors advised of the revised forecast said it might have contributed to the weak performance of Facebook shares, which sank on Monday and Tuesday - their second and third days of trading - to end more than 18 per cent below the IPO price. It is unclear whether Morgan Stanley only told its top clients about the revised view or spread the word more broadly. The company declined to comment when asked who was told about the research. The change in Morgan Stanley's estimates came on the heels of a May 9 Facebook filing of an amended prospectus with the SEC, in which the company expressed caution about revenue growth due to a rapid shift by users to mobile devices. Mobile advertising to date has been less lucrative than advertising on desktops. 'This was done during the road show - I've never seen that before in 10 years,' said a source at a mutual fund firm who was among those called by Morgan Stanley. Concerns: The Facebook sell-off deepened on Tuesday, as investors continued to question the stock's valuation amid a report that underwriters cut their revenue forecasts before the IPO . The $38-per-share IPO price valued Facebook at $104billion. The news comes as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's chairman said that regulators plan to review allegations against Morgan Stanley. 'The allegations, if true, are a matter of regulatory concern' to FINRA and SEC,' chairman Richard Ketchum told Reuters. The news comes as a senior Nasdaq official told customers at the end of trading Tuesday that the exchange would've pulled the plug on Facebook's IPO if it had known the extent of technical problems, according to the Wall Street Journal. Facebook is additionally facing a federal probe into its disastrous floatation in the stock market after it emerged that underwriters may not have given investors critical information before the site's initial public offering last week. Massachusetts Secretary of Commonwealth William Galvin has issued a subpoena to Morgan Stanley over an analyst's discussions with investors on Facebook. A spokesman for Galvin's office said: 'The Securities Division has put out a subpoena to Morgan Stanley in connection with the analyst's discussion with certain institutional investors about the revenue prospects for Facebook.' Decline: After Friday's nearly flat close and Monday's 11 per cent plunge, Facebook shares have closed 8.9 per cent lower at $31 on volume of 101 million shares . In its three days of trading, Facebook's stock has dropped 18 per cent from its $38 issue price. For the thousands of investors that bought at the IPO, that's bad enough, but one analysis of its earnings prospects suggests it could get a lot worse - more like $10 a share. Despite it's hype and its status as a cultural phenomenon, some estimates suggest Facebook would be fairly priced at $9.59. Some analysts, however, see the stock returning to the $40 per share level it traded at last week. 'Investors are looking for much more growth than the analysts covering the company,' said Greg Harrison, corporate earnings research analyst at Thomson Reuters. Two top U.S. financial regulators said the issues around the initial public offering of the social networking site should be reviewed, putting fresh pressure on the company, its embattled lead underwriter and the Nasdaq. Offering: Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg is seen on a screen getting ready to ring the NASDAQ stock exchange opening bell in Times Square last week . After Friday's nearly flat close and Monday's 11 per cent plunge, Facebook shares closed 8.9 per cent lower at $31 on volume of 101 million shares. At that price the company has shed more than $19 billion in market capitalization from its $38-per-share offering price last week. Perhaps not willing to see the price fall any lower, CEO Mark Zuckerberg dumped his 30.2 million shares of stock in the company later Tuesday. At $37.58 a share, Zuckerberg will take home a before-taxes total of $1.13billion, according to Marketwatch. Facebook director Peter Thiel followed suit, dumping his 16.8 million shares for a gross total of $633million. One person who failed to see the disaster coming was President Obama . During remarks at a Facebook-hosted town hall meeting with Zuckerberg last year, the president hyped the social networking site. He said: 'Nobody is doing better than Exxon. Nobody is doing better than Shell or these other companies. They are doing great. They are making money hand over fist. Well, maybe Facebook is doing a little better.' Investors were still shaking their heads over the botched opening trading of Facebook when Reuters reported late Monday that the consumer Internet analyst at lead underwriter Morgan Stanley cut his revenue forecasts for Facebook in the days before the offering, information that may not have reached many investors before the stock was listed. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which were also underwriters on the deal, each revised their estimates during Facebook's IPO road show as well, according to sources familiar with the situation. Reuters reported that Morgan Stanley selectively disclosed the change in Facebook estimates, which drew the attention of the main regulator of U.S. brokerages. 'That's a matter of regulatory concern to us and I'm sure to the SEC,' said Richard Ketchum, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's chairman and chief executive. 'And without saying whether it's us or the SEC, we will collectively be focusing on it. Good investment? An investor holds prospectus explaining the Facebook stock after attending a show for Facebook initial public offering in Boston, Massachusetts . At least one investor has sued the stock exchange on Tuesday, claiming that Nasdaq bungled the IPO and did not nix orders when asked to by would-be stockholders. Phillip Goldberg, a Maryland resident, is seeking class-action status on behalf of all investors who lost money because Nasdaq delayed or otherwise mishandled their buy, sell or cancellation orders for Facebook stock on May 18, the day the social networking company went public. In addition, a different civil lawsuit was filed against Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, IPO underwriters Morgan Stanley & Co and others alleging violations of securities laws. Despite that, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro said investors should be confident in investing, but she conceded there were questions to answer as well. 'I think there is a lot of reason to have confidence in our markets and in the integrity of how they operate, but there are issues that we need to look at specifically with respect to Facebook,' she told reporters as she exited a Senate Banking Committee hearing. Defenses notwithstanding, Barry Ritholtz, a widely followed financial blogger and the chief market strategist at Fusion IQ in New York, took all sides - Facebook, Morgan Stanley and Nasdaq - to task in the sharpest terms on his blog Tuesday. Mr Ritholtz said: 'Thus, what we see are a series of bad decisions made by Facebook's executives going back many years.' He added: 'The insiders got greedy, too clever by half, in how they used secondary markets. They picked a bad banker and an awful exchange.' Marketwatch columnist took the criticism a step further, writing on Tuesday that Facebook 'could bring down the economy.' 'You think I’m kidding?' he asked. 'Not one bit. In fact Facebook is now one of my top-12 economy-killing triggers, any one of which could ignite a firestorm.' STILL OVERVALUED?With Facebook shares all but impossible to sell short, investors have sought out almost any related vehicle to bet against the social network. Over the past three trading days, prices plunged on two closed-end funds that owned pre-IPO shares. Firsthand Technology Value Fund and GSV Capital Corp both dropped more than 25 percent even though their Facebook holdings make up only a small fraction of assets. 'Until investors can actually short Facebook, they have to keep shorting other things that can give them some sort of proxy for Facebook,' said Thomas Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, which owns shares of both the battered closed-end funds. Under pressure: Two top U.S. financial regulators said the issues around the initial public offering of the social networking site should be reviewed . Brokers who over-ordered shares in the expectation that supply would be limited continued to complain they received too much stock to handle and were left in the dark about forecast changes. One Morgan Stanley Smith Barney adviser also cited the fact that institutional investors received information that retail investors did not, calling it 'a huge issue for the entire industry. 'Night and day the institutional clients get things that we don't get. It's a big issue,' the adviser said, adding there was surprise within the brokerage that Morgan Stanley, as lead underwriter, had not done more to support the share price. As bad as the declines have been, though, a view persists that the stock remains overvalued.Thomson Reuters Starmine conservatively estimates a 10.8 percent annual growth rate - almost exactly the mean for the technology sector - which would value the stock at $9.59 a share, a 72 percent discount to its IPO price. Similarly, the company's price-to-earnings ratio remains lofty, even after the selloff. The $31 price implies a forward P/E of 60, compared with Google's 13.3 forward price-to-earnings ratio (for a similar rate of growth). The one bright spot for Facebook was news late Tuesday that it had agreed to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit over its 'Sponsored Stories' feature.

Ms Ashton was nominated for the 'structured approach she has instilled in the team'. The 70-day relay started in Land’s End and will finish on July 27 at the opening ceremony of the Games.

The girlfriend of Miami cannibal Rudy Eugene revealed her name and her face for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. She continued to claim her boyfriend of four months was a harmless man and a devout Christian. Yovanka Bryant, 27, went so far as to say that Eugene, who was gunned down by police after he ate 75 percent of a homeless man's face, would have been a 'good father for her children.' Standing alongside celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, Miss Bryant said Eugene was carrying a Bible before he stripped naked and went on a brutal, unprovoked rampage along the MacArthur Causeway outside Miami Beach during Memorial Day Weekend. Locking lips: Yovanka Bryant produced this photo of her boyfriend of four months, Rudy Eugene, to prove that he was not a violent man . Speaking her mind: Miss Bryant, 27, appeared along side celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, who said she was representing Miss Bryant 'to help her have a voice' She says the only explanation of Eugene's behavior is that he must have been drugged without his knowledge. 'I thought he would be a good father for my children. I wish the public knew Rudy the way I did, she said, according to CBS Miami. She said they never talked about voodoo or cannibalism when they were together. Miss Bryant released a photograph of her and Eugene kissing during a choreographed media appearance led by the famous attorney. Allred represented Nicole Brown Simpson's family during the OJ Simpson murder trial. More recently, she stood with one of the women who accused former presidential candidate Herman Cain of sexual harassment.

She claimed Eugene was carrying a Bible with him before he stripped off all his clothes while walking three miles from Miami Beach to downtown Miami, Florida, in the scorching heat. He also studied the Koran, she added. However, she harmed her own credibility when she said Eugene lived a clean life. 'Rudy never drank alcohol or used drugs around me,' Miss Bryant said. Coming out: Allred said she is helping Miss Bryant handle the international media exposure the cannibalism case has received . Standing by her man: Miss Bryant acknowledged the difference between the things she was saying about Eugene and the public picture of him attacking another man . Moments later, she revised her claim: 'I only saw him smoke marijuana once,' she admitted. A preliminary toxicology report shows Eugene had marijuana in his system when he was killed. Authorities have said he snorted bath salts, which caused him to attack Ronald Poppo, the homeless man who is now recovering from the horrific injuries he sustained. Medical examiners must wait at least two months before more in-depth blood tests can determine if Eugene had any other substances in his system. Miss Bryant acknowledged that her picture of Eugene is dramatically different than the public image of her boyfriend. 'This is a high-profile case,' Allred said.

Seven German . banks have been downgraded by one of the most reputable rating agencies . amid fears that eurozone debt will hit the country. Moody's . said it would be cutting the rating of Germany's second biggest bank, . Commerzbank AG, from A2 to A3 for the long term with a negative outlook. Moody's said its move was driven in part . by 'the increased risk of further shocks emanating from the euro area . debt crisis in combination with the banks' limited loss-absorption . capacity.' Despite the downgrading of the banks, world markets rose, buoyed by the prospect of action from the European Central Bank which is due to meet tomorrow to discuss the crisis. Germany's DAX closed up 2.09 per cent . while the FTSE closed up 2.36 . per cent at 5384.11. Commerzbank AG, Germany's second biggest bank, has had its rating downgraded by Moody's from A2 to A3 . Spain's treasury minister Cristobal Montoro . (left) said markets' doors were closed to Spain while Prime Minister . Mariano Rajoy (right) said Europe 'needs to support those that are in . difficulty' The ECB isn't likely to take any new . steps that will address immediate concerns when it meets, analysts say, even as anxiety builds . over the deteriorating outlook for Europe's economy and banking system. Indeed Herman van Rompuy, European . Council president, will detail long term plans for eurozone integration that are not intended to deal with Spain's crisis as it asks for help. Spanish Treasury minister Cristobal Montoro has said high borrowing costs mean that Spain 'doesn't have market doors open' to it as he begs for more money to help its debt-laden banks. The . request for aid comes as the European Union unveiled plans to stop . taxpayers' money from being used to bail out failed banks. Elsewhere the UK's treasury committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie, has also said that Greece should leave the euro. He believes that the ECB cannot solve . problems facing the country and plans need to be made for an orderly . exit. If Greek voters don't vote for austerity measures Greece could be . kicked out of the eurozone causing chaos. He said that a contingency plan should be made to make Greece leave or face a 'catastrophic' exit. He added that a bailout for Spain . would now be impossible, and the amount of money needed to prop up its . troubled banking sector is estimated to be around €40bn. He did not explain why a rescue would . be impossible, but many analysts fear the size of the economy would . stretch the resources of existing European rescue mechanisms. Spain's economy represents 12 per cent of the eurozone's output - twice that of Ireland, Portugal and Greece combined. The appeal from Europe’s fourth largest economy came as the G7 group of leading nations held crisis talks. Spain, the fourth biggest economy in . the eurozone, is set to put €2bn of bonds up for auction tomorrow, . considered to be a key test for the country. Mr Montoro urged the European Union to help  recapitalise its debt-laden banks. 'The . risk premium says Spain doesn’t have the market door open and that we . have a problem in accessing markets when we need to refinance our debt,' he said. There will be some relief for . taxpayers when the European Commission unveils its proposals to make . bank shareholders and creditors shoulder the burden of losses rather . than taxpayers. Cash injection: Santander chairman Emilio Botin says a relatively small figure of £32billion would be enough to prop up Spain's ailing smaller banks . It is hoped that this will prevent a . run on the banks which could pull the entire system down. Spain's prime . minister Mariano Rajoy . echoed Mr Montoro's comments adding that Europe 'needs to support those . that are in difficulty.' He said: 'The most urgent and important thing is we have a problem of financing, of liquidity and of debt sustainability.' Herman van Rompuy, European Council president, will detail long term plans for eurozone integration that are not intended to deal with Spain's crisis . A G7 source said Germany was pushing Spain to end its resistance to a rescue from the eurozone’s bailout fund. Spain has been trying to gain direct aid without having to submit to the political humiliation of an assistance programme. Meanwhile David Cameron will hold talks on Europe’s debt crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this week. The chairman of Spain's largest bank . said yesterday that the European Union could solve his country's . financial problems by contributing £32billion to some of its most . troubled banks. The comments come ahead of a telephone . conference between the finance chiefs of the G7 group of industrialised . nations, which fear that Europe's failure to get to grip with its . worsening financial position will drag on global recovery. Emilio Botin, of Santander, said the . prospect of a bailout for the nation's government would be 'bad for . Spain', insisting instead on an injection of €40billion to such banks as . Bankia, Catalunya Caixa and others. The Spanish government has been trying . to come up with a plan to recapitalise Bankia, the country's . third-largest bank, after its management requested £15.4 billion from . the government in May. The cost of international bailouts so . far amount is £69billion for Ireland, £63billion for Portugal and . £236billion for Greece, leading to deep worries about the price of a . Spanish lifeline. Mr Montoro said Prime Minister Mariano . Rajoy's government, which took power in December after a landslide . election win over the previous Socialist administration, had a mandate . to reform. Evidence . that Europe's debt crisis is continuing to drag down world economies . pushed stock markets lower today, ahead of the G7 conference call about . the crisis. U.S. officials . have said Washington expects more action to strengthen the European . banking system in the next two weeks before a meeting of the Group of 20 . major economies in Los Cabos, Mexico, later this month. Germany's . DAX retreated one per cent to 5.922, while France's CAC-40 rose 0.4 per . cent to 2,967. Markets in London were closed for a second day for the . Queen's Jubilee celebrations. The euro fell back 0.6 per cent to $1.2429. U.S. markets also looked set to open lower. S&P futures fell 0.2 per . cent to 1,271, while Dow futures edged down 0.03 per cent to 12,059. Earlier in Asia, stock markets rose following a move by Chinese authorities to boost consumption. Japan's . Nikkei 225 index rose one per cent to 8,382 after suffering sharp . losses the day before. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 per cent to . 18,259.03, and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.1 per cent. He said: 'We had the vote of Spaniards . and that is the task they gave us. We understand that our future is in . Europe, in the euro. And we should clearly bank on the institutions . taking decisions.' Mr Montoro's comments seemed to chime . with Mr Botin's, with the finance minister agreeing that an . EU-established banking union would allow ailing lenders to seek help . without governments intervening. Mr Montoro declined to set a figure of . how much money the sector would need to cover toxic loans and . mortgages, but said the question was where the money would come from - . and insisted the EU must make progress on banking unity measures. As bond markets charge exorbitant . rates to lend to Spain, investors fear Madrid may be forced to seek . external aid to finance a bailout of the bad loan-ridden financial . system. A report for clients by HSBC has . calculated that over three years the costs of a bailout for Spain would . be £365billion, of which £80billion would go towards the banks. While analysts have priced a banking . rescue at between £50billion and £160billion, Mr Montoro said the sum . required to recapitalise the financial sector '...is not a very high . figure, it is not an excessive figure'. No . cut is expected later today in the ECB's benchmark interest rate, which . is already at a record low of 1 per cent. And there's little prospect . that it will serve up more cheap emergency loans for shaky banks anytime . soon. It handed out €1 trillion in such loans in December and February. Analysts say the ECB has a strong motive for staying put until it sees some movement from governments. 'The . ECB looks tired of being the eurozone's fire brigade and seems to have a . preference for staying on hold,' Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING in . Brussels, wrote in a note to investors. 'It looks like the ECB will want . to keep the pressure as high as possible to tackle political . complacency.'","Spain needs around €40bn to prop up its debt-laden banks .

A vile rapist whose terrified 11-year-old victim decided not to go to police because of an EastEnders storyline was today jailed for 11 years. Junior Hall, 41, attacked the girl after she called him gay - and he later tried to bribe her with a £20 note. While carrying out the rape, he told her: ‘I’m not gay, I like this too much.’ The victim, who cannot be named, tried to tell her mother but felt she was not believed because the case was too similar to a plot from the BBC soap. The storyline in question was a 2001 plot in which Maureen ‘Little Mo’ Mitchell was raped by her long-term partner Trevor Morgan for buying a hat to wear to her sister's wedding. Mo confided to her sister Kat but said she did not want to go to court and repeat details to a courtroom full of strangers. Later in the series, Mo killed Trevor with an iron. Hall's victim, who watched EastEnders, convinced herself that her mother did not believe her account because of its similarity to the plot. She also believed that, if she reported the crime, her experience would be similar to Mo's and she would not get the support she needed. She did not realise that she would be able to give evidence behind a screen. The attack, which was eventually . reported in 2010, took place at some point between June 2001 and June . 2003 when the girl was aged eleven or twelve. The court was told the girl only summoned enough courage to go to police in 2010 when she was an adult. Hall's victim tried to tell her mother but felt she was not . believed because the case was too similar to an EastEnders plot . involving Trevor Morgan (left), played by Alex Ferns, and 'Little Mo', . played by Kacey Ainsworth . Blow: Little Mo strikes Trevor with an iron in a scene from the television soap opera . Hall denied rape, claiming the attack never took place, but a jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty by an 11-1 majority after more than three-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Judge Timothy Pontius told him: 'She was completely defenceless when you assaulted her. 'She is very much to be congratulated, not only for her courage in reporting to police, but in the remarkable turnaround in her life.'

The great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the world-wide Scout Movement, has appeared in court for the first time since he was charged with his wife's murder in Australia today. His appearance came after numerous reports that 40-year-old Gerard Baden-Clay had been having an affair in the months before the death of his wife, Allison, 43. The murder charge was brought at a Brisbane police station on Wednesday night shortly after Mr Baden-Clay's lawyer, Mr Darren Mahoney, announced that that was the intention of murder squad detectives. Gerard Baden-Clay is driven into the Brisbane Police Watch House after being charged with the murder of his wife Allison Baden-Clay . Mystery: Allison Baden-Clay is the wife of Gerard Baden-Clay, the great grandson of Scout movement founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell. He has now been charged with her murder . He stood with his back to the public . gallery at Brisbane's Roma Street complex for the hearing that lasted . just a matter of minutes. After a health check-up, he was put into his cell for his first night in jail. None of his family was at the short hearing and he appeared to be wearing the same shirt he wore when he was arrested. He will appear before the court again on July 9 when there will be a committal hearing. 'He's devastated,' said Mr Mahoney. Mr Gerard Baden-Clay, 40, was taken . by homicide squad detectives to a Brisbane police station and told his . lawyer that he was being charged with the murder of his former beauty . queen wife Allison, 43. Detectives had earlier called at Mr . Baden-Clay's house and placed him under arrest before driving him to a . police station where preparations were made to charge him with murder. The mother of three's disappearance . from her home after she set out for a late night walk on April 20 . sparked a massive police search. Her body was found on the banks of a creek a half hour's drive from her home 10 days later. Mr Baden-Clay has made much of his relationship to Lord Baden-Powell, making reference to it on his real estate agent's website. Evidence: Queensland Police detectives leave a house belonging to the parents of Gerard Baden-Clay in Kenmore, north-west Brisbane . Family ties: Elaine Baden Clay (left) outside her home from which . evidence was removed. Police insist Mr Baden-Clay is 'not . considered a person of interest in his wife's disappearance' Following the discovery of Mrs . Baden-Clay's body a Brisbane newspaper claimed that her husband had been . having an affair in the months leading up to her murder. A Brisbane newspaper claimed that it . was in Mr Baden-Clay's real estate office that an affair had started . with a saleswoman - and that relationship had been the focus of police . investigations. According to the newspaper, staff at . the real estate office reported seeing Mr Baden-Clay leaving the woman's . home after hours. There was also disquiet over perceptions that the . woman was receiving preferential treatment with new property listings. What happened? Mr Baden-Clay told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together. When he woke up in the morning she was gone . Proud past: Sir Robert Baden-Powell (pictured) is the great grandfather of Gerard Baden-Clay . The paper said tensions in the office . came to a head around the middle of last year when Mr Baden-Clay told . employees that Allison had discovered the affair. Mrs Baden-Clay, a former Queensland . beauty queen, is said to have denied to friends that her husband had . been having an affair and that she wanted her marriage to work. 'She did everything she could to make a happy home,' a source told the Sunday Mail in Brisbane. The investigation into the murder of Mrs Baden-Clay captured the attention of Australia. 'This is a case of an innocent whose . tragic story has captured hearts,' said Queensland Police Commissioner . Bob Atkinson as detectives continued inquiries into the woman's murder. There were some crimes that grip the . public's imagination, he said, adding: 'This is clearly a case with . significant public interest.' Mr Baden-Clay's lawyer said after his . revelation that his client was being charged with murder that he would . 'defend the charge vigorously.'

Jailed: Mark Gore Gore admitted falsely imprisoning the 21-year-old woman in his home but denied kidnapping her with sexual intent . A man who tried to persuade a female . job seeker to try on sexy underwear after he had lured her . to his home for a job ‘interview’ has been jailed for a year. Mark Gore, 38, masterminded an 'elaborate ploy', including a string of fake personalities and meetings, to 'sound out' the 21-year-old for sex after spotting her CV that she had handed to a pub. Gore, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, clearly had a ‘sexual motive’ for what he did and 'lied through his teeth' to meet his lascivious goal, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Gloucester Crown Court. Posing on the telephone as a recruiter called 'Colin', Gore told the woman that he had the power to offer her work in local pubs, hotels or a strip club that he was working for. Impressed by his claims she agreed to meet him at a hotel for an 'interview', to which he turned up under the guise of Colin's boss, Mark Jefferson. 'You told lie upon lie... [creating] an impression that you were interviewing her and other people for employment,' said the judge.'You sounded her out, I am quite sure, to see if she was willing to undertake a role that might have a sexual element to it. 'This was an elaborate ploy. It was . not a last-minute thought. You had seen her advert looking for work the . day before and you set about luring her to the hotel and then to your . home.' Satisfied with the first 'interview', Gore called the woman again to arrange a second one in October last year. He picked her up in his car and told her he had to pass his home to make some phone calls. Scene: Gore picked her up in his car and told her he had to pass his home on Exmouth Street, Cheltenham, to make some phone calls . She earlier told the court: 'He said he had two reception jobs on . building sites, he had bar work in Cheltenham and he also ran a strip . club in Birmingham where he needed a manager and a PA. 'I went in with him but I was a bit suspicious and nervous by this time. 'I was stood in his kitchen while he was on the phone making calls. On the table was a bag and he asked me to look in it. 'There was lingerie in there. There . was a pink basque, a red top that was quite lacy and things for the . arms. I got a bit scared then. He asked me if I would try this stuff on . and I said no. 'I said I didn’t feel comfortable and I . was a bit scared and wary. He asked me how he could make me feel more . comfortable. I said, ""You can’t"". 'He then approached me and he went in for a kiss. I turned my head but he leaned in and kissed me. 'I was scared. I didn’t know what to do with myself. I was in shock. 'He realised I was not going to give him a kiss and then it changed. He asked me if I wanted to go home and he took me back. 'He said to me that I had passed the test and I had got the job. ' Gore admitted falsely imprisoning the woman in his home but denied kidnapping her with sexual intent. His pleas were accepted by the prosecution. But because Gore denied the woman’s claim that he tried to kiss and seduce her, a ‘trial of issue’ was held for Judge Jamie Tabor QC to decide which version of the facts he believed. After hearing from the woman and from Gore, the judge said he accepted everything that she said and found that Gore had been ‘lying through his teeth from start to finish.’ As well as the jail term the judge made an order banning Gore from contacting the woman or her mother. Giles Nelson, defending, told the court that as a result of publicity of the case Gore had been attacked and beaten up and had to receive hospital treatment last week. He pointed out that as soon as Gore knew he had upset and frightened the girl he desisted and drove her home. 'This was a very unusual offence,' said the barrister. 'It was in a period of his life when he was experiencing a series of problems in his life and depression. 'Although what he did was elaborate it was very unsophisicated.'","Mark Gore, 38, promised woman, 21, he could offer work in bars or clubs .

However the continent still held the biggest share of world wealth at $11.4 trillion, even though it was down 2.3 per cent. The rise in the Asian super rich came despite declining fortunes among the world's wealthy due to turbulent financial markets.

The top three economies, U.S, Japan and Germany, retained 53.3 per cent of the total share of HNWIs, slightly up from 53.1 per cent in 2010 . The contraction came as financial markets grew more volatile over widespread concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis. Markets were also unsettled by a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating and unrest in Arab countries that kept oil prices high. In Asia, rising inflation, shrinking exports and natural disasters such as Japan's devastating tsunami added to market turbulence. The world's superrich, defined as worth $30 million or more, took the biggest hit. Globally, their ranks dropped 2.5 percent to 100,000 and their combined fortunes fell about 5 percent. The ultrawealthy are more likely to invest their money in higher risk assets such as hedge funds, private equity or commercial real estate. While returns can be greater, if markets turn sour such investments are also harder to unload for a 'palatable price in a viable time frame,' so instead they were stuck in super rich investors' portfolios, where they quickly lost value last year, the report said.","Region home to 3.37 million high net worth individuals compared to 3.35 in North America .

The youngster was rushed to Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital where medics operated to remove the pellet.

Newlyweds Kimberley and Dominic Proffitt were left devastated when they were unable to jet off after their wedding because of the bank's computer problems. Generous wedding guests surprised the couple by collecting £1,000 to send the pair on a romantic once-in-a-lifetime break to the Greek island of Rhodes.

They were left grounded because travel . agents could not process their debit card due to the computer meltdown, . which has caused a backlog of 100 million transactions. And Kimberley branded a gesture by local bank boss Tracy Tonry of turning up on their doorstep to hand delivering their £1,000 in cash, several days later, as 'too little too late'. Grounded: Kimberley Proffitt saw her chance at a dream honeymoon destroyed when the NatWest computer glitch meant she could not book the tickets . Insurance clerk Kimberley, 25 and from .

She said: ‘I paid by card at the bar and the card was declined, so our bridesmaids had to pay in cash and pay for us too. ‘The barman looked at the card and . said, “Oh, it’s a NatWest one” and everyone started talking about the . problems people had been having. ‘Me and Dominic didn’t have a clue.

A prominent race lawyer exposed as a crook by the Mail was yesterday booted out of the legal profession and ordered to pay £1.4million in costs. Shahrokh Mireskandari, 51, was struck off after it emerged he had faked his legal qualifications and hid his criminal convictions while representing celebrity clients. The conman was found guilty of an extraordinary 104 breaches of the rules governing solicitors’ conduct by a central London disciplinary tribunal. 'Dear friend': Labour MP Keith Vaz (left) and race lawyer Shahrokh Mireskandari (right), pictured at a House of Commons function in November 2007 . It ruled that while running London-based law firm Dean and Dean, he racked up debts, overcharged clients, conducted improper litigation, failed to keep proper records and used clients’ cash to pay staff salaries. The tribunal hearing took place after the Mail revealed in 2008 that Mireskandari: . • Was a fraudster who had conned his way into the UK legal profession . • Had worthless legal qualifications from a mail-drop university in Hawaii . • Overcharged clients while masquerading as a respected race lawyer . • Had an improper professional relationship with crooked Scotland Yard commander Ali Dizaei. When Mireskandari was exposed by the Mail, he was representing ex-Met assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his race claim against Britain’s biggest force and former commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. Close contact: Shahrokh Mireskandari shakes hands with Keith Vaz at a London event hosted by the MP in 2007 . As an ‘expert’ on race relations, Mireskandari ‘paralysed’ Scotland Yard with multi-million-pound race relations litigation, often in cahoots with his Iranian compatriot, the since jailed Dizaei. He even declared he would ‘destroy Sir Ian and his golden circle’ of white officers. Our investigation also revealed how Mireskandari was in close contact with Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, who publicly described him as a ‘very, very dear friend’ and also as the ‘best lawyer in Britain’. Such was Mr Vaz’s loyalty to the lawyer that he even attempted to intervene in a court case on his behalf and lobbied for him in a letter to the legal watchdog. But, in the aftermath of our investigation, Mireskandari was suspended from practising as a solicitor and his firm closed down, Dizaei was suspended and Mr Ghaffur humiliated into dropping his £1million-plus race claim. The decision to kick Mireskandari out of the legal profession follows a six-week misconduct hearing dogged with attempts by him to halt the proceedings. After getting the hearing adjourned from April last year, Mireskandari failed to return from Los Angeles to give evidence, instead bombarding the tribunal with applications to adjourn on medical grounds. He was represented by 17 barristers but panel chairman Jacqueline Devonish said that allegations of dishonesty had been proved. She said it was ‘not credible’ that the solicitor could have achieved top marks in his doctorate at the discredited American University of Hawaii, while at the same time working full-time and being thrown out of three law schools for poor performance. It also ruled that ‘without a shadow of a doubt’ he acted dishonestly when he hid his criminal convictions for 15 counts of telemarketing fraud in America from the Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) when he returned to the UK. The tribunal found he racked up huge debts at Dean and Dean and then ‘dishonestly and recklessly’ used clients’ cash to prop up his business. One client’s mortgage account fund was pilfered by Mireskandari to pay off debts. Another client’s £200,000 bail bond was withdrawn without permission from the court. When a judge ordered it be repaid, Mireskandari was forced to borrow £250,000 from a client to cover the shortfall. Mireskandari was also found guilty of billing clients for work that had not been done. At the same time, he racked up huge debts to barristers. When his firm was closed down, he owed more than £1million in unpaid fees. Mireskandari was also found guilty of participating in an ‘improper scheme’ to reproduce images of a client’s injuries, using a make-up artist, before passing them off as police photographs to the Home Secretary. It was also found he misled the court on a number of occasions – and attracted critical judgments against him. The panel found 54 separate breaches of the Solicitors’ Code of Conduct, 36 of the Solicitors’ Account Rules and 14 of the Solicitors’ Practice Rules. Mireskandari claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated vendetta by the SRA and the Mail. But the tribunal dismissed this. Striking him off, Miss Devonish said: ‘The tribunal order that the respondent Shahrokh Mireskandari, solicitor, be struck off the Roll of Solicitors and it further orders that he pay the costs of £1.4million.’ Solicitor Mark Boardman, who represented two of his victims, said: ‘The Mail can be justifiably proud of the hard work, dedication and good old-fashioned investigative journalism that brought this scandal to the attention of the public and resulted in today’s verdicts.’ Mansur Rahnema, a retired heart surgeon, instructed Mireskandari to handle his divorce. The conman bungled the case, presented his client with an £800,000 bill and sued. Years of litigation followed. ‘Thank you for all your courageous reporting,’ Mr Rahnema said. ‘This man is a monster who has caused so much harm to me and my loved ones. He should really be in jail.’ Academic Sheida Oraki instructed Mireskandari for an agreed fee of £1,000. When he presented his bill the figure had risen to £19,000. He sued and drove her to bankruptcy. ‘This is good news but he should never have been allowed to practise in the UK in the first place,’ she said. ‘He has made my life hell.’ Investigation: The Mail revealed that Mireskandari had an improper professional relationship with Scotland Yard commander Ali Dizaei (pictured)","Shahrokh Mireskandari, 51, was booted out of the legal profession after a tribunal hearing .

Immigrants who want to settle in Britain will in future have to learn about Shakespeare, Florence Nightingale and the Beatles, ministers suggested yesterday. A new cultural test will ask settlers to know about historic figures and to understand British achievements, including military victories such as the Battle of Trafalgar. It will ask immigrants to learn by heart the first verse of the national anthem – although no one will be required to memorise the other three. British history: Immigrants who want to settle . in Britain will have to learn about Florence Nightingale and Isambard . Kingdom Brunel . The test, aimed at encouraging migrants to integrate into society, will replace a citizenship exam introduced by Labour seven years ago which asked for knowledge of human rights, the EU and how to claim benefits. Instead of asking about when women won the right to divorce or who gets free prescriptions, the ‘Life in the UK’ test will demand knowledge of artists, poets and authors. Home Secretary Theresa May first promised a new settlement test last month as part of the Coalition’s drive to make sure long-term immigrants can speak English and are familiar with the culture and history of their new country. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Putting our culture and history at the heart of the  test will help ensure those permanently settling can understand British life allowing them to properly integrate into our society.’ Cultural lessons: The citizen test will now include military victories such as the Battle of Trafalgar . Tony Blair’s test, completed by all those applying for citizenship, was produced by a Left-led committee at a time when multiculturalism – the idea that migrant groups  must be allowed to develop their own culture and that British history is tainted with racism – held sway among Labour leaders. Although background handbooks on citizenship had sections on British history, these were never tested. Mrs May’s test will be based on a handbook which calls the UK ‘a modern, thriving society with a long and illustrious history’. Historic figures referred to in drafts of the test material include the Duke of Wellington and Nelson, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Florence Nightingale, Alexander Fleming and Emmeline Pankhurst. Key battles and their dates have to be learned, along with information about the role in the nation’s history of spiritual foundation stones, such as the King James Bible. Immigrants are told – as they are not in the existing test – that ‘historically, the UK is a Christian country’. Scrapped: Sample questions from Labour's citizen exam, which introduced seven years ago . Revamp: The Life In the UK test was first introduced by the Labour Government in 2005 - and included questions on how to claim benefits . Overhaul: Home Secretary Theresa May will unveil a revised version of the test which places the emphasis on British historical facts and culture . Artists about whom settlers will have . to know are Gainsborough, Turner and Constable; novelist names are Jane . Austen, Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy; and poets include Byron, Blake . and Browning. The handbook asks migrants to learn . passages of poetry including Browning’s Home Thoughts, from Abroad. Musical figures range from Elgar and Holst to the Beatles and the . Rolling Stones. In place of practical advice on employment disputes or bin collections, candidates are told that fundamentalist views are unwelcome. The new guide says: ‘Britain is proud of being a welcoming country but all residents, regardless of their background, are expected to comply with the law and to understand that some things which may be allowed in other legal systems are not acceptable in the UK.’ The guide was welcomed by Alp Mehmet, of the Migrationwatch UK think-tank. ‘I think this is the right thing to do,’ he said. ‘It is about looking for what people can contribute and looking for an understanding of the country, rather than being aimed at people who are looking for what they can get out of the country.’ Numbers of people granted settlement have fallen since the Coalition came to power. In the 12 months to March this year there was a 35 per cent fall in settlement grants, from 226,478 to 148,144.","Questions on claiming benefits and the Human Rights Act will be scrapped in overhaul .

John Edwards' mistress has revealed that she saw the politician's cancer-stricken wife as 'family' even while carrying on an affair with her husband. Rielle Hunter has also opened up about the first time she had sex with Mr Edwards, then a presidential candidate, describing it as being 'like a rock concert'. Ms Hunter is cashing in on her notoriety with a tell-all memoir, which she is promoting in an interview with ABC's 20/20 set to air tonight. Rivals: But Rielle Hunter, left, insists that she felt compassion towards Elizabeth Edwards, right, the cancer-stricken wife of her politician lover John . Affair: Ms Hunter and Mr Edwards had a daughter, Quinn, pictured left, though he initially denied paternity . She has repeatedly insisted that Mr Edwards' marriage to his wife Elizabeth, who died of breast cancer in 2010, was over before she began sleeping with him, and even described the terminally ill woman as a 'witch on wheels'. But in her latest interview, she struck a friendlier tone, saying that she had 'a great deal of compassion and empathy for her suffering.' Ms Hunter continued: 'I have no desire to bash Elizabeth. Elizabeth is the mother to my daughter's siblings. And she is, indirectly, now my family.' Talking about the first time she spent the night with the former senator for North Carolina after meeting in a hotel, she described the encounter as having 'an intensity like a rock concert'. She added: 'Something happened internally with me. I responded... I have not experienced it or felt what was happening before. Ever.' Opening up: Ms Hunter appeared on ABC's 20/20 on Friday to promote her upcoming tell-all memoir . Father: Ms Hunter has revealed her devastation when Mr Edwards denied that Quinn was his daughter . Ms Hunter, who worked as a videographer on Mr Edwards' unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, spoke of her pain after he denied being the father of their daughter, Quinn - and said she thought he had lost his mind. 'What it meant to me is that he was temporarily insane,' she said. 'I mean, he had really gone off the deep end a bit there, but it was painful to witness.' Although Ms Hunter was asked to promise that she would not reveal the identity of her daughter's father to anyone except Quinn herself, she refused because she did not want the girl 'growing up under a lie'. She has repeatedly said that she first became involved with Mr Edwards because she wanted to help him in his political career and personal life - but in the 20/20 interview she acknowledged that her 'help' had not led to success for the politician. 'From the outside world looking in, [it's] like, ""Boy, did you sure help him.""' Video: Ms Hunter met Mr Edwards when she was filming material for his presidential campaign . Mr Edwards has not held political office since the scandal, and faced a long-running court case over allegations he had misused campaign funds to hide his affair with Ms Hunter. He was acquitted of one charge last month, and the others were dropped after a mistrial was declared. Previous revelations from Ms Hunter's memoir, entitled What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me, include the claim that Mrs Edwards tormented herself by using pictures of her husband and his mistress as her screensaver. Mr Hunter bragged that she played a role in destroying the 'myth' of John and Elizabeth Edwards, but says the book is part of her 'duty' to Mr Edwards' other children.","Hunter insists she had 'compassion' for her lover's dying wife .

These are the pictures showing the 'horrendous' conditions passengers are being subjected to at Heathrow - a sea of stressed travellers in queues stretching half a mile through the airport. Crowds enduring the two and a half hour wait to get through immigration were photographed last week growing irritable as the airport swelled. Adding to their frustration, they were met with empty passport control desks and uninterested staff, according to the Daily Telegraph. And airport staff even said to have tried to stop them from taking pictures to try and keep the mess under wraps. The chaotic scenes raised concerns over a 'perfect storm' as an extra 650,000 visitors arrive in the country for the Olympics at the height of the holiday season. Ongoing delays: Frustrated passengers queue inside Heathrow last week to try and get through immigration in this picture taken by a traveller. Some people had to wait for up to two and a half hours in lines weaving through the airport . Thousands of athletes descending on Britain from across the world over the next three weeks will also only to the pressure on the immigration system, the responsibility of the Home Office. The Immigration Service Union, which represents 4,500 border staff, said that the present problems were being made worse as only about half the current workers were fully trained to allow passengers from anywhere in the world entry. The Olympics visitors will also arrive at the peak of summer when hundreds of thousands of families are taking foreign holidays, further adding to the strain at the airport. One businessman who was waiting in the non-EU line said he had to wait more than two and a quarter hours on Friday. He had been returning to Britain from Italy and arrived at 8.30am but did not make it through immigration until 11am. The long and winding queue: Passengers stand impatiently in one of the longest of the lines last week - stretching half a mile through the airport. To the right of them is a conveyor walkway with nobody on it . Adding insult to injury: Passengers facing agonising waits can only look on at the infuriatingly empty immigration desks. Staff were even said to be unhelpful during the crowded situation . 'I have never seen anything like it,' the man, who did not wish to be named, told the Telegraph. 'If they think they are going to be ready for the Olympics, which is now less than a month away, then this was a very poor training exercise – and it wasn’t even busy.' Airport staff are said to have tried . desperately to ban restless passengers from taking pictures of the . scenes. But many people were still able to record the situation using . camera phones. Despite the long delays at immigration, Heathrow seemed to be going to great lengths to welcome athletes arriving in the country. A series of Olympics greeting desks . manned by five members of staff have been rolled out across the . airport. Yet when some passengers walked past them on Saturday evening, the staff were standing idle as they waited for athletes to arrive over the next few weeks. The bright pink 'accreditation' desks . have been placed in four terminals to allow athletes to collect their . passes for the Olympic village. The desks do not deal with immigration . and athletes have to go through the same procedures as members of the . public. They are manned . by Olympics officials and Heathrow staff. There will also be 1,000 volunteers in bright garments scattered throughout the airport in the run up to the Olympics to help athletes. BAA admitted today that recent immigration queues at Heathrow were 'unacceptably' long. The . airport operator said the Home Office had promised all Border Force . desks at Heathrow would be manned during the peak Olympics arrival . times. Border chaos: Passengers at Heathrow have complained about spending two and a half hours in queues through immigration... and it could get worse during the Olympics . Athletes will be arriving from around the world but Unions claims that temporary border staff are not trained to deal with international passengers . But it added that the Home Office should be 'delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as Olympic visitors'. A source within the organisation said that staff levels would be higher during the Olympics because contingency plans did not start for another two weeks. They admitted 'minor' breaches of queuing time through immigration but claimed extra staff had been rolled out. Under its targets, the Border Force must get non-EU passport holders through immigration at Heathrow in less than 45 minutes for 95 per cent of the time. A Border Force spokesman said:  'We are fully prepared for the busy Olympic period and will be implementing well-rehearsed plans. This includes staffing all immigration desks at key ports whenever necessary.' The target for EU passport holders at Heathrow is less than 25 minutes for 95 per cent of the time. A BAA spokesman said: 'Immigration is a matter for the Home Office. The Home Office has said that from July 15 all Border Force desks at Heathrow will be open during peak arrival periods. 'Immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at Heathrow in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the Home Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as Olympic visitors.' Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said that the Home Secretary had assured Parliament that the full summer capacity would be in place by now. He added that Britain cannot afford the 'queues or the lax security'. Thousands of drivers in the capital are bracing themselves for gridlock. But it will be a far speedier affair for athletes and Olympics guests zipping around the capital. The high-profile guests will travel glide through the busy streets using these Olympics Games Lanes. The road marking were painted last night and adjustments to traffic lights will begin this week,The Olympics Rings-marked lanes, which run alongside lanes for general traffic, will only come into operation on Wednesday July 25 - two days before the Olympic opening ceremony, with 'ordinary' drivers allowed to use them until then. The lanes have been dubbed 'ZiL lanes' after the Russian-built ZiL car that carried Soviet Union leaders around. A man walks in an Olympics Games Lane on Upper Thames Street, in central London, and right, an 'ordinary; driver passes through one before rules come into force on July 25 . Painting the lanes: Workmen start marking Games lanes along the Olympic Route Network in central London last night . A car zips along one of the lanes in front on the London eye. The roads will certainly not be this clear during the Games . There will be 30 miles of Games Lanes in London, with the lanes forming part of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network (ORN) which links Games venues. Variable message signs along the lanes will state that drivers will be able to use them until July 25, although Transport for London (TfL) is advising motorists to avoid central London around the ORN and Games venues from mid-July. The exception to the free-to-use rule will be the Games Lane on the M4 near Heathrow which will start on Monday July 16 as the 'Games Family' - athletes, officials and the world's media - begin to arrive in big numbers. Before that there will be a reversal of traffic flow in the Kingsway Tunnel at Aldwych in London to assist traffic flows while on Friday July 20 further ORN work will be carried out, including the installation of barriers to simplify junctions. When the ORN and Games Lanes come into full operation on July 25, they will be enforced from 6am to midnight daily. Gridlock: Drivers will endure scenes such as this across London while Olympics cars glide effortless through the traffic . Up to one million extra visitors are expected in London on each day of the Games and there will be up to 1,300 'Games Family' vehicles an hour travelling between key venues. A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations, including driving in Games Lanes or stopping along the route, and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £200. The Games Lanes will end around two days after the Olympics finishes on August 12 and will not be in operation between the Olympics and Paralympics. A smaller Paralympic Route Network will come into operation shortly before the Paralympics start on August 29. Having dedicated routes to events became an Olympic priority after difficulties in the 1996 Games led to the venue in Georgia, USA, being dubbed 'the lost city of Atlanta'.","Perfect storm as 650,000 Olympics visitors arrive at peak of holiday season .

Immaculate collection: Mr Cox had been taking part in the 50th anniversary tour of the Ferrari 250 GTO . Mr Cox had been taking part in the 50th anniversary tour of the Ferrari 250 GTO - an Italian sports car regarded as the Picasso of the motoring world. It is thought the Ferrari, which is one of only 39 ever built, is worth upwards of £20million. The incident took place outside Saint-Etienne-des Guirets, near Blois. As part of the five-day tour, the enthusiasts drove the iconic Gueux racing circuit in Reims before visiting the Abbey of Hautvillers, the home of Dom Pérignon champagne. The Italian convoy, thought to have had a value close to £500million, was en route to Le Mans when the accident happened on Friday morning. Two passengers in the other car were taken to nearby hospital, according to French reports. Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and JCB boss Sir Anthony Bamford were two of 21 groups of multi-millionaire Ferrari fans taking part in the 50th anniversary jaunt. Ferrari built the 250 GTO between 1962 and 1964 with the 174mph sports car sold with a £6,000 price-tag. Status symbol: A man shows off the car to the press.

The model involved in Friday's crash left the factory in April 1962 with the chassis number 3445GT. Initially red, the car was resprayed blue with a yellow central stripe in 1963 to match the colours of Sweden after race driver Ulf Norinder's nationality.

A tragic young alcoholic who issued a desperate warning to teenagers of the dangers of binge drinking from his hospital bed has died, it emerged yesterday. Matthew Stiebrins, 29, began drinking bottles of vodka at the age of 15 with his friends before his habit spiralled out of control. His alcohol abuse was so bad the alcohol started eating away at his brain and and left with irreversible cirrhosis of the liver. Today his mother Dawn Titterington revealed he was still drinking half-a-litre of cider every day in the weeks leading up to his death. Tragic: Matthew Stiebrins's alcohol abuse was so bad the alcohol started eating away at his brain and and left with irreversible cirrhosis of the liver. He is pictured with his mother Dawn, in hospital, last year . He passed away just three months before his 30th birthday - as doctors grimly predicted - because his organs were so badly damaged. Ms Titterington, 51, today echoed her son’s warning for youngsters to avoid his mistakes and keep their drinking under control. She said: 'He suffered so much and so am I. But I hope his story helps someone.' She said at his worst her son would . drink more than five litres of cider every day on top of vodka, but it . was hard for her to keep track of his addiction. She said: 'The alcohol turned him into a little old man. 'He told me he was going to ring me on the night of his death, but he never did. When I went to his house he was dead. He died from pneumonia. His body was so weak. 'Nobody should have to see their child die before them.' Speaking from his bedside, in February last year, Ms Titterington said: 'When he was 15 he got into a crowd that liked going out drinking, like many teenagers do. Addicted: Matthew, pictured left aged 15 when he began drinking . bottles of vodka with his friends before his habit . spiralled out of control. He is pictured right as a young school boy. At 18 he turned to shoplifting . 'The others grew out of it but Matthew didn’t, he didn’t stop. In the end it just didn’t matter what we said - all the warnings we gave. 'He would say ‘it’s only a few, it won’t do me any harm, everyone drinks.'' She added: 'These teenagers say it’s boring not to drink but they don’t realise that it is slowly affecting their health. 'There’s not enough about the dangers of alcohol, always campaigns about smoking and drugs. There is no substitute like nicotine patches for alcoholics. 'Teenagers think they can give it up but their bodies won’t let them. You would never have guessed that Matthew would have been the one from his group of friends to become hooked.' Mr Stiebrins, from Haverhill, Suffolk, began started bunking off school to drink aged 15 and by the time he was 18 he was addicted and shoplifting to fund his habit. In the months before his death on February 5, this year, he was in and out of Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, and doctors predicted he would not live to see his 29th birthday, on May 4, 2012. Ms Titterington, who works as a seamstress and remarried after she left her son's father ten years ago, said she worried about drugs more than alcohol when her children were young. Now she is campaigning for more support for alcoholics in a bid to prevent other parents going through similar heartache.","Matthew Stiebrins began drinking bottles of vodka aged just 15 .

For five months Frenchman Frederic Bourdin managed to convince an entire family he was their missing 16-year-old son - despite being 23-years-old. Bourdin turned up in Spain claiming to be Texas schoolboy Nicholas Barclay three years after he disappeared aged 13. Scroll down to watch The Chameleon trailer . Serial imposter: Frenchman Frederic Bourdin managed to convince and American family he was their missing teenage son Nicholas Barclay . Elaborate: Bourdin managed to keep up the ruse of being Nicholas, despite having brown eyes instead of blue and different facial features, for five months until his deception was discovered by a private investigator . Nicholas's family flew to meet him and despite the fact Bourdin had a completely different eye colour to their son - blue instead of brown - they took him in believing his elaborate story that the change was down to experiments carried out by his captors. He was only caught out by a private investigator working on the story for a TV station in 1997. He was jailed for six years for the con. And, even more incredibly, the elaborate ruse was not the first time Bourdin had posed as a missing child. In fact, he'd made a habit of it over the years, switching from one alias to another with more than 40 different personas. Now the bizarre story of Bourdin - nicknamed 'the Chameleon' - has been turned into a film. Conman: Despite being jailed in 1997 for pretending to be Nicholas Barclay, Bourdin was caught out again in 2005 pretending to be a Spanish orphan at a French school . Another con: In 2003 Bourdin stole the identity of 14-year-old Leo Balley who vanished on a camping trip in Isere eight years earlier . The Chameleon had its UK premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival this week and reveals how the serial imposter kept up the deception by dyeing his brown hair blond, going back to school, and using a pen to fake a tattoo on his hand. But the Barclay ruse turned out to just be the tip of the iceberg. Bourdin was born in 1974 on the outskirts of Paris. He never knew his father and was bought up by his poor grandparents after he mother abandoned him when he was aged just two. The Chameleon: Frederic Bourdin being interviewed on French television about his numerous personas . He began misbehaving and was sent to a school for young troublemakers aged 12. When he was 16, Bourdin ran away to Paris where he unsuccessfully tried to tell a police officer he was a lost British teenager. His inability to speak much English caught him out. Bourdin then made a career out of pretending to be orphans across Europe - using sob stories to be fed, clothed and looked after. He has since learned to speak five languages fluently. After his release from prison for pretending to be Nicholas Barclay, Bourdin immediately took up his way of life again, stealing the identity of 14-year-old Leo Balley in 2003 who vanished on a camping trip in Isere eight years earlier. He was busted by a DNA test. His latest exploit was in 2005 when he attended the Jean Monnet school in Pau, France, posing as Spanish orphan Francisco Hernandez-Fernandez. He was only unmasked when a teacher at the school recognised him in a television programme about his exploits. Talking about the deception, Bourdin said: 'I loved the kids and the people looking after them, they treated me as one of them. The French news agency AFP quoting him as saying at the time that he sought 'love and affection' by assuming false identities. The school head was quoted as saying Bourdin 'appeared a bit older than his pals - two or three years at most'. In 2007, Bourdin married a French woman named Isabelle after vowing to give up his life as a serial imposter. Now Bourdin, aged 38, has three chilren with his wife. The Chameleon was written and directed by Jean-Paul Salomé. Bourdin, renamed Grondin in the movie, helped as a consultant on the film and was portrayed by Canadian actor Marc-André Grondin.

He was given medical scans - and sent home after doctors told him he had a 'trapped nerve.' But Darren returned to hospital five days later with pins and needles and numbness in his arms. The father-of-three was told he had a broken neck and needed immediate treatment. Darren said: 'The doctor told me I could have been paralysed. They said I was lucky to be walking. 'They rushed me straight to the spinal unit in Cardiff and I had to have an operation to fix my neck. 'I’m only 40, and with a young family I was really scared to death. I could have been left in a wheelchair for the rest of my life - how would my family cope?' Darren said he was assaulted outside shops in his home town of Llanelli, near Swansea. He was rushed to Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen where he was treated and discharged just eight hours later. Darren, who is self-employed landscape gardener, carried on with his job until the pain became too much for him. When he returned to the hospital doctors realised their mistake and rushed him to a specialist spine unit in Cardiff. Darren spent a week recovering at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and has been told he cannot work or drive for at least three months. Mr Langabeer was treated at Glangwili General Hospital. Doctors failed to pick up from medical scans that he had a broken neck . He added: 'I carried on working because they thought it was a trapped nerve. I had days of absolute agony, I’d been carrying around lawn mowers and things. 'I’ve built my business up for three years, and I don’t know what will happen to it now, I don’t know how we’re going to manage if I can’t work.' Hywel Dda Local Health Board are now investigating why Darren was allowed to be sent home. A spokeswoman said: 'The health board cannot comment further at this time as a full investigation is ongoing.' A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed a man had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault.","Doctors sent Darren home saying he had a 'trapped nerve'

A professional poker player who owns 1,200 pairs of designer shoes, including 700 pairs of Christian Louboutins, is starting her own lower-priced footwear line. Beth Shak, whose own shoe collection is valued at nearly $1million which she keeps in a password-protected closet, has decided to bring her love of heels to the masses, pricing her newly designed shoes between $160 and $190. The 42-year-old told the New York Post: 'My almost-18-year-old daughter wasn’t happy having a mom that traveled and was gambling. She kept saying, ""Why don’t you design a shoe line?"" and one day I was like, ""You know, she’s right.""' Collector turned designer: Beth Shak, whose own shoe collection is valued at nearly $1million, has decided to bring her love of heels to the masses, pricing her newly designed shoes between $160 and $190 . Earlier this year, Ms Shak's ex-husband, former New York hedge-fund manager Daniel Shak, sued her over her shoe accumulation, claiming she failed to disclose their value in their divorce. The case was dropped however after his claim that he had never noticed her vast collection because of its 'secret room' location in their home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. At the time, Ms Shak said with disbelief: 'He is saying he didn’t know the closet in our master bedroom existed'. The mother of three, who started buying designer shoes in 2004, amassing her enormous collection in just eight years, said she treats herself to a pair of red-soled Christian Louboutins each time she plays a poker tournament. Shoe fiend: Ms Shak, 42, showed off her jaw-dropping footwear collection on the Today Show last year . Close up: Ms Shak's Facebook page is plastered with images of sky-high . stilettos, from Christian Louboutin (left and middle) to Chanel (right) One pair of custom-made black leather cowboy boots, once owned by the late Elizabeth Taylor, cost Ms Shak a staggering $7,725 at a Christie’s accessories auction last year. With 25 sample pairs of her own footwear label already designed and manufactured, Ms Shak is now working on naming them. One pair is named after her daughter, Lindy, with others labelled the Angelina, the Whitney and the Wendy. 'I essentially named my different shoes after anywhere from iconic women to women that meant something in my life,' she explained. 'The Wendy is for [TV talk-show host] Wendy Williams.' Messy divorce: Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak (left) accused his ex-wife Beth Shak (right) of hiding from him her 1,200 pairs . of designer shoes worth $1million at the time of their divorce . One patent purple slingback heel, called the Elizabeth, will see proceeds go to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, she said. Her own shoe collection fluctuates because she often gives shoes away to charities, she said. ‘It . could go up to 1,400, or down to 1,100,’ she told MailOnline last month. ‘I don’t make a big . deal of my philanthropy, but I’m always giving shoes away to charities.’ She recently donated a prized pair of bubblegum pink patent stilettos, made for her by designer Walter Steiger, to support the charity Wish Upon a Hero, on whose board she sits. Inspiration: Ms Shak's daughter Lindsay (left) told her mother (middle) to start a footwear line . Ms Shak’s shoes will also have identifying marks, in the hopes that her own label will become as well-known and renowned as the signature red soles of her Louboutins. She said: 'I have a signature bead buckle on a lot of my shoes that I’ve trademarked. 'On the bottom of each of my shoes... is a chubby little heart, so when you are walking, people can see the blue heart and know it’s one of my shoes.' She added: ‘I don’t have any training as such, but . I’ve always had an eye for things.

A teenager has missed birthdays, Christmases, and family holidays - because she has Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Shannon Magee can sometimes take 12 days to wake up and will gorge on sweets and chocolate without knowing what she is doing. For five years, the 17-year-old from Bolton, Greater Manchester, has suffered from Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) - a complex neurological disorder. She needs excessive amounts of rest as a result and even slept through her GCSE exams. Only 45 people in the UK have been diagnosed with the condition. Shannon, who has two brothers and three sisters, said the condition has changed her life. She said: 'It is like being awake in a coma. It takes part of your life away with it. It's like I'm in my own little world and I don't recognise people.' Shannon has episodes each month, which usually last about 12 days, during which time she can sleep for about 22 hours per day. When she is awake, her behaviour changes as she can become aggressive and demands sweets and chocolate, and needs around-the-clock care from her parents. It also affects her memory, and she says huge chunks of her teenage years are blank. Shannon said: 'I struggled through secondary school, and the teachers didn't believe what was happening to me. Shannon wants to train to become a nurse but is worried about how her condition could affect her job . 'I didn't really like to tell anyone . at school, so I drifted away from a lot of people and I failed some of . my GCSEs because I was in a sleepy episode.' After . years of tests and examinations, Shannon was finally diagnosed with KLS . after her dad, Christopher Dodd, researched her symptoms online. KLS is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence, and sometimes will begin after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day. This symptom lasts between days and weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients are fine between episodes. Shannon is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. 70% of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder. Her mother, Julie Ratcliffe, 56, . said: 'They were taking blood tests because they thought she was drunk . or on drugs, then they thought it was epilepsy. 'Even when we go to appointments and it is on her medical records, the doctors don't know what it is. 'When she is in an episode it can be very stressful and she can be very challenging. 'She has a vague expression on her face and I can get about 50 texts at work asking for things because she has forgotten she has already texted.' She added: 'We feel better knowing it is not life-threatening, but there is not enough information, nobody knows the answers.' The teenager now wants to become a nurse so she can help others but is worried her condition will get in the way.",Shannon suffers a sleeping episode around once a month .

Sky Sports has been accused of sexism again after it cut short its coverage of the FA Women's Cup final coverage - robbing viewers of a nail-biting result. The clash between Birmingham City Ladies and Chelsea Ladies was suddenly switched during extra time to the build-up between the men's League One play-off final. Viewers missed a remarkable turnaround from Birmingham, who were 2-1 down with just eight minutes of extra time left when Sky switched its coverage. Cut short: Birmingham City Ladies celebrate winning the FA Women's Cup Final after beating Chelsea Ladies FC in a penalty shootout at Ashton Gate, Bristol, on Saturday . A last minute equaliser by Birmingham made it 2-2, before a tense penalty shootout which the ladies from the Midlands won 3-2. Furious fans took to Twitter after the match to brand the decision to axe the coverage sexist. Lorraine Fell tweeted: 'Sky is SEXIST Not showing pens for women's FA cup going to play off.' And Luke Mackay tweeted the chant: 'Sky Sports...WERE SEXIST AND WE KNOW IT.' Mike Maybury, Birmingham City's secretary, told the Birmingham Mail: 'It was disappointing that Sky stopped broadcasting the game before it was finished. 'Sky had taken the contract to air it, they should have fulfilled their obligation.' He added: 'The match on Sky was a good advertisement for women’s football, which is another reason it’s so disappointing that it was not aired to the end of the game.' But Sky Sports blamed the blunder on 'exceptional scheduling issues'. A spokesman said: ‘Sky Sports covered the Women's FA Cup Final live in full but due to exceptional scheduling issues we had to cover the climax through the red button service rather than on Sky Sports 2. ‘The build up and match were shown live on the main channel. We then cut the build up to the League 1 Play-off Final so that we could show extra time in full. Controversial: Former Sky Sports presenters Andy Gray (left) and Richard Keys both left the network after sexism scandals . ‘With the match stretching to penalties the decision was made to switch to the red button. It was a difficult scheduling decision, caused by the wealth of live sport shown at the same time across five Sky Sports channels. ‘However, this did mean that we could cover the climax live. Viewers could also see extensive highlights at 6.15pm and coverage on Sky Sports News.’ The controversy is just the latest allegation to hit the broadcaster, after pundits Andy Gray and Richard Keys last year mocked assistant referee Sian Massey. The pair believed their microphones had been switched off when they were heard questioning if she knew the offside rule. Gray was axed after a video clip emerged of him asking co-presenter Charlotte Jackson to help tuck his microphone down his trousers during an advertising break. It was the third tape to emerge in three days. Keys resigned later after an off-air clip of him was posted on YouTube, in which he referred to a woman as 'it' while twice asking Jamie Redknapp if he ‘smashed it’ [slang for ‘did you have sex with her?’].",Sky Sports blames blunder on 'exceptional scheduling issues'

A boy of 14 was stabbed to death only 500 yards from a police station which was busy preparing for closure. Leroy James died in front of friends on a sunny afternoon following a playground argument. But as the teenager lay slumped against a wall in a pool of blood, officers were packing up their belongings at the station, which is being shut as part of cutbacks. If the officers had not been preparing to leave, at least some of them are likely to have been on patrol in Enfield, North London. Last night a local officer admitted that the station's closure meant officers had been 'distracted'. He said: 'It is a tragedy, but it is even more tragic that he was killed so close to a police station. 'That station was already in its transition phase for closure. 'It was working at half mast and the offices had been stripped bare. 'It is inevitable that the cuts will have an impact on our ability to police these communities. This is an example. 'Some of the police officers might have been out on the streets policing rather than busy packing if it was not being closed.' Leroy was killed on a basketball court at Ponders End Recreation Ground, in Enfield, North London, on Wednesday afternoon as children as young as nine played close by. A post-mortem found the schoolboy died from a single stab wound. Last night two boys, aged 14 and 15, were last night arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Ans as the BBC drew in record viewers for the Games, the capital shunned exercise regimes and instead indulged in the fun of the Olympics with extra snacks and alcohol in front of the T.V. leading to a whopping 18.9m stone weight gain across the UK. And Londeners were the biggest snacking offenders with an average weight gain of 5.2 lbs. Gorging: Britons snacked on treats as they watched the Olympic Games, resulting in a staggering 4.5lb average pile on . The survey highlighted that people living in the Capital . consumed nearly 700 calories more each day, as they treated themselves . to a few glasses of wine and extra snacks on top of their regular meals. This equated to 12,000 extra calories being consumed by the average Londoner during the Olympics – that’s more than 960m calories over the two-week period. Mandy Cassidy, Director of Psychology at LighterLife, who conducted the study, said: 'The Olympics are a fantastic sporting occasion for Great Britain and we typically justify over-eating and associate over indulgence with celebratory occasions. 'Mindless eating occurs often in front of the TV and emotional eating is a well know reason for over eating when not hungry.

"Couple enjoy romantic stroll in villages of Southern Italy's Amalfi Coast . Newlyweds earlier spotted at the Colosseum and Spanish Steps . By . Daily Mail Reporter .

But given that Mark Zuckerberg could comfortably hire an entire Caribbean island with staff for his honeymoon with new wife Priscilla Chan, it's all the more endearing that the two have chosen to spend it in low-key style in Italy. The couple's Italian adventure continued last night with a simple evening stroll in a picturesque village on the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy. Meandering hand-in-hand down gently lit cobbled roads, soaking up the atmosphere, the two proved that sometimes it's the simplest things - and those that come free - that provide the most pleasure. Relaxed: Mark Zuckerberg and his new bride Priscilla Chan wander through the cobbled streets of Italy's beautiful Amalfi coast . The best things in life are free: The two enjoy each other's company as they meander slowly through the narrow streets . Picturesque: The Amalfi Coast has been made a World Heritage Site thanks to its natural beauty . With their coordinated monochrome style - he in a black blazer and white shirt (the hooded top left back at the hotel), she in white lace dress and dark blazer - the two looked the epitome of Continental chic. The couple have travelled to the picturesque part of Southern Italy - a part of the country so beautiful it has been declared a World Heritage Site - from Rome, where they have spent the past few days sight-seeing. Yesterday the newlyweds were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel. A fellow tourist snapped the Facebook CEO as he wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back. The photo of Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg taking in Michelangelo's frescoes was just one many sightings across the Italian capital of the notoriously private social network founder. Roman holiday: Mark Zuckerberg and new wife Priscilla Chan look engrossed as a tour guide speaks about the Sistine Chapel on their honeymoon . Polish tourist Darek Rusajczyk posted the image to Twitter after spotting the social network billionaire and his wife, who is training to become a doctor. The couple were dressed casually, with Zuckerberg in his typical jeans and T-shirt (but missing a hoodie) while Priscilla wore bright red skinny jeans and wraparound cardigan. Zuckerberg and his wife listened intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings. That's amore: Zuckerberg places a hand on his new wife's back as they take in the art at the Vatican . Tourist trail: The couple were casually dressed in jeans and t-shirts as they listened to a priest talk about Michelangelo's art . Eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining, the two opted for a meal at a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they enjoyed a simple Italian meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce. Their bill, which was immediately posted online, revealed that the two sipped tea and water, and paid just 32 euros for their feast - a mere drop in the ocean of Zuckerberg's fortune. Within minutes of leaving the restaurant, the owner Umberto Pavoncello had confirmed the couple had paid a visit - while word also quickly spread via social networking sites. Mr Pavoncello said: 'They seemed like two lovebirds. They shared a plate of artichoke ravioli in the centre of the table. It was a very romantic scene.' Impressed: Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg hang on every word of their tour guide at the start of their Italian honeymoon . Honeymooners: Zuckerberg looks delighted with his new wife as they take in the tourist sights . The couple were also seen at the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, where they took dozens of photographs, before Zuckerberg took his new wife for dinner at Pierluigi restaurant, an institution in the Eternal City since 1938. Staff revealed the two dined out on a supper of prawns Catalan style, oysters and fish carpaccio, followed by lobster pasta and flame grilled fish washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay Gaia e Rei. Receipt: He may have billions in the bank, but the Facebook CEO shared a bargain meal with his wife . Unlike Nonna Betta, staff at Pierluigi were rather more reluctant to reveal the cost of their dinner but it was thought to be in excess of £120 - service not included - with a waiter saying: 'It was just the two of them. 'They were happy and content. They had an intimate and romantic dinner.' The couple are thought to have arrived in Rome by private jet and stayed at the luxury five star Portrait suites hotel close to the Spanish Steps which is owned by the family of fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo. Prices for the upmarket hotel starting at 800 euros a night. Zuckerberg and his new bride had a sumptuous suite overlooking the Trinita dei Monti, the church at the top of the Spanish Steps and enjoyed breakfast in their room every morning before being taken around the city in a chauffeur-driven limousine. On its website the hotel writes: 'Delight in the ‘Dolce Vita’ at the breathtaking Portrait Suites in Rome in the heart of Via Condotti, a stone throw away from the Spanish Steps.' Why the long faces? Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan look awkward as they eat during their honeymoon on Monday . Venue: Zuckerberg, 28, and Priscilla Chan, 27, were spotted having lunch a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Roma's Jewish Ghetto .

South Korean jets and U.S. attack helicopters set the skies alight today as the two nations conducted spectacular live fire drills which were the biggest since the Korean War. The 'war games' and huge explosions south of the Korean border today came amid escalating tensions between Korea's north and south countries, and included a 'provocative' gesture where a North Korean flag was used as a target. The drill at Poncheon, near the heavily-armed North Korean border, involved 2,000 troops along with jet fighters, tanks, Apache attack helicopters, A-10 'tank-killer' aircraft, missiles and multiple rocket launchers. Fire power: A South Korean K1A1 tank unloads live rounds at the Seungjin Fire Training Field during the 'war games' drills today . Explosions in the sky: The live fire exercise could be seen as provocative towards North Korea amid escalating tensions . Taking aim: An Apache helicopter flies near the North Korean flag as part of an exercise, while, right, South Korean special forces deploy by parachute . The exercises were intended to mark this week's 62nd anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950, which ended in a truce, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically at war. Military allies Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. are set begin a three-day naval exercise in the Yellow Sea this weekend, which could further raise tensions around North Korea. Todays drills, involving 2,000 troops from the U.S. and South Korea, are intended to send a clear warning against North Korea aggression by showing U.S. and South Korean combat readiness, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a statement. Firing line: A South Korean Air Force E-737 Peace-Eye aircraft flies flare shells as part of the one-day military tests .

Opening fire: The drills on the North Korean border involved jet fighters, tanks, Apache attack helicopters, A-10 'tank-killer' aircraft, missiles and multiple rocket launchers. Ready and waiting: Combat equipment is lined up at a training center in Pocheon, north of Seoul, as South Korean forces prepare for the exercises . Officials have described these as the biggest ever joint drills. They coincide with several days of joint naval exercises involving a nuclear-powered U.S. supercarrier and separate U.S., South Korean and Japanese naval rescue drills. A U.S. military spokeswoman, Jennifer Buschick, wouldn't comment on the flag, deferring to the South Korean military. Military precision: KF-16 fighers take part in a live-fire exercise which was held to mark the 62nd anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950 . Live-fire drills by the allies are fairly routine, but using the North's national flag as part of target practice is unusual - and will be seen as a provocation by Pyongyang, which has previously threatened war for what it called South Korean insults to the country's national symbols and leadership. Still, an immediate North Korean . military retaliation is unlikely. The rockets didn't hit the flag, which . an analyst said might lead to a less angry North Korean response. But . even a direct attack on the flag would probably only result in . escalated North Korean threats because Pyongyang's struggling economy . prevents it from staging any attack that could cause a war, said Koh .

South Korean defense official, who declined to be named because of . office policy, said the flag was meant to mark enemy territory during . the drills, but he wouldn't comment on Pyongyang's possible reaction to . use of the North Korean flag in the drills. North . Korea's state media have condemned the ongoing drills as a precursor to . an invasion, with the Korean Central News Agency warning that even a . small clash could lead to a 'full-scale regional nuclear war.' Tension . has been rising since a North Korean rocket launch in April that Seoul . and Washington called a cover for a test of banned long-range missile . technology. North . Korea said the launch, which happened during celebrations of the . centennial of late national founder Kim Il Sung's birth, was meant to . send a satellite into orbit; the rocket broke apart shortly after . liftoff.

Avoidable: If patients are moved around and their mattresses turned bedsores can be avoided (posed by model) Bedsores are killing almost as many hospital patients as the deadly superbug MRSA in 'completely avoidable' deaths. And treating sufferers, who develop the ulcers when they are not moved enough, is costing four per cent of the NHS budget. The sores, known as pressure ulcers, cause hundreds of deaths a year. And they take hold when bed-bound patients are not regularly turned over or given special mattresses by nurses. Most victims are elderly or long-term patients who need help to move. The worst offending hospitals have been named in a bid to end the epidemic. The statistics were drawn up by NHS standards watchdog Dr Foster after a survey of 150 hospitals. And the worst had pressure ulcer rates four times higher than the national average. Bedsores affected 412,000 NHS patients a year and the latest figures show they killed 4,708 people between 2003 and 2008 close to the MRSA death-toll. Two years ago Muriel Browning, 96, died at Suffolk's Ipswich Hospital after a hip operation. Her daughter Angela claimed she was left for hours in dirty nappies, causing a sore that infected a surgical wound and killed her. Angela said: 'Nurses couldn't be . bothered to take patients to the toilet. Its dreadful. But she was . left for hours in soiled and wet nappies. 'As a result she developed a massive sore on her torso'. Within a month of being admitted Mrs Browning was dead from an infection that got into her surgical wound. Unison's nursing union chief Gail Adams claimed Government moves to save £20billion in the NHS could make the crisis even worse. Vulnerable: Elderly people are the most likely sufferers of bedsores as they are immobile (Posed by models) She said: 'Thousands of nurses are losing their jobs and this could lead to a rise in the number of patients with bedsores.' Action Against Medical Accidents say they are completely avoidable. Chief Executive Peter Walsh said: 'It's down to poor nursing care and there should be zero tolerance of bedsores. But sadly they are accepted and it leads to a lot of misery and suffering for patients and their relatives. 'These are highly preventable. Stopping them is not rocket science. But in many hospitals they happen too easily.' The new league reveals that Cheshire's Warrington and Halton Hospitals Trust has the worst bedsores record. It is followed by the Medway Trust in . Kent, Southend University Hospital Trust in Essex, Royal Bolton . Hospital in Greater Manchester and West Herts Trust, which covers . Watford General. The final five on the list, with the lowest rate of bedsores, are Luton and . Dunstable Hospital Trust, West Suffolk Hospitals Trust, Northern Devon . Healthcare Trust, George Eliot Hospital Trust in Nuneaton, Warwicks, and . Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust. The shamed hospitals were quick to insist they were taking action. A Warrington spokesman said: The prevention and reporting of ulcers has been strengthened over the past year. And the Royal Bolton said: A great deal of work has been undertaken to make improvements. But Southend chiefs disputed the accuracy of the statistics.

Ron Bramlage, 45, his wife, Rebecca, 43, and the . couple's children - Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and 8-year-old . Roxanne - were killed as they were heading home to Junction City, Kansas from the Bahamas. Ron Bramlage, who owned Roadside Ventures LLC, was piloting the 2006 . Pilatus Pc-12/47, a single-turboprop, fixed-wing . plane, when it broke . apart and went down about 12.30pm in the Tiger Creek Preserve. Tragedy: Ron Bramlage (left), his wife, Rebecca (right) and their four children died in a plane crash in Florida . Sad: The couple's children Brandon, Boston, Beau and Roxanne also died as the family headed home to Junction City, Kansas from the Bahamas . Deputies reached the area by . helicopters, but it was clear there were no survivors, the sheriff's . office said. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, and parts . of the plane were found nearly three and a half miles away, investigators said. Word quickly spread to the family's hometown where the family was known for their charitable work and always having a house full of neighborhood kids. 'It's just a horrific loss,' Junction . City Mayor Pat Landes said, adding that the couple supported many local . projects and provided college scholarships. The family was well known . in town and at Kansas State University, where the basketball arena is . named for Ron Bramlage's grandfather. At least two dozen bouquets of flowers . lined the black wrought-iron fence surrounding the family's ranch-style . home by Thursday evening. A trampoline sat in the front lawn, and a . hammock hung between two large trees in the wooded yard. Standing in his front yard across the . street, Rick Bazan said he had been friends with Ron Bramlage since . childhood. He said his friend would often help local families . financially, such as paying for kids to go to wrestling camps if their . parents couldn't afford to send them. 'Long time': The community where the family lived said it will be difficult to deal with the loss as they were known for their charitable work and always having a house full of neighborhood kids . He said Rebecca, who was president of the local school board, 'never stopped working. She was tireless.' She would be embarrassed by the outpouring of support now at her home, where at least a half-dozen friends of the couple's children were always running around, Bazan said. 'It's going to be a long time getting over this one,' he said as he watched the family's neighbors and friends gather outside. Bella Omann, 14, who went to middle school with the two younger boys, said Beau 'was really the funniest kid I've ever met.' She had an advanced geometry class with Boston, whom she said 'loved reading books. We would always talk about our favorite books,' including the Harry Potter novels. He read so much, she said, that their teacher wouldn't allow extra material on students' desks to keep him from reading. Another neighbor, Joann Williams, recalled driving by the home and seeing the children bouncing on the trampoline. 'They were just a beautiful family. They were just so together, cohesive,' she said. Problem: Ron Bramlage was piloting the single-turboprop, fixed-wing plane (pictured) when it broke apart and went down about 12.30pm in the Tiger Creek Preserve in central Florida . The couple were graduates of Kansas State University and members of the K-State Alumni Association, President's Club, Foundation Trustees and Ahearn Fund. 'The Bramlage family holds a special place in the history of Kansas State University and K-State Athletics, and Ron and Becky have been loyal supporters and great fans of K-State. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bramlage family during this difficult time,' University President Kirk Schulz and Athletics Director John Currie said in a joint statement. Ron was the grandson of the late Fred Bramlage, a 1935 graduate of K-State and Junction City businessman. Fred Bramlage was the lead contributor to the construction of Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that opened in 1988 and is home to the K-State men's and women's basketball teams. A library in the city is named for Ron Bramlage's grandmother, Dorothy Bramlage. Unclear: The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, and parts of the plane were found miles away . Ron Walker, superintendent of the local school district, said the family was down-to-earth despite their wealth and famous name. He said Rebecca, along with heading the school board, was a board member of the local school foundation. 'I've been here about 10 years now. She and Ron, they were among the first people to greet me. I didn't even know they had any wealth at all for about five years. It was just, ""How can we help you, how can we serve?''' The 4,900-acre Tiger Creek Preserve about 50 miles southwest of Orlando contains hardwood swamps, hammocks, scrubby flatwoods, pine flatwoods, sandhill and longleaf pine/wiregrass habitat, according to its website. The crash site was only reachable by helicopters and all-terrain vehicles. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation, which the Federal Aviation Administration said would take a long time. The family had stopped for customs in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had taken off half an hour before the crash.","Businessman Ron Bramlage was piloting a single-turboprop plane with his wife and four children .

David Cameron is facing renewed pressure to hold a referendum on  Britain’s membership of the EU after Germany said it would let its people have one. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said yesterday that closer integration in Europe could only go ahead with a ‘yes’ vote from the German people. Later this week, the EU Commission will press for closer banking union at a summit in Brussels in a desperate bid to raise market confidence in Europe. The plans, which represent a step towards a European banking super-state, include an EU-wide guarantee scheme for bank deposits and a single bank regulator. In an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel, Mr Schaeuble acknowledged that a referendum would be needed to cede national sovereignty to Brussels. He said: ‘I assume that it will happen sooner than I would have thought a few months ago. ‘At the EU summit, the heads of four European institutions plan to present concrete proposals for greater integration. We will see what happens after that.’ Mr Schaeuble also called for an EU . finance minister, with powers to veto national budgets, stronger powers . for the European Parliament and an elected European Commission . president. The comments mean Mr Cameron will have . to confront fresh calls from his own party to hold a referendum on . Britain’s EU membership. Up for a fight: David Cameron has promised to battle attempts to get Britain to join the banking union . Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘This certainly increases the pressure on David Cameron to hold an in-out referendum and it is now a case of when, rather than if.’ His colleague George Eustice MP said: ‘It is very unusual for Germany to hold a referendum and this shows that they recognise the gravity of this decision.’ The summit on Thursday and Friday could be marred by attempts to force all 27 EU member states to submit to Continent-wide banking regulation. Mr Cameron has promised to fight attempts to get Britain to join the banking union, although Britain is urging the 17-nation eurozone to fully integrate its fiscal and banking policies to reassure investors in the single currency. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister dismissed as ‘nonsense’ a suggestion from German chancellor Angela Merkel that the EU should work towards a single national identity. And a spokesman for Angela Merkel suggested that a referendum could be some way off.","Finance Minister agrees integration could only go ahead with 'yes' vote .

Dr Rowan Williams, pictured reading the service of thanksgiving for the Diamond Jubilee, has expressed concern at the proposal . A law to allow same-sex weddings will destroy the institution of marriage for future generations, leaders of the Church of England warned yesterday. They claim it will lead to a constitutional crisis, arguing that human rights legislation will force churches to treat gay couples asking for a wedding in the same way they treat heterosexual couples. The Church of England’s warning comes in response to the Government’s consultation on legalising same-sex marriage, which will close this week. The proposed reforms, formally launched in March, have been described by Church officials as ‘half-baked’, ‘very shallow’, ‘superficial’ and ‘completely irrational’. They claim the change will lead to the Church separating itself from civil law and leaders say this raises the prospect of ‘disestablishment’. This would entail the cutting of ties between Church and state that have lasted for nearly 500 years, threatening a series of major consequences. These include the end of the universal right of everyone in the country to marry in their local parish church, to the removal of the Queen from her place as Supreme Governor of the Church. Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May, saying the plans ‘have not been thought through and are not legally sound’. Church leaders have written to Home Secretary Theresa May objecting to the proposals and dismissed claims by Prime Minister David Cameron that churches would not be forced to carry out gay marriages . They also dismissed as worthless reassurances from Prime Minister David Cameron that no church will be compelled to provide such ceremonies. In the letter they stated: ‘Assurances that the freedom of the churches and other religious organisations would be safeguarded are of limited value given that once the law was changed the key decisions would be for domestic and European courts.’ A gay couple have made history by becoming the first in the UK to celebrate a civil partnership in a religious building. Kieran Bohan and Warren Hartley signed the register at Liverpool’s Unitarian Church on the day of their blessing. The church received final confirmation from Liverpool council that it could register civil partnerships just a week before the couple’s big day. The legislation to allow religious buildings to host civil ceremonies was implemented in December. Mr Hartley, 36, an administrator, and Mr Bohan, 41, who runs a youth group, have been together for four and a half years. They had originally planned to go to the register office the day before the blessing. Mr Hartley said: ‘Bringing the two elements together means we are able to celebrate our love for each other and our love of God.’ The Church’s protest is based on . legal opinions saying that under European human rights law, marriage . must be equally open to everyone. Precedents . established in Strasbourg say if a country allows gay marriage, then . gay couples must have full equality in marriage law. Church leaders say . this means that Church laws which do not allow same-sex couples to marry . can no longer remain the law of the land, as they are now. Nor will . churches continue to be able to offer marriage to everyone. The constitutional implication is that the Church, whose laws have been laws of the land since Henry VIII declared himself its head in 1534, will have to cut itself away from the state. One of the bishops who prepared the Church’s protest, the Bishop of Leicester, the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, said yesterday: ‘Marriage is not the property of the Church any more than it is the property of the Government. It is about a mutually faithful physical relationship between a man and a woman. ‘If you do what the Government say they are going to do, you can no longer define marriage in that way. It becomes hollowed out, and about a relationship between two people, to be defined on a case-by-case basis.’ He said this morning that the changes would lead to the 'gradual unravelling of the Church of England which is a very high cost for the stability of society'. Ben Summerskill, of gay rights pressure group Stonewall, said: ‘There is manifestly no evidence that the recognition of long-term same-sex relationships has any impact on the institution of marriage for heterosexuals.’ Speaking on BBC Radio 4's today programme, he accused the Church of England of 'obsessing' over sex instead of focusing on other issues such as poverty. He also described the church's claims about equal marriage as a 'masterclass of melodramatic scaremongering' and pointed to new research by Stonewall that 65 per cent of people of faith in Britain say gay people should be allowed to marry. Campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘It is absurd to suggest that allowing same-sex civil marriages would lead to legal challenges that could force churches to marry gay couples. ‘Civil divorces are legal, yet there has never been a successful legal challenge to religious organisations that ban divorce. ‘The courts recognise a distinction between civil and religious institutions.’","Gay rights campaigners accuse church of 'obsessing' over sex instead of focusing on other issues .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 18:14 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:14 EST, 14 June 2012 . 'Deeply unprofessional': Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has voiced his support for the Government's new 'snoopers charter' Britain's most senior police officer was accused of playing politics  yesterday after he gave his full backing to Government plans to monitor the public’s every internet click. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe endorsed a draft law that critics claim amounts to a snoopers’ charter, saying that in some cases it could be a matter of ‘life or death’. His actions were branded ‘deeply unprofessional’ and prompted calls for official censure. Mr Hogan-Howe’s intervention in the Communications Data Bill was compared to that of former Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair, who was accused of lobbying for a Labour plan to allow terrorism suspects to be detained for up to 90 days and also backed controversial ID cards. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Just as it  was wrong for Sir Ian Blair to lobby for the flawed ID card scheme, it is deeply unprofessional for Commissioner Hogan-Howe to lobby for Big Brother surveillance. 'It politicises our police and undermines public trust. It’s also shocking that he wants more surveillance powers to “eliminate innocent people from an investigation”. ‘In this country, we’re innocent until proven guilty – not the other way round.’ Former shadow home secretary David Davis, one of the most outspoken critics of the proposed law, said: ‘He will have done his reputation no end of harm by getting involved in this process.’ He said that after Sir Ian spoke out on 90 days detention he was seen as a Government spokesman and, if not careful, the same would be said of Mr Hogan-Howe. He added: ‘The truth of the matter is this is a highly political issue and the police should stay out of it.’ Mr Hogan-Howe made the comments yesterday in an article for The Times, in which he brought the 2005 Soham murder investigation into his argument, saying police were able to disprove Ian Huntley’s alibi that he did not kill schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by looking at his phone and text records. He also appeared alongside Home Secretary Theresa May at a press conference to promote the draft Communications Data Bill. If made law, it will give ministers powers to demand that internet companies store data on every website visit, email, text message and visit to social networking sites for a minimum of 12 months. Police and security services would not have access to the content of messages, but would know who was contacted, when and by what method. Caught: Mobile phone data was crucial in securing convictions against . serial murderer Levi Bellfield, left, and Soham killer Ian Huntley, . right . The Bill is expected to face fierce criticism from Lib Dem and Tory backbenchers when it is scrutinised by Parliament. Currently, police can access information that is stored automatically by internet companies, but they say that 25 per cent of the data is not logged, leaving a loophole for determined criminals. Mrs May said that without the new powers, offenders would go free. ‘We will see people walking the streets who should be behind bars,’ she said. Loss of freedom: Police will be entitled to know the address of every email we send or receive, every website or social networking forum we visit, and the number and identity of everyone we speak to on the telephone . Sitting alongside her, Mr Hogan-Howe claimed the proposals  were no more intrusive than current laws. But . in facing repeated questions over whether he was right to intervene so . publicly, the Commissioner accepted there  was a risk of the police . becoming politicised over the issue. ‘You could say there is a risk [of . politicisation], but the thing I’m passionate about is making sure . criminals can’t get away with crime,’ he said. ‘If that’s regarded as political, it’s a sorry state of affairs.’ But Nick Pickles, director of  pressure group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘We saw under the Labour administration the perils of police officers becoming cheerleaders for Government policies which attack fundamental liberties while enhancing the powers of the police. ‘This is a self-interested power-grab and an unacceptable intervention in policing by an operational police officer. ‘I expect the Mayor of London to censure Bernard Hogan-Howe for the same kind of politicking that the Conservatives rightly criticised Ian Blair.’ The law is a reprieve of measures proposed by Labour which were defeated twice with opposition from the Lib Dems and Tories.","Met Police Commissioner slammed for his public support of the Government's Communications Data Bill .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 16:51 EST, 21 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:17 EST, 22 June 2012 . Pensioner Keith Quartermain, who has been locked in neighbourhood dispute for 20 years, has been told to sell his house or go to jail . A neighbour from hell was yesterday given the ultimatum: 'sell your house or go to jail' after a street dispute dating back almost 20 years. Keith Quartermain, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire,  had been embroiled in the row with neighbours David Quick and Catherine Fillier for at least 18 years, after an initial argument over a path to the rear of their gardens. The 67-year-old had been dragged into court several times over the past decade after repeatedly breaching a restraining order banning him from harassing the couple. Today, he was told that the only . option left for the court was to jail him, but that if he sold his house . he would, at least temporarily, avoid prison. Judge . Gordon Risius was told Quartermain's home in Abingdon was on the . market, and decided to defer his sentencing until December to give him . time to sell the house. 'It . will be in everyone's best interests if you were to move elsewhere and . were I to sentence you to prison today it would probably interfere with a . sale,' he said to Quartermain at Oxford Crown Court. 'So, with your agreement and in the . interests of your neighbours, I am going to defer sentencing you for the . next five and a half months in the hope that by the time you return to . court for sentence at the beginning of December you will have a new . address and the opportunities for contact between you and your present . neighbours will have been removed, or greatly reduced.' Rachel . Drake, prosecuting, said that the long standing dispute was first . brought to the attention of the courts in December 1994, when . Quartermain was accused of making abusive phone calls to Mrs Fillier. In 1997 he did the same to Mr Quick and in 2003 was first given the restraining order after he used a 'laughing machine' and hundreds of abusive signs to mock his neighbours. Mr Quick and Mrs Fillier were subjected to a recording of the 'mechanical laughter' when at their homes and insulting signs were displayed in his garden. 'For the past 18 years there has been a difficulty in Austin Place arising out of some kind of dispute with regard to the land at the bottom of the garden and the footpath,' said Miss Drake. 'That's where the difficulties originated from and Mr Quartermain has a number of previous convictions arising out of his attitude towards his neighbours.' The 67-year-old, pictured outside his house, has been before a judge at Oxford Crown Court numerous times for breaching a restraining order not to harass neighbours in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . Despite being told not to harass them further, Quartermain was back before a judge in 2006 and 2009 for breaching the order and given a 28 week suspended prison sentence, followed by a conditional discharge and an order to pay court costs. However, just last month he was again . found guilty of disobeying the court rules by insulting Mrs Fillier and . Mr Quick on November 3 and 5 last year. Brazen Quartermain had told the court . he that had actually been talking about the TV show Ugly Betty when his . crass words were overheard by a neighbour. However, the jury disagreed and he was . found guilty of two counts of breaching the order, although he was . acquitted of deliberately making clapping noises to irritate his fellow . residents. 'You feel strongly that you are the . victim, rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your . criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last . November.' Judge Risius . Tony McGeorge, mitigating, said that Quartermain had instructed an estate agent and wanted to sell his home. 'He has had two interested parties come and look at the house,' he said. 'He intends to move away from the area altogether, to the Christchurch area.' Mr McGeorge said that his client was also undergoing counselling sessions at his local hospital, although the court was told that he did not have a personality disorder or a mental illness. He added that Quartermain would 'welcome the opportunity' to have mediation sessions with Mrs Fillier and Mr Quick. Judge Risius told Quartermain that even if he sold his house, the threat of a custodial sentence would still hang over him, although he said he would 'take into account any developments' when sentencing on December 7. 'You feel strongly that you are the victim, rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last November,' said the judge. 'Since neither a suspended sentence nor a community requirement have had the effect on you they were intended to have, since your neighbours can not be expected to continue to tolerate you and you disregarded court orders the only appropriate sentence for you is one of immediate imprisonment.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Quick and Mrs Fillier expressed their doubts that Quartermain's behaviour would change - or that he would go through with the house sale. 'We'll see, it's a wait and see situation,' said Mr Quick. In respect of the promised house sale Mrs Filler added: 'He says that every time we get to court.'","Feud between neighbours began with dispute over garden path .

Japanese police are weighing up whether an 'asexual' man who cooked his own severed genitals and served them to five paying diners committed a crime, it has emerged. Mao Sugiyama, 22, had his penis and testicles surgically removed in March and kept them frozen for two months before cooking them at a public event in May. Diners each paid £160 for a portion which was garnished with mushrooms and parsley. Before tucking into dinner, guests sat down to listen to a piano recital. Grim: . Mao Sugiyama, 22, prepares to serve up his genitals as dinner for five . paying guests at a party he organised in Tokyo, Japan . The police probe came after the mayor of Suginami ward, the Tokyo district where the event took place, said it had involved the display of obscene objects. Mayor Ryo Tanaka said: 'Many residents of Suginami and elsewhere have expressed a sense of discomfort and feeling of apprehension over this.' A Tokyo police spokesman said she was aware of the complaint but declined to comment any further. Sugiyama, a painter who defines himself as 'asexual', has also not responded to the fact he could now be prosecuted. But he has previously confirmed the event had taken place and said it was organised to raise awareness about 'sexual minorities, x-gender, asexual people'. In tweets on May 18, the artist said steps were taken so his act met all relevant laws, including a ban on organ sales, processing of medical waste and even food sanitation requirements. Unusual party: Mao Sugiyama, 22, garnished his penis with mushrooms and parsley before serving it up to guests in Tokyo (pictured) He also said he had offered to cook his penis for a guest for £800. However, he ultimately decided to split the ‘meal’ between six guests. He wrote on Twitter: ‘I am offering my male genitals (full penis, testes, scrotum) as a meal for 100,000 yen (£800). I’m Japanese. ‘The organs were surgically removed at age 22. I was tested to be free of venereal diseases. The organs were of normal function. I was not receiving female hormone treatment. ‘First interested buyer will get them, or I will also consider selling to a group. Will prepare and cook as the buyer requests, at his chosen location. If you have questions, please contact me by DM or e-mail.’ Sugiyama said his genitals had been removed by a physician and certified free of infections. In total around 70 people attended the event in the Suginami ward of Tokyo. While five people tucked into Mao Sugiyama’s genitalia, the rest of them ate beef or crocodile. The people who ate his genitalia were a 30-year-old couple, a 22-year-old women, a 32-year-old man and Shigenobu Matsuzawa, 29, an event planner. He Tweeted before the event: ‘It’s a once in a lifetime chance, so I decided on the spur of the moment to do it.’ He posted pictures of the event on his blog, but later removed them and said his decision to take them down was due to ‘privacy considerations’. Sugiyama made guests sign a waiver so he was not responsible if they became ill after eating his genitalia. The dinner party organiser joked before the event that he would be posting his recipe online. Guests said that the genitalia were very rubbery and tasted of very little, CalorieLab.com reported. Sugiyama, who is an illustrator, has also had his nipples removed. As an asexual, his genitalia will not be replaced with artificial female ones.","Mao Sugiyama cooked own genitalia and served it up .

Inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled father had picked out is probably the best mistake Amber Galligan has ever made. A slip of the pen enabled the young mum from Newcastle to convert a £2 stake into a cool £394,487 by winning the weekly Scoop6 bet - which involved picking the winners of six televised races. Amber, 22, had placed the bet at a BetFred shop in the city on behalf of her father Thomas, 53, who suffers from arthritis. Unexpectant winners: Inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled dad Thomas Galligan had picked out meant he actually won nearly £395,000 . However, despite widespread publicity to find the winner of the huge jackpot the pair had ruled themselves out as not all of Thomas's predictions had won. BetFred boss Fred Done launched a nationwide appeal to find the mystery Scoop6 ticketholder before last weekend so they could take advantage of a free selection in Saturday's bonus race at Newmarket and potentially add a further £251,966 to their haul. But Amber only discovered the slip had won after the bonus race deadline had passed when she went into the BetFred shop in Benwell to place a fresh £2 bet for her dad. She said: 'I was at the counter when the assistant told me they'd been looking for me and I knew he wasn't joking as he was so deadly serious. 'When he first told me that the bet had won I thought it was the place part and might have been a few hundred pounds, not hundreds of thousands of pounds.

'It was weird when I heard how much it was. It hasn't sunk in really - not even now. 'I had initially written the bet out on the wrong slip for the Jackpot and the lad behind the counter put it on the Scoop6 slip for me and copied over my numbers. She said her dad had been a fantastic father who deserved a change of luck, adding: 'My dad doesn't know how he picked Dandy Boy at 33-1 in the last leg, but it must have been a slip of the pen and I also put the number 18 in the second leg in and there were only 16 in the race, so that went on the winning favourite.' Thomas who sleeps on the sofa at the family's two-bedroomed council flat said he now plans to splash out on a new house and take his children and grandchildren on a dream holiday. The former builder's labourer who hails from Leith, near Edinburgh, hadn't realised that his first horse Vocational in the 2.25 at Ayr was a non-runner and that the rules of the bet automatically transferred his selection on to the winning 7-2 favourite Angels Will Fall.

He said: 'Amber is my angel - she and all my kids and grandkids mean the world to me. 'I don't bet during the week, but do the Scoop6 when I can afford it on a Saturday. 'I knew there were 568 tickets going into the last race at Royal Ascot and only one on Dandy Boy, but I never realised I was the winner as I thought I was out in leg one.

We don't really do holidays as we have just enough to get by, so I can't remember the last time we went on one if ever.' The pair became the first substantial six figure winners not to come forward in the pool bet's 13 year history and Thomas had even shown the Scoop6 slip to a neighbour as he knew they had the final five winners on the ticket.

David Cameron's spin doctor helped his celebrity wife run an 'avoidance' scheme that may have diverted thousands away from the tax man, it was claimed today. Craig Oliver's partner, BBC news presenter Joanna Gosling, could have pocketed an extra £22,000 a year by being paid through a private company the pair set up, according to newspaper reports. It comes just days after the Prime Minister declared comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for putting millions in an offshore tax dodging scheme. But it appears one of his closest aides helped his wife to run a company for several years that may have reduced the tax she paid on her estimated £150,000-a-year earnings. Claims: The Daily Mirror has said a business set up to handle BBC presenter Joanna Gosling's pay was an 'avoidance' scheme . 'It is total hypocrisy and Craig Oliver should stay out of Downing Street until it is sorted out,' Labour MP John Mann told the Mirror last night. 'The Jimmy Carr publicity stunt has clearly come back to haunt the Prime Minister.' Mr Oliver, who is a former senior BBC executive, ran Paya Limited with Ms Gosling to handle her earnings. He was paid £2,999.97 to be secretary. Star: Top presenter Joanna Gosling, pictured on BBC Breakfast in a controversial short skirt, may have saved thousands by being paid through a company . The TV presenter hit the headlines herself recently after wearing a short skirt to work on the BBC Breakfast sofa. Classed as a 'TV and journalism' company, they were helped by accountant Nicholas Ridge, who says he helps TV producers 'make sure their tax bills are kept as low as possible'. Figures from Companies House seen by MailOnline show that around £150,000 a year was funnelled into Paya. If Ms Gosling had earned the cash via PAYE she would have paid around £52,000 a year in income tax and national insurance, according to the Mirror. But paying herself via a company would have allowed her to cut this to as little as £29,800, making a tax saving of up to £22,000 a year, the paper claims. These are based on figures to 2008, when the company changed the type of return it sent to Companies House. Last year Mr Oliver quit as Paya's secretary after details of the company emerged, not long after Mr Cameron's previous spin doctor and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson resigned over the hacking scandal. Mr Oliver was also in the news last . month after he was filmed giving BBC political correspondent Norman . Smith a dressing down over his coverage of the Leveson Inquiry. A source close to Mr Oliver told MailOnline today: ‘There was never any tax saving motive. It was a condition of employment by the BBC. Couple: No.10 spin doctor Craig Oliver, left, . was secretary of his wife Joanna Gosling's company, and it s has been claimed today this business would have allowed her to avoid up to £22,000 a year in tax . ‘Joanna does not have a staff job and . as a freelance presenter you are told to make this arrangement. Freelance presenters do not got maternity pay or pension benefits or . sick pay. ‘Claims about the benefits have been wildly exaggerated.’ The . BBC was last month under intense pressure to reveal how many of its . stars are channelling their pay through private companies. MPs . accused the corporation of paying senior figures ‘off-payroll’ – . meaning they can potentially cut their tax bills by thousands of pounds a . year. Replacement: Mr Oliver came into Downing Street after Andy Coulson, pictured with David Cameron, quit because of the hacking scandal . Row: Head of Communications Craig Oliver was inadvertently caught on camera berating a BBC correspondent, Norman Smith, outside No. 10 Downing St last month . Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed that more than 2,400 civil servants have been paid through a private company. This means they can pay the corporation tax rate of 21 per cent, rather than higher rates of income tax. But, to the fury of MPs, he said he was unable to provide similar information about public servants who work for local councils and the BBC, because they are not controlled by central government. Probe: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander is investigating how many civil servants are avoiding tax but cannot look into the BBC's affairs . The corporation has said it pays ‘up to 3,000’ actors, editors, make-up artists and other ‘craft staff’ through service companies. Of these, 36 earn more than £100,000. But it refused to reveal how many top presenters and other talent are paid this way. In the past it has been reported that household names including Newsnight presenters Jeremy Paxman, Emily Maitlis and Gavin Esler as well as BBC News stars Sophie Raworth and Fiona Bruce have set up companies to channel their earnings, because they are on freelance contracts. This allows some high profile presenters to off-set expenses against tax, therefore dramatically boosting their net income. The corporation flatly refuses to give concrete numbers of those paid in this way, saying it was ‘commercially sensitive’ and would breach data protection laws. Mr Alexander told MPs: ‘The review could not include either local government or the BBC, who are not under the direct control of central government.' Mr Oliver is away in Mexico with the PM and declined to comment but a source close to him said his wife had not made huge savings from the company. A BBC spokesman said: 'There is no fixed rule that requires presenters to be self-employed. It wil depend on her role. But if they are then the BBC requires them to do this through a service company. This is in order to ensure they are responsible for their tax affairs. It is not done to avoid tax.'","Craig Oliver was secretary of Paya Limited, a business set up to deal with his BBC presenter partner Joanna Gosling's earnings .

Blow: George Osborne's recovery plan could be called into question after the recession was found to be worse than predicted today . The double-dip recession is even worse than feared as official figures today showed a sharper economic slump than predicted. In a blow to George Osborne, gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.4% between October and December last year, compared with a previous estimate of 0.3%. The economy also contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of this year, which is an unchanged prediction, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this morning. The figures mean the current recession - defined as two or more quarters of declining growth in a row - is more severe than first thought. The downward revision will heap more pressure on the Government and fuel . criticism that the Chancellor’s austerity measures are . choking off the recovery. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'Today's figures lay bare the damage caused by the Government's austerity programme. 'The Chancellor has steered the UK back into a double-dip recession for the first time in 40 years, with falling living standards continuing to depress consumer spending. 'This is not how you secure an economic recovery. Continuing with self-defeating austerity is not only choking off recovery but also risks causing permanent long-term damage to the UK economy. 'A new plan based on investment and jobs is more vital now than ever.' Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy . is likely to remain in recession in the second quarter, shrinking 0.5% . across the whole of 2012. She said: 'Given the negative impact of June’s extra bank holiday, GDP is likely to have contracted again in the second quarter. 'Indeed, there are still numerous factors likely to constrain the recovery going forward, not least tight credit conditions.' The impact of the weak economy was underlined by household spending figures, which showed expenditure falling by 0.1% compared with a previous estimate of 0.1% growth. And in a further sign that the Chancellor’s deficit-busting plans are struggling, Government spending grew at its fastest rate in nearly seven years between January and March, the ONS said. The 1.9% surge in Government expenditure was driven by higher spending on public administration, health and defence. Meanwhile, the decline in household expenditure in the first quarter was driven by a fall in spending on financial services and social protection. The decreases were partially offset by spending on food and drink and recreation and culture. Challenges ahead: Some of the worst news came from the construction sector, which declined by 4.9 per cent in the quarter . The construction sector declined by a larger than previously estimated 4.9%, its worst performance since the first quarter of 2009. Industrial production sector output, which includes manufacturing, was also revised downwards to a fall of 0.5% from a 0.4% decline. Despite the overall decline in GDP, growth in the powerhouse service sector, which makes up 75% of the economy, was revised upwards from 0.1% to 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists and business leaders have warned that a technical recession will hit confidence and could cause businesses to rein in spending at a time when they are being encouraged to invest to stimulate growth. But the current downturn is expected to be nothing like as severe as the previous recession of 2008/09, which spanned more than a year.","UK economy shrank by 0.4% between October and December last year, compared with estimate of 0.3% .

Issue: Dr Hilary Cass said children's units, which attract higher numbers of female doctors, were a particular cause of concern . Women doctors who only work part-time are causing staffing issues that could create problems in the future, an expert has warned. Dr Hilary Cass said children's units, which attract higher numbers of female doctors, were a particular cause of concern. She said many tended to work three days a week once they had started families, which led to gaps in the rota which means the remaining doctors had to work for longer periods. She also said UK care of sick children compared poorly with the rest of Europe and many more lives could be saved. Dr Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there were currently no safety issues, but the situation could change for the worse. There are just under 5,000 paediatricians in the UK, of whom three quarters are women. Dr Cass said children's wards traditionally had higher numbers of female doctors. Surgery and A&E on the other hand tend to attract more men as they are regarded as 'macho'. She said: 'Female doctors make great paediatricians but we do have problems planning. 'A significant proportion of people will be working less than full time so our numbers are less than we need to cover rotas. 'We are certainly trying to encourage men. I'm not saying we've got too many women, but the particular balance of females to males just happens to make it harder for us to plan services and means we have a high vacancy rate. 'We end up with gaps in the rotas. The result of that is that consultants have to work very short notice overnight and work the next day. 'As a speciality we can carry that on for a while but we wouldn't really want an airline pilot working like that and don't want a paediatrician doing that. 'At the moment we have not reached the stage where it's unsafe, per se, because the majority of time we have cover. 'But if it continues – and if we haven't got better ways of running services and that affects morale and recruitment into the  speciality . . . then that will become problematic. We're holding the line on patient safety, but it's not a good long-term position.' Concerning: Dr Cass said there are just under 5,000 paediatricians in the UK, of whom three quarters are women (file pic) Dr Cass told Radio 4's Woman's Hour  that the lives of 1,500 children in Britain could be saved every year if the care matched that of other Western European countries. She warned that common conditions such as asthma, meningitis and pneumonia were not being picked up early enough by doctors. Dr Cass said: 'We've looked at mortality rates for children up to ages of 18 and we're comparing poorly not just with Sweden but most of Western Europe.' 'It's with common childhood illnesses that we should be able to pick up and treat. Things like asthma, meningitis and pneumonia that are a real test of how the health system is working.' She added: 'It's a whole system problem. It's not about paediatrics doing badly or GPs doing badly or A&E doctors, it's about how we work together across system and how well trained everyone is to recognise a child who is sick.'","Children's units are cause for concern, says leading doctor .

Deaths on Britain’s roads rose last year for the first time in nearly a decade, official figures reveal. There were a total of 1,901 reported . deaths on Britain's roads last year - a three per cent increase on 2011, . equating to 51 extra lost lives. Of most concern were rises in pedestrian deaths and in serious injuries to cyclists. (File picture) Deaths on Britain's roads rose last year for the first time in nearly a decade, official figures reveal . Transport Secretary Justine Greening blamed last year’s bad weather, while opposition politicians pointed to cuts to road safety budgets. Motoring groups said the figures should be ‘a wake-up call’ for the Government. The RAC Foundation also pointed to increasing use by drivers and pedestrians of distracting iPods and smartphones. Deaths and serious injuries reached 25,023 – up 2 per cent on 2010 and the first rise since 1994. Pedestrian deaths increased by 12 per cent, to 453 fatalities – with by far the biggest increase among children and pensioners. Serious injuries among cyclists were up 16 per cent to 3,085, and have risen by more than a quarter in just two years, the Department for Transport figures showed. Worrying trend: The RAC Foundation pointed to increasing use by drivers and pedestrians of distracting iPods and smartphones . The biggest rise was among adult cyclists, with 2,287 cases – up 21 per cent. However the number of cycling deaths dropped by four per cent to 107. Driver and car passenger deaths also rose – up 6 per cent to 883 deaths. The Department for Transport statistical bulletin said: ‘Adverse weather (heavy snowfalls) experienced in the first and last quarters of 2010 but not in 2011 are likely to be a factor in the increase in serious road casualties and fatalities recorded in 2011.’ Transport Secretary Justine Greening told the House of Commons: ‘We had some exceptional weather in that period and that was one of the reasons why there was such a change.’ Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said Britain’s roads are still among the safest in the world but was ‘disappointed’ at the figures, adding: ’Any road death or injury is a tragedy and I will continue to take urgent action to crack down on the most dangerous drivers while improving the training to make our roads safer for everyone.’ Labour’s shadow transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick believed a decision by the previous Conservative Transport Secretary Philip Hammond to scrap casualty reduction targets was to blame for the rising death toll. Serious injuries among cyclists have risen by more than a quarter in just two years . He said: ‘Since the election the Government has axed road safety grants, removed all funding for speed cameras, approved a trial of longer HGVs and is considering a blanket increase in the motorway speed limit.’ Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Committee for Transport Safety (PACTS) said pedestrian and cyclist casualty figures were particularly worrying, pointing to the rise of the ‘born again cyclist’. He said: ‘These are extremely disappointing results after two years of substantial falls in deaths and injuries. Weather: Transport Secretary Justine Greening cited the harsh winter as a factor . They are a demonstration of the concern that all of us have expressed about the lack of leadership, priority and resources given to road safety by the current Government. ‘For deaths to begin to rise at a time of recession should be a matter of concern to ministers who should see these figures as a wake-up call.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the figures were ‘sobering’ and questioned whether the use by pedestrians and drivers of distracting iPhones, iPods and smart phones to text and surf the internet was to blame. Professor Glaister said: ‘It is notable that car drivers and passengers make up less than half of those killed, with pedestrians in particular also paying a heavy price in terms of lives lost. ‘We need to know why this is. Is it due to more and more people being distracted by using mobile phones and listening to music?’ AA head of road safety Andrew Howard said: ‘It may well be that the weather in 2010 did make that year’s figures look good. But we also have to suspect that the price of fuel throughout 2011 is all that has prevented road casualties for 2011 being much, much higher than in 2010.’ He said ministers ‘must not allow complacency to set in’ adding: ‘The rise in pedestrian deaths and cycle casualties continues to be a major cause for concern’.","1,901 reported deaths on Britain's roads last year .

Jailed: Youth offending team boss Peter Nicholson, pictured, led a gang of fraudsters who claimed wages for bogus employees at Newham Borough Council in east London . A youth offending team boss honoured by the Queen with an OBE has been jailed for five and a half years after stealing almost £300,000 from one of Britain’s poorest councils to fund his lavish family holidays. Peter Nicholson OBE, 58, fronted a gang of fraudsters who created ‘ghost’ employees at Newham Borough Council in east London and pocketed the wages. Nicholson had arranged trips to Canada for himself and relatives, all at the expense of the taxpayer, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. On one occasion he and 10 others enjoyed a 10-day break to Canada worth £4,000 in February 2005. Nicholson claimed the council ‘rewarded’ him with the holiday after he was made an OBE, a title he is now likely to lose. But investigators rejected his claims as the trip was booked before the New Year’s Honours List was announced. Nicholson previously booked a nine-day break to Canada for himself and his daughter using council funds in 2002. The con took place while he was head of the Youth Offending Team at Newham Council between May 20, 2000 and August 31, 2007. Nicholson's job there was to turn around children with criminal records. On Friday he was found guilty of five counts of conspiracy to defraud after an eight-week trial. The court heard Nicholson authorised three ‘ghost’ employees to be paid by the local authority when they did not exist, in order to syphon off the cash. The payments were arranged by his finance officer, Shirin Bazrcar, 51, the manager of staffing agency Excel Employment, which received payments worth more than £65,000. Bazrcar’s firm hired David Tuck, 52, who ran Lads Construction Ltd and was paid thousands of pounds by the council for fronting bogus building projects. Nicholson was jailed for five and half years and Bazrcar was jailed for four years after being found guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud and two counts of money laundering. Victims: Newham is one of the poorest boroughs in Britain and the gang siphoned away crucial taxpayers' money . Tuck, said to have been ‘brought into’ the scam by Nicholson and to have played a lesser role, received an 18-month prison sentence after being convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and a single count of money laundering. Passing sentence, Judge Neil Sanders said Nicholson abused the ‘very . high degree of trust’ placed in him by the council by setting up the . ‘sophisticated’ scam. ‘For all of you, this was the result of greed. ‘It’s clear the effect of these convictions will go beyond each of you as individuals and impacts greatly on your families. Aide: David Tuck was part of the gang and he was also jailed on Friday for his part in the fraud . ‘But I consider that given the seriousness of the offences, an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate.’ Prosecutor Alexander Goudie said the total amount stolen from the taxpayer was £281,771.90. He added that payments for bogus employees were put into accounts held by Bazrcar’s 16-year-old son, Ali. The address given for one ‘ghost’ was registered in the name of Nushan Mostani, Bazrcar’s sister. Scott Wainwright, defending Nicholson, said he was now a ‘broken man’ and had lost everything as a result of the scam. ‘During . his tenure at the council he did some very positive work, with the . Youth Offending Team being taken from the bottom to the top of the . league. ‘The OBE will doubtlessly be removed and he will be stripped of the pension he has contributed to. ‘He acknowledges that if it were not for his actions, David Tuck would not be sitting where he is now. ‘He is aware of the effect his greed has had.’ Martin . McCarthy, for Bazrcar, told how she suffered from a ‘troubled’ mental . state after the trial, requiring her to undergo treatment. Nicholson’s . sister-in-law, Kerry Butler, 46, was found not guilty of a single count . of money laundering but will face a retrial in November in respect of a . charge of conspiracy to defraud, after the jury failed to reach a . verdict. His ex-wife, Sheila Butler, was cleared of involvement in the scheme on Judge Sanders’ direction. Nicholson, of Bexleyheath, Kent, denied misconduct in a public office and five counts of conspiracy to defraud. Judge Neil Sanders directed a not guilty verdict against Nicholson on the misconduct offence. Bazrcar, of Hook, Hampshire, was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of money laundering. David Tuck, of Bexley, Kent, was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of money laundering. His wife Lorna Tuck, 45, of the same address, was cleared of two counts of conspiracy to defraud.

The man had been admitted earlier and was being treated by doctors inside the hospital but had decided to take some fresh air outside the entrance to A&E at Walsall Manor Hospital, West Midlands, when he keeled over. As he lay on the ground passers-by were seen to take mobile phone photographs and video, some of them laughing. The main entrance of Walsall Manor Hospital where a man collapsed and died outside the A&E entrance allegedly ignored by medical staff . It is alleged that staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, initially ignored the patient's plight. The man, who is said to be middle-aged and from the local area, had arrived at the hospital suffering from chest pains. An eye-witness said: ‘The man just dropped dead outside the hospital and nobody seemed to know what to do to help him.’ ‘I was outraged when members of the public actually started filming him, and taking photos on their mobile phones as they walked by and laughed. ‘It really makes you wonder what kind of people we are producing in this country these days.

The week's winning collections are then timed to go on sale at Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and H&M after each episode airs, so fans can instantly get the looks they saw on TV. Though Fashion Star generated just under 5million viewers per episode in its first season, the concept is a profitable one for both NBC and the retailers. Both parties share in the profits from the sale of each collection, and some items proved so popular, they sold out within hours. Louise, who is fashion editor-at-large for U.S. Glamour magazine, presents MTV makeover show Plain Jane, is a regular on E! and was a guest judge on Britain's Next Top Model.

Working out of an office at the prince’s historic London home, glamorous Miss Kyriacou has even had a three-day-a-week post especially created for her - which comes with the impressive title ‘Assistant Communications Secretary, Charities and Marketing’. As such, she has gone from promoting Take That to become the joint second most senior member of staff in Charles’s press office with responsibility for promoting his 17 charities and co-ordinating their work under ‘the prince’s vision’. Her salary, which is undisclosed, is being paid for by the Duchy of Cornwall, which funds all the prince’s public work and private expenditure. A former high flyer at record companies such as Sony - as well as promoting Take That she was also Gary Barlow’s manager during his rather unsuccessful solo career - she became Head of Media and Public Affairs at Comic Relief and it was through setting up a charity climb of Kilimanjaro with several celebrities that she first got to know Miss Cole, who also took part.

More than half a million motorists face motorway chaos until Thursday because of the closure of a key section of the M4 near London which led to delays of up to an hour today, the Highways Agency said this evening. More than 100,000 motorists a day will be affected over the five days it is taking to repair cracks in a key section of overhead motorway to the West of the capital between junctions 2 and 3 in time for the Olympics. Congestion spread as far afield as the M3, A4, M40, and even A3 in Surrey as drivers heeded the Agency's warning to find 'alternative routes' into the capital. Scroll down for video . Gridlock: The Great West Road (A4) is a key diversion route but was at a virtual standstill today . Empty: This stretch of the M4 near London from the West is still completely closed for emergency maintenance . But an agency spokesman said the . widespread congestion which spilled out onto other roads was 'a price . worth paying' to prevent even worse gridlock close to the M4 itself. The motorway was initially closed . because Highways Agency staff discovered a crack in a 'highly stressed . zone' over bridge supports. But there was astonishment that the cracks . problem was first identified four months ago in March. Business leaders . including the Institute of Directors are furious. The M4 will be one of the main routes . into the capital for Olympic games VIPs who will be able to use a . specially reserved Olympic lane – the revitalised controversial M4 Bus . Lane brought back to life and adapted for the games. It goes 'live' next Monday July 16 – with critics fearing the latest chaos is an omen of things to come . A spokesman said motorists yesterday faced delays of an hour going out of London and 30 minutes going into the capital. But there was fall out onto other . major roads into the capital. But the spokesman said: 'If the M4 is . closed, other roads will be busier. 'But if the A3 and M40 being a little . busier is the price we have to pay for avoiding absolute gridliock on . the A4, then it's a price worth paying.' Cracks: White paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the Boston Manor Viaduct flyover which need fixing before the Olympics starts. The cracks were first spotted four months ago . Jam: Even an Olympic official's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters . He said 100,000 cars used the M4 each day – 50,000 in each direction. Explaining the four month delay, he . said that the Highways Agency had initially carried out 1,000 . inspections and identified 64 hairline cracks which needed attention. This involved grinding out the cracks, filling them in, and then . attaching specially made plates over the cracks. But while repairing one crack last . week, they found another crack behind it, yet had not plate made in . advance. Waiting for the plate to be made has caused the delay, they . said: 'We need to make and fir the plate If we'd known about this crack, . we could have made the plate in advance.' The spokesman added they were working . 'hell for leather' to get the work completed on time adding:'We will be . finished in time for the Olympics.

Repairs have begun on the M4 elevated section in west London after cracks were found in the bridge section .

AA president Edmund King said of the . latest M4 closure and its threat to commuters and the Olympics: 'The . closure of this essential artery into and out of London leaves a major . dent in our transport infrastructure just prior to the Olympics. 'It is a shame that these structural . problems weren't picked up earlier when problems with the Hammersmith . fly-over were discovered. 'The repairs need to be completed as soon as . possible or Heathrow visitors to the Olympics will be left at the . starting line rather than getting to the finishing line in Stratford'. Jam: Traffic filters off the M4 approaching the closed section at the weekend. While part of it has now re-opened, one section is expected to remain shut for another three days . Queue building: A section of the M4 motorway has been closed in both directions after a crack was found on an elevated section . Professor Stephen Glaister, director . of the RAC Foundation, said: 'After the queues at Heathrow, now there's . disruption on the M4. Welcome to Britain.

Ken Perenyi will reveal, in a memoir, how he managed to forge his way to riches by conning high-profile dealers and collectors . A gifted artist who used his exceptional talent to get rich by faking art work will expose all his tricks in a confession-style book. Ken Perenyi will reveal how he fooled, dealers, collectors and auctioneers into believing his paintings were rare finds by old masters in his memoirs Caveat Emptor: The Secret Life of an American Art Forger. For four decades American Perenyi,aged 63, who lived in London for 30 years, earned up to $100,000 a time by pretending his paintings were the work of well-known second rate artists, the Observer reported. He steered away from the greatest masters because they were too well documented and kept under the radar by rotating the auctioneers and visiting regional dealers, often claiming he had found the artwork in a relative’s attic or in a car boot sale. His specialties included British sporting and marine paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, painting in the style of artists such as F Herring and Thomas Buttersworth . The book, to be published next month, is expected to embarrass experts both in Britain and the US who were deceived by the cunning artist. He tells how he used fake stamps, chalk marks, old inventory labels and salt water to create rust. He even used canvas weaves form India and China which had the irregularities of cloth used by 19th century artists. Perenyi, who is self-taught, told the Observer that he had attempted to become a legitimate artist. He added: ‘But every time I needed supplies or food, I would make a fake and sell it...I started to rely on faking more and more. I eventually turned it into a full-blown career. ‘I pride myself on my forensic expertise. I started with extensive research…the correct canvas, correct stretchers…framed in good period antique frames.’ Perenyi's specialities include British sporting and marine paintings of the 18th and 19th Centuries. He concentrated on the work of well-known but second-rank artists . Perenyi told dealers he had spotted the paintings at car boot sales or that they were found in a relatives attic . He was behind the forgery of Ruby Throats with Apple Blossoms by the American 19th-century artist Martin Johnson which was hailed as a major ‘discovery’ and fetched nearly $100,000 at auction in New York. Although investigated by FBI, the case against Perenyi was dropped in 2003, subject to the statute of limitations, which leaves him free to publish his secrets. He was never told why the case was dropped, but he believes the art world would be keen to prevent the exposure of the serial forgeries. Publisher Pegasus Books said Perenyi’s confession is ‘certain to be a bombshell for the major international auction houses and galleries’. Today he owns a studio in Maderia Beach, Florida.","Talented artist turned to forgery to get rich .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 09:29 EST, 16 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 16 May 2012 . A baby girl has made waves when she was born in a water birth - weighing an astonishing 12lb 6oz. Bethany Jane Turner, who arrived in a birthing pool at North Manchester General Hospital, is Britain’s third biggest baby girl born naturally. Remarkably her mother Naomi gave birth only with gas and air. Mrs Turner, 33, and husband Gavin, 32, had no idea that their daughter would be so huge. Our big baby girl: Bethany Jane Turner surprised her parents Naomi and Gavin by weighing 4lb more than her siblings did at birth . Their other children Katie, eight, and Billy, five, weighed in at 8lb 10oz and 8lb 9oz respectively, and the couple expected Bethany to be a similar size. The average baby girl is almost half the size at 7lb 4oz. Her grandfather Peter Lowe, 54, has nicknamed her Popeye because she has rolls of fat around her arms. Naomi, an optical assistant from Bury, said: 'It wasn’t until she was born that we realised she was so big. They put her on the scales and everyone was shocked. I was struggling and I was a bit out of it towards the end of the labour but we still managed to have a natural water birth. 'It was perfectly fine and the labour was no more painful than the two other births.' Bethany was born a fortnight overdue at midnight on May 11 - after a three-and-a-half hour labour. Britain's third biggest girl: Bethany was a fortnight overdue when she was born . Naomi and Gavin, a construction site manager, were able to take her home after two days in hospital and praised staff for their care. Sam Wagner, midwife at The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust which runs the hospital, said: 'It was an absolute delight to support Naomi throughout her water birth. 'We were all surprised when baby Bethany arrived with a huge splash weighing 12lb 6oz, a first for the birth centre,' said Sam. The national record for the biggest naturally born baby girl is held by Suzie Devendale, from Swindon, who was born weighing 12lb 12oz in February. Most big babies are born by caesarean, including Britain’s biggest baby girl Niamh O’Halloran - weighing 14lbs 4oz in February. The heaviest baby ever born was in January 1979 when Anna Bates gave birth in Ohio to a boy that weighed 23lb 12ozs but he died 11 hours later. The world’s heaviest surviving baby was another boy, born weighing 22lb 8oz in Italy in 1955. In the post-war years there has been a steady upward trend in birth weight, explained in the main by improvements in our diet. Larger, healthier, more muscular babies were born as a result, pushing the current average birth weight to 7lb 8oz for boys and 7lb 4oz for girls — up 2oz and 1½oz respectively since 1970. And this rise in birth weight shows no sign of stopping. Between 1993 and 2003, the number of babies born tipping the scales at above 9lb 15oz increased by 20 per cent and experts expect statistics from the next decade — 2003 to 2013 — to have rocketed yet again. While there is no set figure for how much a newborn should weigh, The Royal College of Midwives use 8lb 13oz as its guideline for the tipping point between a healthy weight and a potentially problematic one. Alarmingly, the rate of macrosomia (the medical term for babies born over this tipping point) has soared in recent years. So why is this happening? The simplest answer is that babies are getting bigger because their mums are, too.  The latest figures show that almost half of women of child-bearing age in Britain are overweight or obese. Obese women make more insulin than other mothers-to-be, which leads to more fat, sugars and other foods being supplied to the baby. Obesity during pregnancy can be dangerous for mother and child — it increases the risk of many complications, including stillbirth. Doctors report that bigger babies are at a high risk of shoulder dystocia — where the shoulder gets stuck during the delivery. It is a potentially life-threatening condition, which can compress the umbilical cord or put pressure on the baby’s neck, leaving it dangerously starved of oxygen. In extreme cases, it is necessary for the obstetrician to break the baby’s collarbone, in order to deliver it alive, which runs a high risk of nerve damage. ‘While most people think the bigger the baby, the healthier it is, there is mounting evidence to suggest the opposite: in fact, babies carrying too much weight at birth will live with the consequences for the rest of their lives,’ says Dr Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. ‘They are more prone to diabetes and heart disease and are affected at a younger age.’ To combat such problems, earlier this year, the NHS announced a trial to put obese mothers-to-be on diabetes medication to reduce the amount of insulin in their bloodstream — thus controlling the baby’s weight gain.",Grandfather nicknames baby Popeye due to her beefy arms .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 5 August 2011 . Electricity officials in heatwave-hit Texas have warned of impending rolling blackouts from power shortages as the U.S. state struggles to cope with the relentless scorching temperatures. Texans have turned to air conditioners in huge numbers in a bid to beat one of the hottest summers on record in America's second most populous state. But bosses for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) say the soaring power demand in the face of the brutal heatwave has left the state one power plant shut-down away from rolling blackouts. Starved of water: Texas State Park police officer Thomas Bigham walks across the cracked lake bed of O.C. Fisher Lake on Wednesday as the state battles the month-long heatwave . Lifeless: The remains of an alligator are seen in Fisher Lake, San Angelo State Park, Texas on Wednesday as the much-hoped for rain from Tropical Storm Don didn't materialise . Temperatures in Texas are currently topping 100F (37.8C) and have been soaring for well over a month. Record highs have also been recorded this week in nearby states Oklahoma and Arkansas as the relentless heatwave spreads across southern America. In Forth Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas, the mercury hit 115F on Wednesday. ERCOT, which runs the power grid for most of Texas, cut power to some large industrial users after electricity demand hit three consecutive records this week alone. The grid operator now faces rolling blackouts similar to those which hit Texas during a bitter cold snap in February. In Dallas, Texas, a pensioner died from 'heat-related' causes after her air conditioning unit was stolen from her house. At risk: A map shows 'excessively dry' conditions in, among others, Texas, New Mexico, . Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana and Arkansas in southern America . Delores Grissom, 79, had the unit stolen from her front yard last month and died two days later after telling neighbours, 'I'm getting so hot'. Although the electricity firm have done their best to regulate power use and prevent shortages, experts admitted a further shut-down is a possibility. Arshad Mansoor, senior vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute, said: 'You always have to expect the unexpected can happen.'A unit can shut. The wind may not blow.' Ice storms in February crippled dozens of power plants, forcing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts for hours as electric power demand outstripped supply. The drought in San Angelo, Texas, has been so severe that this lake was left with a fraction of water left which turned red . More remains of alligator gars are left by the brutal heatwave which has dried out several lakes in Texas . Power usage in ERCOT reached its highest level ever on Wednesday at 68,294 megawatts, almost four per cent over last year's peak. The Texas grid faces at least one more day of extreme stress before temperatures cool slightly over the weekend. Temperatures in Houston, the state's biggest city, should return to near normal levels in the upper 90s over the weekend, according to AccuWeather.com. The state's biggest power generators, including units of Energy Future Holdings, NRG Energy, Calpine Corp and others, have been running flat out to cash in real-time prices that have hit the $3,000/MWh cap in recent days. But the state's reserve margins have been running razor thin. On Wednesday ERCOT came within 50 megawatts of interrupting flows to industrial customers. One megawatt powers about 200 homes in Texas during hot weather when air conditioners are running for long periods. Extreme drought: Tropical Storm Don didn't offer any respite to areas like Manor, Texas. By the time it made landfall, Don had been downgraded to a tropical depression . Preparations: A line of cars crawls over the Queen Isabella Causeway as residents of San Padre Island move inland ahead of Tropical Storm Don last week . Kent Saathoff, ERCOT's vice president of system planning and operations, said more generation supplies would help, but added that state power generators cannot be expected to prepare for every extreme in weather. He said: 'You have to determine if it is worth spending millions or billions to avoid a one in 10-year event.' With record-breaking demand came . record-breaking prices. Prices for Thursday power topped $400 per . megawatt hour, the highest in at least a decade. Friday's power prices . approached $600.

In the past 12 years, Liz Jackson has witnessed the death of her mother and the birth of her granddaughter. But she did not grieve or celebrate as she experienced life's sorrows and joys. This is because she has been unable to feel strong emotions for more than a decade due to heart drugs she had to take in order to survive. The drugs, which she had to take to stop a heart condition which caused her pulse to race at 250 beats a minute, saved Mrs Jackson’s life but left her unable to feel happiness or sadness. Liz Jackson is delighted to feel strong emotions today (left). She found . it difficult to feel joy at the birth of her granddaughter Faith in . 2005 (pictured together right) Mrs Jackson would even remain completely calm . in the face of loud noises, which startled those around her and left . them with racing hearts. For 12 years she couldn’t even have an argument. During that time Mrs Jackson was . prescribed flecainide, verapamil and verapress to control her heart . arrhythmia but all of them left her with the same life-altering side . effect. Mrs Jackson, a teacher from Willoughby, Warwickshire, said the life without highs or lows was a huge struggle. Mrs Jackson was prescribed flecainide, verapamil and verapress over the years. Flecainide belongs to the group of medicines known as antiarrhythmics. It works directly on the heart tissue and will slow the nerve impulses in the heart. Lack of feeling or emotion is a rare side-effect of the drug according to the Mayo Clinic. Verapamil is known as a calcium-channel blocker because it works by affecting the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells.The most common side-effect is constipation, however there have been reports of it causing drowsiness and sluggishness. Verapress contains verapamil and works in a similar way. It can cause fatigue and dizziness. Anyone experiencing unexpected symptoms when taking a new heart medication should consult their GP. Some side-effects are temporary and disappear as the body adjusts to the medication. She said: 'If someone jumped out on me, I wouldn’t feel frightened at all. I’d just stay calm. 'I didn’t experience the normal highs and lows of emotions for those 12 years. It was like I didn’t have my normal life and didn’t feel the race or excitement of it. 'When my mum died I grieved but I felt like I was in control far more than my family around me. I never had the huge sobbing distraught episodes I otherwise would have done. 'Then when my granddaughter Faith was born, I would feel some joy, but not the magic and deeper level of adrenaline you want to feel in those moments. 'I wouldn’t feel the elation that others would. It was bizarre. 'I had some fantastic holidays to places like New Zealand and Africa in that time too but they were spoiled a bit because I never felt of the buzz of looking forward to them.' Mrs Jackson’s condition began in 1999 when suddenly her heart began race at a dangerous rate, even when she was resting. The mother-of-one feared she could have a heart attack at any moment and was prescribed tablets to control her heartbeat. But even with a busy lifestyle, she felt her life was still held back by the devastating side effects of the drugs. Trips to visit Faith and daughter Laura, 28, where they lived in Cyprus, became a routine rather joyous family event she could look forward to. As her condition progressed, she began . to experience palpitations, breathlessness and dizziness as the drugs . suppressed her body’s adrenaline in order to bring her heart rate down . to normal. Delight: Liz with her daughter Laura and granddaughter Faith in Lapland. She can now feel normal highs and lows . It meant she felt she has missed out on key moments in her life with granddaughter Faith, six, and her Mum, Dorothy, 82, who passed away in 2005. She said: 'When I first went to . hospital they put me on adenosine which would send my body into severe . pain for a few seconds as all my organs would scream out for oxygen as . the heart tried to slow down. 'But then it was a case of persevering with tablets of the three different drugs. 'There . are more times than I can count that I had to be taken from work in an . ambulance to the hospital. It would take me three or four days to . recover. Liz said she couldn't feel deep grief after her mother Dorothy died (Dorothy is pictured with Liz's daughter Laura in 1987) 'I was a bag of nerves not knowing when these attacks would strike and they really impacted on my life, I just stopped doing things in the end.' Then in 2010, she began suffering racing heartbeats again after her body became immune to the medication. Fortunately doctors decided last October Mrs Jackson could undergo ablation surgery to resolve the problem by burning away the heart tissue and electrical pathways causing the attacks. Consultant cardiologist and heart arrhythmia expert Dr Faizel Osman operated on Mrs Jackson at Coventry’s University Hospital to complete success. He lasered the tachycardia depressions in her heart and within days she was able to feel heightened emotions. She feels she has now been given a new lease of life and can again experience the normal emotions she wants. Her family celebrated by taking Faith on a trip to see Father Christmas in Lapland last December, the first holiday Mrs Jackson says she had felt excited about in over a decade. She said: 'I am delighted to be able to enjoy seeing Faith and feeling how I should. It’s great to feel the emotion when she laughs or smiles. 'The trip to Lapland was amazing and it really gave me a buzz I hadn’t had in so long. 'Although I missed out on the feeling you get in your heart of overwhelming joy and excitement of her birth and the six years since, I intend to make up for the lost time. 'Looking back I was always so calm. People around me would be rushing around but I just felt so relaxed about everything. 'I was also very tired though, and looking back I don’t how I got up in the morning, went to school, taught all day and then came home and worked. 'Now, I feel like I’m in my 20s again. It’s a fantastic procedure, the hospital were wonderful and I hope others can benefit from it.'","'I didn’t experience the normal highs and lows,' says Liz Jackson, who 'found it difficult' to feel joy at the birth of her granddaughter .

More than 28 million shares had traded in early action on Tuesday, making it one of the most actively traded in U.S. markets. Shares were recently at $31.75, down 6.7 per cent on the day. At the low, the stock had lost 30 per cent from a high of $45 hit shortly after trading started on Friday. 'At the moment it's not living up to the hype,' said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. Drop: Many analysts predict its value will continue to fall in the wake of the much-hyped but shambolic initial public offering of 421m shares . Facebook's flotation on the Nasdaq was one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history, raising nearly $20billion for the web giant. The drop in Facebook's share price wiped more than $11billion off of the company's market capitalization, or the total value of the tradable shares of a publicly traded company. Some financial advisers, who might have been furious last week at getting left out, were counting themselves lucky by Monday that they did not get their clients involved. Falling Fast: Facebook's shares hit a low of $30.98 on Tuesday, 8.9 per cent below Monday's close, a loss of 18 per cent from their $38 IPO price . 'By pure luck I failed to talk it up with a lot of clients because I didn't think I would be able to get much,' said one Raymond James adviser, who sought, and received, only 500 shares for one client. 'I basically told people they weren't going to get any, and luckily, it proved to be a bust,' the adviser said. Future Fortune: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg married his longtime girlfriend after the Nasdaq IPO, but has lost billions since his company debuted . Facebook's revenue growth has also been slowing recently, raising flags among some who believe the company should show consistently strong revenue growth at this stage in its life. Just days before the initial public offering the company surprised investors when it disclosed that its revenue may plummet even more by users transitioning to mobile platforms, where advertising is less proven. That prompted the analyst at Morgan Stanley to surprisingly tell clients that he was cutting his revenue forecasts for the company. Thomson Reuters Starmine, meanwhile, using expected growth rates of about 10.8 percent over the next decade, values the shares at just $9.59, or less than one-third of its current price. Luck of the Draw: Some financial advisers, who might have been furious last week at getting left out, were counting themselves lucky by Monday that they did not get their clients involved . Dave Rovelli, a senior trader at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC he would be reluctant to invest in Facebook until it had a viable long-term plan for turning its unprecedented amount of user data into profit. 'There's no bottom,' he said, noting that most major financial institutions were short-selling the shares. 'So there's no reason to jump in here. You're catching a falling knife.' 'There's no bottom. You're catching a falling knife.' Senior trader, Dave Rovelli . He added that the sharp fall in Facebook's share price 'leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth', and could damage the reputation of stock markets as a whole. 'We're trying to get the retail investor back on board, and everyone who bought it is getting creamed,' Mr Rovelli said. Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who was the first expert to advise selling Facebook shares on Friday, said he thought the company's true value was around $30 a share. 'There must have been some sober second thoughts about this,' he said in the wake of Monday's mass sell-off. Mr Wieser added that there were 'real concerns about growth and advertisers' frequent lack of certainty how best to use Facebook'.","Stocks sink to $30.98, an 18 per cent drop from the $38 IPO price .

Missing: Nick Stahl, the actor who played John Connor in Terminator 3, has been reported missing by his wife . The actor who played John Connor in 2003's Terminator 3 has been reported missing by his wife. Roseann Stahl told police on Monday that her husband Nick, 32, has been unreachable for a week. Mr Stahl has had a few run-ins with the law and TMZ reports that he has a history of drug use, leading some to fear he's found himself in terrible trouble. Mrs Stahl, who is estranged from her movie star spouse, told the Los Angeles police that she last saw Mr Stahl on May 9. The couple have a young daughter together, Marlo Stahl. Sources told TMZ that the actor had been frequenting Los Angeles's Skid Row area and they're afraid he may be in over his head. Earlier this year, his wife filed court documents that claimed Mr Stahl was abusing drugs and she was afraid for their daughter's safety. She demanded that his visitation with Marlo be limited to just 8 hours a week and that all visits be supervised. She also wanted Mr Stahl to prove he wasn't abusing drugs around their child, asking that he present 'proof of a negative result for a test for drugs and alcohol within the 24 hours prior to his scheduled visitation time.' Before he took on the task of becoming John Connor in 2003's Terminator sequel, Mr Stahl appeared in The Man Without A Face with Mel Gibson, Disturbing Behavior, and The Thin Red Line, which was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Troubled: Mr Stahl, seen here as John Connor, has had a few run-ins with the law and reportedly has a history of drug use . Worried wife: Roseann Stahl, left, who is estranged from her movie star spouse, told Los Angeles police that she last saw Mr Stahl on May 9 . He also appeared in the short-lived but beloved HBO series Carnivale. Mr Stahl was arrested earlier this year on charges that he did not pay a taxi driver, after he allegedly could not cough up an $84 fare. Cursed?

According to TMZ, he spent an entire day in jail following his crime, so his $50 fine was suspended. Mr Stahl's representative declined to comment on the actor's disappearance. Mr Stahl's turn for the worse echoed the fall of Edward Furlong, who played the part of John Connor in Terminator 2. Furlong was found unconscious in 2001 of a suspected heroin overdose. Furlong began his film career with a bang in 1991 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day and won an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Role. He went on in the 1990s to star in films like American History X and Detroit Rock City. But later Mr Furlong's public battle with substance abuse resulted in a few stints in rehab and a DUI arrest, also in 2001. He was arrested for public intoxication in 2004. His wife, whom he wed in 2006 and divorced in 2009, filed a restraining order against him in 2010, alleging that he repeatedly threatened her and was suicidal. The pair has one son. A third actor who played John Connor in the television series The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Thomas Dekker, also may have also succumbed to the 'John Connor curse.' Mr Dekker was arrested for a DUI in 2009 after he allegedly hit a 17-year-old bicyclist, according to TMZ. Furlong was an overnight star after Terminator 2 was released, and won an MTV Award for his role.

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 15:59 EST, 1 November 2011 . Alter ego: Tom Adams, 14, as his drag queen alter ego Tamara . A proud mother has told how her schoolboy son has become a drag queen at the tender age of 14. Tom Adams loves dressing in drag and has performed with his dance class dressed in a sparkly dress, blonde wig and full make-up. Tom, from Hartlepool, County Durham, suffers name calling from school bullies because of his hobby, but he is determined to follow his dreams of becoming a performer. He began using his mother Sharon's red lipsticks, nail varnish and high heels at the age of two and has continued to do so ever since – as his alter ego 'Tamara'. Tom started dance classes at the age of 10 and began his drag act for regular shows and competitions last year on the recommendation of his teacher. He said: ‘I love to entertain and this feels natural. I don't want to be a woman but I like the feeling of being in drag, it's glamorous. ‘Girls have so many fun accessories and I love trying them on. It doesn't matter what the bullies say, I'm my own person and this is what I enjoy. ‘I was worried what people might think at first, but as soon as I had my false eyelashes on I loved it. ‘Getting ready felt so exciting. I love everything from the false nails to the lipstick - I feel comfortable dressing up in woman's clothes and I like transforming myself.’ Tom idolises Lady Gaga and Katy Perry and has posters of them plastered across his bedroom walls. He first took to the stage in front of proud Sharon and his father Jason, 42, in August last year, wearing full drag, including a padded bra. Mother-of-two Sharon, 41, a shop assistant, said: ‘I didn't give him the idea, it was all his. ‘He never wanted to play football or rugby. Tom loved to dance ballet, jazz and tap. He's really outgoing so we encouraged him. It was completely his decision. ‘I felt so proud, he was wearing a short blue dress, false boobs, a short blonde wig and high heels. ‘He had false nails, eyelashes and green eye shadow - the works. It didn't freak me out a bit, it was an amazing performance. Proud mother: Tom pictured with his mother Sharon before and after his transformation into a drag queen . ‘Everyone was really supportive and said how brave he was to do it. I'm so chuffed he's strong enough to be his own person.’ Tom's dance teacher helps him apply make-up but he uses YouTube videos to perfect looks himself. Even Tom's father Jason, who is currently unemployed, is proud of his son and promptly told his friends about his dressing up. The schoolboy has performed in drag four times and regularly practices his act in his bedroom at home and is preparing for his latest show next month. Tom added: ‘Of course the bullies get to me sometimes. They call me a 'girl' and 'gay'. I love how outrageous Lady Gaga is and how Katy Perry looks. On stage: Tom performs as Tamara in his dance class, wearing a blonde wig, full make-up and a dress . ‘That's how I'd like to look in drag. Some of the judges in our dance competitions even think I am a girl. I don't mind, it's nice to think I look so glam.’ Sharon, who also has a daughter Sarah, 21, added: 'I take him to Boots and Superdrug for his make-up but his clothes are specially made by the dance group. 'It's fun shopping together. I've spent about £200 on his outfits. 'He's got an interest in woman's clothes. He helps me choose my outfits - he's the first to tell me if something doesn't look right. 'Tom's talented and he's his own person. If this is what he enjoys I support him. He looks great and he's brilliant on stage. He looks just like his sister.'","'I felt so proud, he was wearing false boobs, a blonde wig and high heels', says mother .

Thousands of holidaymakers endured widespread delays this morning after Manchester Airport ran out of fuel for the first time in its history, leaving 13 flights stranded on the Tarmac. Aircraft have been battling the problem at the airport since yesterday afternoon, eventually sparking delays today which saw passengers on one flight to Tunisia having to wait an extra two-and-a-half hours. Airport officials had today rectified last night's problem, which was caused by production problems at its supplier, the Essar refinery, near Ellesmere Port on Merseyside. Problem: Manchester Airport, pictured, ran of fuel tonight leaving thousands potentially stranded . But a handful of airlines waiting to refuel to leave the airport will not be able to draw on the replenished stocks until 8.30am. The airport confirmed this morning that of the 13 flights affected, one was to Tunisia, while the others were all short haul European flights to mainland destinations in the likes of Spain, Portugal and Greece. Most flights were delayed for less that 30 minutes, but a flight to Tunisia scheduled to leave at 6am was delayed for two-and-a-half hours. An airport spokesman today insisted they were close to 'business as usual', but conceded there had been a 'very small number of delays'. The problem arose after jet fuel . supplies from Stanlow in nearby Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, were disrupted . because of quality concerns at the oil refinery. The spokesperson said: 'Most of the . flights are operating normally. There were no cancellations, no . diversions, and most of the airlines have made contingency plans for . fuel. 'There have been a small number of delays while airlines that have brought a single load of fuel wait for fuel at 8.30am. The problem arose after jet fuel supplies from Stanlow in nearby Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, were disrupted because of quality concerns at the oil refinery . 'Fuel supplies have been completely . restored, we are just waiting for the tanks to fill and then we will . release it to the hydrants. Then it will be back to business as usual.' Airlines had last night been advised to carry more fuel than usual so that they could complete the second leg of their journey from Manchester. An airport spokeswoman had said last night: 'Airline fuel supply companies operating at Manchester Airport experienced an interruption to their supply of aviation fuel from the Essar refinery. 'The refinery has confirmed that fuel supply stocks to Manchester Airport are now being replenished and will be restored by tomorrow morning.' Problem: Ellesmere Port oil refinery, near Stanlow, in the north west of England . Shortage: Experts are predicting 79 trucks of fuel are needed in the airport overnight to get it running again . The airport uses three million litres of fuel a day and a standard tanker can only carry 38,000 litres, meaning they would need 79 trucks just to provide enough for 24 hours. Bosses were made aware of a potential problem on Tuesday and were told yesterday that the supply would run out later on Wednesday. In April 2008, airport bosses warned passengers that fuel supplies were running low because of a similar problem - but the issue was rectified before it affected flights.","Over a dozen flights left stranded on Tarmac awaiting refuel this morning .

A woman whose iPhone went missing on a Disney Cruise was able to catch the alleged thief after photos he took with her phone began popping up in her ‘cloud’ – the feature that stores and syncs all personal documents. Katy McCaffrey, who went on the cruise last month, began noticing that photos started to pop up in her iCloud account. Included in those photos were pictures of her alleged iPhone thief on the cruise ship, viewing the sunset, going to parties, and drinking with other crew members. Caught red handed: A woman was able to identify her phone's alleged thief after the photos he took popped up in her Photostream . Posed: Katy McCaffrey identified the thief as 'Nelson,' part of Disney Wonder's crew . Dislike: McCaffrey posed 20 pictures that Nelson posted, showing the good time he was having with her missing phone . In an effort to reclaim her phone, Ms McCaffrey created an album on Facebook entitled ‘Stolen iPhone Adventures.’ It shows 20 pictures of a man she calls ‘Nelson’ taking advantage of her phone aboard the Disney Wonder, nymag.com’s Daily Intel blog originally reported. The disgruntled cruise-goer was able to see the pictures because of an Apple feature called Photostream, which automatically uploads all photos taken with the iPhone to their iCloud account. Nelson, it seems, was too busy having a good time to check whether or not Photostream was activated. The feature can be turned off with a simple on/off switch in the phone’s settings. Guy's night: Nelson (blue shirt, right) took snaps of himself having a boys night with some friends . Gal pal: McCaffrey identified this woman as Nelson's girlfriend, who also appears to be pregnant . Angry and happy: He posted several pictures of his assumed girlfriend in an Angry Birds T-shirt, displaying a breadth of emotions . Raise your glass: He is seen enjoying a cuppa with another crew member . Photos Nelson took document Nelson’s adventures on the cruise ship. In the first picture, he’s posing on the deck in front of a beautiful ocean sunset. Ms McCaffrey writes: ‘This is Nelson. Nelson has stolen my iPhone.’ She was able to identify him by a clearly placed name tag below the left lapel of his shirt as he was pictured with character actors. In later pictures, Nelson takes snapshots of his pregnant girlfriend, assumedly another Disney Cruise employee. Many of them show Nelson out drinking with friends (‘gosh they look a cool group of folks’) and the boat’s captain at a gathering with drinks and cake (‘sure looks like they had a swell time.’) Ms McCaffrey did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment. Letting loose: Nelson also went to what appears to be a staff birthday party, with the ship's captain (far right) in attendance, she said . Bitter: McCaffrey wrote, 'And here's a beautiful sunset Nelson had time to capture, all on my stolen iPhone' Cruise-tivities: Nelson's interests were varied, and included snapping a picture of another crew member, and one with a parrot statue . Rebecca Peddie, the Manager of Public Affairs at Disney Cruise Lines, told MailOnline that the crew member in question has been placed on administrative leave. She said: ‘We take these matters very seriously. We have a zero tolerance policy for this type of behaviour,' adding that the phone has been recovered and will be returned to its owner as soon as the Wonder returns to port. Ms Peddie said that the crew member on administrative leave is currently on-board the ship, which is currently on an Alaskan itinerary. She continued: ‘We recovered the phone and we’ve been in touch with the guest,’ adding that she and Ms McCaffrey are working out terms. A Disney spokesperson told the newspaper that they found out about the Facebook album and the alleged theft. Meanwhile, the crew member suspect is still on the Wonder, but has been restricted from entering guest areas of the ship. Daily Intel notes that there could be a large margin of error for the employee’s culpability, including whether or not Ms McCaffrey reported the device missing or if he somehow purchased the phone from another person without knowing the original source.","Woman on Disney Cruise alleges that phone was stolen .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . PUBLISHED: . 06:25 EST, 12 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 12 April 2012 . It's a system straight from the Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report. Police in downtown Los Angelese are fighting crime by predicting offences - before they have even happened. Unlike the usual method of responding to 911 calls, cops use computers which show them 'red spots' where an incident is most likely to occur. They are then deployed onto the streets in a bid to deter thugs, burglers and gangsters from going on their next crime spree. Technical: LAPD cops study an enormous computer screen showing 'red spots' where the next crime is most likely to committed . The 'predictive policing' system pulls together crime statistics and pinpoints the areas where most offences are being carried out. Police are then sent to patrol those streets . The programme has some similarities with the hit science fiction film Minority Report.  The movie is set in 2054 and a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes. However, unlike LAPD's system who use computer data, those in Minority Report employ special psychics called 'precogs'. Tom Cruise plays 'PreCrime' captain John Anderton but the system eventually predicts that he will commit a future murder and he has to take flight. Such disturbing situations are unlikely to happen with LAPD's system, which uses crime statistics - and not premonitions - to pinpoint the next likely incident. The system has been trialled in the Foothill division of downtown LA since November and could be rolled out to other areas if it is successful . The 'predictive policing' system being used in the Foothill Division of downtown LA has been developed from the same kind of mathematical calculations used to predict earthquakes and aftershocks. It analyses the times, dates, and places of recent crimes such as burglaries, break-ins, and car thefts. It also looks at the frequency of offences and predicts how many are likely to be carried out if the trend continues. If a spate of crimes have happened in one area, or a crook appears to be moving across the region, this is flagged up the software. The data is then aggregated and 'hot spots' are formed. Capt. Sean Malinowski says the system is able to put police on the streets before crimes have happened. Futuristic: Tom Cruise, left, as John Anderton in the science fiction hit Minority Report, which uses psychic 'precogs' to predict future crimes . Complex: Anderton uses his special powers to predict crime to map future offenders on a giant computer screen. The premonitions backfired when he was himself accused of a future murder . 'Sixty-five percent of our crimes are burglary, grand theft auto and burglary from a motor vehicle. And that's what these boxes represent,' he told CBS. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the main goal was to prevent crime. Since the system was introduced burglaries are down 33 per cent and violent crime is also down 21 per cent. Police Chf Beck said: 'I love catching people - it's what I live for - but what I'd rather do is live in a place and work in a place where crime didn't happen. 'Everybody thinks they do their profession as well as it can be done and so they don't need any help. If this old street cop can change the way that he thinks about these things, then I know my kids can do the same.' He added that the system helps police to use their officers more effectively. It has been tested in the Foothill Division since last November and if it is found to be successful it could be roled out across more divisions in LA.","Hollywood blockbuster starring Tom Cruise uses psychics' prediction .

A holiday seaside cottage owner has been jailed for a year after secretly filming his guests having sex. Jonathan Waugh, a self-confessed ‘porn addict,’ installed a mini camera into a bedroom alarm clock and watched the footage on a wide screen TV in his own cottage in Whitby, on the North Yorkshire coast. York Crown Court heard the 52-year-old former broadcast engineer even installed sensitive night-vision cameras to view the night time antics of holidaymakers at Easter Cottage for over a year. His ‘disgusting and depraved’ hobby . was only halted when a guest, who was a former investigator, was taken . ill to bed and spotted the alarm clock device. Prosecutor . Richard Gent said Waugh would check that it was couples who would be . using the main bedroom of the cottage before setting up the device, . which worked on a motion sensor. He was found out last year when a couple with two children booked the cottage between November 7 and 11. It was then the husband, a former investigator, was taken ill and retired to bed. Mr Gent said that the guest noticed . something unusual about the alarm clock and examined it to find a . memory card installed inside it. He . went straight to the police station with the item and when Waugh was . quizzed he made admissions that he had been 'addicted' to pornography . since his twenties. He had paid £600 for the equipment . which he bought on the internet and had used it to record couples in the . room for 13 months between October 2010 and November 2011. He . added that he had updated the equipment, which could record in the . dark, with a larger memory card and watched the resulting visual and . audio recordings for his own sexual gratification in his own bedroom in . the cottage opposite. Voyeurism: Jonathan Waugh, even installed sensitive night-vision cameras to view the night time antics of holidaymakers at Easter Cottage, in Whitby, on the North Yorkshire coast . Caught out: The bedroom where he had set up his hidden camera. Waugh was only halted when a guest, who was a former investigator, was taken ill to bed and spotted the alarm clock camera device . Easter Cottage is a 19th century three-bedroom holiday home close to Whitby marina. The double bedroom is on the second floor. Guest comments include: 'Beds are so comfy, the best I've ever slept in when on holiday. The owner has gone that extra mile to ensure this property is a joy to stay in. Well done sir.' July 2011. 'A lovely comfortable cottage, ideally placed to explore Whitby on foot. We were made very welcome by the owners on arrival.' April 2011. 'Met by owner who had left milk, tea bags, washing up liquid etc, and explained how everything worked. Bonus having towels, tea towels as we did not have to bring own.' 'The owner Jon is great he really goes the extra mile to make everything just right.'Sept 2010. 'After speaking to the owner he is in the middle of renovating it so it can only get better.' May 2010. As a result the guest and his wife were reported to have felt violated and their relationship to have suffered as a result of the 'disgusting and depraved' actions of the holiday cottage owner. Mitigating Rupert Dodswell said his client was of previous good character and had been very anxious and depressed following the discovery. He added that as a result his client had had suicidal thoughts, but had also voluntarily been seeking help and treatment for his problems. He asked the court not to send Waugh into custody so that he could continue to receive help. After jailing Waugh for 12 months, Recorder David Bradshaw also ordered that he be placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and subject for the same period to a Sexual Offences Protection Order. This will restrict Waugh’s further use of covert recording equipment and his ability to own and run a holiday let, unless the police have notification and access to check it out. Waugh, of Shelley, near Huddersfield, . West Yorks, pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism and asked for a . further six offences of fitting surveillance equipment and making . recordings in Easter Cottage to be taken into consideration.","Jonathan Waugh, 52, was found out when a guest, who was a former investigator, was taken ill to bed and spotted the hidden alarm clock device .

But a recent study has found the timeworn cliché of the tight-fisted Scotsman is wholly inaccurate and it is really the Welsh who are Britain's stingiest people. A survey of 2000 adults by mobile phone app Click A Taxi, found residents of Edinburgh and Glasgow are twice as likely to tip their cab driver than the average Briton. Told ye: The old cliche that Scottish people are tight-fisted has been proved wrong (Pictured: Gregor Fisher as loveable Glaswegian Rab C Nesbitt) Only one in ten Scots never tips, whereas that number rises to one in four in Wales and one in five England. Scots were found to be the most generous, tipping 90 per cent of the time, with an average tip of £1.02 for a £9 journey, 16 per cent higher than the national average of 88p and 78p in Wales.

A 17-year-old girl with a rare aggressive cancer was left undiagnosed for six months after doctors mistook her symptoms for 'typical teenager laziness.' A scan revealed Ashleigh Parks had a large tumour at the base of her brain and her mother Cheryl Watson, 36, was told she only had a 10 per cent chance of survival. Her condition was so serious she was christened in hospital and her mother and stepfather Damian Parks rushed through an adoption process so that Ashleigh could officially call him 'dad'. Now her family are celebrating after Ashleigh finally began responding to the treatment. She is well enough to return to school although it will be four years before she is officially in remission. Ashleigh Parks at home in Doncaster with her mother Cheryl and father Damien. Ashleigh has returned to school . Mr Parks, 28, said: 'We always said that one day I would adopt Ashleigh but her being so ill made us get the ball rolling. 'I am so proud to be her father officially, and not just because she has been so brave, but because she is a wonderful girl and any father would be proud to call her his daughter. 'I was always there for her anyway, but now whatever the future holds she knows she has a dad to turn to.' Ashleigh was just 16 when her mother first noticed she was unwell in October  2010. Cheryl said: ‘I know all teenagers like to sleep but Ashleigh was exhausted all the time. She would fall asleep straight after school. 'She used to love shopping and ice skating with her friends but she could barely keep her eyes open to finish her tea.’ Cheryl took her daughter to see their GP but was told Ashleigh was suffering from nothing more than typical teenage laziness. Ashleigh back at home after treatment: Damien shaved his hair off to make her feel better . Ashleigh, pictured at her christening service held in Royal Doncaster Infirmary. Her weight plummeted during treatment . Ashleigh said: ‘They just said I was a typical teenager and teenagers needed lots of sleep and not to worry.’ Unconvinced, they returned twice with the same concern only to be told the same thing and Ashleigh was prescribed iron tablets as they said she could be anaemic. It was only in March 2011 six months after first visiting her GP when Ashleigh fell down the stairs in a sleepy daze and her mum rushed her to hospital that doctors discovered the awful truth. An MRI scan showed a large tumour at the base of her brain and Ashleigh’s mother was told she had a very rare form of childhood cancer called ATRT. There are only a handful of cases diagnosed in the UK each year and around 30 in the U.S. Doctors explained it was one of the fastest growing tumours with the main symptom being tiredness and lethargy. ‘I was shaking when they told me she only had a ten per cent chance of survival. For months we’d been told she was just a typical teenager and then we’re told she might not pull through.’ Cheryl went to her daughter’s bedside at the Royal Doncaster Infirmary. ‘I told her how poorly she was but she already knew. I couldn’t help breaking down as I held her.’ Two days on Ashleigh was taken to theatre for surgery to remove the tumour. But surgeons had to abandon the operation because it was too close to her brain stem. Devastatingly tests showed three more tumours the size of peas dotted down her spinal cord. They were also too dangerous to remove so Ashleigh would need to start intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her condition was so serious . Ashleigh with her mother Cheryl before she became ill. Doctors thought she had anaemia . Recovering: Ashleigh at a charity event at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium with her father Damien and brother Marcus .

As her weight plummeted from seven stone to four stone and she was tube fed and Cheryl and Damian spent every day at her bedside. Damian even gave up his job as a plasterer to be with her every day. When her hair fell out devoted Damian shaved his off too to make her feel better. Damian also started fundraising and took Ashleigh our in her wheelchair to keep her spirits up. It was from her hospital bed shortly after she was baptised that Ashleigh asked Damian to adopt her. He said: ‘I was already her dad but Ashleigh wanted to make it official. ‘The next day we contacted social services and told them we needed their help quickly.’ They agreed to rush it through as quickly as possible and a few weeks on all the forms arrived. The family went through several rounds of interviews before they received a date for the court hearing earlier this year. Unfortunately Ashleigh was too sick to attend but Damian and Cheryl rushed straight to her hospital bedside once it was made official in March this year. Family matters: Ashleigh at home with her parents, half-brother Marcus and half-sister Jessica . Over the next few months Ashleigh fought hard against the cancer and her family were thrilled when doctors said recently she was finally showing signs of responding to treatment against all the odds. It will be another four years until she is in remission but Ashleigh’s just pleased her hair has started growing back. Cheryl said: ‘ She is so strong and we are so proud. She’s always been a daddy’s girl but now it’s official. ‘We want other parents to know the signs of this awful cancer because early diagnosis is crucial. ‘We were told she was just being a typical teenager when she was desperately ill with cancer.

Victory: Air steward Frank Duckworth has won his disability discrimination case against British Airways . A British Airways steward, who was banned from flying after he fell ill after eating an in-flight mushroom risotto, has won more than £8,500 in a legal battle with the airline. Frank Duckworth, 51, spent several days in hospital after he became unwell only hours after landing in the US on a flight from Heathrow. The incident in October 2010 began a chain of events which saw Mr Duckworth fear for his future at the company as he was restricted to duties on the ground. An employment tribunal today ruled that the flight attendant had been a victim of disability discrimination and awarded him compensation. Mr Duckworth already suffered from diabetes and coeliac disease - a disorder triggered by a reaction to gluten - when he boarded the routine flight from London to Las Vegas on October 4, 2010. But he claimed a mushroom risotto which he ate while looking after passengers aggravated his conditions and made him severely ill. He said the risotto was the only meal option offered to him on the long-haul flight. Mr Duckworth was admitted to hospital suffering from sickness and diahorrea and remained there for several days before being cleared to return home. When he got back to Britain, a doctor appointed by BA decided he was unfit to fly. He managed to overturn the ruling in July last year, but even then found his move to short-haul flights was hit by delays. Tribunal judge Andrew Matthews concluded today that BA staff had blocked Mr Duckworth's move to return to the air. In a written judgment, the judge said staff had not acted quickly enough to get Mr Duckworth onto short haul flights. He said BA had told Mr Duckworth there were no jobs when in fact 'hundreds' of staff had moved across from the company's long-haul Worldwide division to short-haul duties. Dispute: Frank Duckworth, 51, was banned from flying by British Airways after he became ill following a trans-Atlantic flight . The tribunal panel said BA had 'failed to acknowledge the duty at all' to avoid discrimination. 'There was, therefore, an unreasonable delay of some six months amounting to a failure to take such steps as were reasonable and discrimination.' The panel added that the delay had caused Mr Duckworth 'upset and anxiety'. The tribunal awarded Mr Duckworth £6,000 compensation 'in respect of injury to feelings' and £2,505.60 for loss of earnings he would have received in long-haul cabin crew on top of his basic wage. No costs were awarded to either party. Sickness: Mr Duckworth became ill within hours of landing in Las Vegas (pictured) Mr Duckworth was only given permission to fly again on May 13, just two weeks before his tribunal case was due to begin. In a written statement to the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, Mr Duckworth said: 'I’ve had my diabetes and coeliac issues under control for well over 12 months. 'However, due to the way I have been treated by BA I’ve been experiencing anxiety and mood swings which is bringing on real fear of what is going to happen to me with regard to my job and income. 'I’ve had sleepless nights and really felt down about my situation.' He added: 'I believe I was being pushed out and forced to leave British Airways and from a job which I’ve done well and enjoyed for over 20 years.' Doctors have never provided definitive confirmation that the mushroom risotto was the source of Mr Duckworth's illness. Once back in the UK he was sent to see British Airways appointed doctors and on January 6, Dr Richard Caddis delivered the damning verdict he was not fit to fly. His diabetic consultant, Adrian Walker, disagreed and at one stage blasted the company for 'being unfair' to him, the tribunal heard. It was only after being seen by a different medical expert, Dr Mark Popplestone, on July 21 that he was cleared to return to short haul flights, as long as he did not stay overnight for the first three months. However, the struggle continued as he was told there were no vacancies on the 3,000-strong, short haul European fleet, despite an email being sent out in October saying numerous posts had been filled in the last few months. Mr Duckworth, of Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, said he believed he would have been dismissed by the company if he had not taken legal action. He complained that he had still not been granted gluten-free meals onboard the planes. He said: 'I’ve been attempting to return to work as an air steward since October 2010, I’ve been passed fit by BA’s own doctor for flying duties since July 21, 2011, and yet I was only allowed to return to flying duties for the first time on May 13, 2012.' Cause for concern? Mr Duckworth said he was made ill by an in-flight risotto. Doctors have never provided definitive confirmation that the meal was to blame . Katja De Mel, BA’s inflight business manager, said: 'The incident in Las Vegas was not the first. 'Frank had had similar episodes previously while he was down route on other trips. 'I understand from British Airways Health Services (BAHS) that the incidents are caused by an adverse reaction of both Frank’s conditions. 'I was informed that if Frank has food that is not gluten free this causes him to have an adverse reaction on account of his coeliac disease, which in turn effects his diabetes and makes it difficult to regulate his insulin levels. 'I understand that this reaction is what caused Frank to require urgent medical attention.' Talia Barsam, representing BA, disputed claims the company had failed to make 'reasonable adjustments' to Mr Duckworth’s working life so that he could continue to do his job despite his disability. She said: 'All of the transfers going on were being looked at simultaneously and given the nature and complexity of managing a number of cabin crew suffering with disabilities, it’s not surprising it takes the time period it takes. 'That’s not a failure to make reasonable adjustments.'","Frank Duckworth, 51, was hospitalised only hours after eating mushroom risotto on a flight from London to Las Vegas .

I was not in a . position to defend myself as I was still suffering from the effects of . being hit.’ Millions of people worldwide viewed the footage of the attack in Barking, East London, on YouTube. Video evidence: Ashraf Rossli is helped to his feet, but then robbed in Barking, London . Mr Rossli was set upon by another group, which included Beau Isagba, 17, pictured, who was convicted by a court earlier this month of punching him . A Sony computer console and ten games . worth £500 were taken from Mr Rossli’s bag in just a few seconds. The . victim said he had already been set upon by other groups of youths who . surrounded him as he tried to cycle over a flyover to reach a woman . friend who had called for his help. ‘I could see some of them had wooden . sticks and the majority were wearing hoodies which were pulled up. I . felt they could be responsible for some of the disorder,’ he said. ‘I . slowed down but my friend told me to cycle through. ‘Then they closed together and blocked . my path. I couldn’t tell how many people there were. I braced myself to . be attacked. Everything happened so quickly. Some of them tugged at my . bike and shouted “Give me your bike.” I could feel people tugging at my rucksack.’ Shortly afterwards Mr Rossli was set . upon by another group, which included Beau Isagba, 17, who was convicted . by a court earlier this month of punching him. The accountancy student said the group demanded his bike and somebody was feeling in his jacket pocket for his mobile phone. He said: ‘I turned round to see who was attempting to steal my mobile phone and I felt an impact on the side of my face. ‘The force knocked me to the floor. Blood was pouring from my mouth and I could feel it running on to my . hands. I was disorientated and confused. I remember my bike being . taken.’ He was helped to safety by two women . and taken to hospital where he had surgery in which a metal plate was . inserted into his jaw. John Kafunda, 22, and Reece Donovan, . 24, are on trial at Wood Green Crown Court in North London accused of . being the two men responsible for the robbery. Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London . From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement . Lowest of the low: The teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack . Discarded: The thief, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away . When he was arrested Donovan claimed he had been at his mother’s house in Limehouse, East London. But a witness who saw the footage on . the news said he ‘knew straight away’ that Donovan was responsible from . his clothing, distinctive walk and the way he smoked. And someone else came forward to tell . police the second man was Kafunda, of Ilford, because she recognised his . face and clothing. In a police interview, Kafunda said he . was not at the scene of the attack – had he been he would have stopped . it and taken the victim to safety. Kafunda said: ‘A million per cent I . never met the geezer in my life. That’s not me. If that was me I would . have physically stopped it, but that’s not me there.’ The two defendants deny robbery, theft and violent disorder. The trial continues.

Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader accused of having sex with a . 16-year-old male student will be allowed to sue a website for defamation, a court has ruled. Sarah Jones, 26, has brought a lawsuit against the gossip website TheDirty.com after photographs and postings were uploaded in 2009 that branded her a 'slut with two STDs'. Posts claimed she had sex with a boyfriend in her classroom at Dixie Heights High School in Edgewood, Kentucky. She . said the claims cost her reputation with colleagues at the . school. Victory? Bengal cheerleader and teacher Sarah Jones has sued TheDirty.com for character defamation after it posted photos in 2009 branding her a 'slut' for allegedly sleeping with a student at her Kentucky school . Sordid: TheDirty.com posted the gossip about Jones in 2009 and was sued by the former teacher . When she emailed the site to plead they . take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with . Bengals players. Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: . 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two . STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have . to do.' Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s . founder, for character defamation. She was awarded an $11million . default judgement but the litigation is ongoing. Judge William Bertelsman at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided yesterday that the website could not appeal the decision that it was liable to Jones. TheDirty.com had hoped it would be shielded by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) because it had merely posted information written by others. Booked: Sarah Jones and her mother Cheryl, right, both pleaded not guilty to their charges and will stand trial in June . Accused: Her mother Cheryl, left, has also been accused of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case . However the website's lawyer David Gingras told Cincinnati.com that the court's decision 'is not the result I wanted to see, but it is actually a disaster for Jones'. Mr Gringas said he planned to grill Jones about the sexual allegations against her. Jones was accused . of sleeping with a 16-year-old football player  while teaching in a Kentucky school last . year. She resigned from her job teaching high school English in November citing 'personal reasons'. Her estranged husband has chosen to file for an annulment. Jones, a five-year veteran of the . Ben-Gals cheerleading squad, was indicted in Covington, Kentucky on . charges of first-degree sexual abuse last month. The indictment states the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place between October 1 and December 31. Defying expectations: Former cheerleading captain Sarah Jones (right) pictured on a night out with a friend . She pleaded not guilty to unlawful use of electronic means to . induce a minor to engage in sexual activities, a . charge often reserved for people peddling child pornography over . the Internet. Her mother Cheryl, 55, a middle . school principal who is now on administrative leave, faces a single . charge of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case. She also . pleaded not guilty in April. Computers belonging to Cheryl and . Sarah Jones, as well as those of the alleged victim's family, were . seized as part of the investigation. It is believed text messages will . also be central to the case. Sarah . Jones's bond was previously set at $50,000 while her mother's was set . at $30,000.

Love game: Darren White, 41, was discovered lying face down on his bed with a metal chain padlocked tightly around his neck . A businessman found dead in a hotel bedroom, with a chain tightly padlocked around his neck, may have suffocated when a sex game went wrong, an inquest heard. Darren White, 41, was discovered lying face down on the bed, surrounded by sex toys. The body was already decomposed as it had  laid undiscovered for several days and pathologist Dr Peter Jerreat told the inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court that it was impossible to determine a cause of death. Mr Jerreat said: ‘Potentially this could mask someone being suffocated under the influence of drugs.It is possible to have suffocated during a sexual act. ‘I’m definitely not excluding third party involvement,' he added. A violent sex film was in the DVD player . when staff found Mr White’s body, and drugs paraphernalia was also . recovered. Mr White, originally from Colchester, Essex, had recently taken over forklift truck company United Lift Trucks. He had checked in to a serviced flat on the fourth floor of Hotel Think in Long Lane, Southwark, on December 30, after a skiing trip to Switzerland. On January 3, the final day of his stay, a receptionist rang his room at around 11am after he failed to check out, the inquest heard. Even after using a master key to unlock the room, staff were unable to push the door open more than a crack and instead put mobile phones through the gap to survey the scene. They then realised Mr White, of Tenpenny Hill, Thorrington, Essex, was dead. Mr White had checked in to a serviced flat on the fourth floor of Hotel Think in Long Lane, Southwark, pictured, on December 30, after a skiing trip to Switzerland . Pc John Willmor, one of the first officers to arrive in the hotel room, said he found Mr White’s decomposing body lying face down on the bed with the chain around his neck. ‘I could tell he was deceased and had been there for a matter of days rather than hours,’ he said. ‘We looked around, and there were numerous...what I would describe as sex toys, around the room. ‘The television was on and there was a DVD playing at the time - I would describe it as some extremely violent sex acts.’ A . further ten pornographic films were found in the room, along with a . bloodstained towel, and a DVD case containing white powder believed to . be drugs.

City trader James Sanders appeared to have it all – a £9million property portfolio including a mansion in Kensington, a stable of fast cars and a multi-milllion pound business. But the 35-year-old City trader and his glamorous wife Miranda, 34, were in fact funding their luxurious lifestyle from illegal deals, thanks to secret financial information passed on by her sister and brother-in-law in America. Heading for a fall: James Sanders with his wife Miranda. The father of two pleaded guilty last week to insider dealing . Yesterday the couple swapped their . £5million Georgian mansion for a prison cell after both were jailed for . insider dealing. Sanders was sentenced to four years, while his wife got . ten months. Southwark Crown Court heard how the . pair pocketed more than £1.5million by placing bets on the stock market . based on insider tips gleaned from Miranda’s brother-in-law Arnold . McClellan, 52, a partner with financial firm Deloitte who handled major . US company takeovers. Sanders, who ran his own brokerage . firm in London earning £1million a year, gleefully boasted: ‘I’m the . golden boy coming home smelling of roses’. The address in Kensington where the Sanders are said to have lived . The father of two used his profits to . splash out on a five-storey property  worth £5million, originally . intended as an investment. He treated the Georgian mansion, just . off Kensington High Street, to a £1million makeover complete with a . £35,000 wine cellar in the basement. When he snapped up the property for . £1.1million less than the asking price, he bragged that his winning . mantra was ‘buy at the point of maximum fear’ and said: ‘Once the credit . crunch is over I’m going to be quids in.’ Sanders also used the cash to pay off . his mortgage on the couple’s £3.75million townhouse in Holland Park and . allocated himself a £100,000 ‘car fund’ to pay for his 328 GTS and 575M . Maranello Ferraris, a Maserati and Bentley. When investigators raided his home, . they found an extraordinary handwritten list in which Sanders . meticulously set out his spending of £50,000 on Rolex watches, luxury . holidays, designer clothing and fine wines. He also splurged £60,000 on a diamond . for his wife, £150,000 on improvements to the Holland Park home and . £60,000 on premium bonds, while discussed giving his father, Tim, and Miranda’s . father, Michael, £20,000 each. Yesterday the court heard how the . couple got rich thanks to tips on forthcoming acquisitions passed on by . Miranda’s millionaire older sister Annabel McClellan, 39. She  is now . serving 11 months in a US federal prison for obstructing an . investigation into the racket. The housewife, who lives in San . Francisco, had daily conversations with her sister in which she was said . to have passed on confidential information from her husband about . transactions involving five US companies. The two families were exceptionally close and enjoyed equally opulent lifestyles. Co-conspirators: James Swallow (right), a fellow director and founder of . Blue Index, was jailed for ten months. Annabel McClellan (left) was . sentenced to 11 months in a US federal prison for obstructing an . investigation into financial tips . McClellan, a mother of two, met her . husband while working in Deloitte’s London office when she was in her . early 20s. The couple married and moved to America in 1996, where she . divided her time between renovating the family’s $2.1million . (£1.3million) home in an upmarket neighbourhood, Bikram yoga and doing . charity work. But as investigators in the US and . Britain were closing in on the insider dealing, the bored housewife . began developing a sexually explicit social networking business. Called . ‘My Nookie’, it was billed as 'the app your sex life and social life . can’t be without'. Their scam was uncovered when the . Financial Services Authority in Britain launched its first-ever joint . investigation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission . (SEC), which led to Sanders’s brokerage firm, Blue Index, being shut . down and the couple’s assets seized. Investigators discovered 26million . emails and 24,000 phone conversations which were automatically recorded . at the Blue Index office. Many referred to deals based on the tips, . while in some Sanders laughed at the prospect of getting caught. List: James Sanders allocated himself a £100,000 car fund, and set aside £500,000 for 'miscellaneous' items, including watches, clothes, holidays and wine . He boasted to his father, a double . glazing salesman: ‘There’s no doubt in my mind we’re gonna absolutely . cane it over the next year or two because these tips are f***ing . brilliant.’ Peter Carter QC, prosecuting, said the . plan was for Sanders to pay half of the profits to the McClellans, but . investigators were unable to trace any money transfers. The taped telephone calls in fact . suggest that Sanders considered cheating the couple by siphoning off the . cash into a secret account. After the tips made his clients more . than £12million, Sanders planned to sell his firm for £8million, but he . was arrested in May 2009 before he could cash in. When questioned, Sanders claimed he barely knew Mr McClellan – but when they left Bishopsgate police station . his wife immediately ran to the nearest phone box to call her sister. Yesterday Andrew Radcliffe, defending . Sanders, said: ‘He has expressed himself in this way that he acted out . of greed, arrogance and a feeling at the time of invincibility. ‘He is embarrassed at the person he . was and totally ashamed of his own conduct and also that he involved and . implicated others unjustly.’ Mr Justice Simon jailed Sanders for . four years and he was disqualified from running a business for five . years after admitting ten counts of insider dealing between October 2006 . and February 2008. He told Sanders: ‘You were the driving . force behind the criminality. You knew how the system worked and you . traded jointly with your wife so as to generate large sums for the . direct financial benefit of the two of you.’ Sanders’s wife, who runs an exclusive . property business in Kensington and Chelsea, remained impassive as she . stood by him in the dock, impeccably dressed in a tailored trouser suit . and stilettos. She received a ten-month sentence for three counts of insider dealing. Both had previously pleaded guilty. James Swallow, 34, a fellow director . of Blue Index, was also jailed for ten months after admitting three . counts of insider dealing. Senior trader Christopher Hossain, 36, . and Sanders’s friend Adam Buck, 35, were cleared of any involvement in . the scandal after a trial last month. In America Annabel McClellan was . jailed in November last year after admitting obstructing justice for . lying to SEC investigators. She also paid $1million (£635,000) to . settle an SEC lawsuit which alleged that she and her relatives netted . $23million (£14.6million) from illicit trades. As part of the settlement, in which . she did not admit wrongdoing, the SEC agreed to drop its claims against . her husband, who was allowed to quietly retire from his high-powered . job. The couple now face a confiscation hearing in which the FSA  will seek to claw back all of their assets.

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 20:06 EST, 3 April 2012 . The callous wife and daughter of a man who went missing over a decade ago were yesterday jailed for life for murdering him for money – even though his body has never been found. Shirley Banfield, 64, schemed with her daughter Lynette, 40, to kill Donald Banfield and dispose of his body in an audacious plot to get their hands on £123,000 from the sale of the family home and his pension pot. The 63-year-old former BBC accountant and retired bookmaker mysteriously disappeared in 2001. Found guilty: Daughter Lynette Banfield (left) and mother Shirley (right) arriving at the Old Bailey this morning. Both have been jailed for life, and have not revealed what they did with the body of Don . He vanished just days after threatening to leave his wife to start a new life and signing a contract to sell the  family home. Yesterday his wife of 31 years was jailed for life and told she will serve a minimum term of 18 years, while her daughter was locked up for at least 16 years after a jury found them guilty of murder. Father-of-four Mr Banfield was planning to use his pension and money from the  sale of their semi-detached house in Wealdstone, North West London, to fund his retirement in his native Trinidad. But he vanished on May 11, 2001. In the days before his disappearance, he had desperately tried to warn his friends, doctor and even the police that his wife, a retired tax inspector, and his daughter were trying to kill him. He told his doctor he had woken in the middle of the night to find himself handcuffed to the bed and his legs tied as his wife attempted to suffocate him with a plastic bag. He also told friends he had been hit over the head as he slept and his daughter had tried to spray furniture polish into his eyes. Don Banfield as he looked before his death (left), and the police appeal, based off Shirley's claim he had changed his appearance and dyed his hair . On another occasion, his wife produced a knife, shouting: ‘Why don’t you die?’ Mr Banfield begged his son Kevin, 43, to let him move in with him. Two days before he disappeared Mr Banfield told police his wife and daughter were trying to kill him, but he asked them not to take any action, saying he could  not risk Mrs Banfield knowing he had contacted officers. Then, within days of his disappearance, his shameless wife and daughter began helping themselves to his £29,000 pension from his time at bookmaker William Hill and a state pension worth £34,000. Within a few weeks, they had also sold the house, netting £60,000. Neither reported him missing and it was not until May 19 that his friend Rod McIntosh went to the police. But Mrs Banfield claimed her husband was a serial womaniser who often left them. She gave officers a false description, providing a photofit that even her son didn’t recognise, and without a body, the case was dropped. The mother and daughter’s plot unravelled when Mr Banfield’s former employer William Hill became suspicious about them constantly moving house. When police carried out a routine review of the case in 2009, Mrs Banfield attempted to cover her tracks, insisting her husband had visited over Christmas 2008. Shirley and Lynette fled to this home in Canterbury to escape the attention of the police . But police arrested them in February 2010. After being bailed, the pair splashed out £27,000 on a luxury holiday to Grenada. Detectives later recovered a chilling notebook in which Miss Banfield wrote about murdering a man, killing women with a pitchfork, burying bodies and putting a body in a car. She wrote that the body had been in the car for only minutes but the smell lingered on, adding: ‘Oh, thank heavens for the scrappage scheme.’ The women’s Ford Fiesta car was compacted as part of the Government’s scheme in 2008. The mother and daughter were  charged with murder last year. Yesterday, Mrs Banfield collapsed in the dock as the jury returned guilty verdicts. The Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont, QC, told her and her daughter: ‘The three aggravating features are premeditation, commission of your offence for gain and concealment of the body.’ The pair had already admitted conspiracy to defraud, forgery and perverting the course of justice. Detectives still have no idea what happened to Mr Banfield. They dug up the garden of his former home in 2009, but nothing was found. Police plan to speak to his wife and daughter in prison to see whether they will reveal the location of his body. Metropolitan Police photos of Shirley Banfield (left) and daughter Lynette, who are now starting life sentences for the murder of Don Banfield . In an extraordinary twist, it can now be revealed that Mrs Banfield’s brother, Kenneth Hagon, worked as a grave digger. Though there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by him, police said they plan to revisit the ‘line of inquiry’ which could lead to graves Mr Hagon worked on being exhumed in the continuing hunt for the body. Mr Hagon declined to comment yesterday. His partner Audrey Harrison said she found the case ‘disturbing’. In a statement read to the court, Mr Banfield’s sister Kay Hackett said: ‘When Don went missing in May 2001, a wave of shock ran through his closest and extended family. ‘Not knowing where he was and whether he was alive was a constant ache in everyone’s hearts. ‘His mother, Irene, sadly died knowing that he was missing, longing for news of his safe return.’  Met Police Detective Chief Inspector Howard Groves said: ‘Shirley and Lynette’s actions were driven by pure greed, and the evidence to support this is overwhelming. ‘They have consistently deceived the police and other agencies in a bid to cover their tracks.’ Yesterday Donald Banfield’s first wife Lucille described Shirley Banfield as a manipulative liar. She told the Daily Mail: ‘She was always scheming and lying. It didn’t surprise me that she killed him. ‘The last thing Don told his friend Rod McIntosh was, “Do not let them get away with my murder”.’ Living in a leafy parish just outside Canterbury, Shirley and Lynette Banfield attracted little attention.Living as virtual recluses, they were only ever seen tending the garden and leaving the house to go out shopping. But behind their closed curtains on Ashford Road, Canterbury, the remorseless pair were busy spending the proceeds of their crime, splashing out on luxury Caribbean holidays and getting a thrill out of stealing clothes and jewellery. Police were astonished to find their home packed full of clothes, perfume, make-up and costume jewellery, all still with the store tags on. Officers believe they indulged in daily shoplifting sprees, even though they had no friends or boyfriends to show their  ill-gotten clothes off to. Also, significantly, not one photograph of Donald Banfield was found in the property. After killing her husband, Mrs Banfield had to apply to the High Court to get her share of their house in Wealdstone, North West London, as her husband had failed to sign vital transfer deeds. The compulsive liar persuaded the court by saying her daughter was pregnant by her boyfriend of six years, even though Miss Banfield had never been allowed by her controlling mother to have a boyfriend. Shirley (right) and Lynette Banfield, arriving at court at an earlier appearance . Mrs Banfield ploughed the proceeds into property. She capitalised on the boom by buying and selling homes in Whitby, Yorkshire, then York, before buying a four-bedroom detached home in Canterbury outright, with a further £150,000 left in the bank. Her daughter, who formerly worked for the Department for Work and Pensions, knew how to forge documents to drain her father’s pensions. The constant moves may have warded off questioning by prying neighbours, but Miss Banfield nearly gave the game away when she went to see her GP, claiming she had attempted suicide and citing a family trauma. Panicked, Mrs Banfield accompanied Miss Banfield on visits to mental health staff, falsely claiming to be her aunt and making sure her daughter said nothing. When police later questioned them on suspicion of murder in 2009,  Mrs Banfield continued to lie, saying she had seen her husband a few months earlier and insisting she had to get back home to feed her cockatiel. But beneath her cool exterior, she  was worried. When the pair were released on bail after their arrest in 2010, Mrs Banfield tried to sell their house, telling an estate agent she would accept just £250,000 for the home – worth an estimated £390,000 – if it could be sold within 36 hours. The pair then lavished £27,000 on a luxury Caribbean holiday, flying first class to Grenada where they spent their four weeks drinking cocktails, enjoying spa treatments and soaking up the sun in a five-star resort.","Shirley Banfield, 64, and daughter Lynette, 40, both jailed for life .

A devoted couple succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning after toxic fumes from a faulty fireplace filled their home. Grandparents Leslie Cox, 58, and Pamela Cox, 56, were discovered lying lifeless in each other's arms on a sofa by their sons last November. The couple, from Wickford in Essex, lit the smokeless coal fire for the first time that winter, unaware that the chimney flue had become blocked and that deadly fumes were filling their home. Devoted: Leslie Cox and Pamela Cox pictured on holiday. They were found in each other's arms . Mr Cox had attended Basildon Hospital A&E two days before he died, complaining of feeling 'dizzy, nauseous, and disorientated'. Mr Cox, a thermal insulation engineer, had complained of an inner ear condition, which was diagnosed following treatment. At the inquest into the deaths held in Chelmsford today Coroner Mrs Caroline Beasley-Murray described the incident as a 'tragic accident' and recorded a verdict of accidental death. Police investigations revealed a blocked chimney flue above a smokeless coal fire in the living room was to blame for filling the house with toxic fumes. The couple had lit the fire on Thursday evening and had left it lit for two nights before succumbing to the lethal fumes. The pair were found cuddled up in front of the television by their two sons on the Sunday morning after failing to answer concerned calls. A post-mortem revealed Mr Cox’s blood carbon dioxide haemoglobin level was at a lethal 58 per cent while his wife’s had reached 65 per cent. Mrs Beasley-Murray refused to condemn hospital staff for not spotting the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning when the couple visited just days before the fatal incident. Concluding she said: 'In the light of all the evidence I will record a verdict that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Distraught: Sons Ian Cox (left) and Neil Cox (right) holding a picture of their parents. They want more to be done to save other families from falling victim to carbon monoxide poisoning . Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. When CO enters the body, it prevents the blood from bringing oxygen to cells, tissues, and organs. Around 15 people die from CO poisoning each year in the UK - according to the Heath Safety Executive. Symptoms of  include headaches or dizziness, breathlessness, nausea, loss of consciousness and tiredness. Carbon Monoxide can be produced by any combustion appliance, including those that burn fossil fuels e.g. oil, wood and coal. If you have one of these appliances you should make sure that it is serviced and maintained by a competent person and the chimney is regularly swept. 'It is very clear the cause of death was as a result of combustion products building up in the flume. 'Leslie and Pamela died as a result of a tragic accident. 'It is very good that there are so many representatives from the press here today. 'I would like a warning to be given that any appliance which produces products of combustion must be well maintained and regularly serviced.' Sons, Ian Cox, 32, and Neil Cox, 34, attended the inquest with their partners and called on more to be done to save other families from falling victim to what they described as a ‘silent killer’. Neil, a legionella risk assessor, said: 'We don’t blame the hospital as the symptoms our parents showed are very common but it took the ambulance staff two minutes to test us. 'Surely if ambulances have that sort of test then it should be made available in hospitals. 'Everyone must be made aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning - it is truly a silent killer.' Ian, a thermal insulation engineer, added: 'You see smoke alarms in the news all the time but carbon monoxide alarms don’t seem to get enough promotion - it should be compulsory for every house to have one. 'For the sake of £25 you can save a life.' The stark warning is one which has already spread across their home town of Wickford, Essex, where carbon monoxide alarms sold out at all stores in the area within a week of residents hearing about the tragic accident. Harrowing discovery: A PCSO standing guard outside Pam and Leslie's home where they were found by their two sons . Remembering his parents, Ian said: 'They were loved by everyone and everyone loved them. 'Losing them has left a huge hole in our lives - a hole no one will ever be able to fill. 'No one should have to find their parents like we did. 'We just want to prevent anyone else going through what we have gone through.' The couple had lived happily at their £200,000 terraced property in Wickford, Essex, since marrying back in 1975. They enjoyed holidaying at their caravan in Clacton, Essex, and had been planning their retirement when they died on Sunday, November 6 last year 2011. The couple had three grandchildren - the youngest was just three weeks old when tragedy struck the family. Describing the scene the pair were confronted with when they entered the family home that Sunday morning, Neil said: 'We couldn’t get hold of mum and dad so we both came round and found them cuddled up together on the settee. 'They both looked so happy and peaceful - there were still leftover prawns from the meal they had had the night before. 'The only comfort we have found throughout this nightmare is knowing our parents didn’t suffer when they passed away.'

Soon afterwards, the women were said to have been shot or had their . throats cut for breaking local customs that prevent them from dancing . with the opposite sex. Another woman, said to have been ‘an accomplice’, was also allegedly . executed.  Last night officials in Pakistan were travelling to the . remote north-western village of Kohistan to investigate the claims. A tribal council of clerics – known as a Jirga – reportedly condemned . the women to death for ‘fornication’ and staining their families’ names. Their actions were said to have brought shame on the community, which . frowns on men and women dancing together or fraternising at all. Two men were also condemned to death for dancing with the women but they escaped and told a judge the women had already been killed . But local police say the footage does not show the men and women in the . same room together. Three teams of police have visited the area, which . is two days’ walk from the nearest road, while local government . officials have denied the claims, saying the women are alive. The two men dancing in the video, named as brothers Bin Yasir and Gul . Nazar, appeared in court yesterday charged with creating conditions for . tribal violence. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has asked for the women to be produced before . them in the capital, Islamabad, but it was told the weather was too bad . for them  to make the 100-mile journey. The chief secretary of Khyber . Pakhtunkhwa, the province where the incident is said to have happened, . argued that local laws did not allow women to travel in male company or . face questions from a male judge.

Violent: Former charity worker Scott Western (pictured) faces jail for beating his wife after becoming her 'slave master' in a bizarre sex pact . A charity director inflicted a string of violent beatings on his wife after becoming her 'slave master' in a sadomasochistic pact. Scott Western, 44, lashed Therese Western with a belt when she 'broke the rules' of their bizarre sex agreement, which they had entered into in a bid to save their 15-year marriage. He faces jail after he admitted threatening her with violence, inducing her to remove her clothes, slapping her on the face, striking her on the body with a belt, seizing her by the hair and slapping her. Western pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last week to a charge of assaulting Mrs Western, 46, on June 10 last year. Mrs Western went to police after suffering three beatings on the same day at their Wester Hailes flat near Edinburgh, leaving her needing hospital treatment. A court heard both Western and his wife had signed a copy of a contract, which contained rules for the couple’s master and slave relationship, specifying sexual acts and household chores which had to be completed by Mrs Western. She faced 'punishment' if she failed to comply. Among the 'rules' that she broke and received a beating for were failing to answer a question quickly enough, opening the passenger door of their car instead of waiting for him to do it and refusing to have sex when he wanted. Western has resigned from his position at the Wester Hailes-based Community Help and Advice Initiative, which he has been involved with since 1997. CHAI project manager David Gardner said: 'He had admitted to us he was the subject of criminal proceedings of a domestic nature. He resigned at the same time that he was pleading guilty to the offences.' 'Unusual relationship': Western pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court (above) to a charge of assaulting Mrs Western, 46, on June 10 last year . Charity staff were unaware of the precise nature of the allegations against Western. He left his position as director last year once the criminal investigation began, although he returned when he believed the case against him would be dropped and was re-elected at an AGM in September. Mr Gardner said Western had not come into contact with service users. 'It was a voluntary and hands-off role. Directors meet once a month and review reports and oversee the financial side of things. 'I had a conversation with him and he said he had been given legal advice to plead guilty. 'I think he realised he should stand down. He contributed as all directors do. Whatever happened in his personal life is a personal tragedy. It had nothing to do with his work.' Western, a community worker, has no previous convictions. In mitigation, it was said the couple had an 'unusual relationship' which could be 'categorised as alternative'. CHAI, a social welfare charity to relieve poverty, has received funding from the city council, NHS Lothian and Edinburgh Drug and Alcohol Partnership. A council spokesperson said: 'This is a matter for CHAI.' Western, who now lives in Murrayburn Grove, Edinburgh, will be sentenced next month.","Scott Western attacked Therese when she 'broke rules'

When members of the Baby Boomers generation die in the next 50 years, they will leave trillions of dollars in wealth behind, but their children should not hold their breath for a large inheritance. According to the U.S. Trust Insights on Wealth and Worth annual study released on Monday, only 55 per cent of Baby Boomers - those between the ages of 47 to 66 - think it is important to leave money for their offspring. U.S. Trust commissioned an independent, national survey of 642 high net worth adults, who were not clients, with at least $3million in investable assets. Givers: A study found that 31 per cent of wealthy Baby Boomers would prefer to leave their money to charity . One of three Baby Boomers surveyed – about 31 per cent - don’t think it is important to leave a financial inheritance and said they would rather leave money to charity than to their children. By contrast, three-quarters of wealthy people under age 46 said it's a priority to leave inheritance for their children. The top reason for not wanting to leave money for their kids is the belief shared by some Baby Boomers that each subsequent generation should work to earn its own wealth. Following closely behind is the thought that it is more important to invest in children’s success while they are growing up. ‘Our survey points to a shift in generational behavior and outlook, most likely shaped by personal experience and societal responses to economic realities,’ said Keith Banks, president of U.S. Trust. Banks added that well-off parents are concerned that the next generation is not prepared to inherit wealth, which is not surprising considering the fact that most of the Baby Boomers surveyed don't talk to their kids about money: just 37 per cent said they've fully disclosed their net worth to their children. Kept in the dark: Just 37 per cent of Baby Boomers said they've fully disclosed their net worth to their kids . Those over age 67 said they weren't having this discussion because they were raised to avoid money talk, while younger respondents said they didn't want to inhibit their kids' work ethic. Unlike the majority of people from her generation, 63-year-old Kathleen Taylor, of Chimacum, Washington, taught her two grown children since they were young to be responsible for their own money. That is why she plans to leave most of her money to her children and some money to charitable causes, ABC News reported. One way Taylor and her husband taught their children about responsible spending was providing the value of college tuition, room and board to each of them and putting them in charge of paying the bills. ‘People thought we were crazy,’ she told ABC. The Taylors plan to start a college fund once their children start having their own kids. And they intend to add to it on their grandchildren’s birthdays as long as Taylor and her husband are alive. Mrs Taylor said she hopes her own children will do the same for their great-grandchildren. The U.S. Trust study also has found that 42 per cent of Baby Boomers and 54 per cent of those under age 46 are paying medical costs for their parents or other relatives.","Baby Boomers defined as people between the ages of 47 and 66 .

Health experts in New York want to widen the proposed ban on super-sized soda to include juices, milk shakes and even popcorn, it emerged today. Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to outlaw sugary drinks over 16 ounces (1 pint) in the city's restaurants, delis, food trucks, movie theatres and sporting arenas. Now officials charged with deciding on whether it should come into force have suggested they would be in favour of incorporating other unhealthy snacks. Crunchtime: Health bosses in New York want to include popcorn and other unhealthy snacks in the proposed ban on super-size sodas (file picture) Ban: The government wants to outlaw super-sized soft drinks, pictured, and almost half of New Yorkers are behind the policy . At a meeting in Long Island City, . Queens, yesterday, Dr Bruce Vladeck, a member of the city's Board of . Health, said: 'Popcorn isn't a whole lot better from the nutritional . point of view than soda is, and may have even more calories.' Seconding the concerns, Dr Joel Forman . said some juice and milk-containing beverages have 'monstrous amounts . of calories in them', it was reported in the New York Daily News. 'I'm not so sure what the rationale is not to include those,' he added. Earlier at the meeting, it was . revealed that the city's obesity crisis causes 5,800 deaths a year and . costs taxpayers $4billion annually. Vladeck and the 11 other members of . the board voted to approve holding a public hearing on the ban next . month to take place on July 24. What's allowed: The ban won't apply to 8oz cans, 12oz bottles, 16oz bottles, but will apply to 20oz bottles in restaurants, sports stadiums and movie theaters . Sweet: If Bloomberg has his way, any soft drink over 16 ounces will be banned by March 2013 . A final vote on the big soda ban is expected in September, with law taking effect in march 2013 if approved. In a recent poll, New Yorkers were . split on Mayor Bloomberg's controversial ban, with just under half of . Big Apple residents agreeing it'll help people shed weight and the rest . saying it won't make a difference. Just over half said the ban was an example of the government going too far, while 42 per cent said they thought it would be good health policy. Of the 500 adults surveyed for the . NY1-Marist poll, 45 per cent said they thought the ban would help people . lose weight, while 52 per cent said it wouldn't have any impact. More than half the people surveyed said they never order a sugary drink large enough to be banned. Mixed: In the poll, 45 per cent of people said they think they ban would help people lose weight, while 52 per cent disagreed . The . pollsters contacted people at random on cell phones and land lines on . Sunday to get the results, which have a margin of error either way of . 4.5 percentage points. The proposal would make New York the first American city to directly limit portion sizes in an effort to tackle obesity. Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Bloomberg, was pleased that nearly half of the city's residents were behind the ban. 'We . didn't propose it because we thought it would be popular, but it should . come as no surprise that the numbers are so close since New Yorkers . always have had an openness to bold ideas when taking on intractable . problems,' he said in a statement. Nanny: Mr Bloomberg, pictured, has been criticised for banning bad foods . Expansion: Mayor Bloomberg claims sugary drinks are behind the city's high rates of obesity . Under the proposal, regular soda and . sports drinks would be affected, while diet sodas wouldn't and any drink . that's more than half milk or more than 70 per cent juice would be . exempt. Grocery stores and many convenience stores are regulated by the state and wouldn't be impacted. The . controversial ban has been denounced by the soft-drink industry and . critics who accuse the mayor of trying to institute a 'nanny state' rather than allowing individuals to make their own choices. Restaurants that don't fall in line with the ban will be slapped with a $200 fine. According to the New York City Health Department, 34 per cent of adult New yorkers are overweight and 22 per cent are obese. Obesity also kills thousands of New Yorkers every year and costs $4 billion in health care.","Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to outlaw sugary drinks over 16 ounces .

Fears Spain's government may need a massive bailout on top the €100billion handed to its financial sector were heightened today as the cost of public borrowing soared to almost crisis levels. The interest rate on Spanish 10-year . bonds rose to 6.6 per cent - near to the 7 per cent level that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to request the rescue of their . public finances. Adding extra pressure on Spain was Fitch's decision to downgrade the debt rating of 18 domestic banks due to their exposure to Spanish government debt. Last night the £80billion bailout for Spanish banks was branded a 'sticking plaster' and the euro tumbled . Now, following the European rescue of . Spain's banks, there are fears that its financial sector may still fail . and its own government will have to step in and pump in more cash. This could prompt an EU bailout of . the entire nation, especially interest rates reach the critical 7 per . cent point that would make it difficult for Spain to raise enough cash . on international money markets. Yet, despite scepticism over Europe's move to rescue the Spanish banking sector, markets across the globe made tentative gains today. Wall . Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 0.3 per cent, the . FTSE-100 pared earlier gains to stand 0.2 per cent down, as did the Dax . and CAC 40 in Frankfurt and Paris. Plans . for a potential €100 billion bailout for Spain's banks were initially . warmly received before euphoria faded and the gravity of the eurozone . crisis set in. Warning: Austrian finance minister Maria Fekter (left) has said Italy, led by Mario Monti (right), may soon have to be financially saved by the eurozone . It has seen borrowing costs in Spain and Italy continuing their recent ascent. The bank rescue package in Spain was . announced on Saturday but is already being seen as little more than a . sticking plaster for the eurozone's troubles. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, analyst at . Charles Stanley, said: 'Despite the increasingly pressing need to . resolve the growing Spanish banking crisis, a very real possibility . exists that a workable solution may not be forthcoming, leaving Spanish . banks to fail with significant adverse implications.' Banks were under pressure with Barclays off 2.8p to 187.8p and Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 2p at 219.4p. Lloyds Banking Group, however, was up . 0.2p at 28.7p, but this was only after the sale of its remittance . business in Japan to Shinsei Bank. Stock markets across Europe rose this morning but in Asia there were drops following Wall Street losses . The fears that the banks bailout is . already failing came as Austria's finance minister today said Italy, . the eurozone's third largest economy, may also imminently need a . financial rescue because of its high borrowing costs. Maria . Fekter's comments, which rose the stakes in Europe's debt crisis even . further, amplified investors' fears that Europe's leaders are far from . ending almost three years of turmoil. She said: 'Italy has to work its way . out of its economic dilemma of very high deficits and debt, but of . course it may be that - given high rates Italy pays to refinance markets . - they too will need support.' The market reaction suggests that . ministers have failed to break the so-called doom loop between rising . government debt, economic recession and teetering banks that previously . drove Greece, Ireland and Portugal into EU/IMF bailouts. Analysts cited uncertainty about the . mechanics of the Spanish rescue package and fears that private . bondholders could be subordinated to official lenders, risking losses in . any debt restructuring, as they suffered in Greece. 'Is this the next stage of a slippery slope in subordinating existing government bondholders?' asked Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a note to clients. Investors are also worrying about the outcome of a Greek general election next Sunday which may determine whether the country stays in the eurozone. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer and French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici also all called today for swift moves to create a eurozone banking union. Barroso told the Financial Times that a cross-border banking supervisor, a deposit guarantee scheme and a bank resolution fund could be put in place in 2013 without changing EU treaties. EU paymaster Germany has so far rejected a deposit guarantee or a resolution fund, saying they would require treaty change. Britain, which is home to the eurozone's biggest financial centre but is not in the single currency and opposes closer EU integration, should be allowed to opt out of such a union if it agreed not to block it, he said. Fekter's typically outspoken comments came after Italy's industry minister dismissed the idea that Rome may need external help, saying reforms adopted by his government so far had put the Italian economy on a sound footing. Her concerns are shared by one of the German government's council of economic advisers, Lars Feld, who said that Italy could be next in line. 'Overcoming the troubles in Spain will bring calm to the markets for a while, but the chances are not so small that Italy may also come under fire, in particular as the promised labour market reform has turned out to be less ambitious,' Feld said. The Austrian minister has a track record of speaking out of turn or undiplomatically. She angered EU paymaster Germany last month by suggesting Greece might be forced out of the European Union over its economic problems. She infuriated Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker in March by rushing out to brief the media on a deal to increase the eurozone's financial firewall before he could make the official announcement, forcing her to apologise. And when U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was invited to a eurozone finance ministers' meeting in Poland last year to plead for a more robust rescue fund, Fekter said bluntly that Washington should look after its own worse fiscal mess first. In Brussels, EU officials privately voiced exasperation at her latest comments on Italy. A eurozone official said: 'The problem is that this is market sensitive. It's one thing if journalists write this but quite another if a eurozone minister says it. Verbal discipline is very important but she doesn't seem to get that.' Italy's leading economic newspaper, Il Sole 24, appealed to Germany today to act to save the single currency before it is too late. 'Schnell Frau Merkel! (Hurry Up Mrs Merkel!),' the usually sober business daily said in a banner headline in German. An editorial urged Chancellor Angela Merkel 'to make three choices quickly to save the euro and build a politically united Europe'. She should back guarantees for European bank deposits, allow direct access for banks to euro zone rescue funds and accept a mutualisation of European public debts, with each country paying a different interest rates. Italy has the eurozone's second highest debt-to-GDP ratio after Greece. Merkel has opposed issuing joint euro zone bonds and says euro zone member states must agree to transfer more budget sovereignty to European institutions, including the EU's Court of Justice, as part of a political union before she would consider such idea.","Interest rates on Spanish bonds have risen to 6.6% - close to 7% level that forced Greek, Irish and Portuguese governments to seek bailouts .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:25 EST, 24 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:03 EST, 24 June 2012 . Speaking out: Sarah Richardson has said that her 'evil' mother deserves to spend the rest of life in prison for the murder of two of her children . The eldest daughter of child killer Lianne Smith has said her 'evil' mother deserves to spend the rest of her life behind bars. A Spanish court this week found the 45-year-old guilty murdering of her children, 11-month-old Daniel and Rebecca, five, days after her partner was arrested on suspicion of raping Sarah Richardson as a child. Now Ms Richardson, 23, has told how she cannot bring herself to look at pictures of her mother, who ran away to the Costa Brava with paedophile TV hypnotist Martin Smith. Now, having waived her right to anonymity, the brave victim has revealed to the Sunday Mirror how her mother holds her responsible for the children's deaths. Ms Richardson told how she survived 11 years of sickening sexual abuse by her 46-year-old stepfather, who hanged himself in prison in January. His crimes came to light only after Ms Richardson reported him to the police, fearing her young half-sister might be subjected to the same torture. She even wanted to adopt the girl to save her from their mother's lover - who, DNA evidence shows, wrongly believed the murdered youngsters were his. Months after Smith suffocated her children, Ms Richardson said, she wrote to a relative to claim her eldest daughter was to blame for the killings. She said she felt relief at this week's conviction as Smith continues to believe her sick partner was innocent. Smith, who used to manage Cumbria County Council's children's department, is to serve 34 years for murdering her sleeping son and daughter at the Lloret De Mar resort's Miramar hotel in May 2010. Warped: Lianne Smith in court in Girona, Spain, where she was found guilty of the double murder . She and her partner had fled to Spain while he was awaiting trial for raping Ms Richardson. Police finally caught up with them and extradited Martin Smith to Britain. Days later, Rebecca and Daniel were dead. Their half-sister told how she felt some degree of relief that Rebecca did not survive to face the torment she herself went through. And she harbours no sympathy for Smith, adding: 'I am glad mum will spend her final days in jail. She can think about what she's done every moment of every day.' This coldness is perhaps understandable, considering the years of suffering she endured while living with her mother and stepfather. She told how she despised Martin Smith from the moment he came into her life, following her parents' divorce when she was six. Ms Richardson told the Mirror of his overbearing 'presence', his fiery temper and how he would beat her and her brother with a slipper - all of which their mother ignored. The family moved house several times throughout Ms Richardson's childhood, gradually cutting her off from friends and relatives. Then in May 1995, after they moved to a remote farm in the North East, Martin Smith began his 11-year campaign of horrific abuse. Ms Richardson, who was just seven at the time, told how he had just sent her brother to bed the first time he raped her. She said: 'He told me to stand in front of him. He said I was a ""big girl"" and I needed to ""do dares now"". I felt scared. Even at that age I knew it was wrong.' She faced this nightmare once a week - always when her mother wasn't home - and afterwards her only comfort was the thought that she was safe for another six days. Smith, who would make a point of raping the terrified girl on his birthday, even tried to use his supposed powers of hypnotism to put her into a trance. Scared that he would become angry if he saw that this never worked, Ms Richardson played along. Later, the family hit hard times and moved into a caravan, where Smith told Ms Richardson he had thought about killing all of them - and that her mother shared these homicidal instincts. Final days: Sarah Richardson cherishes these holiday pictures of Daniel (left) and Rebecca (right) shown shortly before they died. Her relief at Martin Smith's arrest was shattered by the news of their deaths . She told the Sunday Mirror: 'Part of . me felt it would have been easier if they had, as I would have been free . of him. But when I look at what happened to Becky and Daniel, I was . lucky to escape.' When . Ms Richardson was 15, Smith found out her mother was pregnant with . Rebecca and confessed to the girl that he wanted to marry her and even . father her children. The teenager began to dread a life trapped with this monster, and when her half-sister came along she was determined to protect her. Ms Richardson doted on Rebecca, calling her 'my baby' and telling how she would look after her as if she were her own child. Martin Smith, on the other hand, was strangely indifferent, and Ms Richardson recalls the time the baby fell off a bed while in his care - only for Smith to chastise the teenager for not rushing to the screaming child's aid. She said her stepfather would try to prey on her while Rebecca slept, and so she made sure to keep the infant on her lap. Tormentor: Martin Smith regularly raped Ms Richardson over the course of 11 years . Relief finally came when Ms Richardson . went away to study nursing at university. She was free, but fears for . her younger half-sister plagued her mind - and she used a secret mobile . number to check with her brother Chris that Smith hadn't turned on . Rebecca. It was while studying that Ms Richardson befriended a fellow rape survivor, who helped her to recognise the seriousness of what she had been through. Chris was thrown out of the family home when he was 16, and Ms Richardson thought this meant there would be no one to step in if their stepfather attacked Rebecca. She approached the police in November 2007, begging them not to arrest Smith until she had told Chris and her mother about what he had done to her. But when she finally broke her silence, Lianne Smith accused her of lying, disowned her and walked away. That was the last time Ms Richardson and her brother had any contact with their mother, who ran away to Barcelona with Martin Smith in December 2007. It was there that Daniel was born, though Ms Richardson only learned of his existence when police tracked the couple down. Her relief at Martin Smith's arrest soon turned to anguish as, less than two weeks later, she heard Rebecca and Daniel were dead - killed by their mother, who feared social services would take them from her as her partner's child abuse trial approached. Ms Richardson spoke of sleepless nights spent visualising Rebecca's cruel death, unable to come to terms with the fact that - after her worries about Martin Smith - it was her mother that harmed her half-siblings. Today she is a mother herself and lives with her husband in Carlisle. One of her biggest regrets is that, despite her mother's fears, she could have raised the murdered children and stopped them being taken into care. Holiday pictures from Rebecca and Daniel's final days act as a poignant reminder for Ms Richardson, and she plans to visit their graves in Spain. But as their mother continues to stand by her perverted dead partner, she says her only hope is that Lianne Smith appreciates the pain she has caused.","Sarah Richardson, 23, waives right to anonymity and reveals how her mother stood by as she suffered 11 years of sexual abuse from step-father ."

Troublesome: The investigation found that one in three Americans - including kids - are failing to schedule regular dental check-ups . The high cost of dental work in the U.S. has spawned a concerning crisis, with an eye-opening number of Americans skipping the dentist because they cannot afford it. A new probe has found that one in three Americans are failing to schedule regular dental check-ups because they don’t have enough money - and the results could be deadly. The findings have come from a joint investigation by PBS Frontline and The Center for Public Integrity of dental care in the U.S. The report, Dollars and Dentists aired last night, focusing on the ordeal of Florida girl Trinity Way, 5, who is on Medicaid, a programme that only 10 per cent of dentists in the state participate. Trinity has gone to the emergency room to receive the dental work that her grandmother cannot afford. Dr Frank Catalanotto, a professor at the University of Florida's College of Dentistry, told Frontline that Trinity’s case is a common one in the Sunshine State. He said: ‘1,200 children a year in Florida get their dental care under general anaesthesia in a hospital.’ Only 25 per cent of Medicaid-eligible children get any kind of dental care. The findings come months after it was revealed that more Americans unable to afford dental work have turned to the emergency room - a choice that often costs 10 times more than preventive care and offers far fewer treatment options than a dentist's office. Most of those emergency visits involve . trouble such as toothaches that could have been avoided with regular . check-ups but went untreated, in many cases because of a shortage of . dentists, particularly those willing to treat Medicaid patients, the . analysis said. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Trinity Way has gone to the emergency room to receive the dental work that her grandmother cannot afford . The number of ER visits nationwide for dental problems increased 16 per cent from 2006 to 2009, and the report released in February by the Pew Center on the States suggested that the trend is continuing. In Florida, for example, there were more than 115,000 ER dental visits in 2010, resulting in more than $88million in charges. That included more than 40,000 Medicaid patients, a 40 per cent increase from 2008. Many ER dental visits involve the same patients seeking additional care. In Minnesota, nearly 20 per cent of all dental-related ER visits are return trips, the analysis said. That's because emergency rooms generally are not staffed by dentists. Cost: Preventive dental care such as routine teeth cleaning can cost $50 to $100, versus $1,000 for emergency room treatment that may include painkillers and antibiotics . They can offer pain relief and medicine for infected gums but not much more for dental patients. And many patients are unable to find or afford follow-up treatment, so they end up back in the emergency room. 'Emergency rooms are really the canary in the coal mine. If people are showing up in the ER for dental care, then we've got big holes in the delivery of care,' Shelly Gehshan, director of Pew's children's dental campaign, told The Associated Press. She added: 'It's just like pouring money down a hole. It's the wrong service, in the wrong setting, at the wrong time.' A recent AP report find that in 2009: . South Carolina ER visits for dental-related problems increased nearly 60 per cent from four years earlier. Tennessee hospitals had more than 55,000 dental-related ER visits - five times as many as for burns. The center in Washington, D.C., is a division of the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. Pew researchers analyzed hospital information from 24 states, data from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and studies on dental care. Not all states collect data on ER visits for dental care, but those that do reveal the trend, Gehshan said. Preventive dental care such as routine teeth cleaning can cost $50 to $100, versus $1,000 for emergency room treatment that may include painkillers for aching cavities and antibiotics from resulting infections, according to Dr Catalanotto. These infections can be dangerous, especially in young children, who may develop fevers and dehydration from preventable dental conditions. Dr Catalanotto added that the recession has contributed to the trend. When a family member loses a job, dental care may take a back seat to food and other necessities. Startling: In Florida, 1,200 children a year in Florida get their dental care under general anaesthesia in a hospital . The crisis could have devastating effects, including death. Last year, Kyle Willis, a 24-year-old Cincinnati, Ohio, father, died because he could not afford to have a wisdom tooth removed. ABC News reported that Willis was in so much pain that he needed to be hospitalised, but didn’t have the money for antibiotics he was prescribed. He died after the infection caused his brain to swell. Watch video here . Watch Why Trinity Can’t Go to the Dentist on PBS.

They were also forced to overturn an alcohol ban because of the French love of wine and had a huge bank bailout in the 90s amid rumours that they were going bankrupt. It has also been unpopular with some french visitors and staff, being hit with protests, strikes and was even branded a 'Cultural Chernobyl' by experts 20 years ago. In nearby Bailly Romainvilliers, where the population leapt from 600 in 1990 to 6,000 after the park was built, its Mayor Arnaud de Belenet said many jobs pay 'barely above minimum wage, which is not at all what local people are looking for.' Austerity: No new attractions like the park's famous Captain Hook's Pirate Ship Adventureland have been built for the birthday . Success: The park opened with a bang in 1992 but it has been unpopular with the French and struggled because of the cold and wet Parisian winters . But despite the gloom its birthday will be well celebrated as there will be a 'Disney Dreams' gala to mark the 20-year milestone, with a laser show, water and fireworks. Scores of celebrities have also been brought in to mark the birthday. Jonathan Ross and family, actress Salma Hayek, singer Katie Melua and even legendary footballer Zinedine Zidane embraced their inner child this month to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris. Ross, his screenwriter wife Jane Goldman, and their three children cuddled up to Mickey and Minnie for a celebratory photoshoot and spent the weekend sampling the park's best rides as thousands of visitors from around the world descended for the start of the Easter holidays. And it is rumoured owners are even mulling over the idea of a new park, ready for 2030.","Europe's busiest tourist attraction will not pay it all off for at least 12 years .

The Mad Men star single-handedly sparked the early Sixties bombshell trend when she first hit screens as Joan Holloway in 2007. And it seems the actress, 37, has a penchant for decades past off-screen too, as she reveals in a new interview with Harpers Bazaar's YouTube show The Look. She offers a glimpse of her favourite pieces from her wardrobe, and takes the crew on a tour of her favourite LA vintage stores. Scroll down for video . How do I look? Christina Hendricks models one of her favourite vintage hats for Harper's Bazaar . Accessories appear to be her main addiction; she modelled a straw hat and jewelled capelet from her own closet, before trying on an array of costume jewellery. In a second store, a hat boutique, she was more enthusiastic still, trying on countless hats, before selecting a wide-brimmed number to take home. Wardrobe essential: The actress models an embellished capelet, that she says goes with everything . She issues words of wisdom in the process too, like: 'You've . got to lock down your fascinator,' and 'The secret to wearing a hat is . that you have to commit to it. You've got to commit to these feathers.' Christina, who is married to fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, is . certainly experienced enough to know. She reveals that she has been . seeking out thrift store finds since the age of about ten. 'I lived in Twin Falls, Idaho, and there weren't a lot of shops,' she says. 'I learned very early . on to go to the Salvation Army and just little vintage stores, and . create my own looks. Oftentimes tragic... Hat's entertainment! Christina had a ball in her favourite headwear store, trying on an array of designs . Titfer tat: The star looked fantastic in every piece, but chose a wide-brimmed number (right) as her favourite . 'There were some very original looks that I put together. I had my goth phase, which was pretty... dramatic.' Another source of knowledge and . inspiration, has of course, been Mad Men. She credits the show's costume . designer, Janie Bryant, with steering her towards fitted silhouettes . that flatter her curvy figure. 'I've . learned a lot from being on Mad Men actually, as far as tailoring, . silhouettes and things like that,' she continues. 'Janie Bryant, our . costume designer, she's taught me a lot. Setting trends: Christina shot to fame as office bombshell Joan on Mad Men . Woven headpiece: 'This is one of my favourite hats (above). It's straw, but it's moulded. Cool, right? Very gypsy. 'The . nice thing about this hat, cause it's very formal, is that you could . actually wear this to a dinner party and you don't have to take it off . because it's part of the outfit.' Embellished capelet: Christina says: 'This [capelet, above] is one thing that I find I wear often, and you would think that . because it's so sort of specific that  you wouldn't. 'It's... one of my absolute favourite things because you . can wear it with jeans and a T-shirt or you could wear it with a dress. 'It looks also very vintage as well, but it's actually new.' 'I think I have a lot more pencil skirts. I . used to like very sort of 1920s baggy, sort of floral lacy things that . probably weren't the most flattering on me, but were just so gorgeous that I . wore them anyway.' Among the items that Christina insists every woman must own is a metallic coat 'for the evening'. Picking up one such garment in vintage store My Ulrika, she remarks: 'It's incredibly subtle.' She admits having the money to spend on her wardrobe has certainly helped keep the fashion faux pas to a minimum. She worked as a model between the ages of 18 and 27, living in London and New York, and could not afford to splash out on fashion. 'There were probably some really bad outfits then, because I didn't have any money to shop,' she said. 'I could only shop at Strawberry! 'I'd go back home where my family lives in Virginia, there was great vintage stuff there because a lot of people didn't . want the stuff that I wanted, so I'd go and get that stuff and mix it in . with a little Strawberry tank top or something.' One thing Christina does remember splashing out on was a pair of leather jeans. 'I remember saving up when I lived in New York,' she recalled. 'I wanted a pair of leather jeans so badly and there was some shop down . on St Mark's... I think they were $200. 'That was a really big purchase . for me. I saved up and saved up, and I wore them every single day.'","The Mad Men actress also reveals favourite pieces from her own closet, and what she has learned from the show's costume designer, Janie Bryant ."

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance has found a new front man against the United Progressive Alliance -  Baba Ramdev. The yoga guru is currently protesting against the United . Progressive Alliance Government's alleged inefficiency in tacking black . money and corruption. Ramdev's agitation during at sit-in at the Ramlila Maidan turned into an extended NDA gathering with BJP president Nitin Gadkari, Janata Dal- United chief Sharad Yadav, Janata Party supremo Subramanian Swamy, BJP leader Vijay Goel and representatives from the Shiromani Akali Dal joining him on the dais. Riding the wave: Baba Ramdev (centre) with BJP chief Nitin Gadkari and JD-U president Sharad Yadav at Ramila ground . Ramdev, the pied piper of the assembly, played his own tune against the Centre, particularly the Congress, as his followers cheered with a renewed vigour. 'This protest is to ensure that no dishonest person enters Parliament. Such people should be boycotted. We do not have a political agenda. Congress hatao, desh bachao.' Ramdev declared. The dwindling support for Ramdev at the Maidan soared yesterday as the political leaders came in with their own squad of agitators to the venue. Ramdev leans out of the bus window and waves to supporters after being detained . Ramdev’s platform gave the BJP an opportunity to make common cause with some of its former allies such as the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP), the Biju Janata Dal ( BJD) and the Asom Gana Parishad ( AGP), whose representatives were also present at the ground. Gadkari assured Ramdev full support of the BJP in his agitation against black money. 'This agitation should not be seen from a political prism. This is an agitation of the people of the country and not of a single party. Black money should be brought back and spent on the country’s development,' he said. An unexpected bonus for the Baba came in the form of support from the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, which are supporting the UPA from outside. The fusing together of the Opposition parties around Ramdev is the product of a series of meetings that took place between the yoga guru and leaders of the BJP. Full capacity: Crowds surround the yoga guru . Ramdev had a closed- door meeting with Gadkari on the eve of his agitation that began on August 9. He conducted further discussions with Gadkari, L. K. Advani and Arun Jaitley in another meeting. In July, a prominent lawyer- politician facilitated a meeting between Ramdev and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad. Buoyed by political support, Baba Ramdev has dug his heels in at Ambedkar Stadium, where he has been lodged with his supporters, and has refused to leave despite the police deciding to free him. Ramdev said he would stay there the night and decide the next course of action later. This has given the Delhi Police a headache as they need to sanitise the area because Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will pass through it on August 15. The police brass briefed the Union home ministry on Monday evening even as they continued their efforts to persuade Ramdev break his fast and leave. However, the yoga guru has stumped the police by demanding that they provide food to all his supporters if they wanted him to break his fast. Earlier, despite deploying a large number of security personnel, the police had a tough time controlling the yoga guru and his supporters as they marched towards Parliament. After fiveand- a- half hours of high drama, they were finally detained under Section 65 of the Delhi Police Act, which is a preventive measure. Wiser after the flak following the midnight crackdown on Ramdev’s fast last year, the police were restrained this time. 'The BJP’s calculation was simple. As Ramdev has some following in smaller towns as well as in the urban middle class, supporting him would benefit the party,' said a party source. What worked for the BJP was that Ramdev, unlike Team Anna, had no qualms in aligning with the party and, more importantly, had no plans of launching a political outfit. Moreover, it was easy for the BJP to back the yoga guru on the black money issue as it had earlier been raised by Advani. Ramdev on his part, needed the Opposition’s political backing to avoid an embarrassing end to his agitation like the Ramlila Maidan fiasco last year. The support of parties such as the TDP, the Akali Dal and the BJD was largely the result of Ramdev’s meetings with Naveen Patnaik, Chandrababu Naidu, and Parkash Singh Badal in June. He also met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar. The Sangh’s hand in shaping Ramdev’s agitation has been known for some time. The seeds of the protest at the Ramlila Maidan last year were sown in a meeting in early 2011 at the Vivekananda Foundation in south Delhi. The meeting was attended by Sangh ideologue K. N. Govindacharya, Swadeshi Jagran Manch chief Swaminathan Gurumurthy, Subramanian Swamy and Ramdev. This was part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s effort to “ consolidating splinter movements”. Sources said it has been Gadkari’s gameplan to get Ramdev, Swamy and Govindacharya to play a more active political role, perhaps in order to provide a counterweight to “ Delhi- based” leaders of the BJP as well as to maintain the ideological dominance of the RSS. The coordination between the BJP and Ramdev was perfect as party MPs created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha on Monday on the black money issue. At the Ramlila Maidan, Ramdev, who had been postponing his “ big announcement” since Friday, finally blew the bugle on Monday morning, asking his supporters to get ready to court arrest. Around 1.15 pm, the yoga guru began his march towards Parliament with thousands of supporters. The cavalcade, however, could not move beyond 300 metres and about 10 minutes into the march, it was stopped by the police near the Ranjit Singh flyover. Soon it became clear that Ramdev had been detained and was being taken to Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana on the outskirts of the city. “ Delhi Police is a puppet in the hands of the central government. We will not do anything that disrupts peace,” Ramdev told his supporters. The police had a tough time making their way through the crowd. Even the rains could not move the supporters away. It was only around 6 pm that the buses carrying Ramdev and his aides left. SINCE the number of protesters was large, the police decided to take Ramdev to Ambedkar Stadium near Delhi Gate. Now, he is camping at the stadium. This has triggered another security issue as the Ambedkar Stadium falls on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s route to the Red Fort where he will hoist the national flag on August 15. Ramdev has not yet announced his next course of action but a member of his team said they would present a memorandum on black money and corruption to President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:51 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:52 EST, 30 May 2012 . The mystery of how a U.S. World War 2 fighter pilot met his grisly end after crashing in a South Pacific island jungle has been revealed - after 31 years of painstaking work. Lt Moszek Murray Zanger was initially believed to have been shot and killed immediately after being captured by the Japanese following his 4,000ft parachuting out of his Corsair. He had collided midair with his wingman while out on patrol over Rabaul, Papua New Guinea. Helping hand: Villagers from Vudal who helped uncover the plane flown by Zanger, whose nieces stood behind the USMC flag (left to right) are Andrea Talbutt, Marcy Hanigan and Susan Nishihira. Henry Sakaida is pictured at the rear. But a dogged forensic investigation has discovered he was in fact beaten, tried to flee in an inflatable dinghy and was captured by a Japanese Navy patrol boat. He was then kept chained inside a hut for six months, before being killed and buried near an airstrip. Retired Temple City nursery owner Henry Sakaida, researching the air combat incident, became fascinated with the case and persevered for 31 years to find 'the truth'. And the 60-year-old's discoveries enabled him to take Zanger's three nieces - Marcy Hanigan, Andrea Talbutt and Susan Nishihira - to the site of their downed uncle's aircraft. It was back in 1981 when Sakaida, who studies World War 2 air combat incidents to then track down dogfighters to try and reunite them, first learned from Australian military records that Japanese Prisoners of War had seen an American pilot in captivity in March 1945. They said his name was 'Zanga', and records detailed he was killed shortly after being captured - and following his attempt to escape by grabbing a sword and trying to attack two guards. But Sakaida discovered that forensic investigations revealed Zanger's remains, when recovered by the U.S., showed he had been beaten, not shot. The intrepid historian then found that the pilot was later buried somewhere in Los Angeles. After further research, he was told Zanger's grave was in the Home of Peace Cemetery. But his mother and father had died, and Sakaida could not find any trace of any other relatives. It was when their mother died in 2009 that the sisters decided to try and piece together what had happened to their uncle. Googling his name, they were 'flabbergasted' to see Sakaida's research on him. They contacted him and they made plans to visit Rabaul. Sakaida told the Los Angeles Times: 'Instead of me tracking them down, they tracked me down. 'I turned over a thick folder I'd collected about him and told them that we all should someday go to Rabaul.' The trip was put together and, through help from Pacificwrecks' Justin Taylan, they found the co-ordinates of the crash site and then discovered the wreck.","Moszek Murray Zanger first believed to have been shot dead straight away .

'I need to be her voice right now but if we raise enough money to get her started at this new school, perhaps she will soon have a voice of her own.' Steve Walker, deputy director for children’s services for Leeds City Council, which made the decision to reject Francesca’s application for educational funding, said it could not justify the expense despite admitting the new school would be appropriate. He added: 'Unfortunately we only have a limited amount of money available to meet the needs of all our pupils with complex needs.

HIV sufferers have been given hope of a more efficient treatment, after wide-scale tests on a breakthrough pill. The new 'Quad' pill was found to be faster acting and have fewer side-effects compared to two widely-used drug regimens. And an extra bonus for those who need to take it, the solitary once-a-day . pill removes the need for an array of drugs on a daily basis. Quad: The new four-in-one HIV pill, described by doctors as an 'important new treatment option' Sufferers must rigidly adhere to their HIV medication routine because missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to the medication, making them more vulnerable to a progression of their illness. But now results from two large international trials, published in The Lancet, revealed that Quad was an 'important new treatment option' that could improve compliance with treatment. The human immunodeficiency virus weakens the ability to fight infections and disease, such as cancer. AIDS marks the final stage when the body can no longer battle life-threatening illnesses. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said: 'Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill.' He added that studies have shown single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance. The Quad pill, which is a combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, was created by Gilead Sciences. In May the FDA’s Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13 to 1 to approve it for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in U.S adults who have yet to receive treatment. They will make a final decision in August. This illustration shows red blood corpuscles and the human immunodeficiency virus flowing through the circulatory system . In the Lancet study, the first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens - either Quad, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, known as Atripla. After 48 weeks of treatment, 88 per cent of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels compared with 84 per cent in the Atripla group. Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups. Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams and insomnia compared with Atripla. The second trial included 708 adults who had never received treatment from centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily Quad or a popular and recommended twice-daily combination of protease inhibiotrsritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) plus FTC/TDF. By week 48, 90 per cent of people in Quad had  undetectable viral loads compared to 87 per cent of people in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. The safety of the two regimens was also similar. If approved by regulatory agencies, the Quad would be the first once-daily single-tablet regimen containing an HIV integrase inhibitor.","The Quad pill was found to be more effective than two widely-used drug regimens .

The current order was founded in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland, also known as James II of England. The Sovereign grants membership to the order, and need not seek approval from the Government. The Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne are Knights of the Thistle. Male Knights of the Thistle may use the title Sir, while ladies can use Lady before their forename. Wives of Knights may use Lady as a prefix to their surname, although peers and princes do not use these titles unless their names are written out in their fullest forms. The motto of the order is Nemo me impune lacessit, which is translated as No one attacks me with impunity,  or alternatively No one can harm me unpunished. The same motto appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and some pound coins. The same mottos is also used by the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The Order's patron saint is St Andrew, and its emblem is a thistle, Scotland's national flower.

British based, New Zealand-born designer Emilia Wickstead has fast become one of the go-to designers for London's high society.In business just three years, Ms Wickstead has already dressed a number of royals - not least Kate, who wore an emerald Emilia Wickstead coat dress for a St Patrick's Day appearance earlier this year, and the same £1,200 pink coat dress on two occasions in the past two months - once for a Jubilee lunch at Windsor Castle, and again just two weeks later for a Buckingham Palace garden party. Kate has been spotted various times visiting the atelier in London's Belgravia, and is said to be a great fan of the brand. Privately, Ms Wickstead is said to be delighted the Kate has shown interest in her collection. Ms Wickstead also dressed a number of VIP guests invited to last year's Royal Wedding, including Kate's cousin Lucy; Anya Hindmarch; Georgina Cadbury; Lady Kitty Spencer, Emma Parker Bowles and India Hicks, who was a bridesmaid to Princess Diana. But Emilia's client base is not restricted to the upper echelons royalty. Ms Wickstead can also count Dannii Minogue and Samantha Cameron as trusted customers, both of whom have worn her designs on many occasions.Most recently, Samantha Cameron wore multiple pieces from Wickstead's collection on a visit to the U.S. in March.

On trial: Daniel Pytlarz is accused of sexually assaulting 18 female clients, including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney . A masseur groped a woman as she lay naked at his clinic then offered her a loyalty card when the ordeal was over, a court heard today. Daniel Pytlarz, 34, left his victim fearing she would be raped after he ordered her to strip off her underwear at his upmarket spa in St John's Wood, North London, it was claimed. The woman, who cannot be named, visited for her first ever massage after booking discounted treatment through a health and beauty website, Southwark Crown Court was told. Giving evidence, she told jurors she had visited the clinic in March last year. She said she had been asked to undress by the masseur and had taken her clothes off but left her bra and underpants on before Pytlarz asked her to remove them. 'I was a bit surprised,' she added. 'I was not sure why I had to take my undergarments off but as I had never had a massage before I just thought, ""OK, this is what is supposed to happen"".' But she began to fear for her safety after Pytlarz groped her while she was lying naked on the massage table, the court heard. 'I was actually thinking I hope I get out of this,' she said. 'I wear glasses, I could not see properly and I was naked and did not know how I could get to the door and get my clothes and up the stairs before he got to the door. 'I have a bad back and I thought if I try and get off the bed then my back is going to go and it is all going to be terrible. 'I thought I was going to be raped.' Ordeal: The woman, whose new husband had booked a massage for her birthday in November 2010, said she had asked Pytlarz for a deep full-body massage but 'completely froze' when he touched her intimately . When Pytlarz stopped and asked her if she wanted it to continue she said, 'No, thank you'. She said: 'I got dressed and went upstairs. 'He said he hoped I had not minded what had happened because I seemed very tense and then he gave me a loyalty card. Cancelled appointment: When Sir Paul McCartney's aide told him about the alleged assault he immediately cancelled his and wife Nancy Shevell's appointment with Pytlarz . 'I just said, ""OK, thanks"", and then left.' Pytlarz is also said to have sexually assaulted two lawyers who attended his spa together in January 2011. Both had also booked treatment through the Wahanda.com health and beauty website. One said she and her friend had made the appointments as 'something nice' for them to do together before a meal with their boyfriends. She told jurors that after Pytlarz had touched her intimately while massaging her legs, she had wanted to alert her friend but had been surrounded by the masseur and a female employee. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'I wanted to say something to warn her but they were both standing there so I just said, ""Enjoy your massage, I will see you later"".' Her friend added: 'I do not remember specifics I just remember two very poignant moments of the massage that have stayed with me. 'He was massaging up and down my calf and the bottom of my leg and then up my thigh. 'I've had my legs massaged before and usually people stop at the top of your legs - a good couple of inches from your bikini line or where your pants start. 'That was not the case here.' Among his other victims - of which there are believed to be 18 in total - Pytlarz is said to have targeted a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney, who claimed he touched her intimately when he gave her a free massage at his clinic in December 2009. It happened the day before he was due to give a massage to the ex-Beatle and his girlfriend Nancy Shevell, who is now his wife, at home in Cavendish Avenue, less than half a mile from the masseur's clinic. When the employee told Sir Paul what had happened he cancelled the appointment, jurors have been told. Pytlarz, from St John's Wood, denies seven counts of assault by penetration and 14 counts of sexual assault. All the offences are alleged to have taken place between March 2009 and September 2011. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Daniel Pytlarz, 34, also accused of sexually assaulting two lawyers at spa .

Facebook has suffered a serious blow to its glittering reputation when its share price slumped by more than 10 per cent in just two days of trading since the firm's landmark IPO last Friday. And the pain could continue for the social network, as many analysts predict its value will continue to fall in the wake of the much-hyped but shambolic initial public offering of 421m shares. It means Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who made $19bn on Friday has since lost $2.055bn in the three days since. One market expert even said there was 'no reason' to invest in the company, claiming that jumping on the Facebook bandwagon would be like 'catching a falling knife' - and that there would be 'no bottom' for the shares. Excitement: But Facebook's shares have fallen since the IPO on Friday . Facebook's flotation on the Nasdaq was one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history, raising nearly $20billion for the web giant. But the hotly anticipated share offering soon fell flat, as the firm's share price ended the day just cents higher than its opening price of $38. The price fell even further on Monday, closing at $34.03 as several of the investors, both professional and amateur, who had piled in on Friday quickly had second thoughts. Dave Rovelli, a senior trader at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC he would be reluctant to invest in Facebook until it had a viable long-term plan for turning its unprecedented amount of user data into profit. 'There's no bottom,' he said, noting that most major financial institutions were short-selling the shares. 'So there's no reason to jump in here. You're catching a falling knife.' Disappointing: The shares closed at $34.03 on Monday, down from $38 . History: Facebook's debut was beset by problems - Nasdaq has even announced it will change IPO procedures . He added that the sharp fall in Facebook's share price 'leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth', and could damage the reputation of stock markets as a whole. 'We're trying to get the retail investor back on board, and everyone who bought it is getting creamed,' Mr Rovelli said. Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who was the first expert to advise selling Facebook shares on Friday, said he thought the company's true value was around $30 a share. 'There must have been some sober second thoughts about this,' he said in the wake of Monday's mass sell-off. Mr Wieser added that there were 'real concerns about growth and advertisers' frequent lack of certainty how best to use Facebook'. Hype: But the Facebook IPO is becoming a cautionary tale for other firms . Honeymoon: But Mr Zuckerberg and his new bride Priscilla Chan have lost billions thanks to stock traders . Some investors have managed to profit from the IPO, as the firm's share price briefly leapt up to around $45 on Friday before falling back down again. Steve Bishop, of the RS Technology Fund, told the Wall Street Journal he sold his shares in the 'overhyped' IPO early on, as he felt the market had become 'frothy'. The disappointing results of the IPO could deter other rising tech stars, such as Twitter, from going public and risking a similar blow to their reputations. 'It bears out why so many Silicon Valley CEOs want to stay private as long as possible - to avoid the maelstrom they’ve seen hitting Facebook over the last few days,' analyst Jed Williams told the Financial Times. Blame: Some say Nasdaq, pictured, is responsible for the Facebook fiasco . Opinion is split over who is to blame for the slump in the share price, with some suggesting Facebook issued too many shares in the first place, and others blaming the financial firms tasked with handling the deal. Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, told the Journal: 'The underwriters completely screwed this up,' adding that the share issue 'should have been half as big as it was'. But many experts believe that Nasdaq itself is responsible, as it failed to anticipate the trading demand, leading to serious technical difficulties and a long backlash in processing deals. Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Knight Capital, described Friday's fiasco as 'the worst performance by an exchange on an IPO ever'. One expert even blamed critical media coverage for Facebook's problems - a spokesman for TD Ameritrade said that negative news stories caused 'emotional trading' which depressed the share price.","Founder Mark Zuckerberg loses $2.055bn in three days .

Medicine can often have unpleasant side effects, from headaches and cramps to irritability and weight gain. But 'weight gain' was something of an understatement in the case of one Californian teenager who developed obesity when she began taking prescription drugs for Lupus. Napa-based Jena Graves, 19, was diagnosed with Lupus - a complex condition that attacks the immune system - when she was 15 years old, after complaining of tiring and bruising easily. Napa-based Jena Graves, 19, developed obesity when she began taking prescription drugs for Lupus . Before then, Jena told the San Francisco Chronicle, she was a happy, healthy, active, 5ft 2in-tall teenager with a slim build and a love for softball. Assessed by doctors, Jena was prescribed with a 25-drug cocktail, including prednisone, a corticosteroid that keeps the chronic autoimmune . disorder under control but can have horrific side effects. Prednisone is also an obesinogenic drug (much like many antidepressants) which increases the appetite and makes the body retain fat more easily. And in just five years Jena watched her weight more than double from a slender 120lbs to 272lbs. No one told Jena and her family about the dangerous side effect of the drugs, so she didn't notice that she felt hungry all the time. She continued to eat what she wanted, attempting to satisfy her constant hunger with junk food but never feeling full. She said: 'Mostly . I would ask my mom for it, but when she was gone to work I . would just stand at the fridge and eat, because that's what it does to . you.' One day Jena, 19, hopes to own a ranch of her own . Jena also felt exhausted, recalling: 'I . basically slept all the time. That's when I started . gaining weight and basically got depressed because I couldn't play . softball anymore and depressed because of my weight.' Jena developed insecurities as she gained weight and found it difficult to socialise, eventually withdrawing from seventh grade at Napa's Redwood . Middle School and taking classes in hopsital instead. Vintage High School, another public school in . town, walking across the stage for graduation. Her mother Mindy, a surgical scrub technician, worried about the . drugs' effect on her daughter but trusted the doctors to make her better: 'I figured, ""These people know . what they're doing"".' Soon Jena's situation worsened. She developed Lupus' most common side effect, Type 2 diabetes, possibly triggered by the high blood sugar in her body brought about by the drugs. Both Seal, left with ex-wife Heidi Klum, and the late Michael Jackson have suffered from Lupus . She began taking metformin, a pill that helps regulate blood glucose levels that doesn't cause the same weight gain insulin can. Then, in 2009, Jena and her mother . went to Stanford to get a second opinion and doctors immediately lowered . Jena's prednisone dosage and stopped her prescriptions to most of the . 25 medicines, deeming them unnecessary. They also found that prednisone had been sucking the calcium from her bones and had left her with a fractured back. Dr John . Morton, director of bariatric surgery at Stanford Hospital and Clinics, performed a gastric bypass surgery on Jena that helped . curb her weight gain - and Jena . is now healthy and happy once more, 40lbs lighter and and no longer . taking prednisone, having swapped to azathioprine to control her Lupus. Dr Morton said: 'All these medications are . absolutely wonderful when they work in the right patients. But we've got to figure out if it's appropriate . or not to blanket America with prednisone and other obesity-generating . drugs that are creating problems.'","Jena Graves, 19, from Napa, California, was given 'obesinogenic' drugs .

But they wanted to do something different from the usual phone call or email. And so they invited family and friends to see their baby scan projected on to the white cliffs at Eastbourne in East Sussex. Telling the world: Adrian and Emma Bradbury invited family and friends to their 'portrait gallery' as they projected the 20-week scan of their child on to the Eastbourne cliffs . Previously, the couple had projected their 12-week scan on to the side of the Towner Art Galley in Eastbourne and sent photographs of the event to their loved ones. This was such a success that they projected their 20-week scan on to the cliffs, the walls of medieval Pevensey Castle and the Martello Tower in Clacton-on-Sea. Mr Bradbury, 30, a ceramic tiler, said: ‘We were really excited when we found out we were going to be parents and we wanted to do something different to tell people that Emma was pregnant – something we could always tell our child. ‘With the help of a friend, we went down to the art gallery one night and used a projector to put the image on to the wall. ‘We kept it up for an hour and it attracted a lot of attention from passers-by. 'Even the cleaner inside the art gallery came outside to see what the fuss was about. ‘Afterwards, we loaded the photograph on to Facebook and all our friends loved it. It made it even more special for us.’ Proud parents: The 12-week scan of Adrian and Emma Bradbury's baby projected on to an art gallery wall in Eastbourne . The Towner Art Gallery – which was unaware of Mr Bradbury’s plans – is considering an exhibition of the couple’s photographs and projections and has already offered the unborn child membership. The Bradburys used a generator to project the scan on to their chosen surfaces, choosing areas open to the public. Mr Bradbury said he was inspired to make the extravagant announcement after his wife, a 27-year-old beautician, started a baby diary. He added: ‘It’s a great way of capturing how we felt about the scan at that time instead of hospital scan photo paper which we may lose in 15 years. ‘Once we have saved enough money, we are going to have a 4D scan and do something artistic with it on a larger scale, but we are keeping that under wraps for now.’ There has been a boom in US-style pregnancy announcements such as ‘gender reveal parties’, where expectant parents announce their child’s sex by cutting into a white cake to reveal pink or blue sponge.","Emma and Adrian Bradbury show 20-week image at Eastbourne seafront .

French politicians have responded by . criticising Britain’s health and education system and accusing the Prime . Minister of wanting to establish a UK ‘tax haven’. They also implied . that Mr Cameron was drunk when he made his offer. Green and pleasant land: David Cameron promised to welcome rich French citizens with open arms as Francois Hollande prepared to raise taxes . The Prime Minister promised to . welcome anyone looking to escape a 75 per cent top rate of tax, which is . set to be introduced by France’s new socialist president Francois . Hollande. This week Mr Cameron told a business . summit in Mexico: ‘If the French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of . tax we will roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses . to Britain, and they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our Health . Service and schools and everything else.’ French socialist MP Claude Bartalone . replied: ‘I hope it was an after-dinner remark and that he didn’t have . all his wits about him when he said these things, because it’s just not . the done thing. ‘He can’t have had his wits about him . because if he had, he would have paid more attention to all those . Europeans who go to work in England but who come for medical treatment . in France, and who put their children in French schools because there . are no more public services in England.’ Employers’ federation chairman . Laurence Parisot added: ‘I don’t want French businesses to walk on this . red carpet. There is no way that the entrepreneurial spirit should be . monopolised by our British friends.’ The leader of the Communist Party, . Pierre Laurent, said ‘Britain’s ambition to be Europe’s tax haven’ was . ‘sad’. Chancellor George Osborne lowered the top rate of tax from 50p to . 45p in this year’s Budget. Sky-high rates: France's European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said French bosses were patriots and would stay in their country with 'support' from their government . A Downing Street spokesman stressed . that the Prime Minister had been making a ‘serious point about having a . competitive tax policy’, while a source close to Mr Cameron branded Mr . Bartalone’s comments as a ‘ridiculous outburst’. The jibes about the Prime Minister’s . dining habits follow embarrassing claims in a new biography that he . spends a significant amount of time ‘chillaxing’ and enjoys several . glasses of wine with his lunch. It recently emerged that he left his eight-year-old daughter Nancy in a pub in Buckinghamshire after a long Sunday meal. Britain’s relationship with France was already strained, even before Mr Hollande’s election victory last month. Mr Cameron had snubbed the socialist . when he was in opposition, choosing instead to rub shoulders with the . man he ousted, Nicolas Sarkozy. The nations are also divided on the best way to deal with the recession. Mr Hollande, who describes himself as . an ‘enemy of finance’, announced massive increases in public spending to . be funded by a tax hike. Those earning more than €1million (£800,000) a year will pay 75 per cent tax.","Left-wing president raising top rate to 75% .

Quick thinking: Ella knew exactly what to do when her mother received burns from an exploding microwave meal . Vicky, 32, was severely burnt from her chin down to her chest when sauce sprayed from under the lid on to her face. But her daughter saved her from any permanent scarring damage by immediately calling an ambulance, advising her mother to take a cold shower and then wrapping her burns in clingfilm. Ella had just learnt how to treat burns in an after-school first aid club. Ms Patmore said: 'I am so proud of her. I was in a bad way and she just knew what to do straight away. I had gone into a state of shock.' Remove any clothing or jewellery near the burnt area of skin. DON'T try to remove anything that is stuck to the burnt skin. Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm water for 10–30 minutes, ideally within 20 minutes of the injury occurring. Never use ice, iced water or any creams. Keep the rest of the person warm. Cover the burn with cling film. Put the cling film in a layer over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean, clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand. Treat the pain from a burn with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin. For further information including when to go to hospital visit www.nhs.uk . Paramedics who treated Ms Patmore at her home in Birchington, Kent, said that Ella’s care saved her mother from permanent scarring.

Ms Patmore was taken to hospital for treatment to her burns.Ella has been learning first aid at an after-school club at her school in Westgate-on-Sea. Ms Patmore said: 'I am really grateful to the school for teaching first aid. 'Thank heavens for those classes.' Amazingly it's not the first time that Ella has come to her mother’s rescue. In 2010, a five-year-old Ella called an ambulance when her mother suffered a heart attack. Ms Patmore added: 'She is like a little carer to me, she is amazing.' Despite her emergency heroics, Ella does not want to pursue a career in medicine. She said: 'I’d like to be a zoo keeper when I’m older, as I want to look after animals. I don’t want to be a vet, as I wouldn’t like to cut an animal open.

Roger Clayton, from Paignton, Devon, came up with the idea after being penalised for going seven minutes over his parking time. He is now asking others to become 'parking meter angels' by putting 50p into the meter to buy a stranger the added time they need. He said: 'I saw a traffic warden standing with his machine at Paignton beach so I went over and noticed the car's ticket was about to run out. 'So I just bought another ticket, put it under the car's windscreen wiper and walked away. 'The traffic warden didn't say anything - there's not a lot he could say really, but his face wasn't very happy, though.' He now wants others to also 'spread some good happiness'. He added: 'I felt good - we all work hard - if you've only got 50p to put in a meter or you get stuck in a queue it's not really your fault you overrun your time. 'It happened to me on a Sunday afternoon. I nipped in a shop with my son to buy a pair of shorts and when I came back I had a fine.' Hitting back: Mr Clayton came up with the idea after being penalised for going seven minutes over his parking time (file picture) His views have found support with others in Torbay. Posting a message on a website about it, Hazel Smith wrote: 'These meters are enough to drive people away from the Bay. I am sure traffic wardens are on commission - it's really upsetting getting a ticket.' Julie Brandon wrote: 'Good for him, I say. 'Torbay Council and it's parking policy are doing a good job of driving people away from our Towns and these random acts of kindness may just help to encourage them back in.' But Helen Dunn-Hill wasn't impressed, posting: 'Glad some people still have money to waste in this recession. 'If drivers can't get back in time for before the ticket runs out either catch a bus or park somewhere where they can park longer.'","Roger Clayton came up with idea after being fined for being just minutes over his time .

Unlikely supporter: Atheistic scientist Richard Dawkins (above) is backing a Government scheme that is supplying state schools with King James Bibles . He is the arch-atheist whose best-selling book The God Delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society. So it may come as some surprise to learn that Richard Dawkins has thrown his full support into a scheme to send free King James Bibles to every state school. The plan, backed by Church leaders, was announced by Education Secretary Michael Gove earlier this year in the hope children will learn about the religious text's impact 'on our history, language, literature and democracy'. The National Secular Society were, unsurprisingly, outraged, saying the £375,000 proposal was a waste of money and favoured Christianity when many schools needed to accommodate several faiths. Dawkins, you might think, would be among the critics. But he said he was 'a little shocked' that every school did not already have a copy and that he would have contributed financially to the scheme if he had been approached. Writing in The Observer, he says it contains a wealth of literary merit and refers back to a section in The God Delusion in which he lists 129 biblical phrases which any educated speaker would recognise. The bible delusion? Mr Dawkins hopes the scheme will open children's eyes to what he perceives to be moral corruption in the religious text (file picture) 'A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian,' he adds. However, he admits to having an ulterior motive in backing the scheme as he hopes it will actually put pupils off religion. He highlights how long wars have been fought over how to interpret words 'allegedly uttered' at the Last Supper and how centuries-long schisms were based on 'nothing more serious' than whether Jesus is both God and his son or just his son. Bad influence? Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, an event which, Mr Dawkins claims, has triggered long wars due to arguments over the interpretation of words 'allegedly uttered' during the meal . He also describes the Ten Commandments as horrors' and pointed out how some fundamental Protestants still take them literally. He said: 'People who do not know the bible well have been gulled into thinking it is a good guide to morality. 'Whatever else the Bible might be - and it really is a great work of literature - it is not a moral book and young people need to learn that important fact because they are frequently told the opposite.'","Scientist 'shocked' all schools didn't already have one .

A six-year-old girl who almost drowned alongside her brother and father is doing well in hospital as doctors say she is 'out of immediate danger'. Florence Mynott suffered a heart attack when the boat she was in went over a 10ft weir along with her father, Julian, brothers Freddie, three and Archie, seven. Mr Mynott, an antiques dealer, was taking a 'little pleasure trip' on the river Avon near his home when tragedy struck, killing him and Freddie. His last moments were spent desperately trying to save the children when they were swept over the weir during  an afternoon paddle in their new rowing boat.

Tragic: Freddie Mynott (right) died with his father when their boat went over a weir near their £660,000 home - his brother Archie and sister Florence survived . Florence and Archie were rescued from the fast-flowing water by a heroic villager soon after the boat capsized on Saturday afternoon. Mr Mynott, who specialised in high-end antiques and home furnishings, was seen attempting to swim towards his children near the upturned glass-fibre vessel but the current, increased by the recent heavy rain, was too strong. Yesterday his father, Roger, 69, spoke of the son he described as a ‘safety freak’ who lived for his children. From Pattaya, Thailand, where he runs . his own antiques and interior design business, Mr Mynott senior said his . son and wife Emma, 41, had spent a ‘fortune’ renovating their new . £660,000 riverside home. The couple chose the house in Barford, Warwickshire, specifically because of its waterside location in a quiet village. After . buying the property in January last year, they lived in a cottage in . the grounds until renovation work on the building was completed around . February this year.

So delighted was Mr Mynott with the completed project he told his father he was ‘never going to move from the house’. Mr Mynott senior added: ‘He was so pleased with the house but now he will never get the chance to enjoy it. ‘I was due to come over to see it next week but now I will have mixed emotions. It’s a place where Julian spent so much time, love and money to make perfect, but he never got the chance to enjoy it.’ The tragic father, whose family pictures . were supplied to the Mail with the blessing of a close relative, bought . the boat as a treat for his children days before Saturday’s tragedy.

His father added: ‘It was a little pleasure trip, a few laps down the river and back and it all resulted in a terrible accident. ‘Julian was over-protective of his kids and for something like this to happen must have been agonising for him. ‘He spent whatever life he had left in himself trying to rescue those children.’ Mr Mynott senior described his son as a ‘one-off’ and a ‘wonderful husband and family man’.

Thousands of screaming fans mobbed Chelsea star Didier Drogba as he carried the Olympic flame through Swindon this afternoon. The footballer waved at supporters as he jogged through the town centre with the torch and many of those who turned out to see him were wearing Chelsea shirts. Drogba emerged from the pedestrianised Market Street where fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of the star. The footballer, who was the 84th torchbearer of the day, ran down Commercial Road in Swindon's bustling shopping district. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Footballer and flame: Didier Drogba with the torch as he carries it through Swindon . Mobbed: Many turned out to see the footballer who, yesterday, announced he would be leaving Chelsea . Running man: The footballer, who was the 84th torchbearer of the day, ran down Commercial Road in Swindon's bustling shopping district . The road was turned into a sea of blue, red and white from the hundreds of Union flags, balloons and football shirts. Drogba was flanked by police and security as he handed over the flame to Stephen Ratcliffe, chairman of Newlands Park, a community multi-sport venue owned by Cheltenham Rugby Club. As the two torches touched, spectators ran towards Drogba to get a photo of the footballer. He was then quickly whisked through the crowd into a silver car and driven away. While the footballer was whisked away, there was drama shortly after he had passed the torch on when a 16-year-old youth attempted to grab the flame as it passed. The teenager was rugby-tackled by a security guard after getting within 2ft of the torch as it made its way down Great Western Way in the town. The youth was then bundled into the crowd before he was chased down the street and detained by officers at the scene. A spokesman for the force revealed he was not arrested - but taken home to his parents and given a word of advice. Eyewitness Shauni Iles, 20, who was  watching the relay with sister Maddie, six, looked on in horror as the Olympic flame was almost seized by the rampaging yob. The sociology student, from Swindon, said: 'The guy came from the left of me and ran out into the road - he got about two-feet from the torch. Drama: This is the moment an unidentified youth attempted to attack the Olympic Flame as it passed through Swindon. The man was bundled into the crowd and detained by officers, before being given 'a word of advice' 'But a security guard tackled him and threw him back into the crowd - narrowly missing my sister. He landed on top of a four-year-old child. 'He then tried to run off but was eventually caught by police and arrested. It was a really shocking thing to witness - the torch was under attack.' Drogba, who plays for the Ivory Coast striker, scored the equaliser and then the winning penalty in Saturday's dramatic Champions League final win over Bayern Munich, announced yesterday he was quitting Chelsea to pursue his career elsewhere. He departs Stamford Bridge with his reputation as one of the club's greatest players firmly intact, but he knows it could have been so much different. Ever since the 34-year-old joined the club from Marseille in 2004 they have been chasing the European Cup and, after so many near misses, Drogba's final kick for them earned them the prize they coveted. Had he not have scored and had Bayern gone on to win, he admits he may have been tempted to stay but, with all his loose ends tied up, he is moving on to a new chapter. Explosive: The torchbearer is greeted by fireworks as they run across Bristol's iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge . Honour: Rebecca Pantaney carries the Olympic flame over the Clifton Suspension Bridge during the leg between Failand and Filton . Long way to go: After arriving it he UK last Friday, the Olympic Flame is now on day five of its 70-day relay . Speaking to Radio 5 Live, he said: 'I think winning the game was the key. Not me scoring the penalty. 'Winning the game was the turning point, that's why I have decided to say goodbye. 'We made the story together and I want people to remember that. This is the best time to move on. 'Yes, there's a chance that if the result was different, maybe I would be here. 'We were talking for many weeks, but the turning point was based on the fact I won everything I could and scored in most of the finals we have played, trying to make a difference. 'I hope everyone will understand. Everything I did was for the fans and I hope they understand.' Earlier today, the Olympic torch took a wrong turn in Bristol, delaying the relay by 10 minutes. However, once the convoy got back on track it sparked a spectacular fireworks display as the torchbearer passed over the city's iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge. The torch left the foggy streets of Bristol for North Somerset at 5.50am before travelling by convoy to visit Nailsea, Backwell and Flax Bourton. But as it returned to Bristol via Nailsea the convoy took a wrong turn in Failand. Moment to shine: John Shaw carries the Olympic flame on the leg between Bristol and Nailsea .

Ms Pantaney won badminton gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games as part of the women's team.Gasps could be heard from the crowd as people cheered and waved Union Flags. The display followed the torchbearer as she ran across the bridge to loud applause from spectators. The flame was handed over on the middle of the bridge, which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to Thomas Baker. A Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) spokesman said that when the mistake was made no torchbearers were running and the relay was in 'convoy mode'. They added: 'They missed a turning this morning between Nailsea and Failand. They realised straight away and rectified it. 'They were running 10 minutes late.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:59 EST, 8 September 2011 . Artery-opening brain stents that are designed to prevent repeat strokes in patients actually significantly increase them, scientists say. A large clinical trial found in the first month after treatment, . patients with the stents experienced more than twice the rate of strokes . and deaths compared to patients without them. The results prompted the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to stop enrolling people on the U.S-wide trial in April. Trial: Researchers followed 450 patients, half of whom were fitted with a brain stent . Now researchers are trying to . determine what caused the increase. Among the possibilities are blood clots forming on the . stents or breaking loose from blood vessel walls. Damage to blood . vessels during installation of the stents may also have been to blame. Dr Colin Derdeyn, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said: 'Further research may identify specific groups of patients who may . benefit from these stents, but for now we seem to be able to save more . lives by aggressively working to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.' The 450 patients in the study, who were treated in 50 medical centres, had recently had strokes or temporary stroke-like symptoms associated with significant narrowing of a major brain artery. This narrowing reduces blood flow in the brain and puts patients at high risk of additional strokes. All patients received blood-thinning drugs and aggressive treatments to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, two key risk factors for stroke. Half of the patients were randomly selected to receive the stents in 2008. A narrow brain artery (arrow, left) is treated with a stent (arrows point to each end). U.S researchers found they may actually increase the risk of strokes . The researchers found that nearly 15 per cent of patients treated with stents had a second stroke or died in the first 30 days after treatment, while less than six per cent in the control group had another stroke or died in the same time period. During a nearly one-year follow-up period, 20.5 percent of patients in the stent group and 11.5 percent of patients in the control group had a stroke or died. 'The complications on the stent side of the trial were higher than we expected,' Dr Derdeyn said. They said further research could show stents may still be the best treatment depending on whether the brain arteries were blocked with just plaque or plaque and blood. The only FDA-approved device dedicated . to blocked arteries in the brain is the Gateway-Wingspan system. This . technology allows physicians to open a blocked cranial artery by . inserting a balloon into the artery and inflating it. Doctors then . insert a stent to keep the artery open. Every year over 150,000 people have a stroke and it is the third largest cause of death. Stenosis, a blockage or narrowing of brain arteries caused by the buildup of plaques and clots, accounts for around 1 in 15 cases. The research was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine.",U.S trials halted after twice as many patients died in first 30 days after surgery compared to control group .

A U.S. congressional panel voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to turn in sensitive Justice Department documents after a grueling six hours deliberating on Capitol Hill. After the 23-17 party-line vote, the controversy will now be passed onto the full House of Representatives, which will vote on it next week, unless there is a resolution in the interim. In the case, the Obama administration invoked executive privilege for the first time since coming to office, withholding some documents related to a failed gun-running investigation. Decision made: After six hours of arguments and amendments, members on the Republican side of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee consider a vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress . Announcement: Republican Representative Darryl Issa,centre, delivers remarks to reporters after the committee approved a resolution holding Attorney General Holder in contempt of Congress . Attorney General Eric Holder talks to reporters after meeting with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa . The Republican-controlled House of . Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on a . party-line vote, decided to cite the nation's top law enforcement . officer in connection with the operation, code-named 'Fast and Furious.' The move set up a new confrontation between the Democratic president and Congress. House Speaker John Boehner and . Majority Leader Eric Cantor said if the requested documents were . submitted before that vote, it would provide an opportunity to resolve . the issue. In theory, an official charged with . contempt could be punished with a fine or jail, but no one expects it to . come to that. Weeks or months of controversy feeding into the . presidential election campaign is the more likely result. Republicans were already taking . advantage of the moment to portray the president as a participant in a . cover-up, just as congressional Democrats did when they fought with . President George W. Bush over that administration's refusal to turn over . documents relating to the dismissal of a group of federal prosecutors. 'Until now, everyone believed that . the decisions regarding 'Fast and Furious were confined to the . Department of Justice,' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker . Boehner. He added: 'The White House decision . to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were . either involved in the Fast and Furious operation or the cover-up that . followed.' Presidents since Richard Nixon have . claimed executive privilege to protect internal documents and . conversations in similar disputes with Congress with varying results, as . the courts have never given presidents any absolute authority to defy . subpoenas from Congress. Even before the vote, the White House criticized the panel chaired by conservative Representative Darrell Issa. President Obama has granted an 11th-hour request by Attorney General Eric Holder to exert executive privilege over the Fast and the Furious documents the Department of Justice has said . 'Instead of creating jobs or . strengthening the middle-class, congressional Republicans are spending . their time on a politically-motivated, taxpayer-funded election-year . fishing expedition,' White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer . told Reuters. Rep Issa and other Republicans on the . panel accused the Justice Department that Holder heads of stonewalling . and trying to protect its political appointees from potentially . embarrassing revelations about the botched gun-running probe. 'The frustration of this committee in not getting documents for a year and a half must be satisfied today,' Rep Issa said. The documents, requested by a House committee, explain how the . Justice Department learned that there were problems with the operation that . resulted in hundreds of guns illicitly purchased in Arizona gun shops . winding up in Mexico. In February 2011, when the controversy over the law enforcement operation was first disclosed, the department denied that agents had engaged in gun-walking. 'It’s a whole variety of material, and it’s consistent with what we have already made available — emails, documents of that nature — that really go into the way in which the department handled itself from February of 2011 until December of 2011,' Holder told reporters. The Justice Dept says that President Obama has exerted executive privilege over Fast and Furious documents after Attorney General Eric Holder made the personal request . Ordinarily, such deliberative documents are off-limits to Congress. In Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department’s initial incorrect denials are seen as providing justification for Congress’ document demands. Issa and the House Republican leadership have asked whether the department’s initial denial in a Feb. 4, 2011, letter to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation. The material 'pretty clearly demonstrates that there was no intention to mislead, to deceive,' Holder told reporters. 'The attorney general has made an unprecedented offer to turn over documents that are part of the Department of Justice’s internal deliberations and work product and to brief the committee on their contents,' said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the committee’s Democrats and a former federal prosecutor. 'Regrettably, Chairman Issa refuses to take yes for an answer.' 'We have offered to make materials available ... to brief on those documents, to answer any questions that might come up with regard to the documents that we produced,' the attorney general said. 'The ball’s in their court,' Holder said. 'We made what we thought was an extraordinary offer.' Issa took a different view: 'After this meeting I cannot say that I am optimistic' for avoiding a contempt vote. Attorney General Eric Holder (right) walks through Statuary Hall to speak to reporters following his meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday . Issa spokesman Frederick Hill said that at the meeting, 'the attorney general indicated he would only be willing to produce a subset of documents that numbered fewer than 1,300 pages if the committee would first agree that the production of these documents would end the committee’s investigation of the Justice Department.' Issa declined the offer. In a letter to Issa on Tuesday night, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said 'our offer would have provided the committee with unprecedented access to these documents, many of which are not covered by the committee’s subpoenas in this matter.' The White House move came in response to a planned vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for withholding the documents. The panel's chairman, Republican Darrell Issa, vowed to press on with the contempt charge. 'I write now to inform you that the president has asserted executive privilege over relevant ... documents,' Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote to the committee. Executive privilege allows the White House to argue that some private communications between the president and members of his administration cannot be divulged to Congress. 'This untimely assertion by the Justice Department falls short of any reason to delay today's proceedings,' Issa said. If the House panel votes to charge Holder with contempt, it would then be up to the full House to decide whether to bring that charge against the nation's top law enforcement officer. The process could take months or even years of court battles and further poison the political atmosphere in a presidential election year. For months, the committee and the Justice Department have been in negotiations over documents related to federal law enforcement's handling of the 'Fast and Furious' probe of guns heading from the United States into Mexico and then being used by Mexican drug cartels. President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege for the first . time Wednesday. He applied the presidential power to withhold documents a . House committee is seeking in an investigation of a flawed . gun-smuggling probe called Operation Fast and Furious. Presidents have the right to invoke executive privilege to preserve . the confidentiality of information and documents in the face of . legislative inquiries. The White House says presidents have asserted . that privilege 25 times since 1980. Here's a look at how many times each president since Ronald Reagan have asserted executive privilege: . President Barack Obama: 1 . President George W. Bush: 6 . President Bill Clinton: 14 . President George H.W. Bush: 1 . President Ronald Reagan: 3 .","House Committee found Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for 'Fast and Furious' documents .

The computer failure that has affected millions of NatWest customers for the past week meant one man who was unable to pay for bail had to spend an entire weekend in prison. Michael Brock, 25, appeared at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday charged with attempted rape, assault by penetration and indecent assault. He was granted bail on condition a surety, believed to be £25,000, was paid before his release. But the computer glitch meant the money was not transferred to the courts’ service bank account before closing time on Friday. A court official also tried to check it had been processed on Saturday but the payment had still not been made. A NatWest customer had to spend a weekend in a remand cell after he was unable to pay bail surety at Canterbury Crown Court . Millions of customers have been unable to carry out transactions following the technical problems faced by NatWest . Brock, from Canterbury, was finally allowed to leave custody on Monday on the bail condition he went to stay at an address in Ramsgate. In a separate case a defendant at . Westminster Magistrates' Court was released after a judge used his . discretion to grant bail despite a similar problem occurring. A spokesman for HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: “Defendants are released on bail once confirmation of the receipt of bail is received. 'We are aware of only two cases where there was a banking issue. We were advised of one case (at Canterbury) by barristers on Monday morning. 'It related to a case last Friday and court staff used their discretion to ensure that the defendant was released as soon as possible on Monday. 'In the second case (at Westminster . Magistrates Court) the judge made a judicial decision last Friday to . release the defendant given the circumstances.' Elsewhere, customers have been left unable to . pay bills, do their grocery shopping or make essential transfers since . Wednesday as a result of IT problems. Many . people went unpaid as a result of the error but they were able to go to . NatWest branches with proof of employment and given up to £300 to tide . them over. It is expected that it will take until . the middle of this week for all the problems to be rectified but for . many there will be an ongoing issue of having to contact their banks to . claim back any automatic charges incurred as a result of the problems. It was revealed last night that the . flawed computer programme was being supervised by an IT support team in . India and yesterday Stephen Hester, chief executive of . RBS, faced calls to forefeit his bonus over the fiasco. Last . February, RBS advertised for a series of key jobs, paying between . £9,000 and £11,000 a year, in the Indian city of Hyderabad, much less . than what an equivalent worker would be paid in Britain. The banking giant was urgently seeking . computer graduates with several years experience of using  CA-7, the . programme which the bank uses to run its vast network of transactions . and accounts. The job . advertisement said: 'Looking for candidates having 4-7 years of . experience in Batch Administration using CA-7 tool. Urgent requirement . by RBS.' But last night technology website The Register claimed that this software needed to be updated and this task was overseen from India by staff who are employed to work around the clock to solve any faults. RBS has been swift to deny that its controversial job out-sourcing programme has been responsible for the fiasco. It merely says that the 'software error occurred on a UK-based piece of software' but has declined to say where the staff overseeing the software are based. It is a fact that the vast computer servers are based in Britain. But insiders confirmed last night that many of their support team are based in India. Since being rescued by the taxpayer RBS has shed about 30,000 jobs, including more than 20,000 UK-based roles, and has outsourced work abroad. Some of its IT support teams are now said to be based in India, even though the under-fire banking group's headquarters remain in Edinburgh. The Unite union questioned whether the 'off-shoring' job cuts had left the bank unable to cope after the software failure. Last night insiders said problems began on Tuesday night when CA-7 was updated. On a normal evening, this should allow all the cashpoint withdrawals, salary transfers and direct debits to be updated. The nightly update is the reason why internet banking transactions made by so many customers are not updated if they are made after a certain time of the day. But what appears to have happened is that crucial files were deleted. The error was spotted but – incredibly – was repeated on Wednesday and again on Thursday. It was only on Friday morning that staff realised the full scale of the crisis. Urgent calls to India followed and troubleshooters were drafted in. The problem was that every single transaction that was waiting in the queue had to be reprocessed in strict order of arrival, causing further delays over last weekend. RBS has consistently denied that the decision to relocate jobs to India has made any difference to its handling of the situation. The IT support team for the failed computer program is based in Hyderabad, India . 'Out of touch': Outspoken Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott has said there should be . 'no question' of Stephen Hester, chief executive of NatWest parent RBS, . receiving a bonus from the state-controlled bank this year . But critics said that if the number of . UK-based support staff had been cut back, it would always run the risk . of problems if there was a major fault. Last night Computer Associates, which owns CA-7, declined to comment on what had caused the problem. The fiasco is believed to be the longest and most widespread problem of its kind since the advent of computer banking. Which? said it raised questions about how robust systems were at other banks. Britain's major banks have all faced criticism that they are reliant on . constantly grafting software updates on to their complex computer . systems rather than replacing the systems themselves. David . Bannister, the editor of Banking Technology magazine, told Channel 4 . News: 'What should have been a minor glitch has led to a pretty . disastrous cock-up.' He questioned why a back-up system did not appear to have been in place to protect the bank against a software failure. The executive directly responsible for the bank's IT systems is chief administrative officer Ron Teerlink. His pay and bonus are not disclosed because he does not sit on the main board, but he is understood to receive a six-figure package. Leading Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott accused the back of a 'monumental systematic failure' adding that there was 'no question' of Stephen Hester receiving an annual bonus from the state-owned bank - if he was allowed to keep his job. As well as his short-term bonus, Hester is also eligible for £7.9million of long term incentive awards over a number of years, provided he meets performance targets. Mr Hester took home more than £1.2million last year after he agreed to waive a £1.6million bonus following weeks of political pressure. But he cannot even guarantee that the crisis – which has led to a backlog of 100million transactions – will have been ironed out by the end of the week amid claims from insiders that the ‘priority incident’ is far from being resolved. Customers called for him to resign and accused RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, of repeatedly lying about fixing the computer fault which triggered the week of misery for the group’s 16.9million account holders.","Another judge uses his discretion to release inmate in similar circumstances .

Parents of a baby girl whose heart stopped for four minutes believe she came back to life thanks to her great-grandfather who died just five days before from a heart attack in the same cubicle. Eloise Wilmshurst was discovered by father Michael in her cot at the family home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, suffering a fit which left her fighting for breath. Michael and mother Charlotte dialled 999 and within minutes they were on board an ambulance as paramedics fought to save Eloise’s life. Family: Eloise seriously ill in hospital, and right with great-grandfather Bryan Spencer who died from a heart attack in the same cubicle just five days before Eloise was rushed to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital . The family arrived at Oxford’s John . Radcliffe Hospital just as her heart stopped and paramedic Kate Ellis . leapt from the vehicle to run inside with the lifeless child. In an agonising coincidence as doctors fought to save their daughter’s life, Mr and Mrs Wilmshurst . realised she was being treated in the same cubicle Michael’s . grandfather Bryan Spencer had suffered a fatal heart attack in just five . days before. But after four minutes Mrs Wilmshurst, 29, and Mr Wilmshurst, 31, were stunned as their little girl came back to life. In . less than 24 hours Eloise was awake and breathing on her own, shocking . doctors who said she wouldn’t be able to do so for at least two days. Relief: . Michael and Charlotte with baby Eloise whose heart stopped for four . minutes but she astounded doctors and came back to life. Now her parents think her great-grandfather was watching over her . Now, two weeks later, Eloise is back . home with her sister Abigail, five, and Mrs Wilmshurst said they . believed 100 per cent that Bryan was watching over her. Doctors . also said Eloise was the first baby to have been successfully . resuscitated after being brought in by ambulance suffering a cardiac . arrest in five years. Mrs . Wilmshurst said: 'Bryan was definitely watching over Eloise. We have had . a lot of heartache over the years, I think Bryan decided we weren’t . going to have any more tragedy. 'As Eloise was being resuscitated Michael was saying ‘not that cubicle’ as we knew it was where Bryan had suffered his heart attack but the team were obviously still working on her. Worry: Mrs Wilmshurst first realised . something was wrong as she and her husband heard a noise come from Eloise’s room (she's pictured the day before she fell ill, left, and right with big sister Abigail when she was born) 'That four minutes were a nightmare, I . was so upset my hands had frozen like claws. When she came back they . put her straight onto life support but early Sunday morning the . consultant would only tell us she was ‘a very, very poorly girl’. 'She . was supposed to be sedated and on a breathing tube until Monday at . least. I think her recovery surprised everyone, by Sunday afternoon they . were still trying to keep her sedated and on breathing apparatus but . she was having none of it, she was waking up and pulling out the tube. 'Finally about 5pm the consultant said . if she wants to wake she can wake up and over the next week she just . got stronger and stronger.' Mrs . Wilmshurst said she first realised something was wrong as she and her . husband sat in the family garden with friends and heard a noise come . from Eloise’s room at around 10pm on Saturday, August 18. She . said she discovered later Eloise had suffered from febrile convulsions - . a condition often triggered by and underlying infection causing the . baby’s body temperature to spike suddenly. The condition is quite common in young children but Eloise’s reaction was exceptional. Experts: Eloise was taken to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital where it took four rounds of CPR to revive her . She said: 'Babies cannot sweat like an . adult can and usually these convulsions pass without any ill effects, . it just happened that Eloise wasn’t so lucky. 'We . heard a noise from Eloise’s room, usually she knocks a toy in her cot . and it makes a sound when it hits the side, then she calls out because . she wants some milk. 'But . this time I thought ‘that’s odd she isn’t making a sound’, Michael went . upstairs to check on her and then shouted down ‘call 999’. - Around one in 50 children will have a febrile convulsion by the time they reach the age of five . - Children under five cannot regulate . their body temperature so the fits are a way of expending the heat . through the muscle and the skin . - A febrile convulsion is caused . by a rapid rise in a child’s temperature usually at the start of a . bacterial or viral illness. A child’s temperature may have reached 38.5C . or 39C but it is thought that the rate of rise, rather than the final . temperature, is more important. - During a febrile convulsion, a child . loses consciousness and becomes either stiff or floppy. They may stop . breathing briefly and their eyes can roll back. A child may be irritable . or sleepy after coming round. - It’s important to keep calm as most . convulsions pass without ill effect, however if the child is not . breathing normally after a convulsion, or if it lasts five minutes or . more, you need to get emergency help by dialling 999. 'Eloise . was grey, she was dribbling and fighting for breath, the ambulance was . there in under four minutes and we jumped in the back with Eloise.' Engineer Mr Wilmshurst said when he first saw his daughter he knew something was wrong. He said: 'She was struggling to breath, her eyes were glazed over and she was grey, it’s not a sight any parent wants to see. 'I . think Bryan was watching over her in hospital but we have to say a . massive thank you to all the doctors and paramedics who helped save her . life. 'I had said goodbye to Bryan on Monday and on Saturday Eloise was being treated in the same bed he had a massive heart attack in, it was a roller coaster of emotions. 'There was a moment when the machines stopped beeping when we realised they had got her back and they all did a fantastic job, not just the A&E but in intensive care afterwards.' Mrs Wilmshurst said when the ambulance arrived at A&E unusually there were four paediatric consultants on duty when normally there would be just one. As the ambulance pulled up Eloise’s heart stopped and Mrs Wilmshurst said paramedic and mother-of-two Kate Ellis ran inside carrying her to medics. Ms Ellis, from the South Central Ambulance Service, said it took four rounds of CPR to bring her back. She said: 'The minute we got to the house and saw Charlotte jumping up and down we knew something was wrong, when I ran into the house and picked Eloise up in my arms and knew she was very poorly and things were going down hill . 'In the ambulance on the way her jaw locked meaning it was hard to keep her airway open which was already partially blocked with saliva. 'She went into cardiac arrest as we arrived and as I ran into the hospital I was numb and in shock, we didn’t know if she would survive but we were greeted by no less than four consultants, a couple of specialist registrars and nurses and they went to work immediately. 'Febrile convulsions are relatively common but in 15 years in the job I have never seen a reaction like Eloise’s.'","Eloise Wilmshurst was found by her father in her cot suffering from a fit and fighting for breath .

When Abigail Lightbown suffered dramatic weight loss and was continually being sick, her parents feared she may have developed an eating disorder. They took the nine-year-old to see a GP, who could only suggest she may have been suffering acid reflux and gave her medication to ease the condition. It was not until seven months later, when the youngster fainted and underwent an MRI scan that the truth was discovered - she had one, possibly two, life-threatening brain tumours. By this stage she had lost 4kg. She had to undergo an emergency operation was given just a 50/50 chance of pulling through. Survivor: Abigail Lightbown, pictured with her mother Bernie, was wrongly diagnosed with an eating disorder when she in fact had two brain tumours . VIP visitors: Abigail in Royal Manchester Children's Hospital with her brother Jack and Manchester United Footballers Jonny Evans (far right) and Darron Gibson . Abigail, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, survived the operation in which 95 per cent of the tumour was removed and, now aged 11, recently completed a 48-week cycle of radiotherapy and . chemotherapy treatment. Her parents, Bernie and Gary Lightbown, heard Abigail throwing up every morning and feared she was deliberately making herself sick to look like 'stick-thin celebrities'. Mrs Lightbown, 34, said: 'At first I thought it . was down to travel sickness but at one stage she was throwing up every . morning. She was given acid tablets by her GP but they weren’t working. 'Her appetite started going - she was never a fussy eater and always had a fantastic appetite. 'I . took her to hospital to see a paediatric consultant and they were still . thinking along the lines of acid reflux. We would try and tempt her . with her favourite foods, but it just wasn’t happening. 'That’s when I . thought it was possibly an eating disorder. 'She . has never been image conscious, but I couldn’t think of any other . reason. I know how some girls are these days seeing all the celebrities . in magazines and on TV, and I tried to catch her out. 'We had rows about it and she would get really upset. I have since apologised.' Family ties: Abigail with her parents Bernie and Gary and her brother Jack . The truth of Abigail’s condition . finally emerged in January 2011 - five months after she first felt unwell - when she fainted in front of her father during a visit to her . grandmother’s house and claimed she had pins and needles in her legs. She . underwent an MRI scan at Bolton Royal Hospital and the family were told . a tumour - and possibly a second one - had shown up on the scans. In February 2011, Abigail underwent a seven-hour operation and then, starting in April that year, began chemo . treatment to ensure the remainder of the tumour was not active. Mrs Lightbown said: 'It . was when we met the oncology consultant I knew exactly what we were . dealing with. I just kept thinking, things don’t happen to . people like us. 'But Abigail took it really well. She wasn’t bothered . about the chemo and got really excited about the aspect of wearing all . sorts of different hats and wigs.' But despite losing her hair, Abigail has only worn a wig twice. She returned home in April last year and started a 48-week cycle of chemotherapy . treatment, with breaks in-between and continued physiotherapy. Local hero: Abigail meets Coronation Street star Antony Cotton, who plays barman Sean Tully in the soap . On holiday: Abigail and Jack at Niagara Falls in Canada in June 2010, two months before she started feeling ill . She went for her final dose of treatment in June this year, and she will receive regular check-ups from now on to ensure the tumour does not become active again. Her parents are now campaigning for greater awareness about brain cancer, one of Britain's biggest killers. Her father thinks Abigail could have been treated faster if there was more widespread knowledge about the disease's symptoms. Mr Lightbown said: 'Through our experience we just can’t believe how little money and effort goes into raising awareness about brain cancer and the symptoms. 'We honestly believed Abigail had an eating disorder. Yet brain tumours kill more women under the age of 35 than breast or any other cancer. It’s shocking, when you look at the campaigns that go on for breast cancer. 'We are so proud of her daughter. People don’t understand how inspiring and motivating she has been. 'We would have really struggled if she hadn’t been the way she is - she’s only worn her wig twice because she doesn’t the chemo get to her.'

Honeytrap: Mundill Mahil decided to 'play God' when she recruited the men to carry out the fatal attack on businessman Gagandip Singh . Three people were locked up today over the brutal killing of a TV executive who was beaten and left to die in a burning car. Gagandip Singh, 21, was lured to medical student Harvinder Shoker's university bedroom in Brighton after she said she wanted to talk to him but it turned out to be a honey trap. He was knocked unconscious by Harvinder Shoker and Darren Peters then bundled into the boot of a car that was driven to Blackheath, south east London, and set on fire. Shoker was today sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 22 years while Peters was given 12 years for manslaughter and Mahil was handed six years for grievous bodliy harm. It emerged during the trial that Mr Singh tried to rape Mahil six months before he died. She then confided in Shoker, known as Ravi, about the attempted sex attack, and he recruited Peters to help in the plot against Mr Singh. He did not know that Shoker and Peters were lying in wait in the bedroom, where he was viciously beaten. Once Mr Singh was unconscious, they wrapped him in a duvet and bundled him into the boot of the Mercedes he had been driving. They drove the car to Blackheath where it was set alight with Mr Singh still inside in February last year. Passing sentence, Judge Paul Worsley said: 'This was a tragic case. A promising young man of 21 years was burned to death.' Speaking to a tearful Mahil, he said: . 'He died in appalling circumstances. He was lured by you, Mundill, to . your student house in Brighton where you intended, as the jury have . found, that he suffered really serious harm. You had collected Ravi and . Darren from the railway station for that very purpose.' After the attempted sex attack, Mr Singh had bombarded Mahil with hundreds of text messages and phone calls. The judge went on: 'You, Mundill, had . decided that Gagandip Singh should be taught a lesson he would never . forget. Exactly six months to the day before his death in the very . bedroom where he was to be attacked, he had sexually assaulted you.' Final picture: Gagandip Singh, 21, caught on CCTV in a shop moments before he was murdered. His body was later found in the boot of a burnt out car . Harvinder Shoker (left) was sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 22 years while Darren Peters (right) was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter . Mahil's brother Harinder had . apparently encouraged her to do something about the assault, because she . did not want to go to the police. Judge Worsley said: 'Another brother . of yours, Harinder, encouraged you to do something about what had . happened to you. Otherwise nothing would have happened to Gagandip . Singh. That should long remain on his conscience.' He said Mahil 'showed no pity' when Mr . Singh called out her name as he was attacked, and added: 'You can be . manipulative, vengeful and deceitful.' 'Revenge': Mr Singh was attacked by the two men at Mahil's university home and driven away in a car that they set on fire . Addressing Shoker, he said: 'Besotted by Mundill, you were prepared to do whatever she asked and more. 'One witness spoke of your boast that you were prepared to go to prison for 21 years for the sake of Mundill.' He said the apprentice electrician had . gone 'far beyond' the planned attack and 'intentionally killed Gagandip . Singh in horrific circumstances'. Judge Worsley said he was satisfied . that Mr Singh was conscious in the boot of the car when Shoker and . Peters tied his hands with a satnav cable. Scientific evidence suggested he was unconscious when the car was set on fire. The judge told Peters that he had not . cared whether Mr Singh was alive when the car was set on fire, and after . the attack had 'callously' withdrawn £300 using Mr Singh's bank card as . his payment for going to Brighton that night. Mahil, 20, from Chatham, . Kent; Shoker, 20, from Greenwich; and Peters, 20, from Blackheath, were all sent to . young offenders institutions. Mr Singh was the owner of a new . broadcasting service called Sikh TV, and also helped in his family's . successful packing business. The court was read a victim impact . statement from his mother Tajinder, which said: 'As a mother, I can't . even begin to find the words to express the great loss I feel. When I . first learned of Gagandip's death, I was completely and utterly broken.' It went on: 'Since Gagan's death I . fell like my heart has completely broken. They have taken not only a son . from me but a source of joy in my day. My family now consists of only . my daughter Amandip and I. I always think how different our lives could . be with Gagandip still in them.' She and Mr Singh's sister have attended every day of the Old Bailey trial. Mrs Singh said of the three . defendants: 'Any one of them could have shown some compassion to my son . and stepped forward and stopped the assault on him.' His sister said in her statement: 'He . was a constant source of support in my life, emotionally and . practically. Since his death I have felt utterly adrift and often . incapable of coping with the grief of his death.' Scene of death: Singh was driven to a quiet alley in Blackheath, south east London, where the car he was in was set alight and he was left to die . The family have already suffered the loss of Mr Singh's father, who was murdered in India. 'I have no other siblings and the thought of visiting my father's grave alone makes me feel very lonely,' Miss Singh said. Describing the ordeal of the trial, . which began on November 28, the day after her birthday, she said: 'I had . to see the three defendants and to listen to their lies made me so . angry, but I had to remain calm and strong for my mum. I tried to . remember Gagandip from the CCTV shown in court.' She said she saw him 'burnt and unrecognisable lying in the funeral director's'. 'The sight comes to my mind so often . that I feel like I've been robbed of my memories of my brother and I . have to think of the good things in order to push these visions of his . burnt body out of my mind.' In mitigation, Michael Birnbaum QC said Mahil was of 'extraordinarily good character'. He said: 'She has had support from some members of her community but she has faced a barrage of vitriolic abuse from others.' Mr Birnbaum explained that she had . suffered a 'barrage of hate-driven abuse', and that Sikh TV ran a . campaign that she should not get bail at a directions hearing last July. Pretty: Mahil, left, and Singh, right, met online in 2009 and the 21-year-old man became infatuated with her . Demonstrators gathered outside the Old Bailey and some shouted 'death to Mahil' in Punjabi. Mr Birnbaum said: 'There will be some . in her community who will always hate her and will regard her, albeit . wrongly, as the girl who got away with murder.' He told the court she had been the . victim of a serious sexual assault by Mr Singh and criticised a . statement by Detective Superintendent Damian Allain after verdicts were . given, which suggested Mahil had 'portrayed herself as a victim'. 'She was and remains a victim of . sexual abuse both physical and mental and it's astonishing that the . superintendent does not recognise that,' Mr Birnbaum said. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said of Shoker: 'He is immature, he is naive, he is no intellectual giant.' She said he had 'true feelings of deep . sympathy' for Mr Singh's family and Mahil had 'held him in her thrall' and sometimes ridiculed him in private texts. Richard Barraclough QC, for Peters, . said: 'Darren Peters was not part of the plan to beat or kill Gagandip . Singh. He didn't know when he went to Brighton that Gagandip Singh was . to be beaten or kidnapped or killed.' He said that Peters was involved only . at the end of the attack when the car was set alight, and had travelled . to Brighton because threats were made against his father. He also expressed 'deep sorrow' for the victim's family.","Mundil Mahil lured Gagandip Singh to her room saying she wanted to talk to him .

Trainee chef Daniel Stringer-Price, 17, quit his college course, suffers double vision and is afraid to go outside on his own, after the unprovoked attack earlier this year. He was left for dead, bleeding and barely conscious, after up to eight men kicked and punched him repeatedly in the head. Bloodied and bruised: Daniel Stringer-Price, 17, was beaten up by a group of eight men in an unprovoked attack . His best friend, Kavan Brown, 17, also suffered a broken nose during the assault in Hyde, Greater Manchester, on February 4.

Proud: Princess Eugenie pictured on Tuesday following a service of thanksgiving to mark her grandmother's 60 years as Queen . Princess Eugenie has told how her grandmother the Queen would have found the final two days of the Diamond Jubilee 'quite testing' without Prince Philip by her side. The Duke of Edinburgh was taken ill on Sunday with a bladder infection, after standing for hours in the teeming rain as the Jubilee River Pageant made its way along the Thames. Nevertheless, the princess described her grandparents as a 'power couple who kind of astound people' as she gave the first interview by a royal following the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Princess Eugenie, 22, told Sky News: 'To see Granny and Grandpa standing for four hours, I mean, together, they are invincible. 'They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other. Grandpa was unfortunately taken ill and for Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock really and she is his.' Yesterday afternoon Princes William and Harry visited the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital after the Palace confirmed he won't be be out in time celebrate his 91st birthday at home tomorrow. Philip had been planning to celebrate privately with his family and was not due to attend his next scheduled engagement until Tuesday, when the Queen hosts a garden party at the Sandringham Estate. His sudden illness marred the Queen's celebrations, but Princess Eugenie nevertheless described the four days of national celebrations as an 'unbelievable experience that will forever stay with me.' 'To see the showing that people gave (The Queen) is just unfathomable for me. I just think it's unbelievable and it makes me so proud,' she told Sky News. Eugenie and her sister, Princess Beatrice, travelled the length of Sunday's river pageant with their father, the Duke of York, aboard the historic Havengore barge.

Princess Eugenie also told Sky News that one of her highlights of the Jubilee celebrations was the pop concert in front of Buckingham Palace.

A cigarette case presented by the world’s most famous crime novelist Agatha Christie to the saxophonist who found her after she disappeared in 1926 is expected to fetch £10,000 at auction. The beautiful silver box was given to musician Bob Leeming as a thank you from the author after he spotted Agatha at a hotel in Yorkshire. Leeming’s sighting brought to an end 11 days of frantic searching for the troubled writer who had vanished from her sprawling Devon home on December 3. Thank you present: Agatha Christie gave saxophonist Bob Leeming this beautiful cigarette holder after he found her at a hotel in . Yorkshire following her disappearance in 1926. It is engraved with the . words 'With best wishes Col. & Mrs Christie' Valuable: The King George V cigarette box is expected to fetch £10,000 when it is auctioned at Sotheby's in London next month . The woman famed for scribing gripping whodunits had left authorities scratching their heads about her whereabouts and efforts to find her involved a reported 500 officers, tracker dogs, dredging water courses and even an aeroplane. In the end she was discovered holed up at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Yorkshire on December 14. The King George V case is inscribed with the words: 'With our best wishes, Col. & Mrs Christie' and has been passed on through several generations of the Leeming family.

Now the highly sought after item is going under the hammer at Sotheby's auction house in London on July 10 and is expected to fetch a staggering £10,000.

Archie’s announcement that he had fallen for another woman, Nancy Neele, . and that he wanted an immediate divorce brought her further pain. The pair . separated, but had a temporary reconciliation which Agatha later said was a ‘mistake’ that led to ‘a period of sorrow, misery and heartbreak.’ It is these factors which are thought . to have led to Agatha’s disappearance. The writer claimed she . remembered nothing about how she arrived in Harrogate, Yorkshire. She eventually divorced her husband in 1928 before going on to marry archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan in 1930. In . 2006, biographer Andrew Norman, in his study of the writer's life, . claimed that when she went disappeared Agatha was in the grip of a . rare medical condition named 'fugue state' and was in a trance for . several days.

Shot dead: Gang member Joseph Thompson who was ambushed and had up to nine bullets sprayed at him in the early hours of today . A feud between rival gangs responsible for the murder of schoolboy Rhys Jones is feared to have erupted with the killing of a crimelord in Liverpool. Joe Thompson, 30, had been a leading member of the notorious Strand gang which runs underworld drugs rackets in the Norris Green area of the city. The father was shot dead in the early hours of this morning while a 27-year-old man was also left fighting for life. The double shooting is thought to be a turf war between the Strand and rivals Crocky Crew who were blamed for the 2007 murder of Rhy Jones, 11. The gunman, who was carrying a handgun, blasted up to nine shots at Thompson and an unnamed friend during an ambush. The second victim was today being treated at University Hospital, in Aintree, where his condition was described as 'critical'. Armed police were today patrolling the notorious estate following the killing. The street of semi-detached homes was sealed-off by today as officers were carrying out house-to-house inquiries. Schoolboy Rhys Jones was murdered as he walked home from football practice in Croxeth, Liverpool, by Sean Mercer who fled the scene on a bicycle. The clans have, in the past, waged 'turf' war against each other which resulted in the death of eleven year old Rhys. In 2006 Thompson was identified by police as one of the leading members of the Strand gang. Together with the Darren Smith, the brother of murdered gang member Liam 'Smigger' Smith, he was given an ABSO aimed at disrupting his activities. Thompson's son today left a tribute to his father at the scene of the shooting, saying: 'RIP dad GBNF (gone but not forgotten)'. Underneath, he had drawn a heart. One local resident, aged 59, said: . 'It used to be a nice neighbourhood but now it’s ruled by thugs. I heard . a couple of shots at about 1am and it woke me up. The next thing we . knew the area was filled with police. Probe: Police cordon off the scene in Norris green, Liverpool, after one man was shot dead and a second man was left seriously injured . Tragic: Rhys Jones, 11, who was shot dead in Liverpool in 2007 after being caught in the crossfire . 'Thompson’s a known name around here . and it is a gang area but the child’s message is heart rending. I just . want to get away as soon as I can I’ve already put my house up for sale.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Emergency services were called to Ravensthorpe Green at about 1am to a report that two men had been injured after being shot at in the street. 'On arrival officers found a man, believed to be in his 30s, who was declared dead at the scene by paramedics and a man, who is believed to be in his 20s, with a gunshot injuries. 'The injured man was taken to hospital by ambulance for treatment. At this time his condition is described as being critical. 'The scene has been cordoned off, house-to-house enquiries are under way and high- visibility patrols have been stepped-up in the area. 'The motive for the shooting is not yet clear and officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. 'An investigation to establish the full circumstances of the incident is in hand.' Local councillor Barry Kushner said: 'This is a shocking and appalling act of violence. It’s been quiet over the last 12 months. Crime has gone down and we’ve had a reduction of serious crime in the area. Investigation: A man opened fire with a handgun in Norris Green, Liverpool, shortly before 1am. Today a white forensic tent had gone up as a probe was launched . Tribute: Flowers are left at the scene for Joe Thompson, aged in his 30s, who was shot dead . 'What we want is for people to help with the police’s inquiry and to provide information. In terms of using words like ‘gang’ it is giving credibility to these people where it is not in any way deserved. We are talking about a tiny, small criminal element that you get in most areas. 'Of course people are worried, it is a natural response but there will be a greater police presence in the area. I’m comfortable that with the police presence there will not be a retaliation. 'There has been shootings across Liverpool over the last year and we are trying to improve his area with security and will be holding a meeting tomorrow in light of the events to give confidence to the community. 'People should not be carrying guns, especially in an area where there are children. People should not have to deal with this.'

A long-running dispute between two brothers over conifers erupted in violence when one of the warring siblings hit the other in the face with a small potted tredd. Richard Hewson, 68, would not even speak with younger brother Geoffrey, 64, but one day when he spied him planting trees on communal land near his manor house he snapped. The wealthy retired sales executive picked up one of the juvenile saplings and hit his brother in the face - causing a split lip, cut to his ear and another between his eyebrows. The squabbling siblings live opposite each other in two beautiful homes in the picturesque Landford Manor, near Salisbury. Geoffrey Hewson stands outside his home (right) next to the trees which he planted. His brother, Richard, lives in the house to the left . Richard bought the manor home and coach . house in 2003, converting the main building into three separate . dwellings and sold the other property to Geoffrey. However they fell out over a series of family issues, including the will of . their mother, who died in 2004. The warring pair do not speak despite sharing the same driveway, eventually came to blows on November 19, 2011. Salisbury Magistrates' Court heard Richard Hewson had been in a long-running dispute about the trees with his brother Geoffrey, who lives in a cottage opposite the manor. Geoffrey Hewson moments after he claims he was hit by his brother . Geoffrey, a retired businessman . and property developer, admitted he had not discussed his planting plans . with Richard over fears he would become 'confrontational'. Richard was angry about the trees because he claimed it would restrict access to his drive for his tractor and trailer. Salisbury Magistrates Court was told that Richard Hewson had discovered Geoffrey had been consulting residents of the manor estate about the trees - without notifying him. Geoffrey told the court his brother . approached him when he was planting the trees, picked one up and hit him . in the face with it. He . claimed the tree had a stake in the bottom of it which split his lip and . he also suffered a cut to his ear and between his eyebrows. Hedge dispute: Richard Hewson's house Landford Manor is pictured on the left, while his brother Geoffrey lives in the house to the right .

But Richard denied the allegation and said he had picked up a tree and thrown it in his brother’s direction, but it did not hit him. He said Geoffrey, who lives with wife Carol, 63, rugby tackled him to the ground and the injuries were caused by gravel as they grappled on the floor. The pair were eventually pulled apart by a neighbour with both later reporting the incident to the police. Geoffrey Hewson stands outside his home. The squabbling siblings live opposite each other . Richard was arrested and refused to accept a police caution with the case going to Salisbury Magistrates who found him guilty of assault. He was handed a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £300 costs. Speaking at their beautiful countryside homes in Wiltshire, the two feuding brothers continued their war of words. Geoffrey said his 'ignorant' brother 'thrust' him in the face with one of the trees. He said: 'I wanted to tidy up the area and asked the community chairman if I could plant the trees. I did it for everyone’s benefit. 'Then, as I was doing it I looked around and I had the tree thrust in my face, putting me on the ground. I know how to defend myself so I kicked his legs away and he came down to my height and we were on the floor. 'I restrained him which isn’t easy when you have a lung infection and a neighbour helped me up. I had a cut lip, cut ear and broke my watch. 'I called the police and they arrived two hours later. The CPS got involved because he refused to take the caution. He should have put his hands up and said he lost his rag. 'It is so sad at his age, he could have easily had a word about it but he didn’t. He’s so ignorant and everyone in the community keeps the same view.' But Richard firmly stood by his defence, describing the case as a 'serious miscarriage of justice' and claiming locals have ganged up on him and wife Christine, 67, trying to force them out. He denies hitting him with the tree, instead saying he threw a tree towards his brother with Geoffrey then charging at him before they 'grappled' on the floor. Richard also claims Geoffrey suffered the injuries as they rolled around the floor like two schoolchildren in a playground. He also branded Geoffrey 'a liar' and regrets selling the coach house to his brother in the first place. However, he received a six-month conditional . discharge and ordered to pay £300 costs after being found guilty of . assault by magistrates in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Furious at the verdict, Richard said: 'What they were saying in court is not what was said in their witness statements. I didn’t hit him. I’ve never laid a finger on anybody. My brother is a liar. He’s lied forever. 'His statements to police and as a witness contradicted each other. On the stand he said he had difficulty bending down but he managed to build a low brick wall. 'For me, my whole life has been about honour and trust and as a salesman I used to agree £12 million deals all around the world with the shake of a hand. 'We had a barrister for the case and he was fuming when the magistrate found me guilty. This is a terrible miscarriage of justice.' Richard’s wife Christine added: 'This has caused us a great sense of wrong and injustice. Richard has never hit me or the children and I cannot believe he would harm anyone other than in self-defence. 'Geoffrey says he feels intimidated and unable to move freely around Landford following the so-called assault. Geoffrey is not the only one to feel intimidated. We have been thoroughly hurt by the whole incident. 'A police officer made the comment to my daughter that perhaps the boys should have their heads knocked together. It should have been left at that.' Richard, who has now installed CCTV at his property in case any further incidents happen, claimed his brother had got everyone in the area on his side to force him out.

Rielle Hunter says the first time she slept with John Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life.' Lurid details continue to emerge about the affair that annihilated the two-time presidential candidate's political career as Hunter's tell-all memoir slowly leaks to the public. The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina Senator, he called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero sleep.' Scroll down for video . Together: John Edwards in pictured in New Orleans in this December 2006 photo with Rielle Hunter, who worked as a videographer for the campaign . First night: Hunter slept with Edwards within hours of meeting him at an event at the Regency Hotel in New York City in February 2006 . Hunter claims she wrote the book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. However, the former campaign videographer seems to leave little to the imagination about her sex life. The book is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.' Hunter says she caught Edwards' eye at the hotel when she followed him out of a reception and said, 'You are so hot.' Hours later, she got a call from him inviting her to his room. She claims she went only because she thought she could give Edwards advice for his presidential campaign. But that all changed the moment she was alone behind closed doors with 'her Johnny.' 'The connection I felt when I walked in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge and unstoppable,' Hunter writes, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online. Speaking up: Rielle Hunter, with her daughter Quinn, speaks to Chris Cuomo for 20/20 . Shot at redemption: After his acquittal on campaign finance violations last month, John Edwards pledged to rebuild his public image . 'And then a moment came while we were talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.' But Hunter says she didn't give in easily to sleeping with a married man -- it took Edwards telling her a story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first night they met. 'He told me that he had an entire hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online. 'Clearly, this behavior of his was not going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. He needed this safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been that way, something happened between us.' In the public eye: Hunter's affair with John Edwards which resulted in their daughter Quinn, cost the former senator his bid for the White House . Under siege: Elizabeth Edwards, pictured here three months before she died of cancer, is called abusive and 'venomous' by Hunter . But Edwards did lie to Hunter. He lied that night about the three other mistresses -- and used the lie to manipulate her for five years. He didn't come clean about his love life until 2011, she says. Edwards had two other mistresses, he said, but both those affairs ended before his 2004 bid to become Vice President. Hunter, 48, says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine as she pursued an acting career in New York. But she got past drug abuse before she turned 30 and replaced it, she claims, with a quest for 'spiritual growth.' The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship. Hunter . attacks Edwards' wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, . calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women. Other accounts of the 2008 . presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John . Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth . Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. She . says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say . Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential . candidate. Hunter . repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and . Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that . the baby was not his. He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two. Hunter's book is a window into the life of a political mistress. Tell-all: In an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air on Friday, Rielle Hunter describes her life as a political mistress . Major . New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book, . citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a . Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books. She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail.

Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts . She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened.

A postal worker who was sliced almost in half by a chainsaw-wielding madman in a New York City subway station six years ago has forgiven his attacker but will face contractors in court this week for leaving the dangerous tools lying around. In scenes straight out of the film 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', Michael Steinberg, now 70, was carved into by the demented Tareyton Williams while he was waiting for a train at the 110th and Broadway station in the early morning of July 6, 2006, on his way to work. Mr Steinberg survived the bloodbath, although the two power saws, called Sawzalls, sliced through his ribs and punctured his lung. Victim: Michael Steinberg, pictured after the attack, will face contractors Five Star Electric Corp. in court on Tuesday . He told The New York Post . he has never recovered from the horrific attack and is desperate to . finally face the people he holds responsible - the Transit . Authority-hired contractors Five Star Electric Corp. - in court on . Tuesday. 'Nobody should suffer like I’m suffering. I’m a nervous wreck. I cry, I have dreams. Emotionally, I’m like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It’s had a profound effect on my life,' Mr Steinberg told the newspaper. 'I’m not angry with the man that attacked me. He was a sick man. I forgive him. What I do hold a grudge about, because people should be accountable, are the contractors who had been working in the subway and let him pick up these hacksaws they left unattended.' On the night of the attack, Mr Williams calmly walked towards the 4-foot-11 Mr Steinberg with the two chainsaws and began cutting into his chest. The elderly New York native begged his attacker to stop carving, offering him cash and credit cards, but he ignored the pleas. Finally he stopped, said 'now I will take your credit cards and your money' and walked calmly out of the station. At the time, Mr Steinberg told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help. Subway: The postal worker was in the 110th and Broadway station on his way to work when he was attacked with two chainsaws . 'I screamed for help. 'Please help! Please help me!' The ... people (construction workers) heard me. They just looked. They never stopped to help me, and that disturbed me more than anything else. I begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me,' he explained. '...I was bleeding everyplace. No transit employee ever came over to me to see how I was doing. They just kept doing their job. That's what upsets me more than anything else. There were at least six of them there, and they could have gotten him off me. It's a sad commentary on how people just don't give a damn.' Doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper, the postal worker would have been dead. Mr Williams was arrested after punching a man walking his dog later that day and pleaded guilty to senseless assault. Before being sentenced to 18 years in . prison, he told Mr Steinberg he was sorry and the Morningside Heights . man accepted the apology. Dangerous: Mr Steinberg claims the contractors are responsible because they left the chainsaws lying on the station (file photo) But Mr Steinberg hasn't forgiven the Transit Authority or Five Star Electric Corp. who he said have never apologised for allowing the near fatal attack to take place. Mr Steinberg sued both for unspecified damages for his physical and emotional injuries but the TA was let off due to governmental immunity. According to The Post, the civil trial against Five Star begins on Tuesday and Mr Steinberg, who was forced to quit his job with the post office in 2009, plans on telling the Manhattan courtroom how the attack ruined his life. 'I dream about this incident. I do ride the train, but I’m petrified until I get out. If somebody bumps into me, I scream,' he told the newspaper. 'I had 42 years on the job and I loved my job but I just couldn’t get on the subway anymore.' According to court documents, Five Star insists it didn’t do anything wrong and that Mr Williams’ actions couldn’t have been predicted.","Michael Steinberg, now 70, suffered sliced ribs and a punctured lung after a madman came at him with two chainsaws that were left on the platform .

Members of Take That invested £26million in a scheme that HM Revenue & Customs believes is designed to avoid tax, it was claimed last night. Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and their manager, Jonathan Wild, are among 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships in music industry investment schemes that act as tax shelters for wealthy individuals, according to The Times. HMRC is attempting to shut down the partnerships, run by a company called Icebreaker Management Services, at a tax tribunal in November. Barlow – who was recently made an OBE – and company could face paying back millions of pounds if it is successful. 'Seeking haven': Fellow Take That stars Mark Owen (left) and Howard Donald (right) are also said to have invested in the scheme, which HM Revenue & Customs is attempting to shut down . A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘We do not . accept that the Icebreaker tax schemes have the tax effects their . promoters claim.’ They said one Icebreaker scheme had already been . successfully challenged. Icebreaker . denied that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax. It said they . were intended to invest money in the music industry for profit by . producing ‘creative and artistic material and [creating] taxable . profits’. 'Taking shelter': Take That member and X Factor judge Gary Barlow (pictured) is one of 1,000 people who have contributed £480million in partnerships in investment schemes designed to avoid tax, it has been claimed . Companies House records show that the three Take That members and their manager joined two Icebreaker partnerships in March 2010 and September 2011. In the first, they put in £5.2million of their own cash and borrowed another £20.8million. The partnership registered a loss in the year to April 2010 of £25.2million, which accounts show as ‘available for discretionary division among members’. According to The Times, Matt Hodson, working on behalf of Icebreaker, told an undercover reporter that the men had also invested in a second partnership, which has not yet filed accounts. Lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, Owen and Mr Wild said the men had paid significant amounts of tax. They confirmed that their clients were investors in the two partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes. There is no suggestion that other members of Take That were investors – and it is not known whether those that did were aware of the tax benefits when they invested in the partnerships. But the revelation comes after it emerged that comedian Jimmy Carr is one of thousands using a legal off-shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax. Carr, who has publicly mocked tax avoidance schemes, is believed to be the largest beneficiary of a Jersey-based accountancy arrangement said to shelter £168million a year from the taxman. He puts away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme, which is used by more than 1,000 tax avoiders, it was claimed. K2 works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based trust, which lends investors back the money. Because the loan can technically be recalled, it is not subject to income tax. A typical Icebreaker partnership . collects around £10million from about a dozen investors and uses the . funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists. Icebreaker . can help investors to save more in tax than they put into the scheme . with losses being offset by a wealthy investor against other income . earned during the previous three years. Investors can bump up this tax relief by taking out offshore loans arranged by Icebreaker. For . a minimum investment of £40,000 into an Icebreaker partnership, boosted . by an offshore loan of £160,000, a member can generate £77,520 of tax . relief. A person who invests £200,000 in cash can earn £1million tax free.","Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen have put money in 'music industry investment schemes'

Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. There are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year, but 20 to 25 percent of victims die.","Aimee Copeland, 24, was pictured for first time since on Saturday having her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated .

"By . Suzannah Hills . CREATED: . 14:21 EST, 5 July 2012 . Victim: Catherine Wynter was stabbed to death . A teenage babysitter was stabbed to death on Boxing Day by her secret boyfriend who tried to pin the blame for the murder on a fictitious person he created on Facebook, a court heard today. Art student Catherine Wynter, 19, was found in a pool of blood by her mother after being stabbed multiple times while babysitting her young niece and nephew in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Karate teacher Tony Bushby, who began dating Miss Wynter after they met at West Hertfordshire College, was arrested by police but insisted one of his friends had carried out the murder. St Albans Crown Court was told Bushby made up the identities of four people and created false Facebook accounts for them on social networking site Facebook. It was one of these characters he accused of murdering Miss Wynter. Prosecutor Michael Speak told the court Bushby had used these fake identities to get closer to Miss Wynter and to trap her 'in a web of malicious deception'. The profile pages of Dan Tress, Cyn Darwin, Shane Pleuon and Krystal Stanguard featured photographs Bushby had found on the internet. He then contacted Miss Wynter through the four identities, who had no idea they were not real people - using them to  impress Miss Wynter by saying flattering things about himself. The prosecutor said: 'He systematically tricked Katy over a period of time into believing that she was in contact via Facebook, not only with the defendant, but also with a small circle of his close friends. 'In fact, this small circle of Facebook friends was entirely fictitious. They were all people the defendant had invented. They did not exist.' When arrested by police, Bushby, also 19, claimed Dan Tress murdered Miss Wynter. On trial: Tony Bushby is accused of murdering Catherine Wynter and then blaming it on a fictitious character . Tragedy: Catherine Wynter was found stabbed to death by her mother in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire . Mr Speak added: 'I should be blunt about it - that is total nonsense. Dan Tress did not exist. 'He was a figment of the imagination . of the defendant’s disturbed imagination. These are four fictional . identities created by the defendant.' The court heard how Miss Wynter, . known as Katy, had been stabbed repeatedly and had 23 wounds on her . body, including 13 serious stab injuries. The jury was told how Miss Wynter . agreed to babysit for her sister Sabrina while she spent Boxing Day . night with her boyfriend and his parents. Her mother Joy Davies went to check on her just after 8am on December 27 last year and saw blood on the front door. Ray of sunshine: Miss Wynter was a promising artist who was expected to graduate this year . Cordoned off: A forensic expert combs the driveway of the house for clues as a police officer stands guard . Mr Speak said: 'She had just gone round to make sure that everything was OK. 'When she got to her daughter . Sabrina’s front door she noticed, and of course it was immediately . unsettling, what she thought might be blood on the front door and she . saw that a light was on upstairs in her daughter’s house. 'She got in and she was immediately met by Sabrina’s two young children, and they are very young, just three and four-years-old. 'They came running down the stairs and they said together: ‘Grandma, Grandma, Katy’s dead’.' An ambulance was called but Miss Wynter was already dead. Tributes: Friends and neighbours started leaving flowers with police officers at the scene of the stabbing . Heartbreak: Flowers marked for 'Darling Katy' are left at the scene in tribute to Miss Wynter . Her mother said she was aware her daughter was in a relationship, but added that the boyfriend seemed to be 'a bit of a secret'. The court was told Bushby, 19, had . returned to his nearby home with blood on his clothes and hands after . murdering Miss Wynter during the evening. When police officers went to the . house Bushby shared with his mother to speak to him, he denied Miss . Wynter was his girlfriend. He was taken to a police station and arrested . upon arrival. It was then he tried to pin the blame on one of the personalities he created on Facebook, the prosecution claim. Bushby, of Digswell Close, Borehamwood, denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Pamela Owen . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 12 September 2011 . 'Killed over conkers': Steven Grisales, 21, died from a single knife wound to heart after telling youngsters to stop chucking conkers at him . The mother of a 21-year-old who was attacked after he asked a group of youths to stop pelting him with conkers has described her son as perfect and said he always respected others. Jasmid Grisales, 43, said she was devastated that her son would now not be able to fulfil his dream of becoming an architect. She also said she had brought her children up to be respectful of others and said parents with little or no money should stop blaming the government and start teaching their children the difference between right and wrong. 'I see people saying, ""Our children have nothing, they cannot do anything but go to the streets"". That is not true. 'Steven went to karate, to other extra clubs, I count my pennies to pay. People say it's the Government's fault. It's not, where are the parents? I've been doing my bit, teaching my children to do right.' Mrs Grisales said she was trying to stay strong for her three other children, Nicole, 11, Isabella, six, and 2-year-old Alexander but found it difficult to believe her son would not be coming home. Describing him as a 'funny, caring and respectful boy' she explained how he would regularly call her if he spotted a building he loved. Brought up in a quiet area of Enfield, Steven had won an architectural scholarship at Westminster College and would have been due to enrol the day he died. After helping his grandmother with her weekly shop, he ate one of her Colombian dishes and called home to say he was on his way. He was due to stay at her house but had forgotten his passport which he needed so that he could register at college the following day. Tragically, he was stabbed in the heart near Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, North London, after he asked a group of people to stop pelting him with conkers. His mother, who said she moved here 20 years ago to escape this type of violence, said her son had just returned from Argentina where he had been working with his father for the past four years. An outstanding and determined pupil he had obtained his GCSEs and A Levels so he could get a degree. Heartbroken: Jasmid Grisales and her husband Andres visit the site where their son, who was going to do his grandmother's shopping, was senselessly killed . The area in North London is becoming notorious for this type of violence and on Wednesday night, another teenager was killed near to the same spot where Steven was stabbed. The teenage boy, known locally by his nickname Andre . ‘Yardie’, is in a serious but stable condition. He was also walking to the same train station when he was pounced upon at about 6.50pm in College Close, Edmonton. A witness said: ‘Yardie seemed to be arguing in the playground with another boy. One called the other “moist”.’ Another witness said: ‘He isn’t the sort of guy who would start trouble. He isn’t in a gang.’ Two people have been arrested over the stabbing, Scotland Yard said. Detectives were said to be 'unaware' of any link with the murder Steven. Just an hour after the teenager was attacked, a man in his 50s was knifed in nearby Victoria Road, the BBC reported. Last month, Leroy James, 14, was stabbed to death in a nearby playground in a suspected territorial dispute between gangs. Steven's grieving . father Andre wept at the scene of his eldest child's death as he said . he could not understand why his son was killed and said it would not have happened in Colombia where the family live and he works. Dangerous: College Close in Edmonton in North London. The red ring shows where a 15-year-old was stabbed and the nearby blue ring shows where Steven Grisales was killed in an alleged row over conkers last week . Yards apart: A teenager was stabbed close to where 'good boy' Stephen Grisakes was attacked . A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder and has appeared in court, while another boy, also 15, has been questioned. A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl have already been arrested and released on bail. Mr Grisales, with his heartbroken wife . Jasmid, described Steven as a 'good boy' who had done nothing wrong . before he was stabbed. The aspiring architect, who was born . in Britain but whose parents are Colombian, had returned to the UK three . and a half weeks ago from Argentina. His father has been working there . and the teenager was spending time with him. Mr Grisales said his son did not drink or smoke and was not into gangs. He said: 'It's devastating for all of us, the whole family - aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles - back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it. We don't understand. Without a reason, without nothing.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: . 'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at . the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station. 'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.' Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male. A . local resident heard Steven scream and ran outside to try and help, but . the injuries were so severe she was powerless to save him. Floral tributes were left on College Close, near to the murder scene . A resident said: ‘All the kids carry knives. I see them playing with them like they are toys.’ Witnesses are urged to call the incident room on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . PUBLISHED: . 09:36 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:14 EST, 4 July 2012 . Killed: Jennie Leeman was shot at close range . A businessman shot his wife dead because she refused to listen to his claims that her new lover was a paeodphile, a court has heard. David Leeman admitted shooting his wife Jennie during a heated argument in an isolated barn in Parracombe, North Devon, but claimed he temporarily lost control of his actions because he was so angry. The 60-year-old told the court he had . confronted his estranged wife over the allegations about her new . partner because he was worried about the safety of his children. However, the row escalated and resulted in Leeman opening fire on 44-year-old Jennie. Leeman said he could not remember . shooting his wife and said it felt as if there was a second . version of himself in the room pulling the trigger. He said: 'My head was bursting. I have no idea why the gun came out of my pocket. All I wanted her to do was to stop and listen. 'It was like a voice saying ""stop, . stop, stop"". I was saying ""stop, stop, stop, stop"" but the gun was going . off. She died with the first shot. 'The gun kept going off; bang, bang, . bang, bang. I held her on the floor and looked at what I had done and . prayed she would go to a peaceful place. I said the Lord’s Prayer over . her body.' The court heard how Mrs Leeman left the defendant just days before, ending their 18-year marriage. She left him for their 40-year-old tenant Norman Laramy, who she had started an affair with when he moved into another rented barn at their complex of farm buildings, their home for nine years. A jury at Exeter Crown Court heard they had agreed to separate and that she would have custody of their two daughters aged seven and 16, while he stayed at the farm with their oldest son William, aged 18, and a younger boy of 13. Leeman killed his wife last September by shooting her at almost point blank range with an illegally held MAB semi automatic pistol which he had taken out of hiding a few days earlier. Crime scene: Police outside the isolated barn in Parracombe, Devon, where the body of Jennie Leeman was found . He later told police he believed he was protecting his daughters because he believed Mr Laramy was a paedophile. He had reported his concerns to the police twice in the week before the shooting, calling officers to his farm the previous day to present them with a statement written by his son William, the court heard. The jury have been shown the statement in which he alleges he went to the barn where his mother and Mr Laramy were living and saw him looking at indecent images of two 13-year-old girls which his own son had taken on his phone. 'I wanted it to stop but I had no power. It was all black around me' William’s statement said Mr Laramy was so engrossed in what he was watching that he did not notice he was there and that he then encouraged his son to perform sexual acts with the girls and film them again. William when he protested and said the images were sickening, Mr Laramy told him ‘chill out and man up’, according to the statement. However, Mr Laramy told the jury a very different version in which he discovered inappropriate images on William's phone, reprimanded him, and ordered him to delete them immediately. Leeman admitted the shooting the day after during his first interview with police but insisted from the outset he was trying to protect his daughters from a man he believed to be a predator. Affair: Mrs Leeman left the defendant for their tenant . He said: 'I passed her the statement from my son about Mr Laramy. I told her I didn’t want her going to live with this man with our daughters. 'I told her I was not happy about her having the girls if that man was staying in the house. I said she had to believe me and showed her William’s statement and she half read it. 'I said ""listen, listen to me"" but she would not listen to what I was trying to tell her and said she was going to take our younger daughter. It all got heated. 'Then there was just a big black area and then I was kneeling on the floor holding her hand and she had left me. She had died. 'I shouted stop, stop, stop. It wasn’t me. It was like part of me and I was next to it. I did not want it to have happened but it had happened. 'I wanted it to stop but I had no power. It was all black all around me. I don’t know why the gun went off. I don’t know why it did but it kept going and going and going and going. 'I wanted to blow my brains out but there were no bullets left. I did not know what had happened. There was no reason for it. I loved her very much but we had separated. 'I was willing to let her go. She had been the best mum in the world but I knew she’d had enough. I was finding it very difficult because we had been together so long.' He said they had talked about selling the farm but decided to carry on renovating the buildings and he had bought her a personalised number plate of JEN 88 S before they split up. The prosecution said he shot his wife in a fit of jealousy to stop her leaving him after luring her to the office. They say he must have planned the . killing because he had retrieved the gun and carried the loaded weapon . in the pocket of his camouflage jacket. Leeman, a property developer and small scale farmer from Parracombe near Combe Martin, denies murder. He admits manslaughter by reason of loss of control and the possession of an illegally-held pistol.

A Nashville cafe owner who died after mistakenly locking himself inside a walk-in cooler at his restaurant suffocated to death within minutes, the medical examiner's office has found. Jay Luther became trapped in the freezer at the Germantown Cafe East on Sunday night and was unable to get out as the mechanism to open the door had been left on a shelf outside, police said. He was also unable to call for help as he had left his cellphone in his nearby condo, they added. Authorities believe he died within two to five minutes. He suffocated from carbon dioxide vapours from dry ice that had been placed inside the cooler to preserve food after a power outage on Friday. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Jay Luther, pictured last September, was suffocated by carbon dioxide fumes from dry ice after he became locked in a walk-in freezer. He had left his cell phone at home . 'It's... an unfortunate coming together of circumstances for this poor gentleman that got trapped inside the freezer, at a time there was carbon dioxide there, and he was overwhelmed by the vapors,' Adele Lewis, deputy chief medical examiner, told The Tennessean after performing the autopsy. The body of Mr Luther, 47, was found when an employee was unable to get in the building at around 9.15 a.m. and called the other co-owner, Chris Lowry. The two discovered the body and called 911. Police are now investigating their own response to the scene, after it emerged officers responded to an alarm that had been set off inside the freezer on Sunday night, but did not check inside. Mr Luther had gone to the restaurant on Sunday after the power returned and he went to check on the food in the freezer. At some point the door slammed shut behind him. The button that opens the freezer from the inside was broken and had not been working for some time, The Tennessean reported. Questions: Police, pictured at the scene after the body had been found, had gone to the restaurant after an alarm was set off in the freezer. They did not check inside as they thought it was a false alarm . There . is evidence that Luther fought to get out of the freezer by using . cardboard to try and open the latch, Nashville police spokesman Don . Aaron said. 'It turns out he plunger - the mechanism that would have opened the door from the inside - was actually on a shelf outside the cooler,' Aaron told NewsChannel5.com. 'As we know now, his cell phone was left in his condo nearby the restaurant. so he was in there without a phone and without the appropriate tool to open the cooler door.' He added that officers responded to an alarm set off at the restaurant at 8.29 p.m. on Sunday and arrived outside the restaurant five minutes later. 'It was called into us as a hold up alarm from the cooler of the restaurant,' Aaron explained. Scene: Luther had gone to the restaurant on Sunday to check food in the freezer after a power outage . Popular: Employees remembered Luther, who co-owned the restaurant, as 'an awesome guy' 'When they got there they saw a sign on the door saying it was closed for the weekend due to a power outage. There was no indication whatsoever of any robbery taking place or that anyone was even inside the building.' The police officers determined it was a false alarm caused by a power surge when the power returned to the building and left the scene. It is uncertain whether Mr Luther would have still been alive when they arrived at the scene. The full autopsy report will be out in 10 to 14 weeks. Luther's hair stylist, Adam Barnes, questioned whether the man’s death could have been prevented. 'It's . not the police’s job just to determine from the outside if there’s an . emergency or not,' he told WKRN. 'They need to come in or at least . call.' Investigation: Police spokesman Don Aaron said a plunger for the inside of the door had been left outside and Luther had tried to use cardboard to try to open the latch . Colleagues and friends remembered the restaurant's co-owner as 'an awesome guy' and 'very well loved', WKRN reported. Police are currently investigating the death, although no foul play is suspected.

A new feature-length documentary, The Eye Has To Travel, will pay tribute next month to the phenomenal life, work and influence of Diana Vreeland. But in her research for the long-awaited film, the late, great former editor of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar's granddaughter-in-law, Lisa Immordino Vreeland, unearthed some bizarre and fascinating details. Among the unlikely facts that she has listed in a new Harper's Bazaar article were that Vreeland would have her dollar bills and tissues ironed before placing them in her handbag. Scroll down for video . Unlikely rituals: Legendary fashion editor Diana Vreeland would have her dollar bills and tissues ironed before placing them in her handbag, and had her pillows injected with perfume . Her pillows were injected with perfume using hypodermic needles, and she would have her custom-made shoes shined . for years before she even set foot in them. Those she did wear were also shined daily - and not just the leather, the soles too. Mrs Immordino Vreeland also reveals . that the British-born editor had a lingerie store in London before she . entered the world of magazines. 'Legend has it that Wallis Simpson . seduced Edward, then Prince of Wales, while wearing one of Diana's . nightgowns,' she writes. She quoted Vreeland's son Frederick once joking: 'Mom's store brought down the British Empire.' As for her daily routine, that too . was intriguing: Vreeland rarely left home before noon, and would . regularly work while in the bathtub. Lunch was a peanut butter and . marmalade sandwich with scotch to drink. 'Peanut butter is the greatest invention since Christianity,' she would say. Fashion legend: Vreeland had a lingerie store in London before she became an editor, and apparently Wallis Simpson seduced Edward, then Prince of Wales, while wearing one of her nightgown designs . Thanks to the stories and anecdotes of her husband, Alexander, brother-in-law and father-in-law, Mrs Immordino Vreeland was afforded unique access and insight into Vreeland's life. Though she interviewed over 60 people for the documentary, to be released in the U.S. and the UK on September 21, it is the family tales that she most loved to hear. 'Legend has it that Wallis Simpson . seduced Edward while wearing one of Diana's . nightgowns' Lisa Immordino Vreeland, Director, The Eye Has To Travel . 'My husband and his brother, Nicholas, shared . wonderful childhood memories of time spent with their ""Nonina,""' she revealed. Vreeland, who died in 1989, has been credited with discovering Twiggy and advised Jackie O on fashion. The Eye Has to Travel explores her . intriguing early years from a society lady who invented a new profession . - the fashion editor - to her time defining the look of both . Harper’s Bazaar, from 1936 to 1962, and then American Vogue, which she edited for a decade. Influential: Vreeland advised Jackie Kennedy, pictured in 1962 (left) and discovered supermodel Twiggy (right) Using Vreeland's distinctive voice, from old TV interviews and soundbites, as the framework . for the film, Mrs Immordino Vreeland uses commentary from .

'The bikini is the most important thing since the . atom bomb' Diana Vreeland, 1946 . Through their anecdotal stories and first hand experiences about what it was like to . work with the inspiring editor, the lighthearted yet informative documentary creates a series of poignant moments with plenty of fireball quotes. Vreeland is seen saying, deadpan, during the film: 'You can see the approaching . revolution in clothes. You can see and feel everything in clothes.' In . 1946, she is seen commenting that 'the bikini is the most important thing since the . atom bomb,' and nearly 40 years later, in 1984, she explained with a . similar seriousness how she saw fashion magazines while she was writing . her autobiography. 'What these magazines gave was a point . of view. Most people haven't got a point of view; they need to have it . given to them,' she said. Early years: The Eye Has to Travel explores her intriguing years as a society lady (pictured with Andy Warhol) who invented a new profession, the fashion editor . Editor extraordinaire: The film also explores her time defining the look of both Harper's Bazaar and then U.S. Vogue, where she profiled celebrities like David Bowie (pictured), Mick Jagger and Edie Sedgwick . Designer Anna . Sui says in the film: 'Mrs Vreeland really brought us into a modern . period, and knew that fashion and the world were on their way to . something much more global.' Anjelica .

One man takes the weight, another grips the powerful tail and whoever draws the short straw gets to hold on to the head, his fingers just inches from all those teeth. All three men were needed to lift this 248lb giant, the largest blue shark to be caught in British waters and a potential man killer. It was reeled in by 43-year-old Bob Pollard, 11 miles off Penzance, Cornwall, and beats the previous best by 26lb. Skipper Robin Chapman used the tried-and-tested formula of measuring the length of the shark and its girth to calculate its weight before returning it to the sea alive. 'It was just massive': It took anglers Shane Triggs, Bob Pollard, and skipper Robin 'Chippy' Chapman (l-r) all their might to haul the shark on board the fishing boat off the coast of Cornwall . Bob Pollard was fishing in a boat around 11 miles off the coast of Penzance, Cornwall, when he reeled in the mighty catch . For an official record, Mr Pollard and . fellow angler Shane Triggs would have had to weigh the shark on land, . which would have meant killing it. Mr Pollard, a builder from St Neot, . near Liskeard, said: ‘It started off with a very gentle tug on my bait . but after I began to wind it in, the battle commenced in earnest. ‘I knew it was going to be a decent . sized fish. When it broke the surface, it was just massive. It took the . three of us to pull it aboard.’ The shark measured 8ft 3in in length and was 3ft 9in around the middle. Mr Chapman, 33, skipper of the boat . Bite Adventures, said: ‘I have had a couple of blue sharks at about . 180lb before. You could tell just by looking at it that this one was . much, much bigger. ‘We are 100 per cent “catch and release” and Bob would never have wanted to kill such a wonderful fish.’ There are calls for the British Record . Fish Committee to recognise catches that are calculated by measuring . the length and girth so encouraging fishermen not to kill certain . species.

Life coach Ali Campbell says in his book 'More than Just Sex' that the look men want to see is her looking down and then moving her eyes in a sweeping motion across the floor because it almost certainly means that she is attracted to you. This glance means that she is checking her internal emotions, in short, she likes you but is working out how much. 'It's the . holy grail of looks,' he said. 'If a guy can pick up on that he has a sure-fire way to work out if she is interested.' And in a complete reversal the . disinterested, shy or bashful look sideways a woman often gives is not . the brush-off most men thought it was. It is in fact the opposite. If a woman looks away for up to 45 . seconds and then stares you . straight in the eye it is another sure sign that she is interested . because she is thinking hard about whether you are a suitable partner. 'Most guys have the idea that if they make eye contact and she looks away she is not interested. But she will look away, that's inevitable. That's what happens when we think to ourselves and also consider our feelings,' Mr Campbell told MailOnline. 'I have interviewed literally hundreds of women and too many men concentrate on having the right car, the right watch, the right whatever. But it is rubbish, all the women I spoke to told me they are just interested in what men are like inside. 'What I am doing for guys is to make sure they know there is someone out there who is interested in you. The important thing is to show who you really are.' But of course with good news there is . bad and this book has also given men the clearest indications yet about . whether they have no chance of love with someone they like. If . after the man makes eye contact she instantly looks over his head or . stares straight back at him it is almost certainly curtains. Forget it: An aggressive stare, left, or looking up or over a man's head is not good news and experts say a man is best to turn his attention elsewhere . These two 'aggressive' reactions mean the man should back off quickly and turn his attentions elsewhere to avoid further embarrassment. 'You do not want her to stare you out or look over your head. That's a bad sign,' he said. Mr Campbell's study has also found women . give off other signals that men should look out for on a date or when . they meet someone for the first time. Secret: The book has revealed a whole new world to men which they can use to know if a date is going well or not . Whether she is right or left handed she will use her dominant wrist to point at you if she likes you. Also if she touches her hair she is attracted to you and if she twirls the ends then she really likes you.","If she looks down and then moves her .

Workers who commute more than ten miles to work each day are at greater risk of suffering from heart disease, diabetes or cancer, researchers have warned. Long-distance commutes can be particularly hazardous to health and are linked to increased weight, bigger waistlines and lung fitness, according to a study. And scientists at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, claim that travelling just 15 miles to work are at more likely to be obese and not getting enough exercise. Road to bad health: Workers who commute more than ten miles to work each day are at greater risk of suffering from heart disease, diabetes or cancer . Lead researcher Christine Hoehner said: 'The study is the first to show that long commutes can take away from exercise and are associated with higher weight, lower fitness levels and higher blood pressure. 'All of these are strong predictors of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers.' The researchers based their results on the health of 4,300 commuters in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin areas of Texas. U.S. census figures show that over the past four decades, Americans are commuting longer distances, with an average commuting time of 20 to 25 minutes. However, Dr Hoehner and her team calculated the shortest commuting distances by road for the workers, who live in areas where about 90 per cent of people travel back and forth to work by car. They also tracked their heart and lung health, body mass index (BMI) -  which is a measure of weight relative to height - waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglycerides, or fat in blood, and blood sugar levels of the commuters, as well as their physical activity. Fifty-one per cent of the people in the study travelled ten miles or less to work each way, and 18 per cent travelled more than 20 miles. The average commute was 12 miles. The researchers found that long commutes were associated with less moderate or vigorous exercise, greater BMI and larger waists and higher blood pressure. 'It looks like the threshold was a commute distance of ten miles for blood pressure,' said Dr Hoehner, adding it started to change with that distance. Obesity was associated with a commute of more than 15 miles. The researchers found no differences in the findings between men and women and different age groups. Dr Hoehner suggested the long commutes and more time spent behind the wheel reduce how time much people exercise. She said: 'For folks that live a long way from work they need to find ways to build physical activity into their day. 'Driving to work has become a part of American life. There is no reason why taking walks during work breaks can't become a part of American life too.'","Travelling just 15 miles each way to work leaves commuters more likely to be obese .

But one Lincolnshire geography teacher who spent 15 years unhappy with his size has been crowned a slimming champion after losing almost 11 stone in just one year. A newly svelte James Pepper, 30, who lives in Market Deeping, says his family and friends no longer recognise him after his weight plummeted from 23st 13lb to 13st 6lbs. A shadow of my former self: Geography teacher James Pepper, who lost over 10 stone and has been crowned Slimming World's Man of the Year 2012 at the Ritz Hotel, poses with a cardboard cutout of his larger self . Just last year, aged 29, Mr Pepper vowed to lose the weight as a 30th birthday present to himself. He made the decision after realising he had been steadily gaining weight since the age of 15 and had been frustrated with his size for half his life. Mr Pepper, who has been crowned Slimming World's Man of the Year 2012 at London's Ritz Hotel, said: 'I've had people I know walk past me in . the street. They're always really apologetic but I actually take it as a . huge compliment.' Speaking about his dramatic transformation, Mr Pepper said: 'At 15 I was just a little bit overweight but I didn't do anything about it and I got bigger and bigger. 'Whenever . I felt unhappy, whether it was about my weight or something else, I'd . cheer myself up by buying something nice to eat like a cake or a pie. 'It . carried on like that for the next 15 years. I always knew I needed to . do something about my weight but I didn't know what, so I'd put it to the back of my mind.' Now you see him...and now you don't: Geography teacher James Pepper, left, before losing the weight, and now, right, almost 11 stone lighter and 'finally fit at 30' Mr Pepper, who is single, eventually decided to tackle his weight problem when one of his friends asked how he was planning to celebrate his 30th birthday. He said: 'That was the trigger . because I realised then that I'd been unhappy with my size for half of . my life. Winning smile: James Pepper with his award for Slimming World's Man of the Year in the garden of the Ritz Hotel in London . 'I asked my . colleague Caroline, who had lost a lot of weight, about the Slimming . World group she went to and agreed to go with her. 'She was delighted . because she got a free week for bringing along a new member!' The teacher signed up to the programme - which promotes healthy eating and meal plans - in June 2011 and lost five stone before the school holidays were over. When he returned to the classroom with his new, smaller body he received rapturous applause from his pupils. By his 30th birthday in September Mr Pepper had . dropped six stone. He said that before going to his first Slimming World meeting he was really nervous as he had the impression there would be lots of women in the group. 'And to be fair . there was, but they were all really welcoming and friendly'. He says the . biggest change is learning to plan his meals: 'I never used to think . about what I'd have for dinner until I was on my way home, which means . I'd pick up a takeaway or grab something quick and easy - and usually . unhealthy - from the supermarket. 'Since . joining Slimming World I enjoy cooking meals from scratch, my favourite . is homemade burgers and potato wedges with salad. 'Food . isn't my comfort blanket anymore either, although I do have an . emergency Curly Wurly in my classroom - but so far I'm one of the few . teachers who hasn't broken it out.' Mr Pepper revealed that another secret to his dramatic weight-loss was becoming more active. Last year he began walking more, and he also went swimming for the first time in 12 years. He said: 'As a . geography teacher I go on lots of trips. I used to huff and puff my way . up mountains, following the kids while someone else led, but now I'm . first off the bus and charging up the hill. 'The . kids at school have been really supportive and asked lots of questions, . someone even asked if they could write a magazine article on me for . their coursework which was very flattering. 'I . think it's important to be honest with them and I always say I wish I'd . done something at their age, but at least I can say I finally got fit . at 30.'","Lincolnshire's James Pepper vowed to drop weight for his 30th birthday .

Amy attached to her nutritional supply with her mother, Helen: Helen said she was furious at her daughter's treatment in a Hare and Tortoise restaurant . A teenage girl who has to be fed through a tube in her heart has been left fuming after she claims she was booted out of a restaurant - because she hadn’t ordered a meal. Amy Knowles, 17, is currently a patient at Great Ormond Street Hospital after contracting septicaemia - a blood infection - due to the condition Complex Neuromyopathic Intestinal Dismotility (CNID) she has which means she can’t digest food. The teenager has been unable to eat any food for more than six months - and has to be fed through a tube taking nutrients straight to her heart. But after a rare visit to a restaurant . with her mother, Helen, and sister, Bethany, after she was allowed to . leave hospital for a few hours, she was left mortified when a waitress . told the party had not spent enough money as Amy was not eating - and . allegedly asked them to leave. The . family claim a waitress at the Hare and Tortoise in the Brunswick . Centre, near Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) told the family they . would have to order a third meal - as they were pennies under the . restaurant’s minimum spend of £6 per diner. Although . stunned mother Helen explained that her daughter Amy was unable to eat - . and even offered to show staff the tube taking nutrients into her heart . - they claim they were told there would be 'no exceptions.' One staff member even suggested Amy could have 'just a starter' - and offered to let the family buy food to take away and eat later. Helen said: 'I am furious at the way my daughter was treated. 'It is hard enough for Amy to go into a restaurant knowing she can’t eat - but she wanted to go out because her sister had come to visit her, and they were only allowed out of hospital for a short time. 'Amy is a very thoughtful girl, and she knows that her sister really likes the food at this restaurant - and said she wanted to go, even though she couldn’t have anything to eat.' The Hare & Tortoise Restaurant in London where a family claims they received poor treatment from staff . The three women visited the restaurant on Tuesday lunchtime - the day before Amy underwent risky surgery to have a portacath- which connects the central line that allows fluids to travel to her heart - replaced after it became infected with the bout of septicemia. She had been looking forward to going to the restaurant as they sell iced tea - one of only a small number of drinks she can have - and she wanted that as her only 500ml dose of fluids allowed that day. Helen said: 'Amy was quite happy to sit and just have a drink while we both had food, but we were told that because there were three diners, we had to spend at least £18. 'I had ordered food and drinks that came to more than £17 - we were pennies off the minimum spend.' The food bill for Helen and Bethany came to almost £13 and the two bottles of water and iced tea they ordered would have tipped them close to the requested £18 fee for three people to dine in the restaurant. 'I explained that really there were only two diners in our party, and told them about Amy’s condition. She even had a GOSH wristband on, but then the waitress suggested she just had a starter - or even ordered some food and took it home later. 'I said we didn’t want anything else to eat, but we were told we’d have to leave. Amy during treatment at Great Ormond Hospital. There is no known cure for her condition that leaves her unable to digest food . Amy, who is fed through a tube, received a visit from Jessie J during one of her stays at Great Ormond Street Hospital . 'She went to speak to the manager, who I explained the situation to as well - but he told me I didn’t understand the situation, and all I had to do was buy some more food for Amy. 'There was no compassion, and they didn’t even bother to try and understand what I was explaining to them. 'It’s not about the money - I couldn’t care less whether the meal cost £100 - but Amy was so upset she’s been made to feel like she had done something wrong. 'When the waitress was talking to us, I could see the look in Amy’s eyes - she was devastated by how she was treated. 'The restaurant is a five minute walk from Great Ormond Street, and a lot of children are probably taken there by their parents on rare days away from the hospital. 'I’d hate to think any other child with dietary requirements was made to feel so small over a few pence. 'When we went back to the hospital, all the doctors and nurses who had been treating Amy were appalled.' Amy shows the tube that takes nutrition to her heart . For 12 hours a day Amy, from Keighley, West Yorks, has to be fed by tube to her heart which feeds liquid nutrients into her blood stream, but what the future holds for her is uncertain. There is no known cure. Amy said: 'I’ve got one life, I’ve just got to laugh and enjoy it.' A spokesperson from the Hare and Tortoise disputed the family's account of events, and said: 'We are saddened to learn of the unfortunate experience our customers had at our restaurant during the busy lunch hours. 'The customers, a couple with a young girl (later we learned she had a serious health problem, being unable to eat), ordered two meals and a drink, amounting to approx. £14 to £15, just shy of £18 to make the average £6 per head. 'Our staff explained to the customers our rule, i.e. minimum spending of £6 per head as written on the menu, and offered them an option to order something extra or take-away meals to make up the spending shortage. But the customers were somehow just upset and were unwilling to consider this option we offered. 'Learning that the girl has just come out of a hospital, our staff apologised and said we are making an exception this time to enable them to enjoy dining at our restaurant. 'Unfortunately, however, the customers decided to leave. 'We are a very busy and popular restaurant, often with a long queue seen outside, and well-known for providing quality meals at affordable prices. 'Therefore, we have to ensure that there is a good turnover of customers to satisfy the needs of all our good customers and that is why we have certain rules in place. 'It is felt that our staff treated the customers fairly and well, and made a kind concession too. We are just saddened to hear of the unhappy incident. In order to show our goodwill, our management has decided to contact the customers to send them a Gift Meal Voucher.'","Mother says her family were asked to leave because daughter's lack of meal meant they didn't meet 'minimum spend'

"By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 20:02 EST, 29 February 2012 . His mane is tinged with grey and he’d have trouble clearing a fence. But that’s hardly surprising because at 51, Shayne could be the oldest horse in the world. The chestnut stallion has lived at the Remus Memorial Horse Sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, since 2007. And the elderly nag has some senior company after it was revealed that he lives in the same town as Pip the 24-year-old terrier, who is thought to be the world's oldest dog. Good innings: Shayne still enjoys a gallop outside his stables in Brentwood, Essex, despite clocking up 51 years as one of the world's oldest horses . Happy retirement: Shayne, pictured here with stable-hand Paige Emmins, now enjoys a more leisurely lifestyle in his senior years . Shayne is still happily trotting around his paddock and is in better shape than many of his stable mates, despite having nearly three decades on most of them. He is believed to have inherited the title of the world’s oldest living horse following the death of the previous holder in 2004. The 15 hands gelding is now enjoying a laid back retirement with four meals a day at the 40-acre Remus Memorial Horse Sanctuary in Brentwood. Sanctuary founder Sue Burton said: 'We get people who rescue a horse and they say it is in its 30s and then it knocks them for six when we say we have one in its 50s. The elderly nag lives on a diet of fibre, alfalfa nuts, sugar beet and chaff . 'Shayne is a really good boy. He is still very active - sometimes we forget how old he is. 'I guess his secret to a long life is taking it easy in his old age and enjoying his retirement.' Shayne was brought to the Remus Memorial Horse Sanctuary in April 2007 after spending many happy years with his previous owner in Chingford, Essex. He is fed a high-calorie diet consisting of fibre, alfalfa nuts, sugar beet and chaff mixed together and he is also partial to a bit of cabbage to help keep his weight at 480kg. Despite suffering from some mild arthritis, his health is in good health. The previous title of oldest living horse in the world was held by Welsh/Arab steed Badger, from Pembrokeshire, Wales, who died aged 51, in in 2004. Shayne does not have a birth certificate but they were given his birth date by his previous owner and have since verified his age with medical checks. Sue added: 'Fifteen used to be regarded as old for horses when I started working with them, but research into medicines means they can live much longer now. 'The previous owner brought Shayne to the sanctuary after her other horse died. 'Shayne does not have a birth certificate so we are going by what his previous owner told us - but it all adds up.' Remarkably, Shayne lives in the same town as Pip, the 24-year-old terrier-whippet cross, who was named the world’s oldest dog in December. Still going strong: Bizarrely, Shayne lives in the same Essex town as 24-year-old Pip, thought to be the world's oldest dog . Record breaker: Shayne could inherit the title of world's oldest horse after the previous title holder died in 2004, aged 51 . Pip unofficially became the world’s oldest canine following the death of a 26-year-old Shiba mix, Pusuke, in Japan. Equine vet Erik Belloy, 46, from House and Jackson vets in Blackmore, Essex, said: 'Fifty-one is definitely a ripe old age. 'It’s uncommon because ponies tend to live a little bit longer than big horses do. 'Horses do, however, live longer now because of advances in veterinary medicine and the production of their feed.'

Jeremy Hunt was given a clean bill of health by David Cameron last night just 25 minutes after disclosing damning new details of his closeness to James Murdoch. The Prime Minister backed his Culture Secretary despite the revelation that Mr Hunt exchanged friendly texts with Mr Murdoch before and after assuming responsibility for the BSkyB takeover bid. In addition, it emerged Mr Hunt was in phone contact with the media boss on the very day he was handed oversight of the controversial deal. Scroll down for video . Questions: Jeremy Hunt, who is fighting to save his ministerial career, . has a gruelling day of questioning at the Leveson Inquiry today . He also appears to have ignored legal advice from Government lawyers who told him he should have no 'external discussions' about the deal while it was being handled by Business Secretary Vince Cable. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne are also facing tough questions over exactly why the Culture Secretary was handed responsibility for the BSkyB deal even though they were aware of his enthusiastic support for it. Despite the startling revelations at the Leveson Inquiry into the Press, the Prime Minister formally dismissed demands for Mr Hunt to face an investigation into whether he breached ministerial rules just 25 minutes after he had left the witness box. That swift decision drew a sharp . response from Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on . standards in public life, who said it was an 'error of judgment'. 'I . just get the feeling it's beginning to feel like the latter end of the . Blair government in not having the high standards that the public want . to see from the political class,' he said. Downing .

Mr Hunt also admitted yesterday that he had considered resigning amid the controversy over his department's handling of the bid. But . he finally agreed that his special adviser Adam Smith, who exchanged . hundreds of texts and emails with News Corp, should go instead. He . told the inquiry: 'I did think about my own position, but I had . conducted the bid scrupulously, and I believed it was possible to . demonstrate that, and I decided it wouldn't be appropriate for me to . go.' The inquiry was told . the Mr Hunt sent a text to Mr Murdoch just hours before he was given . responsibility for determining the BSkyB bid congratulating him on . gaining EU clearance for the deal. 'Just . Ofcom to go,' he told Mr Murdoch, referring to the broadcasting . watchdog.

'Could we chat about this... am seriously worried Vince will do real . damage to Coalition with his comments.'

Health managers have backed down over a controversial policy of using a cheap unlicensed drug to treat eye disease . Health managers have backed down over a controversial policy of using a cheap unlicensed drug to treat eye disease. Trusts have been telling consultants to switch to the cancer drug Avastin rather than Lucentis, which is 15 times more expensive. Both drugs treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disorder that can lead to blindness, but only Lucentis is licensed and approved for NHS use. Its manufacturer Novartis has mounted . a legal challenge by seeking judicial review of the policy being . pursued by a group of primary care trusts in the South of England. It said widespread use of an unlicensed medicine undermined the system to protect patients. Charities and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists were also concerned about possible health risks. Now, the trusts have reversed their . policy at a board meeting, claiming the price of Lucentis has been cut, . making it a better deal. The reluctance of local eye specialists to use the cheaper alternative also meant the policy was not  making planned savings. The list price for Lucentis is around £900 per injection while the estimated cost of a shot of Avastin is £60. Bosses at the Southampton, Hampshire, . Isle of Wight and Portsmouth Primary Care Trust Cluster have not . disclosed how much they had hoped to save. However, the trusts said switching drugs would have cut the £7.5million annual bill for treating wet AMD. Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in the developed world. These pictures show how it affects the eye . Professor Jonathan Montgomery, chairman of the PCT Cluster Board, said it continued to believe the  policy was lawful, sensible and safe. But ‘significant discounts’ in the price of Lucentis are in the best interests of patients, he said. The professor added: ‘The board also took into account the policy had not been taken up in any meaningful way by consultant ophthalmologists on the advice of their Royal College. ‘This has meant the potential benefits we envisaged, to patients and the NHS, of offering Avastin as well as Lucentis, had not been realised.’ This decision could set a precedent for other NHS trusts planning to recommend Avastin to cut costs, including NHS North Yorkshire and York. How age-related macular degeneration affects vision over time . A Daily Mail investigation last year found dozens of PCTs in England have told consultants to switch to Avastin, or leave the decision up to patients. Although trial data suggests the two drugs are equally effective in treating AMD, Avastin has not been licensed for this purpose and is being used ‘off-label’ which puts responsibility on the doctor to vouch for its safety. Fears over side effects in the US led to the Department of Veterans Affairs stopping the use of Avastin after reports of infections apparently caused by contaminated syringes. Patients have lost their remaining sight and one man is suing for £2.6million in damages for loss of sight and brain damage as a result of an infection. Some doctors attribute a high rate of infections from Avastin to contamination by careless pharmacists splitting vials intended for cancer patients into small doses for eye treatment, but there is also concern the drug stays in the body far longer than Lucentis. Stephen Whitehead,chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said Novartis had taken ‘the right course of action’. He said ‘We are pleased that SHIP has decided to revoke its commissioning policy that had supported the use of a medicine which was unlicensed for the indication, in place of a licensed medicine which had already gained full regulatory approval. ‘It continues to be our view that off-label and unlicensed prescribing should be strictly limited to those circumstances where there is no licensed alternative and where the clinician, in discussion with the patient, decides that this is in their best interests. ‘Loosening the regulations in this area would not only put a patient’s safety at risk, it would also undermine the entire regulatory process which is in place to protect public health.’","Trusts have been telling consultants to switch to the cancer drug Avastin rather than Lucentis, which is 15 times more expensive ."

Critical: Aimee Copeland is battling for life in intensive care after contracting a flesh-eating bug . 24-year-old Aimee Copeland, who had her leg amputated after an aggressive flesh-eating bug infected a wound, is likely to lose more limbs. Her father, Andy, said that while his daughter is showing signs of improvement, doctors might be forced to amputate her hands and right foot. 'Her fingers basically appear mummified,' said Mr Copeland at a press conference with his wife Donna and daughter Paige, 25, reports AJC.com. However, the family remain optimistic, as a neurologist and cardiopulmonologist have said there is no brain damage or irreversible injury to the lungs, which were under attack. Previously they had stated her chances of survival were 'slim to none'. Mr Copeland describes his daughter as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' and hopes that she will eventually finish her master's degree. 'What we've got is nothing short of a miracle. My baby is alive and her mind is good. I know we have a difficult road ahead, but right now we're rejoicing,' he said. Aimee's mother is more cautious about her daughter's future. 'We want to think that way, but it can just change,' she said. 'It's like a rollercoaster every day.' Miss Copeland was kayaking along the Little Tallapoosa River in Carrollton, Georgia, when she stopped to ride a home-made zipline. The line snapped, and she suffered a gash to her left calf, which required two dozen staples to close. After initially being turned away several times from medics with nothing more than pain killers and antibiotics, horrified doctors realised an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria - aeromonas hydrophila - had invaded the increasingly agonising wound. Medics were forced to amputate the young woman's leg on Friday night, and she remains in a critical condition at the JMS Burn Center in Augusta. Andy Copeland told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that . his daughter, who is a graduate psychology student at the University of . West Georgia, attended the emergency room at Tanner Medical Center in . Carrollton after cutting her leg. Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery [from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige] . Doctors there closed the wound with 22 staples, and told her to take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain. The next day, she returned complaining of severe pain and was given a prescription for painkillers. Her father said this alleviated her symptoms, but the pain continued to build on Thursday. 'Aimee . went to the doctor and received a prescription for antibiotics and . posted a clean MRI report,' he said. 'Again, she was treated and . released.' On . Friday morning the student was driven to the emergency room by a . concerned friend. Pale and weak, she received a shocking diagnosis: She . was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria . that can destroy skin, fat and muscle. Physicians . told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and . hip, and that her whole leg would have to be amputated. Miss . Copeland was flown to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, where . doctors performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg and removed . further infected tissue from her abdomen. Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' 'The . surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at . this point saving her life took precedence,' Mr Copeland said on . Facebook. 'They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited, if any use of her leg.' 'Aimee . [cardiac] arrested when they moved her from the operating table, but . they were able to successfully resuscitate her,' he added. Writing on Facebook on 6 May, he . concluded: 'I type this factual progression of Aimee’s condition as a . way to better cope with what is without a doubt the most horrific . situation that a parent can possibly imagine. 'We take so much for granted in life, . but I never imagined that one of my daughters would face this most . unlikely of situations. 'I . hope and pray that when you read this that the news we receive at . sunrise will be positive. At this point, no news is good news, but all I . know to do is hope and pray for the best. I only ask that you all do . the same.' The JMS Burn Center in Augusta, where Aimee is receiving vital medical care . Friends and co-workers from the Sunnyside Cafe in Carrollton, where Miss Copeland works, have banded together to support her family. WSBTV quoted a friend, Kara Dermo, who said, 'She was awesome, just great ... just really awesome to be around.' Miss Copeland is well-known in Carrollton, where she had organised festivals and activities. Sunnyside cafe owner Gary Duke said: 'She planned to go to work helping troubled youth. Then all the sudden, this devastating accident.' A website for psychology students at the University of West Virginia said of the brave young woman: . 'About Aimee: Bright star, lover of life, infinitely generous of heart and spirit. From Snellville, GA. B.A. from UGA in 2010. Nearing completion of her Master’s degree at UWG Psychology. Loved dearly by family and friends.' Miss Copeland's friends have established Aimee's Fund at the United Community Bank in Carrollton, with the aim of raising money for her rehabilitation. Details are available on the student page dedicated to Miss Copeland. They also plan to hold a blood drive in the university's gym from 2 to 7pm on May 15. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland was infected with killer bug through a deep gash on her leg .

The BBC Director General has lavished praise on staff for what he called their 'outstanding' coverage of the Jubilee weekend – despite a storm of protest about the standard of the programmes. The broadcaster's Jubilee coverage had by last night prompted 2,425 complaints from viewers. Nearly 2,000 were about the coverage of Sunday's river pageant, which even some BBC figures described as 'lamentable' and 'mind-numbingly tedious'. Plaudits: BBC Director General Mark Thompson has heaped praise on his staff for their coverage of the Jubilee . Yet in an internal email to staff yesterday, Mark Thompson wrote: 'Our output has been impressive not only in its scale, but in its ambition, quality and outstanding journalism. 'By capturing the spectacle of the Thames Pageant and yesterday's ceremonies alongside smaller local celebrations we reflected reaction from up and down the country.' He added – without irony – that the BBC had 'made our own contribution to a special moment in our nation's history'. The extraordinary comments stunned many BBC journalists who are said to feel 'deeply embarrassed' by the coverage. There was further incredulity when the corporation confirmed that many of the presenters who fronted the Jubilee coverage will be given key roles in the Olympics. Matt Baker – who viewers described as 'woeful' and 'out of his depth' during the pageant – will be fronting the 'live action'  from inside the Olympic Park. BBC veteran Peter Sissons said the number of complaints was 'very serious' and bosses should have a 'serious rethink' about the presenting line-up ahead of the Olympics. Well covered? The Diamond Jubilee Concert Picnic at Buckingham Palace Grounds, London, was held in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's 60 years on the throne . Around 500 were unhappy that the programme credits were played over the spectacular four-minute firework display . Fearne Cotton, presenting for the BBC on board HMS Belfast, was criticised by viewers . The former newsreader said: 'The BBC should look long and hard at a lot of the presenters from that Sunday. Some of them were absolutely appalling. You're only as good as your last show – and on that basis a lot of them should be very worried indeed.' Viewers were aghast at the idea that the Jubilee presenters would be featured during the Olympics. One wrote: 'Chris Hollins – God I hope the BBC has more up its sleeve than this for the Olympics.' Another added: 'If we all bribe the BBC with cold, hard cash, will they promise not to employ Fearne Cotton or Matt Baker during the Olympics?' War veterans have joined the criticism of the BBC river pageant coverage, claiming they were made to stand in the rain for more than an hour while waiting to be interviewed. Fearne Cotton's interview with men on board HMS Belfast has already been condemned by viewers after she called one 'Jim' when his name was John. Yesterday former petty officer Bryan Stockley, 75, who served on Belfast in the Far East, said the shipmates' experience was 'absolutely traumatic'. The 26 former seamen, all aged between 70 and 90, were summoned to the quarterdeck, where they were left to shiver in the cold while only two were interviewed. Mr Stockley, from Monmouth, south Wales, said their day was 'completely ruined'. He added: 'It was appallingly inconsiderate to ask people of our age to stand for so long and get so cold.' A spokesman for the BBC said it had apologised for the delay to the interviews. 'We endeavoured to speak to as many of the people involved in the pageant as possible.' As well as the river pageant, the BBC has received hundreds of complaints about its coverage of the palace pop concert on Monday. Around 500 were unhappy that the programme credits were played over the spectacular four-minute firework display which closed the event. Comedian Lenny Henry was also criticised for cutting short Rolf Harris's sing-along of Two Little Boys. Some of the strongest critics of the BBC's Jubilee output have been its own stars. Stephen Fry said the BBC's coverage of the pageant was 'mind-numbingly tedious'. Kevin Marsh, a former editor of the Today programme and The World At One, called the coverage 'lamentable' and 'scarcely credible'. The corporation's obituaries editor Nick Serpell said that some of the coverage had him 'reaching for the sick-bag'. The executive responsible for the coverage has gone on holiday. BBC Vision director George Entwistle was unable to appear on Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday to defend the corporation, although it is understood he did not leave until the coverage had been completed on Tuesday. As a result, the job fell to former BBC executive Mark Damazer – who was less than robust in his defence of the corporation. Damazer admitted that the BBC had 'probably tried too hard' to be inclusive. What had gone wrong was 'a conscious attempt, I think, to make the whole event as it were informal and to use the modern idiom, inclusive and warm'. 'The BBC just probably tried too hard. It's just that the BBC on these occasions – and there's a long history of it – is worried about being seen as “Auntie” and being too formal and too stiff.' He added: 'I don't think this is going to be the BBC's Bafta Award winning entry next year.' A spokesman for the corporation said: 'The concert was watched by a peak audience of 17million, making it the highest rating show of the year, whilst an average audience of over 10million saw our coverage of the pageant, a broadcasting event of unprecedented scale and complexity.' BBC creative director Alan Yentob also dismissed the complaints, saying no coverage ever received a 'universal three cheers'. He told Radio 4's Media Show that the BBC had tried to make the 'tone' of the river parade about the 'people too' and 'enjoying that day'.

The most expensive beach hut in Britain has sold for a staggering £170,000 in just two days of going on the market. The wooden structure on an isolated spit has no running hot water or washing facilities and requires a 30 minute walk, a ride on a land-train or a short ferry trip to get there. Yet estate agents were overcome with interest in the 18ft by 10ft timber retreat and a bidding frenzy meant the hut was able to command the record price. Sold: This is Britain's most expensive beach hut which has sold for £170,000 in just two days in bidding frenzy . The immaculately-decorated hut on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, boasts stunning dual views of the harbour on one side and The Solent on the other. The surge in beach hut sales is at odds with the national housing market that is struggling in the financial climate. The Mudeford sandbank is recognised has having the most expensive huts in the country, although the previous highest price paid for one was £126,000 three months ago. Comfortable: The galley kitchen in the wooden hut even has a stove, fridge and a sink with running water . Bedtime: The hut sleeps six but a bylaw dictates people can only stay overnight between March and October . Relaxing: The hut also has solar panels on the roof to provide electricity for lighting . The £170,000 sum could buy an 'exceptional detached villa' with three bedrooms near Glasgow. It could also buy a Grade II listed cottage in the historic market town of Wymondham in Norfolk or a luxury three bedroom detached house in Hull. Hut 97 at Mudeford has solar panels on the roof to provide electricity for lighting and a 12V pump system that supplies water from a tap. It has a fitted kitchen with gas oven and fridge which can be powered by a battery or gas. Views: Sunbathers can see The Solent and the Habour (which would be more stunning without rain clouds) Big business: There are 350 beach huts at Mudeford (pictured) which normally sell for about £140,000 each . There is a separate bedroom on the . ground floor two single beds in the cramped confines of the roof eaves . plus a sofa bed in the living space. Although six people can sleep there, a local bylaw only allows overnight stays from March through to October. On top of the asking price, the new owners will have to pay a ground rent to the local council of £2,500 a year. It has been bought by a wealthy family with grown-up children from Christchurch. Storage: There's space in the ground floor of the hut to store beach equipment such as sun loungers and boats . Luxury: A wealthy family from Christchurch have bought the beach hut - one of 350 in the local area . Andrew Denison, from Denisons Estate Agents in Christchurch, said: 'The hut is positioned side-on with views of the harbour and the sea and the Isle of Wight, making it quite rare. 'The dual aspect views and the fact it is such a good size meant that as soon as we put it on the website people found it appealing. 'There was a frenzy of people interested and appointments were booked very quickly. 'The most expensive hut we have sold before went for £126,000 last month and we usually put them on the market for about £140,000. 'But, this hut is plush and a fantastic size so I think that is why it went so fast and for so much, I don’t know of any that have sold for this sort of figure. 'It must be one of the most expensive beach huts in Britain, I haven’t seen any go for more money than this.' There are about 350 beach huts at Mudeford that make up the 23,000 huts in Britain.","The 18ft long wooden hut has no running hot water or washing facilities and requires 30 minute walk to get there .

Twin babies Dylan and Hannah Fox will grow up together, sharing a special bond as well as the same birthday. Unfortunately, the one thing won’t have in common is a nationality. For while Dylan is English, his sister is actually a Scot, having been born on the other side of the Border after their mother went into labour early. Odd: Twin babies Dylan, right, and Hannah Fox, left, were born in different countries, with Dylan born in England and Hannah in Scotland. Mother Donna Keenan is pictured with her babies . Bizarre: Mrs Keenan, 28, started having contractions at home in Northumberland and gave birth to Dylan, left. But because the twins were premature, she had to be taken to hospital in Scotland where Hannah, right, was born . Mother Donna Keenan, 28, started having contractions at home in Northumberland, giving birth to Dylan in the living room of his grandparents’ house. But because the twins were premature, she had to be taken to hospital – in the over the border in Scotland. Hannah arrived an hour and forty minutes after her brother, but in a different country. The babies’ father, Joe Fox, 24, said: ‘We’re still getting our heads around it. 'I’ve been looking online for an England babygro for Dylan and a Scotland one for Hannah. ‘It was an amazing experience to say the least and Donna was brilliant.’ The drama of the twins’ birth in two different countries began four weeks before their due date last Sunday. Proud: Parents Donna Keenan and Joe Fox are pictured. Mr Fox, 24, said the couple were still getting their heads around the births taking place in different countries . Healthy: Dylan Joseph Fox, left, was born weighing 5lb 13oz. Hannah, right, weighed 4lb 14.5oz . Miss Keenan went into labour while watching Italy play Spain in the Euro 2012 final with her partner and his parents at their home in the Northumberland market town of Wooler. It all happened so fast that the paramedics had to deliver her first baby on the living room floor. Dylan Joseph Fox was born safely at around 10pm, weighing 5lb 13oz, but because the twins were so premature the medics were worried. They decided there was enough time to take the new mum to hospital for the birth of her second child. So Miss Keenan, her partner, who works at Haggerston Castle caravan park, and their new baby were taken by ambulance on the hour-long journey to Borders General Hospital in Melrose. Less than two hours after arriving on the maternity ward, Hannah Rose Fox was welcomed into the world. Beautiful: Hannah is pictured wrapped in her mother's arms. She was born at Borders General Hospital in Melrose . Thrilled: The happy mother is pictured with son Dylan . Cafe worker Miss Keenan, who has been with her partner for four years, said: ‘Joe and I already have a daughter, Jessica, who’s now two and a half, and I was in labour with her for 30 hours so I never imagined the twins would come so quickly. ‘I had already been up to the Borders hospital and was back at Joe’s mum’s house when I started to feel a bit strange, and that’s when my waters went. ‘That was just after 8pm. I called the hospital and they said to come straight in, but we didn’t have time. We called the paramedics and the next thing I remember is them saying to get ready to have the baby on the living room floor.’ After the first birth, Mr Fox was hoping for a second which came after midnight. He said: ‘At that point we knew they were going to born in different countries, but there was also a chance they’d be born on different days because it was so late. ‘I joked to Donna that she should hold on as long as possible but I only mentioned it once and I don’t think it went down too well!’ In the event, Hannah was delivered at 11.40pm, weighing a healthy 4lb 14.5oz. Both babies and their mother are in the special care baby unit of the Borders hospital. It is hoped they will be transferred closer to Northumberland, to Berwick Infirmary, before being allowed home as a family.","Mother Donna Keenan, 28, started having .

Tragic: Ashley Ebanks, 22, was killed after falling in front of a taxi on a dual carriageway because the shoes he was wearing had slippery soles . A student was killed after falling in front of a taxi on a dual carriageway because the shoes he was wearing had slippery soles, an inquest heard today. Ashley Ebanks, 22, was hit as he dashed across a road in Birmingham city centre on March 5 last year. He had borrowed the smart shoes from a friend to make sure he got into a nightclub, Birmingham Coroner's Court was told. Just minutes before he died, Mr Ebanks had complained to friends about how 'slippy' the soles were. One friend, Surha Bains, told Friday’s hearing how Mr Ebanks had been one of a group of five who had been drinking in his city centre flat and had decided to go to the Oceana nightclub. They caught a taxi but were forced to run across the busy dual carriageway on the Smallbrook Queensway after they were dropped off opposite the popular night spot. Two of them managed to reach the other side but Mr Ebanks, who was studying business and economics at Manchester Metropolitan University, was stranded in the central reservation. Mr Bains told the inquest: 'Ashley decided to run out into the road, a taxi was coming so he rushed and then he slipped and fell and got hit.' Another friend, Rajdhir Dhanda, said he had loaned Ashley some shoes because the ones he was wearing were not smart enough to get into Oceana. He added: 'He said the shoes fitted him but he said the soles felt a bit slippy.' Pathologist Dr Peter Acland confirmed Ashley, from West Bromwich, West Midlands, died from a fractured skull. He added that the bright student had also drunk twice the legal limit for driving. He told the inquest: 'At this level, his judgement could have been impaired, particularly his reaction times.' Taxi driver Sardar Mohammed will not face prosecution over the accident after police estimated he was travelling at less than 30mph. Mr Mohammed told the hearing: 'One of the men put his foot on the road and I thought ""he’s going to run"", so I slowed down. 'But then he put his foot back on the kerb so I started moving again but he started running and was in front of the car when he slipped and fell.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Birmingham assistant deputy coroner Michael Snell said Mr Ebanks' footwear were to blame for his death. He said: 'Ashley was required to change his footwear and borrowed some shoes and it is clear from the evidence that these shoes may have played a part in his ultimate accident. 'He had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. His judgement may have been impaired and he may have attempted to cross the road in circumstances where had he been sober, he would not have done so.' A verdict of accidental death was recorded.","Ashley Ebanks, 22, was hit as he dashed across a road in Birmingham city centre in March last year .

"By . Jamie Mcginnes . UPDATED: . 02:18 EST, 27 June 2012 . Legal action: Mark McCammon, pictured, alleges that he and other black players at League Two club Gillingham were treated differently from white footballers . A black footballer is suing his former club after claiming he was dismissed after being racially discriminated against. Mark McCammon, 33, alleges that he and other black players at League Two club Gillingham were treated differently from white footballers. The 6ft 2in striker claims he was ordered to come into the ground amid 'treacherous', snowy driving conditions while some white players were told they were not required. McCammon has also alleged that the Kent club tried to 'frustrate him out' by refusing to pay private medical bills to help him regain his fitness following injury. He said was instead offered the choice of undergoing the same operation on the NHS rather than privately, a move he described as 'completely out of character' for a Football League club. By comparison, the former Charlton, Swindon, Millwall and Brighton player said that a white player was flown to Dubai for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club’s expense. He claims that after leaving the club, Gillingham 'were effectively campaigning covertly against me' by trying to sabotage his career. Strong interest was shown following his departure by 11 clubs but talks with all collapsed, often at a late stage, he said. 'It soon became known that the chairman had been interfering,' McCammon said in his witness statement. 'My agent was told by other agents that the job he was doing was an impossible one as they were aware that GFC were effectively campaigning covertly against me with the intention of sabotaging my career.' Barbados international McCammon signed a three-year contract with Gillingham in 2008 on £2,500 a week and was the club's highest paid player. Chairman: Mark McCammon is suing Gillingham and its chairman Paul Scally (pictured). Gillingham has said it 'wholly rejects' all the allegations . The first campaign went well but by his third season with the club, they had been relegated to League Two and he suffered an injury that needed an operation. In his statement, McCammon said: 'The way the chairman approached the matter was that he saw my injury as a way to get rid of any financial obligations, such as my wages, he might have as a result of my contract. 'Effectively, he preferred to offer me some money to get out of the contract rather than have to pay for my injury and help me back to recuperation. 'There was at least eight months left on my contract. 'It was essential that I completed the operation as soon as possible so that I could get my fitness to the right level and start with the team again.' Instead, it is alleged, McCammon was 'stalled for as long as possible' and eventually offered money to terminate his contract. He is suing Gillingham and its chairman Paul Scally for race discrimination, breach of contract, unfair dismissal and failure of his ex-employer to pay him. The case comes at a time of concern about racism in football, particularly at the Euro 2012 championships. It also comes ahead of the trial of England star John Terry on charges of racially abusing QPR’s Anton Ferdinand. Terry denies the charges. Gillingham has said it 'wholly rejects' McCammon’s allegations. Tribunal: Footballer Mark McCammon in action for Brighton. He claims Gillingham FC treated him and other black players less favourably than white colleagues . McCammon said that during his injury spell, he had to stay behind at the club for four hours longer than the other injured and non-injured players.He claimed this was on the 'strict instructions' of Mr Scally. 'Once the players had all left, I sat there watching mind-numbing daytime TV and Britain’s Got Talent,' he said. 'The process of waiting was designed to inflict maximum levels of frustration on me and it certainly had that impact. 'Sitting at the club instead of progressing with my operation was like watching paint dry.' The events which led up to McCammon’s dismissal were triggered on November 30, 2010, when south-east England had heavy snowfall. On that day, McCammon claims that he and two other black players - Josh Gowling and Curtis Weston - were told to make the four-mile drive from the house they shared to the club's medical rooms. 'One of my housemates had contacted another player who lived about two miles nearer to the club who was also due to attend the medical centre with us on that day,' McCammon's statement said. 'He was a white player who had informed us that the club physiotherapist had told him that he was not required to come in on that day because of the snow. Talks: After Gillingham's relegation to League Two at the end of the 2009/10 season, Paul Scally (pictured) brought in Andy Hessenthaler as manager and discussed striker Mark McCammon . 'There was a further player we contacted who was in the same boat - ie he needed to attend the club for physio on the same day. He lived further down in Kent in Maidstone and had a longer drive in. 'He was white and had been informed by the club staff that he also did not need to come in for the day because of the snowy conditions.' Later, McCammon said one of them received a text message threatening to dock them two weeks' wages unless they made it to the stadium by midday. When he arrived at the club, McCammon said he headed to manager Andy Hessenthaler's room to confront him about being 'racially intolerant' over the decision to order them in. He claimed that Hessenthaler reacted angrily. 'He lost his temper and flayed the contents of his table. He pushed the table over, throwing overboard the computer on it and all its other contents. 'It was the most aggressive and temperamental physical display of tantrum I had ever seen. 'The body poise in his language as he stood up to address me was a stance that stated, ""How dare you talk to me"". 'I was concerned he was going to attack me and I asked whether he was planning to hit me.' On trial: The claims by Mark McCammon come ahead of the trial of England star John Terry (pictured) on charges of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand, which Terry denies . McCammon was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed for aggressive conduct towards the manager and racism, it is claimed. After the club's demotion to League Two at the end of the 2009/10 season, Mr Scally sacked the management team and brought in Hessenthaler, who had been manager at Dover FC. During Mr Scally's initial discussions with Hessenthaler, they talked about McCammon who was 'regarded as a player who didn't have the best attitude and who had clashed with the previous manager'. Despite this, Mr Scally asked his new manager to focus on getting McCammon back playing regularly as he was the club's highest-paid player and one of its main strikers. Mr Scally's witness statement said: 'I wanted Andy and the rest of the management team to get the best out of him performance-wise as, for whatever reason, his playing record for the club and his goal ratio was poor and he appeared to be very injury-prone.' Regarding events on November 30, 2010, Mr Scally said McCammon was being aggressive, physically and verbally, after he confronted Hessenthaler in his room. The decision to dismiss McCammon was a unanimous one by all three members of the club's panel. Mr Scally said the allegation of racism by McCammon was 'maliciously made and without any merit' as a way of deflecting from the fact that he and his two black team-mates had been caught 'lying'. Mr Scally said that not to dismiss him would have sent the wrong message to the players and the management team about the type of behaviour tolerated at the club. The employment tribunal is being heard in Ashford over the next four days. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mark McCammon says Gillingham FC tried .

Poor: Scandal-plagued welfare-to-work provider, A4E has managed to get just 3.5 per cent of its job-seekers into long-term roles. Its chairman, Emma Harrison, is pictured . Scandal-plagued welfare-to-work provider, A4E has managed to get just 3.5 per cent of its jobseekers into long-term roles. Fewer than four out of 100 unemployed people who have gone through the firm have secured jobs that last more than 13 weeks. Almost 115,000 jobseekers were referred to A4e in the ten months to May 2012 under the government's work programme. Of those, just 4,020 secured jobs that lasted more than three months, according to a Channel 4 News investigation. The company has already been hit by damaging allegations of fraud. Its chairman, Emma Harrison, who paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011 despite A4e's dreadful record, was forced to quit earlier this year. The figures show that A4e - the second biggest provider of the work programme - is failing to meet its targets in the first year. It has to get 5.5 per cent of its jobseekers into sustainable roles every year to keep its contract. The 'expert' firm has even struggled to secure real jobs for applicants in the Olympic borough of Newham in East London, trailing behind even the local council. While the borough has secured 5000 sustainable jobs through its own job support scheme, A4e has managed to get just 92 people out of 2,837 participants, into sustainable jobs. The company also has contracts to help jobseekers in Merseyside, the East Midlands, South Yorkshire, Lancashire, the Thames Valley area and South Yorkshire. In the Thames Valley Area, just 2.8 per cent of jobseekers secured long term roles while in East London, just 3.3 per cent got jobs that lasted more than 13 weeks. Worrying: The 'expert' firm has even struggled to secure real jobs for applicants in the Olympic borough of Newham in East London, trailing behind even the local council . Margaret Hodge, the chair of the public accounts committee, which has been investigating A4e, said the figures were 'abysmal'. Mrs Hodge said: 'We have had a relentless stream of emails, brown envelopes from people...who have worked for A4e complaining about poor performance, allegations of fraud and malpractice.' She added that taxpayers had a right to know if the firm was failing to meet its targets. Current and former jobseekers involved with A4e told of their poor service at the company. Karen Turner, another A4e 'customer' described the 'humiliating' process of being made to take a chlamydia test on her first day on the programme. Not happy: Margaret Hodge, the chair of the public accounts committee, which has been investigating A4e, said the figures were 'abysmal' Philip Hammond, who is currently on the Work Programme in Bootle, Merseyside, described the programme as a 'scam', adding that the firm was 'not fit for purpose'. He said he had only had two phone calls from the company in six months and had not been offered a single job interview. According to calculations by Channel 4 News, under the terms of the Work Programme the company is likely to have received more than £45million in taxpayer funding. The government and A4e refused to confirm the figures as they relate to the first 10 months of the first year of the contract, rather than the full 12 months. A spokesman for A4e told Channel 4 News: 'The Official WP [work programme] statistics will be published in the autumn following rigorous auditing and data matching by DWP. 'As a provider, under the terms of our contract, we do not have permission to disclose or comment on performance data before that point.' He added: 'The Work Programme is just one year into a five year, outcome based, programme. The statistical data will undergo robust validation in DWP, compiled and released in accordance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. 'Any data released before then is therefore unreliable and risks misleading the public as to the performance of the Work Programme.' A Department of Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'The period covered by this data makes it virtually impossible for any provider to have built up a significant number of job outcome payments, most of which are only payable after someone has found a job and stayed in it for six months. 'To try to draw conclusions when most people have not even been on the programme for six months would be ludicrous.'","Fewer than four out of 100 unemployed people seen by the firm have secured jobs lasting more than 13 weeks .

A Sunday service inside a cathedral was dramatically interrupted after a large block of ice believed to have fallen from an aeroplane crashed through the roof. The congregation, who were packed inside Brentwood Cathedral in Essex, heard a loud explosion as the ice block hit the roof of the building. It caused roof slate and ice to fall outside the cathedral and resulted in damage to its beams and roof. Scary: A Sunday service inside Brentwood Cathedral, pictured, was dramatically interrupted after a large block of ice believed to have fallen from an aeroplane crashed through the roof . Father James MacKay, who was leading the Eucharistic prayer when the incident happened, said there was a 'massive explosion' about halfway through the celebration, causing everything inside the cathedral to stop. He told the BBC: 'I was trembling with a bit of shock. 'After a couple of seconds of shocked pause I said ""right, let's crack on"" and we did so.' An usher from inside the cathedral went to investigate the explosion and discovered the building had been hit from above. Fr MacKay said it caused a great deal of damage to the roof of the building, which is England's newest cathedral. Unusual: The Civil Aviation Authority said ice falling from planes is very rare . 'It went straight through the slate,' he said. Following the incident, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said ice falling from planes is very rare but said it can happen around hose connections and if washers fail. But a spokesman said: 'You can have a big lump of ice come off an aircraft as it descends into warmer air.' He added that increasingly the incidents are caused by natural meteorological phenomena. The CAA gets about 30 reports every year of ice falling from aircraft. Brentwood Cathedral was built between 1989 and 1991. The incident occurred on July 1 and the damage has now been repaired.","Congregation at Brentwood Cathedral, Essex, in shock after ice block fell from the heavens ."

Temp staff: Bill Johnson was in charge of the newly merged Prospect Energy and Duke Energy for less than an hour before he was ousted . In the history of golden parachutes it has to be the most generous of them all. The former boss of the largest electricity company in the US is to get a $44m payoff - for just 20 minutes work. Bill Johnson was in charge of the newly merged Prospect Energy and Duke Energy for less than an hour before he was ousted. According to Securities filings he could walk away with the colossal farewell package in what a former colleague has called ‘the most blatant example of corporate deceit’ he had ever seen. Utilities regulators are now considering investigating his abrupt resignation amid protests from shareholders. The Attorney General in North Carolina, where Duke is based, is also demanding it hand over board meeting minutes and other documents relating to the merger. But should Mr Johnson receive his package it will be more than the $26m that former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond will receive after he was forced to resign amid a lending rate rigging scandal. The $26billion merger of Duke Energy and Prospect Energy had taken 18 months to hammer out and would have cemented Duke’s position as the biggest electricity provider in America. Regulator the North Carolina Utilities Commission had been told that Mr Johnson would take over as head of the newly formed company. But according to Progress board member John Mullin III, Mr Johnson was asked to resign on Monday afternoon by the board some 20 minutes after the deal closed at 4.02pm having already won regulatory approval. Duke Energy chief executive Jim Rogers was then put in his place, the Los Angeles Times reported. Critics have claimed that the way it played out suggested it was choreographed beforehand. The motive could have been to ensure that the merger won regulatory approval or give Mr Johnson as good a payoff as possible. In a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Mullin said: ‘I do not believe that a single director of Progress would have voted for this transaction as structured with the knowledge that the CEO of Duke, Jim Rogers, would remain as the CEO of the combined company. Prominent: Duke Energy is based in North Carolina . 'In my opinion this is the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed during a long career on Wall Street’. Former Progress Energy board member Alfred Tollison Jr, added: ‘Frankly, I felt misled. ‘Just from circumstantial evidence you would have to think it didn't happen overnight, that there was a lot of forethought given to it.’ The reaction of the markets was swift and credit rating firm Standard & Poor’s put Duke on a watch list which could lead to a downgrade due to concerns over corporate governance. The drama also puts the spotlight on Mr Rogers again who has a remarkable record when it comes to coming out on top in mergers. A prolific networker, he frequently flies to Europe where he dines with heads of state and world leaders, racking up $406,000 on corporate jet expenses last year alone. Office: Bill Johnson was in charge of the newly merged Prospect Energy and Duke Energy for less than an hour before he was ousted . On two almost identical such mergers in the past he has wound up being the chief executive of the combined company - even if others were not so fortunate. Frank O'Donnell, the head of environmental campaigners Clean Air Watch, said: ‘In Washington, presidents come and go, but Jim Rogers seems to be forever’. Mr Johnson has declined to comment. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said: ‘We will be working with S&P in the coming weeks to resolve their 'credit watch' listing as expeditiously as possible.’","Bill Johnson is facing a $44m payoff after working for Prospect Energy and Duke Energy for 20 minutes .

Low-cost airline Wizz Air will become the first to make passengers pay to bring hand luggage into the cabin. Passengers travelling between Luton and the Polish city of Katowice will be charged £8 to carry items larger than a handbag, rucksack or laptop on board under trial policy being introduced next month. If the trial is successful the policy will be rolled out across the whole Wizz Air network. Heading for turbulence? Wizz Air is introducing extra fees for 'larger' hand baggage items . If the dimensions of a bag exceed 42cm x 32cm x 25cm, its owner will be expected to pay the additional fee to keep it with them - even if it fits inside an overhead locker. If the item is smaller, the passenger will be allowed to take it on board free of charge - as long as it fits underneath the seat in front of them. Customers paying the fee for a trolley case or other larger item of hand luggage will be able to board the plane early - after priority passengers - to ensure there is sufficient space in overhead lockers. Bags that measure 55cm x 40cm x 20cm or larger, or that weigh more than 10kg, must be checked into the hold. Small trolley cases such as the one pictured would be unlikely to meet Wizz Air's new criteria . Wizz Air claims the trial will 'reduce boarding hassle and improve on-time performance, and result in a better overall travel experience'. Travel industry commentator Bob Atkinson, from TravelSupermarket, described the maximum size for free hand luggage under Wizz Air's trial policy as 'tiny'. 'If you are trying to avoid paying to check in bags by using hand luggage, this is bad news,' he said. 'It forces people to travel with next to nothing if they don't want to pay extra.' Mr Atkinson said customers could get a shock if they found themselves being charged extra for what they thought was a 'regular-sized' piece of hand luggage. 'Customers are unlikely to be happy at having to pay for something that they have previously taken for granted,' he said. 'I would be horrified if I saw other airlines following this idea - but I wouldn't be surprised to see other budget carriers looking at this. 'It's all about revenue.' Wizz Air currently flies from Luton to a range of destinations across Europe, including Prague, Warsaw, Split in Croatia, Vilnius in Lithuania, and Ljubljana in Slovenia.","Wizz Air passengers will have to pay for any item that does not fit under their seat under new trial scheme .

Tragedy: Liam Shackleton died from multiple injuries after he fell from the bedroom window of his grandfather's flat in in Leeds . The sister of a six-year-old boy who plunged to his death from the eighth floor of a tower block after child locks were removed from a window may have tried to save him, an inquest has heard. Liam Shackleton died from multiple injuries after he accidentally fell from the bedroom window of his grandfather’s flat in Leeds in May last year. His traumatised 10-year-old sister Tiffany is believed to have grabbed on to her brother as he climbed on to the window sill from a chest of drawers and . may have been trying to prevent him from falling, the inquest at . Wakefield Coroner’s Court heard. Retaining locks which would prevent the window from opening too wide had been removed since new double glazing was installed in the flats in Lindsay Mount, in the Lincoln Green area of the city, in 2005, the inquest was told. Robert Goor, head of repairs and maintenance for council housing, said the locks were fitted as standard but could be moved or removed with an allen key. He said Peter Shackleton, who was the tenant of the flat and Liam’s grandfather, may have removed the locks which were supplied with the windows. Investigations found the locks were in place on one window in the living room. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner David Hinchliff said: 'When the windows were fitted, they should have had these retaining locks on. 'The point of these retaining locks is they are removable, adjustable, you can slide it up and down to adjust the gap the window goes to and you could, if you wanted to, remove them altogether.' He added: 'The point of the locks is, if you do have active children, they can prevent the window opening to a dangerous level. 'Had these blocks been on and set at a level which would restrict the width the window could open, this accident could have been prevented.' He said he would write to the landlord of the . property in Lindsay Mount, in the Burmantofts area, and recommend they . look into fitting all windows with static inhibitors to prevent them . opening too wide. He also said he would . recommend regular inspections of the properties to ensure safety . features are in place and working. Liam’s mother, Tanya Shackleton, who sat with her husband Martin, left the room in tears at one point as Mr Hinchliff described her son as 'a very active little boy, full of mischief'. Retaining locks which would prevent the . window from opening too wide had been removed since new double glazing . was installed in the flats (pictured) in 2005, the inquest was told. Liam fell from the eighth floor . Mrs Shackleton said that her father-in-law had not removed the retaining locks from the windows. Mr Hinchliff said to her: 'Your belief is there were never any little blocks on the bedroom windows.' The inquest heard that Liam, with his mother, father and siblings, had been living in his grandfather’s one-bedroom flat for three weeks while they waited to be rehoused. On the day of Liam’s death, on May 31, the family were in the bedroom of the flat for around three hours while workers replaced carpet tiles in the living room. Furniture from the living room had also been moved into the bedroom, including a chest of drawers that had been moved underneath the window to make room for extra furniture. After the carpet was laid, the adults . began to move the furniture back into the living room, leaving Liam and . his sister playing in the bedroom. A short time later, at around 5.15pm, Liam’s sister came into the living room to tell her mother Liam had fallen. She later told police that she was getting cross with her brother as he . was not listening to her when she told him to stop climbing on the chest . of drawers. Mr Hinchliff said: 'She said she had hold . of Liam when he fell from the window. She might have realised he was in . some danger and tried to prevent it.' He added: 'She had got cross with her brother because I don’t think he . would listen or do what she was telling him and she said he accidentally . fell from the window. She might have been trying to get him down.' Mr Hinchliff said the window in the bedroom was opened as the room became 'very warm and stuffy' and the adults were smoking. Liam’s uncle Shaun Shackleton found the young boy lying on the grass outside and left him with his mother while he went to get an ambulance. Liam was taken by ambulance to the Leeds General Infirmary but died a short time later. Mr Hinchliff told Mr and Mrs Shackleton: 'When you are living in what . was an unsuitable and cramped condition because of the circumstances you . were in, it does mean even further diligence and supervision has to be . made when you have hyperactive children, who understandably have no . sense of danger and are too young to have regard for their own safety.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Shackleton, 36, said they wanted to move on with their lives. He added that he agreed with the coroner’s recommendations. Two men, aged 57 and 36, a 28-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl were arrested on suspicion of child neglect but were not charged.","Liam Shackleton died from multiple injuries after he accidentally fell from bedroom window .

Steven Holliday was accused of ruining the career of a junior female employee because she could not satisfy his 'sexual demands' A married energy boss was yesterday publicly accused of ruining the career of a junior female employee because she could not satisfy his ‘sexual demands’. Steven Holliday, chief executive of the National Grid, is said to have abused his powerful position to pursue the young woman and control her fledgling career. The extraordinary claim was made by an audience member at the annual shareholders’ meeting of Marks and Spencer, of which Mr Holliday is a non-executive director. During a question-and-answer session with 2,000 shareholders, a woman stood up and accused the 55-year-old of breaching ‘his own ethics policy’ regarding her daughter. She added: ‘He talks about supporting the young, yet he pursued her, used his power to control her job and destroyed her career when she could no longer meet his sexual demands.’ National Grid have confirmed they were made aware of the allegations in 2010 but dropped the matter after carrying out an investigation. He is chairman of the remuneration committee at Marks and Spencer and was sitting on the panel to be questioned by the shareholders when the outburst began. The woman began her question by addressing another panel member, saying: ‘How can you support Steven Holliday’s position chairing the committee which determines executive pay when he has breached his own ethics policy with my daughter?’ Gasps echoed around the auditorium as security staff fumbled to switch off her microphone, but she continued to talk until she was ushered out of the building with her husband. Pictured centre stage, Steven Holliday was challenged by a woman in the audience before she was escorted from the hall .

And she insisted her daughter, believed to be in her early thirties, had not been in a relationship with Mr Holliday. The claims are highly embarrassing for Mr Holliday, who is married and is believed to have at least two daughters. He has been group CEO of National Grid since 2006 and last year earned £2.2million. He was appointed to the Marks and Spencer board in July 2004. After the meeting, Mr Holliday left through a back door but National Grid later issued a statement dismissing the woman’s claim.

Seven former Labour ministers are set to pocket more than £4million in public money by kickstarting their fading political careers as elected police commissioners. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott is expected to earn £155,000 a year in pay and pension contributions if he becomes the first police and crime boss for Humberside. Lord Prescott leads a roll call of Labour rejects and retreads who are seeking to cash in on Government plans to create 41 elected bureaucrats to set police priorities around the country. Six other former ministers – Tony Lloyd, Alun Michael, Jane Kennedy, Vera Baird, James Plaskitt and Paddy Tipping – will all pocket between £106,000 and £141,000 a year by topping up their MP and ministerial pensions. John Prescott (pictured last week) is standing for the role of Police and Crime Commissioner, taking his earnings to £155,000 if he is successful . Among the six other ex-Labour ministers going for the jobs are (l to r) Paddy Tipping, Tony Lloyd and Vera Baird . The remaining three are (l to r) James Plaskitt, Jane Kennedy and Alun Michael . Research by the Conservative Party has found that former Labour MEP Simon Murphy will also take home around £116,000 if he wins as commissioner for West Mercia Police. The details emerged as Labour and the Tories launched their nationwide campaigns for the Police and Crime Commissioner elections, which are due to be held on November 15. The winning candidates will serve for a four-year term. If Lord Prescott succeeds, he will receive a salary of £75,000, some £10,000 more than an MP currently earns. He will also benefit from around £20,000 a year in pension contributions from the final salary scheme which is being run by local police authorities for the commissioners. Lord Prescott collects an annual pension of around £37,000 as an ex-MP and a further £23,000 a year in ministerial pension. He also receives further payments for after-dinner speeches and media appearances. Lord Prescott could become the first police and crime boss for Humberside . Tony Lloyd, a former chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, is set to earn £100,000 a year if he becomes police commissioner for Greater Manchester, while Alun Michael for South Wales Police and Jane Kennedy for Merseyside Police, will earn £85,000 a year from their salaries. Mr Tipping for Nottinghamshire and Mr Murphy are expected to earn £75,000, £10,000 more than Mr Plaskitt who is standing for Warwickshire. Vera Baird is standing for election as Northumbria’s commissioner with a salary of £85,000. Each can expect to gain £20,000 a year in crime commissioner pension contributions, while the average pension for a retiring MP is £21,000 a year. Based on these figures, the seven former MPs and Mr Murphy would collect a total of £1,012,000 for at least the next four years. The Tories have just one former MP running, though not without controversy. Michael Mates, 78, who is standing in Hampshire, saw his political career wrecked after disclosures about his close links with the fugitive financier Asil Nadir. His basic salary will be £85,000 but after 36 years in Parliament he will also have a large Parliamentary pension.

"By . Andrew Pierce . PUBLISHED: . 18:21 EST, 18 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:46 EST, 19 July 2012 . Nick Clegg was accused of hypocrisy yesterday after it emerged that his team of political advisers has ballooned from three to 14 at a cost to the taxpayer of £900,000 a year. The figure represents the lion’s share of the £1.3million annual bill for the 21 Liberal Democrat special advisers. Details of the increase, which is another breach of a manifesto promise, were slipped out in a Downing Street statement as MPs broke up for their 47-day summer recess. Unpopular: Clegg's approval rating has reached a new low of minus 59, down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of May 2010 when the Coalition was formed . In Opposition Mr Clegg pledged that a Lib Dem government would never burden the taxpayer with the bill for special advisers, nicknamed spads. In September 2009, in a policy document A Better Politics for Less, he pledged: ‘The [Labour] government employs 74 special advisers, an increase of 90 per cent since 1995, at a cost to the taxpayer of £5.9million each year. ‘These are political jobs and therefore should be funded by political parties. Special advisers will not be paid for by the taxpayer.’ But now he is in government, the Deputy Prime Minister has abandoned the commitment to slashing Whitehall’s ‘Spadocracy’. He had three political advisers when the Coalition began, now there are 14. The cost of his private office has soared by 200 per cent in a year at a time when he is demanding deep cuts in public spending. The highest paid adviser is Jonathan Oates, Mr Clegg’s chief of staff, whose £98,000 salary comfortably tops the £89,000 paid to junior ministers. Three other advisers are paid £80,000 a year, including Neil Sherlock, a millionaire accountant who has donated £88,000 to Lib Dem funds. He is the Lib Dems’ first director of government relations. His former employer, City giant KPMG, already earns vast sums from Government accounting contracts. Julia Goldsworthy, special adviser to Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, is paid £74,000. Until her defeat at the last election she was Liberal Democrat MP for Falmouth and Camborne, with a salary of £65,738 – so she has received an £8,000 pay rise from public funds since losing her seat. The rest are paid an average of £64,500 – only slightly less than the £65,750 paid to MPs. Labour accused Mr Clegg of double standards. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘Even from a man who is used to breaking promises, this is total hypocrisy from Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems. ‘His party used to say special advisers shouldn’t be funded by the taxpayer but now, as this shambolic government lurches from crisis to crisis he’s attempting to shore himself up with a raft of new political appointees paid for by the public. You can’t believe a word he says. Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg give a speech at the Soho Depot in Smethwick announcing a 9.4 billion package of rail projects earlier this week . ‘Neil Sherlock should not be rewarded for his donations to the Liberal Democrats with a publicly funded job.’ Some of the Lib Dem advisers are monitoring the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence, and the education and health departments, which are all run by Tory Cabinet ministers. Yet the spending spree, which is designed to burnish the Lib Dems’ battered image, has done nothing to halt the slide in Mr Clegg’s approval ratings. The most recent YouGov poll found that Mr Clegg’s approval rating had reached a new low of minus 59, down from a heady plus 53 in the halcyon days of May 2010 when the Coalition was formed. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘They do not work directly for the party, they work for Lib Dem ministers in the government.’ David Cameron is also under fire from his own MPs for reneging on his pledge to cut the number of staff on the Downing Street payroll. In a speech in September 2009, he said: ‘If we are going to take our country through these difficult times those who lead must lead by powerful example. That means getting our own house in order and cutting the cost of politics.’ The Coalition agreement, published in May 2010, promised to introduce a limit on the number of special advisers. The number has now reached 81 – one more than under Gordon Brown. The total salary bill is £6.2million, up 30 per cent on the £4.8million in the first year of government. The bulk of the rise is accounted for by the increase in Lib Dem advisers. Mr Cameron has 19 special advisers including Andrew Cooper, his personal pollster, and Craig Oliver, the director of communications, who are both paid £140,000. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘The more advisers this government recruits the bigger the mess it seems to make of things. ‘What is the point of them? If they were experts in policy the cost might just be acceptable. But they are not. ‘Most of them look no more than 15 years old and seem more suited to making the tea than advising senior Cabinet ministers.’",'These are political jobs and should be funded by political parties. They will not be paid for by the taxpayer' - Nick Clegg's words in opposition in 2009 .

Arrivals: James Murdoch, left, and Lachlan Murdoch, right, sons of Rupert Murdoch, attend Allen & Company's Sun Valley Conference today . On the tech side, guests include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com Chief Jeff Bezos, Google Inc's Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. Facebook, one of the most closely watched and highly anticipated companies to go public, fell flat with its IPO in May after technical glitches on the Nasdaq and questions about its ability to increase advertising revenue. The fallout from Facebook's public debut and how that will affect other tech companies' plans of going public will certainly be a topic of conversation among the moguls. So will the fate of Yahoo, an Internet icon that is struggling to regain its leadership status after being usurped by Google, Facebook, Apple , and others. Yahoo's interim CEO Ross Levinsohn is currently on the guest list, but he may not make the event due to the annual meeting of Yahoo shareholders next week while former Yahoo CEOs Jerry Yang and Terry Semel are also expected to attend the conference. Thumbs up: Apple CEO Tim Cook gives the camera a big greeting upon arrival . Jolly: Film producer Harvey Weinstein, left, enjoys a laugh upon arrival, and Robert Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), right, looks a bit more wary of photographers . Apple CEO Tim Cook also is slated to attend. His predecessor, the late Steve Jobs, shunned the event, though his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, is listed among this year's guests. One topic on the minds of media executives will be the next version of Apple TV. 'I'm sure there will be lots of speculation with the full version of Apple TV. If and when that happens, that will have a major impact on how Internet video is consumed in the living room,' said Ken Allen, director in Blackstone's technology advisory practice. Vivendi, the French media conglomerate, could be looking to unload some assets now that long-time CEO Jean-Bernard Levy has stepped down. One Vivendi asset widely considered to be ripe for disposal is its 60 per cent, or $8 billion stake, in U.S. video game publisher Activision Blizzard, whose CEO Bobby Kotick, a Sun Valley conference regular, is registered for this year's edition as well. Clearance: Security is seen at the door of the Sun Valley Inn at the Allen & Co Media Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho where most of the events will take place . The company could also spin off Moroccan telecom company Maroc Telecom or mull a Murdoch-style split of its business into a telecom and media arm, analysts and bankers have said. Lucian Grainge, the head of Universal Music Group, another Vivendi asset, will also be in attendance as his company continues its battle for regulatory approval of EMI Group. John Malone, the CEO of Liberty Media is expected, as his media holding company tries to seize control of Sirius XM Radio , the satellite radio provider it floated a $530million loan to in 2009 to help it avoid bankruptcy. Television and film producers also may be looking for new avenues to sell their content as online players try to bolster their offerings. 'The content companies are in the best position. They just need to continue to figure out the best way to monetize their content through new mediums,' said Jonathan Boyar, managing director of Boyar Value Fund, which owns shares of Cablevision Systems , CBS Corp, Time Warner and Comcast. The November presidential election is 'another source of uncertainty in terms of what sort of regulation we'll have, what the tax outlook will look like, what the healthcare will look like,' said Blackstone's Allen.","Event is magnet for media and tech stalwarts, as well as CEOs .

Defeat: Cherry Pusey, alongside her husband John, have lost a 20-year campaign to close the layby near their home which passing motorists used when they were caught short . Motorists who made a couple’s life a misery by using a layby opposite their home when caught short may have been annoying but did not amount to a nuisance, judges have ruled. The Court of Appeal’s decision called a halt to John and Cherry Pusey’s 20-year campaign to close the layby and left them facing a six-figure legal bill. Mr and Mrs Pusey had pointed to hundreds of incidents of drivers relieving themselves in the layby, as well as leaving their engines running and lights flashing. They even employed a top environmental consultant in their quest to have the layby shut down. Mr Pusey said his wife was once threatened with a gun whilst investigating a pick-up truck parked there and the couple were assaulted after remonstrating with a driver urinating within sight of the front gate of their Exmoor home. The layby, on the B3224 at Wheddon Cross, Somerset, had become a focus for petty theft, vandalism, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour – including blaring music, shouting and swearing – the court in London was told yesterday. Refusing to order Somerset County Council to shut the layby, the Court of Appeal judges ruled that – despite all the couple had endured – the motorists’ misbehaviour did not amount to a ‘nuisance’ in the eyes of the law. Lord Justice Patten said Mr and Mrs Pusey had been complaining about the layby since at least 1993. However, their attempts to persuade officials to grass it over met with ‘considerable opposition from local residents’. The Puseys argued the layby interfered with the ‘reasonable enjoyment’ of their home and garden, making it impossible for them to relax. However, the council insisted it had no power to close part of the highway and any criminal misbehaviour was a matter for the police. The layby, had become a focus for petty theft, vandalism, fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour, the court in London was told yesterday . The couple, who set up a CCTV camera to capture anti-social behaviour, were refused an injunction at Bristol High Court last year by Judge Roderick Denyer, who ruled that, viewed objectively, their complaints were ‘extremely exaggerated’. Giving their reasons for dismissing Mr and Mrs Pusey’s appeal against that ruling, Lord Justice Patten – sitting with Lords Justice Ward and Longmore – ruled there had been ‘no actionable nuisance’. The couple had to prove there was ‘a real interference with the comfort or convenience of living according to the standards of the average person’. ‘Abnormal sensitivity to noise or other matters complained of is not therefore sufficient to found a cause of action’, he said. The use of the layby was not excessive and the Court of Appeal could not ‘properly interfere’ with Judge Denyer’s decision. The couple were also refused permission to appeal further to the Supreme Court.","Court of Appeal halts John and Cherry Pusey's 20-year campaign to close layby .

It seems that two famous British Kates - Middleton and Moss - have been influencing the way UK women dress - and, in particular, how much flesh they choose to bare. We may have invented the miniskirt, but these days British women are some of the most covered-up in Europe, wearing longer skirts and less revealing tops than their continental counterparts, according to new research. British modesty: The conservative style of the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and comments made by Kate Moss, right, are proving influential in the way British women choose to dress . Skirts in Britain tend to hang, on average, 10cm longer than those worn in France and Italy, while . the majority of British women cover their upper arms, cleavages and . legs above the knee, according to research carried out by Parisian fashion house Georgede. The findings revealed that French . and Italian women wear the shortest skirts, followed by the Spanish and . Germans, then the Scandinavians, Austrians and Brits. In fact, only women in Luxembourg wear longer skirts than those in Britain do, but their clothes are still more revealing overall. Georgede's MD Phillip Bendavid said: 'It is very much the Kate effect. Kate Middleton and Kate Moss are leading the charge. 'Kate Moss’ recent comment that women should cover up more is very much a reflection of what is happening in the UK.'Increasingly, British women are becoming more conservative in the way they dress.'The Duchess of Cambridge is also definitely influencing the way British women are dressing.'For example, you never see her inappropriately dressed. She covers up those areas that women are very conscious about.' Continental curves: European women including Italian Nancy Dell'Olio, left, and Spain's Elen Rivas, right, have been found to bare more flesh than their British counterparts . A survey of 1,000 British women found 61 per cent of those aged 35 and over were most likely to avoid baring their upper arms, and 54 per cent of this age group cover their knees. Only 37 per cent of the over 35s and only 19 per cent of those under 35 choose to cover their cleavage. Mr Bendavid added that he approved of British women's new-found fondness British for covering-up. He said: 'Imagination is a wonderful thing. A women is often more alluring when sufficiently well-covered.'","British women wear longer skirts and less revealing tops than those in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Scandinavia and Austria .

There were more than a few raised eyebrows at the Olympic closing ceremony last night - and not solely thanks to Boris Johnson's dance moves. Onlookers in the 70,000-strong audience at the Olympic stadium were baffled by the inclusion of Victoria Beckham's high end designer label in a fashion hall of fame that featured in the lavish show. The Spice Girl's fledgling brand took its place on the list of showcased designers with Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. Shoe-in: Georgia May Jagger wore a gold fit-and-flare Victoria Beckham design on stage during the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games last night . Georgia May Jagger (second from right) in Victoria Beckham's design took . her place alongside fellow models, from left, Lily Cole, Karen Elson . (back row), Stella Tenant, Kate Moss, Lily Donaldson, Jourdan Dunn, . Naomi Campbell and David Gandy . Mrs Beckham – who only launched her fashion range in 2007 - was included on a supposedly selective roll call of the finest fashion designers the country has ever produced. Only nine of the very best – namely Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Christopher Kane, Burberry, Erdem, Jonathan Saunders, Stephen Jones and Paul Smith - were featured. With her fashions only a few years old – and receiving lukewarm reviews among some critics – observers will question whether her presence on the list is little more than a giant advert. There was a supermodel for each great British fashion designer featured in the fashion segment, with Georgia May Jagger modelling Beckham’s wares. Giant advert? Onlookers were baffled to see Victoria Beckham's fledgling label included in a showcase of Britain's most legendary designers . Ms Beckham designed the bespoke . fit-and-flare piece in gold gazar especially for yesterday evening's . event, saying in a recent interview that when she created it, she was . thinking of 'the ideas of high performance - in terms of quality, fit, . fabric and stitching,' and adding that she revisited one of . her signature designs. Eleven cutters and designers are reported to help Mrs Beckham to design the clothes lines that bear her name. And the results have received mixed reviews in the fashion world. There have been accusations that the designs are seriously overpriced, with dresses in her mainline brand costing around £1,650 each, and a pair of leather leggings bearing her name once priced at £1,250. One of her lines - entitled, ‘Victoria, Victoria Beckham’ – was recently marketed as being affordable and good value for money. But the marketing caused ridicule when it emerged that a sleeveless wool shift dress cost £500 while a long-sleeved day dress cost £750. She has also been criticised for marketing herself as a ‘British’ designer while having her clothes made overseas in Morocco and Portugal, instead of in Britain.","Georgia May Jagger walked the catwalk wearing a gold dress designed for the occasion by Victoria Beckham .
