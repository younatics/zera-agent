"Petr Cech may not want to compare this Chelsea team to others he has been involved with, but the long-serving goalkeeper believes they have 'huge potential' this season. Jose Mourinho's men have been the campaign's most impressive side, with last weekend's loss at Newcastle their only defeat in 24 matches in all competitions. That ended talk of the west Londoners going through the season unbeaten, yet they remain top of the Premier League after continuing their 100 per cent record at Stamford Bridge by overcoming Hull 2-0 on Saturday. Petr Cech gives out instructions to his Chelsea team-mates in a rare appearance for the veteran keeper . An injury to Thibaut Courtois saw Cech make his first top-flight start of the season against the Tigers, with the Blues' dominating throughout despite their display lacking the panache of other matches. 'You always look for a response when you have a game when you don't win and it is not going the way you want,' Cech said. 'You need to find a way to win the next game. It was not an easy one but we managed to get a good result out of that and we controlled it for most of the game because Hull didn't have a shot on target. 'It is obviously nice to have the game time and the most pleasant part is to have the clean sheet and three points because Hull made it hard for us although we had a good start. 'We scored an early goal but for a long time in the game it was just 1-0. The second goal obviously made a big difference and with the sending off we could control the game.' Thibaut Courtois has been Jose Mourinho's No 1 between the sticks for Chelsea this season . While it was not the impressive display Chelsea fans have become accustomed to, there were flashes of the quality which makes them favourites to add to their haul of four league titles. Cech was between the sticks for three of those triumphs and, while not keen to compare this team to others, believes they can achieve something special. 'We only judge the team when the season is finished and you can see how many trophies the team has in hand,' the 32-year-old told the official club website, www.chelseafc.com. 'It is difficult to say which Chelsea side in history was the best because a lot of them won trophies. 'This team has huge potential, it has been doing really well this season, we are top of the league and have been doing some brilliant games but we are empty-handed at the moment, and I don't like to compare the teams until the season is finished.' Chelsea's first chance of a trophy comes in the Capital One Cup, with Cech likely to remain in goal for Tuesday's quarter-final at Derby. Cech waves to the Chelsea faithful after the Blues kept up their excellent form with a win against Hull . Steve McClaren's side are amongst those vying for promotion from the Championship - a division Hull could soon find themselves unless they buck up their ideas. The Tigers have not won a league match in nine attempts and could do with a moment of magic to turn decent displays into three points. Such inspiration is unlikely to come from the boots of Hatem Ben Arfa, though. Steve Bruce is unsure whether Hatam Ben Arfa will play for Hull again after the playmaker's exodus . An exciting deadline-day loan signing from Newcastle, the 27-year-old has become persona non grata at the KC Stadium and has been omitted from the squad since last month's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United. Bruce retains there has been no bust-up with Ben Arfa, although does not expect him to don the amber and black shirt again. 'To be honest, I don't know if Hatem is in Paris,' the Hull boss said in response to reports the midfielder has returned home. 'That's the truth. The playmaker - on loan from Newcastle - has failed to impress for Steve Bruce's side . 'As for not playing again for Hull City, then at the moment he's not in the squad and the transfer window opens in January. 'There are still conversations to be had with him, but at the moment he is not in the squad and he hasn't earned the right to be in the squad at the moment. 'I don't know if the report that he is in France, or whatever it is, is true. I'm not sure.'","Chelsea maintained their three-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Hull on Saturday .

"Ronny Deila will prioritise tying down his existing stars ahead of signing new ones when the transfer window opens at the turn of the year. With his Celtic side still in four competitions, the Norwegian admits he would like to make ‘one or two’ additions to his squad in the January window. However, with Kris Commons out of contract in the summer, John Guidetti coming to the end of his deal at Manchester City and Virgil van Dijk the subject of constant speculation, Deila intends on dealing with current players before his mind turns to fresh faces. Ronny Deila has admitted he will concentrate on keeping hold of his current players when the window opens . John Guidetti's Manchester City contract ends soon, and Celtic would like a permanent deal for the striker . Asked if the priority was ensuring his current stars prolonged their stays, Deila replied: ‘Yes, that is the case. It is much easier to develop what you have, when you know what you have. To get people in, is like getting presents. You never know what you get. It could be nice or something you have to throw away. ‘It’s very interesting to get presents but it does not always turn out the way you want to. ‘But you know what you already have. And you know players like Guidetti will be better (in the future). They are young. That’s the kind of players we want to get in so we can progress as a team and hopefully get to that level we want to be at in Europe. ‘We want to try and get Guidetti to go through. Keeping Virgil and Kris, these are important. There is always speculation over Virgil van Dijk, pictured training before Celtic's game against Dundee United . Kris Commons (centre) is also out of contract in the summer, so Deila is looking at keeping hold of him . ‘We also have to look for players who can add to the squad and make them better. If we can do that then we will be in a better position in February than we are right now. ‘The negotiations (with Guidetti) are going on. There is progress all the time. We will see if we can get what we want. If we do, everyone will be happy.’ Rangers, Dundee and Inter Milan stand between Celtic and progress in the League Cup, Scottish Cup and Europa League in February while only four points now separates the champions from Dundee United and Aberdeen in the Premiership. And, although optimistic for what the second segment of the season might hold, defeat at Tannadice last Sunday left the Norwegian casting a critical eye over what’s transpired under his watch so far. Celtic are currently still in four competitions this season, and Deila would like to add one or two to his ranks . Guidetti has impressed on his loan move from Manchester City this season . ‘When I see the possession and pressure we have and how we are controlling games, it is about getting possession into goal chances,’ he said. ‘With the potential we have, I would give us a five, six (out of 10) maybe. ‘We have a long way to go but it is quite good also. ‘This club is a sleeping bear. It is a huge club, we have so many talented players and good staff. 'We have just have to have the energy to work and progress, want to learn and get better. If you have that you can reach your goals.’ Meanwhile, Aleksander Tonev’s agent has claimed Werder Bremen were interested in ending the Bulgarian’s troubled spell at Celtic. The on-loan Aston Villa winger’s appeal against his seven-game SFA ban for a racial slur on Aberdeen defender Shay Logan was thrown out last week. Celtic have stood by Tonev and a deal to cut-short his time in Britain would be complicated by the fact they paid Villa a year’s loan fee in the summer. Agent Nikolay Zheynov said: ‘Werder have again shown interest in him, but at this stage we don’t yet know whether the transfer will go through.’","Kris Commons is out of contract in the summer, while John Guidetti is coming to the end of his Manchester City deal .

'If the flight comes out of his dart Cookie will quite happily take 20 seconds to pick it up, just to keep me waiting. It's Peter Manley-style tactics and mind games. 'He's a bit better than me, though, so if I beat him it will give me several years' worth of bragging rights over him.' Cook explained that he started playing darts when on tour of India almost a decade ago. The PDC shared a picture on Twitter of Alexandra Palace being prepared for the World Championships . The stage at Alexandra Palace is set for the tournament to commence on Thursday in north London . 'Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison brought a dartboard and I got involved in their games,' he added.

'I do it properly — exactly the right height from the floor and I make sure I stand the correct distance away. 'The hotel managers have nothing to worry about.

"On Sunday, Ashley Barnes scored to rescue a point for Burnley against the might of Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. But in March 2013, while playing for Brighton in the Championship, Barnes was far from the hero as he picked up a seven-game ban for tripping a referee. With the Seagulls losing 1-0 to Bolton in the dying minutes, the midfielder saw red and lashed out at official Nigel Miller, landing himself in hot water with the Football Association. Ashley Barnes (centre) was dismissed in March 2013, while playing for Brighton, for tripping the referee . Barnes (left) was initially given a four-game ban, but it was extended to seven after being reviewed by a panel . In a fan-filmed video, you can make out Barnes (left) sticking out a boot to trip the referee Nigel Miller . At the time, he was handed a red card and an automatic four-game ban, as it was his second dismissal of the campaign. But later, the FA increased the ban to seven matches, citing his behaviour as constituting 'an offence whereby the standard punishment that would otherwise apply was clearly insufficient'. The FA had ruled that the incident displayed 'truly exceptional circumstances' and as such it was referred to an independent three-man commission who could recommend a further ban. A year and a half later, Barnes is plying his trade in the top level of English football, and has scored three goals in four Premier League games for a Burnley side battling to stay in the division. Brighton are in a similar position in the Championship, having not won a game since November 4th. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch a fan-filmed video of the trip .

"A 26 year old Californian former employee of Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has been arrested for starting a spinoff version of the drug dealing Silk Road website. Wearing a hooded sweatshirt with 'Internet Better' on the back, Blake Benthall, known online as Defcon, appeared in federal court in San Francisco after his arrest earlier today. He faced several charges, including conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking, which carries a potential life sentence and a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. Benthall was an active Twitter user, describing himself as a 'rocket scientist, bitcoin dreamer' Authorities said the copycat version of Silk Road attracted about 150,000 active users since Blake Benthall started it in December, acting as its owner and operator. They said it generated monthly sales of at least $8 million as it was used by thousands of people peddling illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to buyers worldwide. Authorities said the original site generated more than $1 billion in illicit business since 2011. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Haun told U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley that Benthall was a flight risk, was a danger to the community and should be held without bail after he waived his rights and 'did admit to everything,' including running the copycat website. Calling Benthall a 'severe flight risk' who had acquired fake identify documents, Haun said investigators found $100,000 in cash in his apartment after he earned $400,000 in monthly commissions on $8 million monthly revenue since December. Corley ordered Benthall returned to a federal lockup until a bail hearing Friday. Benthall's attorney, Daniel Blank, declined to comment except to say the issue of bail must be resolved. Friends of Benthall said they were stunned by his arrest. 'I'm shocked to hear this,' said one. 'He's a genuine nice guy and this has sent shock waves amongst the people that know him who had no idea. 'We trust the courts will be able to set facts straight'. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that Benthall created 'Silk Road 2.0,' a 'nearly identical criminal enterprise' website, about five weeks after the government shut down the original version in October 2013. Benthall's social media profiles were still running today - but his own personal website had disappeared . Authorities said the original site generated more than $1 billion in illicit business since 2011. 'Let's be clear — this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison,' he said. 'Those looking to follow in the footsteps of alleged cybercriminals should understand that we will return as many times as necessary to shut down noxious online criminal bazaars. We don't get tired.' FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said, 'Benthall should have known that those who hide behind the keyboard will ultimately be found.' Authorities said the new version of Silk Road attracted about 150,000 active users since Benthall started it in December, acting as its owner and operator. They said it was used by thousands of people peddling illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to buyers worldwide. Benthall faces a prosecution similar to that faced by Ross William Ulbricht, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he founded and ran the original Silk Road website. Ulbricht remains incarcerated, awaiting a January trial in New York. The alleged homepage to Silk Road 2.0, the successor website to Silk Road . Authorities said the copycat website was virtually identical to Silk Road, appearing exclusively on the Tor network, which cloaks the locations of Internet servers and users, and requiring all transactions to be paid with the virtual currency bitcoin. Initially, they said, Benthall even went by Ulbricht's moniker, 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' before switching to 'Defcon.' They said offerings on Silk Road 2.0 consisted overwhelmingly of illegal drugs, including hundreds of listings for psychedelics, Ecstasy, marijuana and opioids, plus phony identification documents and computer hacking tools and services. Following the arrest of Blake Benthall, the site showed this message . They said a break in the investigation occurred when an undercover investigator from Homeland Security Investigations infiltrated the website's support staff, gaining access to private, restricted areas of the site where the investigator could interact directly with Benthall. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said Thursday that federal authorities must remain vigilant. 'We can't play whack-a-mole here — close down one Silk Road and let another one pop up,' the New York Democrat said. 'Hopefully we can put an end to this.' 'Let's be clear — this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison,' he said. 'Those looking to follow in the footsteps of alleged cybercriminals should understand that we will return as many times as necessary to shut down noxious online criminal bazaars.

That affection will be temporarily forgotten on Monday evening when Liverpool host Swansea at Anfield.

"MPs yesterday passed an historic vote to stop TV licence fee dodgers from going to jail. Politicians from all three main parties agreed to strip the BBC of its powers to prosecute viewers in the criminal courts. It is a victory for campaigners who compared existing laws – which allow people to be sent to prison simply because they are unable or unwilling to pay the £145.50 annual charge – to a ‘banana republic’. We know what you're watching: A TV Licensing enforcement official during a previous crackdown . Debate: The BBC has voiced fears that it will lose revenue if it no longer has the power to prosecute . Under the new proposals, fee evasion will become a civil offence punishable with a fine, similar to missing a gas bill or not paying your Sky TV subscription. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen – who jointly proposed the law change after gathering the support of 150 backbenchers – welcomed the vote, saying existing laws are a ‘shameful blot on our justice system’. The proposal also won the backing of Crown Prosecution Service director Alison Saunders and former BBC chairman Michael Grade. In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates’ court cases. Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines. Yesterday, the 19 MPs on a committee considering the new Deregulation Bill voted in favour of an amendment that could end criminal sanctions when the BBC’s charter comes up for renewal in 2016. Support: Former BBC chairman Michael Grade was in favour of a law change after 190,000 were prosecuted . The change – which is expected to become law by the autumn – calls for a year-long review of BBC funding with detailed examination of the case for decriminalisation. The review’s findings will then be presented to the BBC Trust and both Houses of Parliament before further law changes end criminal sanctions for licence fee evasion. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Bridgen compared the BBC’s  current draconian powers to those of a third-world dictatorship. He said: ‘Imagine the condemnation if the BBC had learnt of a banana republic introducing a poll tax on its citizens, irrespective of income, for them to be able to have access to television. Imagine also if this poll tax were enforced by the threat of prison sentences which disproportionately saw women with children detained by the state. ‘There’s no need to imagine this scenario, because it is exactly the position we currently have in this country.’ Detection: The BBC has warned taking away the threat of prosecution will lose it £200million a year . The BBC warned that decriminalisation could lead to it losing £200million in revenue. However, director of corporate and public affairs Andrew Scadding said yesterday: ‘This approach is a sensible one as it means that all parties will be able to consider any changes to the current system with a clear understanding of the consequences that will follow.’ The BBC will become less populist and broadcast more Shakespeare, opera and literary festivals, it was announced yesterday. Director general Tony Hall unveiled a series of high-brow TV programmes, including the return of history series Civilisation, and a £2.75 million boost to arts programming. He said: ‘This is the strongest commitment to the arts we’ve made in a generation. We’re the biggest arts broadcaster in the world, but our ambition is to be even better.’","MP Andrew Brigden said law was like one in a third world banana republic .

Cisse (replaced by Riviere 73): Lucky to escape red for elbow on Coleman. Right place at right time for well-taken equaliser. Always a danger and deserved standing ovation.

Coleman: A perfectly-whipped cross from the right for Kone’s opening goal. Roughed up by Cisse and Co but took it in his stride. Unlucky to be on losing team - 6.5 . Distin: Age catching up to the 37-year-old. Careless passing at times as he manned the back. Lost his man too often - 5.5 . Alcaraz: Out of his depth at times. He and Distin did not look adequate at the back for Martinez - 5.5 . Everton defender Seamus Coleman (left) lunges in to prevent Cisse taking the ball . Garbutt: First Premier League start and was composed on the ball. Looked good getting forward but ultimately on losing side - 6 . Baines: Largely anonymous in first half but chased the ball well to make Newcastle uncomfortable. Fine ball through for Mirallas’ goal which gave visitors hope in final moments - 6 . Barry: Most booked player in Premier League history with 100. Not today. Was well disciplined in Everton engine room but lost physical battles - 5.5 . McCarthy (replaced by Barkley, 45): Workhorse as per, closing down Newcastle when home side were in possession. Substituted at half time for Barkley - 6 . Veteran midfielder Gareth Barry (left) shields Colback away from the ball . McGeady (replaced by Mirallas, 61): His ball inside allowed Coleman to cross for the opening goal. Sacrificed for Mirallas after 61 minutes. Looked frustrated to come off - 6 . Eto’o: Looked dangerous and wanted to get on ball plenty in role behind Kone. Once he got his chance after 63 minutes, however, he fluffed lines by sending shot well over crossbar - 6 . Kone (replaced by Lukaku 71): Got Everton on their way with a well-taken goal in his first Premier League start. Worked hard and chased the ball well - 7 . Ross Barkley's (right) mistake allowed Colback to score what was eventually the winner . Substitutions: . Barkley (on for McCarthy, 45): Scored in both Premier League appearances against Newcastle but not this time as a half time substitute. His mistake led to Colback goal, which confirmed Everton’s defeat - 5 . Mirallas (on for McGeady, 61): Gave Everton hope with goal in 84th minute. Composed finish under pressure from approaching goalkeeper Alnwick - 6.5 . Lukaku (on for Kone 71): Too little, too late to have an impact - 6 . Arouna Kone (centre) opened the scoring or Everton after only five minutes . Manager: . Roberto Martinez: Made seven changes and heavily rotated team. Lost the passing game and looked a hurried formation at times - 6 . Referee: .

"The man accused of helping inject women with a toxic mixture of tyre sealant, cement and super glue has been attacked by the mother of one of his alleged victims during a taping of a talk show. Corey Eubank, who allegedly duped women into paying for the injections to enhance their behinds, was on Spanish-language show Cristina when the woman allegedly swung at him with a needle. 'The victim’s family jumped out of the front row and the victim jumped out and started attacking my client,' Eubank's lawyer Jim Lewis told the Miami Herald. Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Corey Eubank (second from left) begins arguing . with a woman who paid for injections that allegedly left her disfigured. He appeared on Spanish-language show Cristina in a bid to clear his name . Out of control: As host Cristina Saralegui runs for cover, the show's guest lunges at Eubank, left . Speaking with CBS Miami after the attack, Eubank added: 'The mother jumped out of the audience, came and grabbed a syringe and threw it and it hit me in my forehead. I wanted to scream as loud as I could.' Following the alleged attack, which occurred around 9.30 p.m. at Dural Studio in Miami, Florida, police questioned at least one person, Lewis said. Eubank, 40, of Hollywood, is accused of assisting Oneal Ron Morris, who police say tricked women into paying for injections which left their bodies horribly disfigured. Morris, also known as 'Duchess', performed the procedures, while Eubank coordinated the appointments, police said. The toxic injections left several alleged patients hospitalised and in need of corrective surgery. Heated: Audience members, including the alleged victim's mother (in the white shirt), begin heckling Eubank . Attack: After allegedly hitting Eubank with a prop needle, the woman is restrained by security officers . But the duo have claimed they are innocent and they remain out on bail. Eubank appeared on the show in an attempt to clear his name. He was on stage with . members of his legal team and Shaquanda Brown, who claims Morris's . injections left her disfigured. Discussions on the show became heated . when Brown's mother, who was seated in the front row, allegedly grabbed . a syringe from a table and lunged at Eubank. The syringe, which was to be used for a . demonstration later in the talk show, scratched Eubank on the . forehead. Security officers restrained the woman. It is the latest drama in the case, which has received nationwide attention for the 'fake doctor' at its centre. Morris, 30, was born a . man but now lives as a woman. Her police photographs show an apparently . enhanced rear, which police say is her own work. 'Injured': Speaking after the attack, Eubank wore a plaster on his head, where he was allegedly struck . 'Fake doctor': Eubanks was arrested after allegedly acting as an accomplice to Oneal Ron Morris, pictured, who injected patients with a near-lethal mixture. Morris, 30, was born as a man but lives as a woman . Despite being charged with practicing . healthcare without a licence and causing serious bodily injury, she has . denied all allegations, saying the accusers are 'ruining her life'. The FBI has joined the investigation into the death of a British teenager who died after a botched 'booty boost' operation in a hotel room near Philadelphia Airport. Claudia Aderotimi, an 18-year-old wannabe rap star from London, died after the 'backstreet' operation carried out by a transgender woman known as the Black Madam almost a year ago. She had hoped a curvier rear would boost her showbiz career. It was thought Aderotimi had been injected with industrial grade silicone which caused her to have a massive heart attack only hours after the op. But coroner tests have failed to establish the type of substance used. Forensic experts with the FBI crime lab are now trying to find out what kind of substance killed Aderotimi. They have taken over investigation into the case as part of a wider inquiry into illegal cosmetic surgery procedures. Morris claimed in an interview on Entertainment Tonight: 'They didn’t catch me doing anything. So they . are just allegations. So I’m innocent. I really am innocent or . whatever. 'I didn’t do any of . these things to these people. Just know these people who are lying are . ruining my life. That’s all I have to say.' Morris . was initially arrested November 18 after an alleged patient complained . that she injected cement and a chemical compound called Fix-a-Flat, . which is used to mend car tyres, into her backside. The alleged victim was hospitalised . with pneumonia and a bacterial infection after receiving a lethal . cocktail of injections from Morris in May 2010. She was left with life-threatening injuries, needing several surgeries and round-the-clock care. But Florida health investigators took more than a year to gather evidence against Morris because the woman was too embarrassed to come forward. Morris was allowed out on bail then . arrested again on November 23 when a second alleged victim came forward. Eubank, 40 was . arrested the same day. Morris performed her operations in homes and hotel rooms across South Florida, police say. Caught: Morris, who carried out the injections in hotel rooms and homes, was arrested in Florida in May 2010 . Dangerous: The cocktail injected into the woman's buttocks included cement, tyre sealant and super glue . 'Victim': Raji Narinesingh's face has been left misshapen by the illegal treatment . Another . alleged victim, Raji Narinesingh, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but . could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using . medical silicone. Narinesingh, who is also a transgender who lives as a woman, says she heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community. After . being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen . shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a ballooning upper lip. She . later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job. 'I have learned my lesson,' She said. 'I could have died. I know that now.' But Morris denied that she is a fake doctor. 'If anybody’s the victim, it’s definitely me,' she said.

"For more than 200 summers, the sound of leather on willow has echoed around Rickmansworth Cricket Club. Not this year. The club, one of the oldest in England, has had to suspend play following an unprecedented pitch invasion – by a colony of badgers. The animals have ripped up the pristine turf, turning 50 square metres of it into a mudbath. The usually-manicured grass at Rickmansworth Cricket Club has been destroyed by local badgers . It means the Hertfordshire club, . founded in 1787, cannot start the season. It has had to suspend play . indefinitely because badgers are a protected species, so members can do . little to get rid of them. They can only watch helplessly as the . animals rip up the historic ground. In 1882 it hosted the Australian . team that nine days later beat England at the Oval, the defeat which . gave rise to the Ashes. Chairman Mark Raine said: ‘I’ve been . at the club for 25 years and never seen anything like this before. We . estimate that around 50 square metres of the pitch has been damaged by . the badgers and because they are protected by law we are totally . helpless to stop them. ‘The pitch looks more like the Battle . of the Somme as it is covered in huge holes and mounds of earth. It . looks like someone has turned up with a mortar and tried to trash it.’ Game, sett and match to the badgers: Club officials believe a colony of the protected mammals is to blame . Happier times: This photograph shows how it used to look before the badgers staged their pitch invasion . It's just not cricket: Rickmansworth Cricket Club secretary Paul Blackwell shows the damage that's been done . The badgers are believed to have been attracted to the turf by crane flies, which lay their larvae in the grass. Usually the club sprays the ground to . clear the insects, but it was too cold to do so this year. The treatment . only works at temperatures of 8C to 12C (46F to 54F). Under the Protection of Badgers Act . 1992 it is illegal to kill, injure or disturb badgers or to destroy . their setts. Mr Raine said: ‘Apparently the badgers really like the . larvae and they have been tearing up large swabs of the ground in . search  of them. Rickmansworth Cricket Club played against the England team in 1882 on its pitch - and won . This team photograph dating back to 1938 shows how the pitch has always been kept in perfect condition . ‘We have bought some sonic alarms to . try to frighten them away, but they are proving totally inadequate and . we are powerless to do anything else. ‘In the whole history of the club a . game has never been cancelled due to badgers before. The badgers have . churned up so much grass that it looks like we will have to re-turf the . whole pitch, which will be really expensive. ‘At the moment we don’t know when we will ever be able to play on the pitch again.’ The 226-year-old club moved to its present ground, Park Road, halfway through the 19th century. Founded in 1787 - the same year as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - Rickmansworth Cricket Club may date back even further than that, as there are records of games held at the club as far back as 1760. Initially based at the south end of the town, the cricket club moved first to Rickmansworth Park, now the grounds of the Royal Masonic School for Girls, and then to its present site at Park Road in the middle of the 19th century. The club owns a well-preserved score book covering the years 1881-1883, and it includes details of the celebrated game between the host side and the England team which Rickmansworth won just days before the Australians beat England at the Oval in the game that gave birth to the Ashes. The following year, the Australians returned and defeated Rickmansworth by nine wickets.","Manicured grass of Rickmansworth Cricket Club has been totally shredded .

"She epitomised regal elegance last night in a tiara and jewels. But today Queen Elizabeth opted for a less opulent look as she attended a service at St George's chapel at Windsor Castle. Her Majesty, 87, wore a pretty paisley print dress under a peach coat.

The Queen had worn the spectacular Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia's tiara and a stunning emerald necklace for the historic occasion. If the elderly couple had a late night, they showed no signs of it today as they resumed their royal duties. Show must go on: The couple didn't show any signs of a late night as they took their seats . Guests watch a screen showing British concert organist Thomas Trotter giving a recital . Historic: The royals were shown a manuscript dating back to 1750 by Royal College of Organists Director of Academic Development, Andrew McCrea . Music to their ears: The Queen and the Duke said they enjoyed the performance . The Duke of Edinburgh, 92, raised a smile from his wife as they took their seats for the service after being greeted by Dean of Windsor David Conner. The RCO, of which the Queen is the patron, has more than 2,000 members and is involved in the training and support of church organists across the UK. The recital was held in the castle's gothic 15th century St George's chapel. The Queen and The Duke visibly enjoyed themselves during the 45-minute long organ recital which included numbers by Bach and Peter Hurford, exchanging smiles throughout. They were later introduced to the organist, Thomas Trotter. The Queen told him that he had played 'very well', while the Duke asked about Mr Trotter's forthcoming concerts. The Queen gave a speech during last night's banquet that was attended by a number of royals and dignitaries . The state banquet was a lavish affair . The Royal party also inspected the chapel's 18th century organ which was commissioned by King George III. A Buckingham Palace source said: 'I think she's here quite often. She knows the chapel well.' The afternoon event was attended by more than 200 people, including representatives from the world of organ music and choral recital. A video screen was even erected to allow the Royal party to observe the organist's footwork. The president of the Royal College of Organists, Catherine Ennis, said: 'We are very grateful that Her Majesty the Queen, our patron - accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, has consented to be present today to crown our anniversary celebrations. 'We hope that we can share our 150th anniversary celebrations with everyone with an interest in organ and choral music, whether through playing the organ, directing or singing in a choir, or through simple enjoyment of the music.'","Queen Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh attended organ recital .

"There has been a lot of talk, as ever, about Wayne Rooney in a World Cup year but the words of two former Manchester United midfielders spoke volumes last summer. When Rooney's long-term credentials for both England and Manchester United were questioned, Roy Keane simply said: ‘If you think Wayne Rooney’s gone, then you are sadly mistaken.' Paul Scholes, after wondering aloud whether Rooney's glory days were behind him, then gazed into his crystal ball: 'I don't think Wayne will be able to play centre forward until he's 34 or 35. But he could play centre midfield, possibly, into his mid-thirties. Wayne Rooney strikes to score his second goal in Boxing Day's fixture against Newcastle at Old Trafford . In his new role Rooney has been likened to former Manchester United central midfielder Paul Scholes . In United's last three games Rooney has now been directly involved in five of their seven goals, scoring three. The 29-year-old celebrates his opener against Newcastle at Old Trafford with United striker Radamel Falcao . 'He's got all the ability to take over my old position at Manchester United.' Now, under Louis Van Gaal, Scholes' premonition is coming into fruition. He has started the last three games as a central midfielder and has been directly involved in five of United's seven goals, scoring three. Rooney is still United's most important player, still the soul and spirit of his team. He has now been dining at the top table of English football for some 14 years but he still seems to work harder, cover more ground and expend more energy than those around him. If truth be told, not everybody at Old Trafford felt entirely comfortable with the prospect of Rooney wearing the captain's armband. Some felt he was granted preferential treatment by David Moyes and privately licked their lips with glee after the appointment of Louis van Gaal, presuming the Dutchman would favour Robin van Persie. Never presume. Rooney's ability was questioned during the World Cup last summer, but appears to be enjoying his new role . Rooney is now well accustomed to the questions that surround his longevity as an elite footballer. And he continues to embarass those who ask them. For some, Rooney is still not quite the player we wanted him to be. Nobody stirs the debate quite like him. He could drop a crisp packet on the floor and be blamed for climate change. The perception of Rooney veers from one extreme to another with unreasonable frequency. We lament his failure to reach the Ronaldo/Messi stratosphere when we should recognise his consistent excellence for club and country. It is now nine Premier League goals for the season and he remains the one player that appears most eminently capable of lifting this United team when he feels the need. Just like Paul Scholes, Rooney's Premier League record for Manchester United is phenomenally impressive . As a captain, Rooney continues to mature. Privately, he was disappointed that he let his team-mates down with a wild hack on Stewart Downing in October, bringing a red card and a three match ban. That one instance, however, must be considered in the context of a player that has received only three yellow cards in his last 41 appearances for club and country. His contribution to the United cause is unquestionable. Rooney has now scored or assisted 97 goals in his last 101 Premier League games at Old Trafford, scoring 68 and creating 29. It is a remarkable statistic and almost makes you question whether Rooney's considerable qualities have been underestimated in recent times. If his future is to lie in central midfield, it will bring a long over-due goal threat. A decade has passed since United last possessed a central midfield player that scored more than 10 goals in a single Premier League season. It was Scholes, in the 2004-05 campaign. Rooney's passing accuracy against Newcastle on Friday was reminiscent of former Reds midfielder Scholes . Since hanging up his boots after his retirement Scholes has taken up a position as a television pundit . Against Newcastle on Boxing Day, Rooney showcased the technique and vision that Van Gaal so clearly appreciates, recording a 90.2 per cent passing accuracy but even more impressive is the 85.7 per cent success in his opponents' half, underlining the damage he can do in the final third with that majestic chipped pass to create Robin van Persie's goal. It was a ball that Scholes would have been proud to play. This was Rooney at his lung-busting, committed best but allaying all that dedication with his technical poise. For a long time, many have asked whether his endurance would be impaired by his powerful physique. Van Gaal provided an emphatic answer to that after yesterday's performance: 'He has the lung capacity to run 90 minutes as a midfielder.' To quote Keane once more: ‘If you think Wayne Rooney’s gone, then you are sadly mistaken.'","Wayne Rooney has started the last three league games in centre midfield .

"With Christmas barely out of the way, it might seem a bit soon to be thinking of a trip abroad. But experts say this is the ideal time to plan a foreign holiday after travel agents began slashing the price of package trips yesterday and it emerged that a strong pound is giving tourists up to 28 per  cent more for their money than a year ago. Operators are cutting the prices of deals to popular resorts in Turkey, Greece and Spain as competition begins during the peak selling season for holidays after Christmas. Bargain breaks: Thomson is offering 14 nights in Florida for £1,119 per person - a saving of £670 per couple . When package prices, meal costs and . exchange rates were assessed together for ten winter destinations in . January, Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt came out top for value. A week in the Red Sea resort costs just £399 – less than half of mid-haul competitor Jumeirah Beach, Dubai. The strong pound also buys tourists around £55 per £500, or 12.5 per cent more in Sharm than during the same period last year. The . best value long-haul destinations include Orlando in Florida, Negril in . Jamaica, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, according to a . survey for the Post Office. Bali, . in Indonesia, is the place to  go to get the most from the pound, with . sterling up 28 per cent on  the weak rupiah – buying the equivalent of . £108 more spending money for each £500 exchanged compared to 12 months . ago. Cape Town  in South Africa is also great value, with tourists . getting the equivalent of £91 more per £500 because of  the 20 per cent . slump in the value of the rand. A . seven-night break, departing January 1 from London to Orlando in . Florida costs £719, researchers said, while a holiday in Playa  del . Carmen, in Mexico, was £899  and a seven-night stay in Dubai  was £983. Thomson is offering seven nights for couples to Marrakech for £399 per person - a saving of £330 per couple . Most expensive of the resorts surveyed was Penang in Malaysia where the package costs as much £1,314. Paul . Havenhand, the head of travel at the Post Office, said: ‘Egypt’s  Red . Sea resorts have always been a good value option but it’s not  just . Sharm el-Sheikh where sun-seekers will find their pounds  stretch . further. ‘Sterling buys . more holiday cash in all ten of our January hotspots, with the biggest . benefits to be found in Cape Town and Bali.’ January is prime selling season for holiday firms, with some cutting as much as £360 per person off short and long-haul breaks. Thomas . Cook has slashed seven nights in May at a four-star resort in Gran . Canaria by £200 per person to £419. Thomson First Choice has 14 nights . in Mauritius in May from £1,599 a head, saving £740 per couple. The travel agency is also offering a seven night stay at a five-star resort in Belek, Turkey, for £1,769 which saves £320. Thomas Cook is offering seven nights in Olu Deniz in Turkey all-inclusive from £1179 per person . A seven night stay in Barbados has been cut by £442 to £1,159 per person. However, . British holidaymakers are expected to spend more on their annual . getaway in 2014 rising to an average of £1,035 per person, a new study . has found. That will include £617 on the hotel and flights, and £459 in spending money. A typical break will last 9.6 nights, staying in a Spanish beach resort, and self-catered accommodation. Next year will also see a 14 per cent fall in the number of Brits opting for a staycation - a break within Britain. Holidaymakers are more likely to jet off on long-haul flights, research by online comparison service Travel Supermarket shows. Popular destinations will include the likes of U.S (7 per cent), and Turkey (3 per cent). Spain continues to be the nation's favourite country in which to take a foreign holiday. But the number of us who expect to be visiting will fall from 14 per cent this year to 12 per cent next. Over a third of British holidaymakers (37 per cent) expect to spend more on their holiday in 2014. Thomas Cook is offering seven nights in Ayia Napa self-catering from £1,529 for a family of four . In 2013 the total sum spent was 1,035 pounds, or 41 pounds less than 2014. A . quarter of those who plan to spend more (25 per cent) saved up for a . nicer break, while 23 per cent cut back on last year's travels to afford . it. Almost four in ten Brits (39 per cent) took a beach holiday in 2013 but only 29 per cent plan to do the same for in 2014. Instead, Brits are craving culture, history, shopping or entertainment. Research shows city breaks were five per cent more popular in 2013 than they were in 2012 (35 per cent, 30 per cent). Excluding those who have yet to decide, five per cent more holidaymakers plan on taking two or more breaks in 2014 compared to 2013 (70 per cent, 65 per cent). A quarter are set to take exactly two holidays in 2014, which is the national average. The summer months of June, July and August are by far the most popular months to travel in 2014. Trips in June are potentially inspired by the FIFA World Cup, which kicks off on June 12 in Brazil. A total of four per cent of Brits surveyed revealed they are going to a destination with a good atmosphere to watch the tournament. Thomson First Choice is offering 14 nights in Mauritius from £1,599 per person . While a further four per cent claim the World Cup might inspire them to go to Brazil one day. The trend of people booking all-inclusive breaks in 2014 is set to rise by two per cent. Nearly two in five single young professionals (39 per cent) want to have an adventure. Those most tempted by a relaxing holiday are couples who do not plan to have children (73 per cent) and couples with grown up children (71 per cent). Almost one in five families with young children go on holiday to experience new cultures (19 per cent), but the majority (67 per cent) claim that spending time with the family is their main motivation for traveling. Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket said: 'Spain has long been a favourite beach destination for Brits looking to unwind. Airtours is offering seven nights in Sharm el Sheikh in Egyt from £1,799 for a family of four . 'It continues to offer great value in terms of affordable holidays and a reliable experience for holidaymakers. 'However it's great to see people having the confidence to try new, less traditional, holidays as they look to make the most of their time and money overseas. 'With economic signals indicating a slow but steady upturn in many countries, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Cyprus are emerging as popular holiday alternatives to the nation's favourite, Spain. 'Meanwhile, destinations such as Sri Lanka, Dubai, Florida, Cancun and Egypt are ideal for those looking at experiencing more long haul locations for their beach breaks. 'The fact that so many of us are keen to enjoy a city break demonstrates how keen we are to make use of the UK's proximity to exciting, and increasingly accessible cities across Europe. Cities offering low cost of living such as Budapest, Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga, will continue to soar in popularity, but for those looking to splash more cash, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Las Vegas are all increasing in popularity as people travel for special occasions or for a treat. 'Regardless of where you choose to go, January will always be a key booking time for holidaymakers, so my advice will always be to think about what you want from your break and research your options via a price comparison website to help decide on the best holiday options for you.

"Bee populations have been falling rapidly in many countries, fuelled by a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder . Parasitic mites have 'turbo-charged' the spread of a deadly virus that is killing honey bee colonies around the world. Bee populations have been falling rapidly in many countries, fuelled by a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder. Many suspects have been named for bee colony collapse, including popular pesticides. Now University of Sheffield scientists studied the impact of a parasitic mite arriving in a fresh territory - Hawaii - and concluded that it is a prime suspect, since it spreads viruses while feeding on hemolymph, or bee's ‘blood’. To clarify the link between mites and viruses, a team led by Stephen Martin of Britain's University of Sheffield studied the impact of Varroa in Hawaii, which the mites have only recently invaded. They found the arrival of Varroa increased the prevalence of a single type of virus, deformed wing virus (DWV), in honey bees from around 10% to 100%. At the same time the amount of DWV virus in the bees' bodies rocketed by a millionfold and there was a huge reduction in virus diversity, with a single strain of DWV crowding out others. ‘It is that strain that is now dominant around the world and seems to be killing bees,’ Martin said in a telephone interview. ‘My money would be on this virus as being key.’ Bloodsuckers: The presence of the Varroa mite parasite increased the prevalence of a single type of virus, deformed wing virus (DWV), in honey bees from around 10% to 100% . Other factors - including fungi, pesticides and decreased plant diversity - are thought to play a role in colony collapse, but Ian Jones of the University of Reading said the latest findings pointed to the virus and mite combination as being the main culprit. ‘This data provides clear evidence that, of all the suggested mechanisms of honey bee loss, virus infection brought in by mite infestation is a major player in the decline,’ he said. Jones, who was not involved the research, said the findings reinforced the need for beekeepers to control Varroa infestation in colonies. The threat to bee populations extends across much of Europe and the United States to Asia, South America and the Middle East, experts say.     Bees are important pollinators of flowering plants, including many fruit and vegetable crops.","Study into impact of mite on 'fresh' territory - Hawaii - has revealed devastation it can cause in bee colonies .

"Ally McCoist has told his Rangers players to blot out the latest round of off-field headlines ahead of Saturday’s Championship clash with Hearts. The Ibrox side could slide nine points behind the Championship leaders if they lose at Tynecastle. They travel east against a backdrop of 10 job cuts among administrative staff at the club, fresh calls from former director Dave King for fans to starve the club of cash and former owner Craig Whyte facing a warrant for his arrest. ‘I keep saying to the players the only thing they should concentrate on are the things they can affect,’ McCoist told Talksport. ‘That’s results. Ranger boss Ally McCoist has urged his players to ignore the latest round of off-field headlines . ‘To a man, they have come in and trained their socks off and are a great bunch of boys. ‘It can be difficult for them at times because it’s been on the front page of the paper for the last three years - more, sadly, than it has been on the back. But there is nothing we can do about that. All we can do is give the supporters something to cheer about and that’s via results on the park.’ After the dismal 1-1 home draw with Alloa, McCoist is likely to face further calls for his head if Hearts stretch their lead at the top, but he claimed to be savouring a trip to Tynecastle. ‘Outside Ibrox it’s probably my favourite ground in the country. The atmosphere is as good as anywhere,’ he said. ‘If we get the result it’s a great win for us and that’s all we are thinking about.’ Rangers were held to a 1-1 draw against Alloa at Ibrox on Saturday . Rangers players put their hands to their heads in frustration as Sebastien Faure (second left) misses a chance . Warning once again that a League Cup semi-final with Celtic is secondary to promotion, McCoist added: ‘We have absolutely got to put the semi-final on the backburner. You probably won’t believe I am saying this, but that semi-final against Celtic is secondary to us getting out of the division.’ Meanwhile, the war of words between businessman King and the Ibrox hierarchy continued last night. Rangers chairman David Somers has claimed King’s failure to provide proof of funds and identify members of his consortium had made it impossible to accept his offer of investment in the club. King subsequently claimed proof of funds was available ‘immediately’ but that Sandy Easdale, chairman of the Rangers football board, had agreed the information could be provided once the backing of shareholders was confirmed. Captain Lee McCulloch (right) celebrates after opening the scoring for Rangers against Alloa . Alloa's Liam Buchanan (left) slots it home to score his side's equalising goal . This was denied by Easdale last night in a statement which read: ‘I am 100 per cent supportive of the stance taken by David Somers. David had a legal and regulatory duty to determine the legitimacy of Mr King’s offer. Any suggestion on Mr King’s part that I had agreed that these contentious issues could be dealt with after an acceptance of his bid are inaccurate and misleading. ‘The suggestion that Mr King could not proceed further because my shareholding and proxies would have blocked his bid is a nonsense. For a bid to be rejected it has to be received first. I can only conclude Mr King’s phantom bid was designed as a vehicle for self-promotion of some kind. Unfortunately the consequences of his inaccurate and ill-advised statement serves further to destabilise the club and upsets the fan base at this very sensitive time. I have grown tired of Mr King’s antics.’ Tempers flared between Alloa's Mark Docherty (left) amd Nicky Law as the pair square up to one another . Alloa celebrate at full-time after picking up a vital point against Rangers . Brian Kennedy also released a statement revealing he wanted Ibrox given legal protection as part of his £3m loan offer. The Sale Sharks owner’s proposal was turned down by the board, with Somers claiming they opted for a £2m loan from Mike Ashley because he wanted less interest and security in return. Somers’ words have now prompted Kennedy to detail the rival nine-point terms he put forward with his money last month. Those included a request for ‘Ibrox Stadium to be protected in a Trust or a similar Legal mechanism that would allow this asset to be used solely for RFC in whatever legal entity to play football in perpetuity.’ Kennedy also wanted former director Paul Murray appointed to the plc board for 24 months - and the right to appoint an administrator if Rangers tipped into another insolvency. Kennedy was requesting a three per cent interest rate but it’s understood he was willing to negotiate this down towards zero. Rangers manager McCoist (left) shakes hand with Alloa manager Barry Smith prior to kick-off . He added: ‘The loan (of which £1m had been provided by Mr George Letham) was designed to give the Board of Rangers PLC the time needed to pursue Dave King’s offer and/or a new share issue in order to ensure long term financial security for the business. ‘Furthermore the appointment of Paul Murray would provide much needed harmony between the Board and the supporters. ‘I was informed by Mr Somers the Board had no objections to any of these terms. He later informed me he had made the decision to go with Mr Ashley’ s offer after consultation with the Major Shareholders. This is their prerogative.’","Rangers go into Saturday's match  six points behind leaders Hearts .

"A mother and her son both suffer from a devastating allergy to the sun which means any exposure to it causes them agonising pain. Claire Turner, 50, and son Sam, 13, have a rare medical condition called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) - a condition which causes the skin becomes incredibly sensitive to natural light. Any exposure to the sun causes them agonising pain and Sam’s allergy is so severe he has to remove some light bulbs in the family home because they cause his skin to feel as though it’s on fire. Claire and Sam Turner have a rare genetic condition which makes their skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight . As a result, they are forced to stay under cover in the daylight hours and wear long sleeves, gloves and even masks to avoid spending days in agony. Ms Turner and Sam even have to cover their faces with scarves if they venture out in sunlight.Sam’s condition is so severe it is also triggered by low energy light bulbs and fluorescent strip lights - meaning every unknown building can be a danger to his health. Ms Turner, from Thame, Oxfordshire, said: ‘We’re like a vampire family - we can’t come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark. ‘If I stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me. ‘Sam is even affected by low energy light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, we have to remove the bulbs from the ceilings at school so that he has an area where he can sit in darkness. If they go outside during the day, Ms Taylor and Sam both have to completely cover their exposed skin to avoid suffering an agonising reaction which makes them feel like they are having boiling water poured over them . ‘He lives his life looking up - to make sure he doesn’t get hit by the wrong kind of light.’ The windows in the family’s house and car are specially protected against UV rays and they now have a mobility badge so the family can park in spaces nearest to shops and limit exposure to the sun. Ms Turner’s daughter Jo, 16, carries the EPP gene but is not light sensitive - meaning she can go outside in the sun without horrendous pain. Ms Turner said: ‘I thought my children had escaped the condition - until my youngest Sam started having reactions to the light at the age of eight. EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As . blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy . from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly . damage surrounding tissues. The . nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, . and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing . swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation . ‘I was devastated - he’s had to learn to live his life all over again by keeping out of the light. ‘If the other boys go outside he can’t go with them - he sits in his room playing Play Station.’ At work as a nursery nurse, Ms Turner has a special black tent for when the children go outside to allow her to perform her duties while staying out of UV rays. She said: ‘Every outing has to be strategically planned - we have to sit at the back of restaurants away from the windows, and we can’t visit swimming pools with glass roofs. ‘We spend our time skirting round the edge of buildings to avoid the sun - the only place we can go easily is the cinema - because we can just sit in the dark.’ The condition means that the family can’t visit hot countries or spend days outside. Ms Turner said: ‘The best family holiday we ever had was a cruise, Sam and I could spend our days below deck playing games and activities whilst Jo sprawled in the sunshine. ‘It’s hard for Sam - it’s something we’ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives.’ The pair have been supported by the British Porphyria Association and now give talks about dealing with the rare condition at their meetings. Hermione Lawson from The British Skin Foundation said: ‘Erythropoietic protoporphyria, also known as EPP, is a rare skin disease that causes the skin to become oversensitive to sunlight. ‘When sunlight reaches the skin, either directly or indirectly, it causes tingling, itching or burning, even redness and swelling, and can be very painful. ‘The condition usually starts in childhood, and although it is a hereditary condition, it is not always passed on from parent to child - so it is not unusual to have just one child with the condition.’ EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. Ms Turner's daughter, Jo, does not have the condition and so is not sensitive to sunlight . It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood.

"Scarlett Johansson has won legal damages against a French author whose novel features a promiscuous character based on the Hollywood actress. Lawyers working for Johansson, 29, told a court in Paris that writer Gregoire Delacourt had invented a series of love affairs with other celebrities amounting to a 'fraudulent use of her personal rights'. Delacourt had argued that the Johansson character in his book 'The First Thing We Look At' was in fact meant as a 'tribute' to her beauty. Upset: Lawyers working for Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson claimed a novel features a promiscuous character based on her amounted to a 'fraudulent use of her personal rights' Claims: Author Gregoire Delacourt (left) argued that the Johansson character in his book 'The First Thing We Look At' (right) was in fact meant as a 'tribute' to her beauty . Johansson's lawyer Vincent Toledano told the court Delacourt's book presented her as a 'sex object' and that a series of love affairs detailed in the work never took place. The book's offending scene comes when a mysterious blonde woman that the author describes as Johansson's 'exact double' asks for help at the house of a car mechanic in a French village. The mechanic is described as looking like 'a better version of Ryan Gosling'. Delacourt said he never meant the scene to offend, adding: 'It was meant as the highest praise. She is an archetypal beauty of our times, very human with a touching fragility. 'She is a wonderful, iconic actress. I was hoping that she might send me flowers because this book is, in a way, a declaration of love,' he went on to say. Big name: Delacourt said his work is meant to be a satire on celebrity culture, but would think twice about referring to Johansson (pictured here being honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame) in future . Characters in the book are also based on actors Gene Hackman (left) and Ryan Gosling (right). The mechanic that Johansson's character is romantically linked with is described as 'a better version of Ryan Gosling' Delacourt said his work is meant to be a satire on celebrity culture, but would think twice about referring to Johannsson in future. 'If I had known she was going to kick up such a racket, I would have picked another actress. 'All these famous people live with us all the time. Celebrity culture is imposed on us by the media, the press and the Internet,' Delacourt added. 'So her complaint is based on exactly the phenomenon I am denouncing. It's a paradox. But I suppose it's all very American,' he went on to say. As part of her legal action, Johansson sought an injunction to stop the novel being translated or adapted for cinema. That particular request was thrown out by the Paris court. She had also demanded £40,000 in damages for the 'fraudulent use of her personal rights' but that figure was significantly reduced to just £2,000 by the judge. Speaking after the verdict, Delacourt described the sum he had been ordered to pay 'derisory'.","Lawyers working for Hollywood star, 29, claimed book invented love affairs .

"Michael Carrick insists Manchester United should be targeting the Premier League title, rather than Champions League qualification this year. United made it seven wins from eight matches on Boxing Day when they swatted Newcastle aside with an easy 3-1 win. Despite the impressive recent run, United remain 10 points behind Chelsea and seven shy of second-place Manchester City, who have won their last nine matches in all competitions. Michael Carrick (left) in action for Manchester United in their Boxing Day match against Newcastle . Carrick believes United can catch Chelsea and Manchester City and mount a title challenge this season . United currently sit third in the table, 10 points behind Chelsea and seven behind Manchester City . Chelsea and City have a far more-settled starting XI than United, who have suffered because of injuries this season, but Carrick believes it is not unreasonable to think the Red Devils can catch them and top the table at the end of the season. 'We’re continuing to look up and will continue to try to catch them [City and Chelsea],' the midfielder told United’s website. 'We’re not satisfied with third. It’s obviously an improvement and we’re getting better but we want to keep looking up.' It has not been lost on the United hierarchy that the team’s resurgence has coincided with Carrick’s return to the starting XI.

West Ham United (A) Since Carrick recovered from an ankle injury at the start of November, the Red Devils have dropped just two points - a fact not lost on Sir Alex Ferguson, who described the 33-year-old as 'the best English player in the game' this week. Carrick prefers to think that United’s upturn in form is partly due to the attacking options Louis van Gaal now has at his disposal. On Boxing Day the United boss started with an enviable attacking quartet of Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie. 'That’s four world-class players you’re talking about there,' Carrick said. 'Going in to a game with those lads in your team gives us a real threat and a lot of confidence knowing we can create chances and score goals. Against Newcastle they clicked nicely and hopefully in the weeks coming up we’ll see something similar.' Carrick has been impressed by the contribution of Radamel Falcao, seen here squaring for Rooney to score . Louis van Gaal, who handed out Christmas presents before the game, is seeing his plans come together . Van Gaal, ever the perfectionist, was not completely satisfied with his team’s victory against the Magpies, which came courtesy of a Rooney double and a Van Persie header. The United manager was delighted with his team’s attacking play, but was less than happy with Phil Jones for clipping Jack Colback in the area to give Newcastle a late consolation from the penalty spot. 'We did a lot of bad things,' Van Gaal said. 'Did you see the penalty? It was from our throw-in... it’s not possible to give that penalty away. 'We can improve and we are improving every match. That’s the most important thing. 'It’s a process not for one day, but for a year.' A penalty from Papiss Cisse to make it 3-1 was the blemish on United's afternoon . Carrick shields the ball from Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini during the contest at Old Trafford . Van Gaal was also unhappy with the Premier League for scheduling United’s next game at Tottenham 43 hours after the game against the Magpies ended. Carrick, who played for Spurs for two years before signing for United, thinks he and his team-mates must not dwell on the inconvenience too much, though. 'Going to Tottenham is always a tough game and to go there two days after this match at 12 noon makes it very tough,” he said. 'But we have to get ourselves ready for that and it’s the same for them as well. It’s a game we look forward to and we go there confident.” Van Gaal will rotate his team for the match in north London. British record signing Angel di Maria is a big doubt because of a pelvis injury he suffered in training on Christmas Eve. Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj are out through illness. Daley Blind (knee) and Marcos Rojo (thigh) are unavailable, but Luke Shaw took part in a post-match training session on Boxing Day and could feature for the first time since November 22, when he injured his ankle against Arsenal.","Michael Carrick believes Man United can challenge for the title .

He posted a video promoting his extremist views just hours before a killing spree which . left 93 people dead after a car bomb exploded in downtown Oslo and a gunman descended on a youth camp on the island of Utoya. In another post online, Breivik analysed the differences between the EDL and the British National Party. He also allegedly made contact with another far-right organisation, Stop the Islamification of Europe, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The EDL is  an organisation with far-right views which opposes what it perceives as the spread of Islam and extremism. The EDL has denied any connections with Breivik. The . Norwegian branch released a statement saying: 'The terrorist . acts are connected with a person who is against multiculturalism and . Islam, we must emphasize that the suspect has never been a member of our . organization. Protest The EDL, at a demonstration earlier this year, have distanced themselves from the Norwegian mass murderer . 'Our . values are freedom of speech, equality, peace and democracy. It is our . fear that the discussion will now end up in a track where our arguments . are met with hatred and incoherent arguments.' A post on Friday evening on the English . Defence League Facebook page for the London area read: 'England will stand by . Norway... We have an EDL man on the ground in Norway and will be in . touch with the NDL. Let's pray the loss of life isn't high, although 1 single loss is to high. Our hearts go out to the dead & their families who are suffering :/ (dg)' The revelation has led to the news that extra security will be put up at mosques around the UK, said British Muslim leaders. Mohammed Shafiq, the leader of Ramadhan Foundation, one of Britain's largest Muslim groups, said mosques are being extra vigilant as it emerged that the suspect blamed for the Norway attacks opposed Muslim immigration to Europe. Shafiq said he was talking to other European Muslim leaders about the need to increase security and to British police about extra protection. 'People are afraid that we will be the next target,' Safiq said in a telephone interview during a large gathering of Sunni scholars and leaders in northern city of Birmingham. 'As a result, we've told people to be extra vigilant and there will be added security placed at mosques.' A pig's head was recently left at a mosque outside of Oxford, he added. And anti-extremist group Hope Not Hate has called for the EDL to be 'formally classified as a far-right organisation' in the wake of the Norway attacks. Director Nick Lowles said: 'Incredibly, the EDL are not currently classified as an extremist right wing group. That severely limits the capacity of the police to gather intelligence on the EDL, its members and its activities. 'Given the mounting evidence of connections between the EDL and alleged violent extremists like Anders Behring Breivik, we don't see how this situation is sustainable.' Controversial: The English Defence League is a far-right organisation that is anti-Islam and anti-immigration . Breivik's estranged father, who has had no contact with his son since 1995, said he only learnt of his involvement via online newspapers. The pensioner, who now lives in France, said: 'I was reading the online newspapers and suddenly I saw his name and picture on the net. It was a shock to learn about it. I have not recovered yet.' Police have refused to comment on Breivik's motivation but in his 1,500-page manifesto, he mapped out various details including setting up an ultra-conservative newspaper and instructions for bomb-making. In the text, titled 'A European Declaration of Independence', he wrote how he wanted to rid Europe of Islam and Marxism. 'It is better to kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike,' he said. 'Do not apologise, make excuses or express regret for you are acting in self-defence or in a preemptive manner.' He also called for a 'cultural Euro-Tea . Party' referring to the grass-roots, right-wing organisation in the U.S. supported by Sarah Palin. The manifesto also referred to a secret . meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar - . skilled fighters endorsed by the Church who fought during the Crusades . in the Middle Ages. They are sometimes revered by white supremacists. Chilling: A picture of Breivik taken from his manifesto posted just a few hours before he went on a killing spree in Norway . It . said the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European . countries with another three members unable to attend, including a . 'European-American'. The . document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of . Breivik’s planned attacks. It is thought that investigators will now try . to determine if these people exist and what their connection is to . Breivik. According to the Daily Mirror, in another blog post from two years ago Breivik argued Muslim gangs in Norway are free to do what they want, while whites forming gangs are branded as racists. He alleged that it led to him linking up with white criminal gangs and taking part in clashes against police. The Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said officials were working with foreign intelligence agencies to see if there was any international involvement in the slaughter. 'We have running contact with other countries' intelligence services,' he said. BBC journalist Jon Sopel tweeted that a Scotland yard detective has arrived in Oslo to offer assistance during the investigation. Norway police say Metropolitan police are helping with investigations. Though the Norwegian far-right movement has carried out attacks in the past, it has historically been a small community. The late Stieg Larsson, the Swedish crime writer famous for his Millennium trilogy started the anti-racist, anti-extremist publication Expo following a sharp rise in violence carried out by Scandinavian neo-Nazis in the 1990s. It has been reported that Norwegian far-right extremists have developed strong links with criminal communities, as well as with similar groups abroad, in Europe, Russia and the U.S. David Cameron said yesterday it was important for Britain to learn any lessons it could from the outburst of violence. He said: 'The loss of life in Norway has been absolutely horrific; it's on a scale, frankly, that is hard to comprehend. 'The Norwegians are old friends and allies and neighbours of Britain, and I know that everyone in Britain will want to stand with the Norwegian people in the days of sorrow that lie ahead. 'Also, we will want to make sure that we learn, like others, any lessons there are to learn about how to be more secure against horrific outrages like this.'","British Mosques to increase security, say Muslim leaders .

"She is the celebrated yachtswoman who sailed her way into the record books 25 years ago. Now Tracy Edwards has launched a bid to rescue the boat she used when leading the first all-female crew to the finish line of the Whitbread Round the World Race in 1990. Miss Edwards made history and inspired a generation of female sailors when her team won two of the six legs on their way to completing the gruelling race. Tracy Edwards, pictured right, has launched a bid to rescue 'Maiden', pictured left the yacht she famously used to skipper an all female team around the world in 1990 . Since completing the Round the World yacht race the yacht has had several owners and has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is pictured here in a marina on an island in the Indian Ocean . Their 58ft yacht, called Maiden, was the unsung star of the race as it was already 21-years-old at the time and was self-funded by Miss Edwards. But since the momentous event the yacht has had several owners and has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is now abandoned and languishing in a marina on an island in the Indian Ocean. Having recently discovered its plight Miss Edwards has launched a fundraising campaign to salvage the boat, bring it back to Britain and restore it to its former glory. The campaign has gained support from a host of big names including Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon and Virgin Media boss Richard Branson. Now Miss Edwards, 50, hopes to reunite her former crew and re-enact their historic race finish 25 years ago by sailing Maiden up Southampton Water on May 28 next year. The vessel will then go on display at maritime museums around Britain and also be used to take young people from charities sailing. Miss Edwards, who was awarded the MBE and named Sportswomen of the Year in 1990, needs to raise £50,000 to ship Maiden, pictured, to Cape Town where it will be refitted and then sailed to the UK . Miss Edwards, who was awarded the MBE and named Sportswomen of the Year in 1990, needs to raise £50,000 to ship the boat to Cape Town where it will be refitted and then sailed to the UK. She said: ‘When we formed the Maiden crew I had to take out a mortgage just to buy the boat. ‘I had no choice but to sell her at the end of the race which was very sad. I sold her to someone who looked after her well but she was then passed to someone who didn’t. In 1985 Miss Edwards became the very first woman to take part in the Whitbread Round the World Race, now the Volvo Ocean Race. Afterwards she began assembling an all-woman crew and bought a boat called Prestige, which was refitted and renamed Maiden by the Dutchess of York in 1988. A year later Maiden was among 22 boats which started the race from Southampton. Many doubted an all-woman crew could compete with male crews but Miss Edwards led her team to second overall in her class. In 1999 after the birth of her daughter, Mackenna, she retired from yacht racing and in 2001 she managed Maiden II the first ever mixed professional racing crew aboard a Maxi Multihull. They broke the Trans Atlantic and 24-hour records in 2002. In 2003 she signed a £6 million sponsorship deal with Qatar Sports International (QSI) and moved her family and team to Doha. In recent years she has founded a training company and is a sought after motivational speaker. Miss Edwards, 50, now lives in London with her 14-year-old daughter Mackenna and runs a company providing advice on internet and travel security. ‘I have kept an eye on her for many years and it has been heartbreaking seeing her gradually rot away unloved. ‘I got an email from someone saying they had found Maiden in a marina on an island in the Indian Ocean. ‘She had been there for a few years and was in a terrible state looking like she had just been dumped. 'Maiden' skippered by Tracy Edwards returns to Southampton to win class honours in the Whitbread Round the World Race in 1990 . ‘I contacted the marina which had seized her after her last owner disappeared. The staff got in touch with me and asked if I would like her. ‘I’ve gone from swearing that I would never set foot on another boat as long as I live to facing the prospect of resurrecting Maiden and sailing her again. ‘I can’t even start to think what it will be like to spend a month on the old girl bringing her home from Cape Town, let alone sailing into Southampton with the original crew.' In 1985 Miss Edwards became the very first woman to take part in the Whitbread Round the World Race, now the Volvo Ocean Race. Afterwards she began assembling an all-woman crew and bought a boat called Prestige, which was refitted and renamed Maiden by the Dutchess of York in 1988. Tracey Edwards and the crew of Maiden celebrate winning a leg during the 1989/90 Whitbread Round the World Race 25 years ago. Miss Edwards is now trying to rescue the vessel from ruin . The vessel 'Maiden' has been languishing on an Indian Ocean island and £50,000 needs to be raised for it to be returned to Britain . A year later Maiden was among 22 boats which started the race from Southampton and she led her team to second overall in her class. She added: 'The Maiden campaign was so much more than just a group of women proving they could race around the world. 'It became a symbol for anyone inspired to achieve something amazing. We weren’t a big budget boat and we had to scrimp and save to make it happen. 'With a little bit of TLC we can restore Maiden to her former splendour and our hope is she can inspire countless people to sail. There is still plenty of life left in Maiden.'

"Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said three in four people back the benefits cap . The cap on benefits of £26,000 a year could be cut, Iain Duncan Smith suggested  yesterday, telling MPs that the figure was ‘under review’. The Work and Pensions Secretary was responding to continuing anger from Tories, who indicated that they want the figure reduced to £20,000 or lower. MP Andrew Bridgen told the Commons that the limit was ‘considerably more’ than the average take-home pay in his constituency. Official figures show workers in North West Leicestershire earn on average £22,130 but keep only £17,866 after tax. Mr Bridgen urged the Minister to  continue the squeeze so benefits were always lower than earnings. Mr Duncan Smith’s comment follows demands from Conservative MPs last week to lower the limit to £20,000. He said yesterday: ‘The only people who don’t support the cap are the Labour Opposition.’ Tory MP Philip Davies also highlighted the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street and Channel 5’s On Benefits and Proud. He said it showed claimants who could afford ‘copious amounts of cigarettes, have lots of tattoos done [and] watch Sky TV on the obligatory wide-screen television’. Last week it was revealed 33,000 families claimed £26,000-plus a year in handouts before the cap was imposed last July. It included 150 who received more than the take-home pay of someone on a salary of £65,000-a-year. In the Commons Mr Bridgen said his constituents were astonished by the figures. Jobcentre: Ministers hope that capping benefits will persuade thousands of people to find work instead . He urged Mr Duncan Smith to ‘persevere with this policy of a benefits cap and also review the level at which the cap, which is currently considerably more than the average post tax income in my constituency’. Reducing the cap to £20,000 would be the equivalent to take take home pay of someone in work on a salary of around £25,000. Mr Duncan Smith said: ’73 per cent of the public support the cap as it stands, nine out of 10 Londoners in a recent poll supported the cap. The only people who don't support the cap are the Labour opposition. ‘We will keep the policy under review but the one thing we should celebrate is we are reforming welfare to ensure those who need the money get it, and those who don't make sure they go back to work.’ The cap affects income from the main out-of-work benefits including Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit and other benefits such as Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit and Carer’s Allowance. However, households are exempt from the cap if someone living their receives one of a number of other benefits such as Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Industrial Injuries Benefit and the War Disablement Pension. Mr Duncan Smith also revealed he thought the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street was helping to win the argument for reform. The Tory minister said viewers were rightly 'shocked' by programmes such as Benefits Street and On Benefits and Proud, featuring people who spend their benefit money on luxuries such as cigarettes and wide-screen TVs, but that they had enabled the Government to force through measures, which he said would put an end to the abuse. Conservative MP Philip Davies said the documentaries will leave working people 'irritated' by the spending f those living on state handouts. Channel 4 show Benefits Street, which features people living on James Turner Street in Birmingham, is helping to win the argument for benefits reform, Mr Duncan Smith suggested . The member for Shipley asked Mr Duncan Smith: 'Have you managed to watch programmes like Benefits Street and On Benefits and Proud? 'If . so, have you, like me, been struck by the number of people on there who . manage to combine complaining about welfare reforms whilst being able . to afford being able to buy copious amounts of cigarettes, have lots of . tattoos done, watch Sky TV on the obligatory wide-screen television?' He . added: 'Do you understand the concerns and irritations of many of the . people who go out to work every day, pay their taxes, who cannot afford . those kinds of luxuries themselves?' Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'Many people are shocked by what they see, but the reality is that is why the public backs our welfare reform package, to get more people back to work, to end these abuses.' He said the last Labour government, which presided over 'massive spending and trapping people in a benefit dependency' was to blame for the abuse.","Work and Pensions Secretary said £26,000 limit on claims is 'under review'

"The ghost of a guilt-ridden nanny who allegedly saw a child die in her care during the Second World War has been spotted in an Oxfordshire bed and breakfast, experts believe. During a ghost tour of the historic area, an outline of her spirit is thought to have been captured in an eerie photograph of Langsmeade House in Thame. The house, which was built in 1924, has previously been listed on local websites as a hotbed for paranormal activity where guests reported hearing footsteps and ghosts 'clearing their throats'. Scroll down for video . Paranormal activity: The ghost of a guilt-ridden nanny is thought to have appeared at the window of the B&B as a group of enthusiasts passed by . It is the first time the ghost has been seen on the property but guests have mentioned others in the past, its owner said. Michelle Morris was taking part in a 'paranormal investigation' in the house on Halloween when she heard 'activity upstairs'. The 42-year-old said: 'I was outside with a group of guests and we were investigating the grounds,' the 42-year-old said. 'We decided to head towards the house and when I looked up there was a lot of activity on the top floor. 'That’s when I started taking photos as I knew it was something paranormal.' The student decided to take a photograph of the building, which is when the ghost's outline appeared. 'Another man says he heard a child whisper in his ear: ""I fell out a tree"" and I think it was the ghost of the guilty nanny,' she added. It is one of the few sightings Ms Morris has experienced since taking up ghost hunting last year. 'I'm fascinated by what is out there and whether there is anything for us after death. Ghost-hunters said there was 'a lot of activity' on the top floor of the guest house which they believed was empty . 'I love what I do and this photo makes it all worthwhile.' Marianne Aben, who owns the property, said she has experienced paranormal activity in the house but knows nothing of the death of a nanny. 'I have lived in Langsmeade House since January 1988, the record holder of all the residents since 1924 when the house was built. 'There are definitely unexplainable ongoings, but I have not heard of a nanny and a dead child falling from a tree. 'I have searched for the names of all the previous owners and only the first one who commissioned the building at the time, could not be traced. If any fatal accident has happened here, then it must have been in the first three years of this house's existence,' she said.","Eerie outline of a woman spotted peering out of top storey window .

"Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik used dum-dum bullets - which explode inside the body and often kill their targets instantly - on his deadly rampage around the idyllic holiday island of Utoya. The revelation by a surgeon comes as these incredible photographs emerge of children using mattresses to barricade themselves into their rooms. Eyewitnesses have described how the mass-murderer was 'calm and collected' during his spree, and and explained how they pretended to play dead to escape death. Terrified victims, aged between 15 and . 25, hid in buildings, crouched behind trees and lay among dead bodies. Others pretended to be dead . while some dived into freezing waters to escape Utoya island, north west of Oslo. Terrified victims posted this picture on Facebook after they barricaded themselves in a building on the island . Idyllic: An aerial view of Utoya Island, Norway, taken a day before the shootings . One young couple even hid in a freezer . for two hours while frantically trying to contact friends and family. Other witnesses said Breivik 'shot the cutest girl first' and would laugh and shout during the killing spree. Erlend Fosseida Selre, 19, said he was . watching TV coverage of the bombing in the country's capital, Oslo, . when the shooting started. 'We could hear shots and speaking from the floor outside. We thought it was the gunman walking around. 'We decided to stay until someone came to open the door, and prayed it would not be the gunman,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. Survivor Prableen Kaur, the deputy . leader of the AUF, the ruling Labour party's youth wing, said she was . talking to friends when she heard the first shots and immediately texted . her mum to say she was OK. And the chief surgeon at a hospital treating victims of Norway's camp massacre said the killer used special bullets designed to disintegrate inside the body and cause maximum internal damage. Dr Colin Poole, head of surgery at Ringriket Hospital in Honefoss north west of Oslo, said surgeons treating 16 gunshot victims have recovered no full bullets. He said: 'These bullets more or less exploded inside the body. These bullets inflicted internal damage that's absolutely horrible.' Ballistics experts say so-called dum-dum bullets also are lighter in weight and can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances. They commonly are used by air marshals on aeroplanes and hunters of small animals. Poole, a surgeon for 26 years at the hospital, said the bullets were 'hyper-fragmentable' and produced confusing pictures on X-rays. 'It's caused us all kinds of extra problems in dealing with the wounds they cause, with very strange trajectories. The effect they cause inside the body is like a thousand pin pricks.' At first a number of people thought it . was a joke but soon realised the reality of the situation when Breivik . began chasing his victims down. Miss Kaur said the killer shot a . number of people around her. Desperate to live, she pretended she was . dead and lay ontop of another body for more than an hour. Lethal: Dum-dum bullet are more deadly than normal ammunition as they leave a larger exit wound . Eventually a local man with a tiny . boat came to her rescue and she was taken to the mainland where she was . able to ring her mother. 'I'm still in shock. I have seen the corpses of my friends and several of my friends are missing. 'I am glad I am alive. This summer's most beautiful fairy tale is transformed into Norway's worst nightmare.' Adrian Pracon, one of the organisers . of the political summer camp, was working in the information booth when . the massacre took place. The . 21-year-old, who was shot in the back as he pretended to play dead, . said people had thought the gunman, dressed in police uniform, was there . to help. He also described how he would shoot . to kill, carefully pulling the trigger, and said the blond-haired . gunman looked as though he was straight out of a 'Nazi movie'. 'The . man started walking towards the camp and people ran up to him to ask . him what was going on. They head heard what had happened further down . the hill, but the man he brought out a gun and he shot four people,' said Mr Pracon. 'They came to him for help and he just shot them. It's unbelievable that something like this could happen.' Survivor Thorbjorn Verride, 22, from the shootings on Utoya island breaks down after being taken to safety . A group of young girls comfort one another after Breivik went on his killing spree . Survivor: Adrian Pracon, his shot gun wound clearly visible, speaks to the BBC about the terror that unfolded on the island . Camp: Temporary morgue tents were put up by rescue workers after 85 people were killed on the island of Utoya . Mr Pracon described how the 32-year-old right wing extremist knew his victims had little chance of escape and would check bodies for any signs of life, kicking them as he moved along. 'He then started looking for people and followed them into their tents, he kept shooting them inside their tents and they had nowhere to hide. Rescue workers search for bodies in the lake. It is believed a mini submarine is also being used in the search . 'There were 20 to 30 people died in the water, I saw a couple of people being shot and the weapon was so powerful. The jet of the water was huge and became red,' he said. Desperate to escape he hid behind the dead bodies and lay there before he heard Breivik coming. 'Luckily I was lying down but people were falling about me. Around my legs, behind me and in the front of me so I hid behind them. I stayed completely still and did not want to show the gunman any sign of life. 'He walked towards me, over dead bodies that were lying around me, I heard his shoes walking and felt his breath. 'He was calm and collective, he was not in a hurry to press the trigger quickly and if people ran, he knew he would catch them, no problem,' Mr Pracon told the BBC. Before he was shot Mr Pracon said he had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only managed a short distance before deciding to turn back. He was then shot in the shoulder as he tried to pretend he was dead. Now, recovering in hospital, he said: 'I heard a loud band and a high pitched sound in my ear and after that it lasted until I went to the hospital.'

"As well as standard age ratings such as PG, 12A and 18 we may soon be seeing films given an additional rating based on its depiction of female  characters. The Bath Film Festival has announced that it will be introducing a new 'F' rating when it opens for its 24th year later this week, which will indicate that a film either has a strong female protagonist, director or screenwriter or addresses women's issues. This rating takes forward the idea of the 'Bechdel test', which festival organisers believe is too restrictive, and aims to counteract the gender stereotyping of women that is so prominent in the film industry. Despite the strong female lead, played by Sandra Bullock, Gravity would not pass the Bechdel test . The 'Bechdel test' was developed by cartoonist and US feminist Alison Bechdel and monitors whether at least two female characters talk to each other about subjects other than men. Cinemas in Sweden embraced the guidance system, last year introducing an ‘A’ rating to highlight films that failed the Bechdel test and so are deemed to have a shortage of ‘female perspectives’. However the organisers of this years Bath Film Festival felt that the rating was lacking, prompting them to introduce their 'F' rating, which is held by only 19 of the 42 films being shown during the festival, including Reese Witherspoon's new film 'Wild', My Old Lady starring Maggie Smith and Testament of Youth which is Vera Brittain’s  story of life during WW1. Many believe Reese Witherspoon will be given an Oscar for her role in 'Wild' -one of the films given an 'F' Testament Of Youth, starring Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain and Kit Harington as Roland Leighton, is one of the films that has been awarded a 'F' rating in the Bath Film Festival . Speaking to the MailOnline Producer of Bath Film Festival Holly Tarquini explained the decision to expand on the Bechdel rating: 'There's quite a lot of films with significant female roles that don't pass the Bechdel test. Gravity is the classic of course where Sandra (Bullock) plays such a strong character in the film but doesn't speak to another woman. 'I also wanted to illustrate the discrepancies not just in people on screen but those behind the camera. 'There is a significant gender difference in the numbers of men and women in producing, writing and directing roles. The 'Bechdel test' was developed by cartoonist and US feminist Alison Bechdel, pictured . 'If you speak to people in the film industry  they will claim there is no gender inequality, yet only  4.7 per cent of the films coming out of Hollywood last year were directed by women which is just staggering. 'I don't think it is something considered or intentional within the industry. And it is certainly not based on concerns over profit; films directed by women gross the same, films with female lead tend to gross more, and more women buy cinema tickets than men.' Holly and the Bath Film Festival organising committee hope that their new 'F' rating will draw attention to this issue, as well as the female characters depicted in films. 'If you look at movies there are minuscule numbers of women in professional roles in them, yet, certainly in the UK and US, in reality it is 50 per cent. They don't reflect reality. 'It feels as if we don't shine a light on it and acknowledge it wont ever change. We need to look at it and talk about it. 'It would be great if everybody took it on so that people who are interested carry on having the conversation about how disproportionate it is.' They hope that the F rating will also go some way to helping alleviate the falling numbers of women in the film industry in the UK. Figures from the BFI’s Statistical Yearbook for 2013 show that in 2011, 18.9 per cent of UK writers for released films were female, in 2012, it was 13.4 per cent. Similarly, in 2011 15 per cent of all UK films released were directed by women, this went down too to just 7.8 per cent in 2012. Research in the U.S. also supports the notion that women are underrepresented on the screen and that little has changed in the past 60 years. Of the U.S. top 100 films in 2011, women accounted for 33 per cent of all characters and only 11 per cent of the protagonists, according to a study by the San Diego-based Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film. Another study, by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, showed the ratio of male to female characters in movies has remained at about two to one for at least six decades. That study, which examined 855 top box-office films from 1950-2006, showed female characters were twice as likely to be seen in explicit sexual scenes as males, while male characters were more likely to be seen as violent. ‘Apparently Hollywood thinks that films with male characters will do better at the box office. It is also the case that most of the aspects of movie-making - writing, production, direction, and so on - are dominated by men, and so it is not a surprise that the stories we see are those that tend to revolve around men,’ Amy Bleakley, the study's lead author, said in an email.","Bath's 24th Film Festival to introduce new 'F' rating .

"Former senior Olympic team official, Greg Hodge, is being investigated after a new set of allegations were made about his behaviour. The head coach at the West Coast Swimming Club had already been accused of inappropriate behaviour after it was alleged that he kissed a female junior swimmer on the cheek at a Canberra state championship event. Swimming Western Australia received complaints about the incident and Hodges' coaching membership with the Australian Swimming Coaches and Teachers Association is currently under review. Head coach at the West Coast Swimming Club, Greg Hodge, is being investigated over a second allegation of inappropriate conduct . However a second allegation regarding inappropriate conduct is reported to have been put forward about the coach last week, according to News Limited. The West Coast Swimming club said Hodge would continue on  despite the allegations. A second Olympic coach, Michael Palfrey, has also been revealed to have had allegations of inappropriate conduct towards young teenage athletes launched against him. The former senior Olympic team official is still being investiated over a previous allegation that he kissed a female junior swimmer on the cheek . Some of the official complaints have come from former coach Tim Lane who alleged he saw Mr Palfrey 'affectionately touch and rub the neck and shoulders of female athletes ...', News Limited reports. Swimming Western Australia CEO Darren Beazley dubbed allegations against a second olympic coach, Michael Palfrey, as 'unsubstantiated' Mr Lane's allegations also included a recollection of a number of incidents, in one of which he claimed Mr Palfrey encouraged a male teenage swimming student to improve his time by telling him he could 'spend a night with one of his older female athletes' who was nearby at the time, and 'do whatever he wanted to her'. Mr Palfrey denied all of the allegations which have been dismissed after a joint investigation by Swimming WA and he Western Australian Institute of Sport found them to be 'unsubstantiated'. It has meanwhile been announced that Australian Olympic team officials and coaches will undergo mandatory working with children checks in the lead-up to the Rio games in 2016. Australian Olympic Committee John Coates said the move was sparked by revelations at the royal commission into child sexual abuse. 'I want us to try and set the highest standard possible here in protecting athletes,' he said. Mr Coates has consulted with British and US counterparts on the issue of child abuse in elite sport and praised their vigorous policies. Australia was looking at similar policies.","Greg Hodge, a head coach at the West Coast Swimming Club, is being investigated over a second allegation of inappropriate conduct .

"Hundreds of mice and dozens of monkeys have been infected with Ebola by the Ministry of Defence as part of research into the killer virus. Official figures show 200 mice and 56 marmosets were infected with the disease, which causes internal haemorrhaging, and then killed, over two years. Last night it emerged a patient in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was being tested for Ebola after returning sick from a visit to West Africa, which is currently suffering the worst ever outbreak of the virus. Scroll down for video . Porton Down: The site in Wiltshire has been the centre of the UK's chemical weapons research for 100 years . Stocks of Ebola are kept at MoD's research centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire, a highly secretive location where work has long been done on chemical and biological weapons. Revealing the scale of the Ebola research, officials told The Sun that all the animals were awake when they were infected with the virus, then 'humanely culled' after tests or when their suffering became too severe. The research was said to be aimed at understanding the development and spread of Ebola in animals, with later experiments working on possible treatments. Last night Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency confirmed a patient who returned from West Africa with malaria was being tested for the Ebola virus at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. The PHA has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community. The patient is being kept in isolation and tested for Ebola at the Royal Victoria Hospital, pictured, in Belfast . The Public Health Agency has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community . A spokesman for the PHA said: 'The Public Health Agency has confirmed that a person who has recently travelled in an area affected by Ebola is being assessed in accordance with the agreed risk assessment. 'The PHA is liaising with colleagues and has advised that there is no increased risk to the wider community. 'Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, can be a severe illness in humans. The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is two to 21 days. Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle carry out a Ebola training exercise . 'It is important to note that the likelihood of contracting EVD is extremely low unless the person had come into contact with blood or body fluids of a symptomatic person. Therefore we would like to stress that the risk to the public is low. A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop a fever, a headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat, and intense muscle weakness. These symptoms start suddenly between two and 21 days after becoming infected. Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and impaired kidney and liver function follow. The patient then bleeds internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth. Ebola virus disease is fatal in 50 to 90 per cent of cases. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chances that they will survive. Source: NHS Choices . 'There is no change to the current situation in Northern Ireland in that the risk to the public here is very low. 'The patient being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, has tested positive for Malaria, and an Ebola test is being done as a precautionary measure. 'A further update will be given when results are available.' Last week, a woman with a history of travel to west Africa was tested for Ebola at St George's Hospital in south London. She arrived at the hospital complaining of a fever - and tested negative after being kept in isolation and closely monitored overnight in line with national guidelines for handling the outbreak. Other UK hospitals and health centres which have seen walk-in cases of patients tested for Ebola - with negative results - include the City of Coventry Health Centre and Southmead Hospital in Bristol. In October, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that up to ten Ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas - and that the health crisis will get worse before it improves. The death toll from the Ebola epidemic has now risen to 4,950 out of 13,241 cases in the three worst-hit countries of West Africa, the World Health Organization said on Friday. Last week, a patient presented herself to St George's Hospital, pictured, in Tooting, south London, with a high temperature.

"EU rules on food allergens will cost British restaurants many millions of pounds, while elsewhere in Europe the new regulations will be ignored, leading chefs have warned. Coming into effect next month, the regulations require food outlets to check on 14 ingredients that cause allergic reactions. Schools, hospital and prison kitchens must also comply, along with hotels, restaurants, B&Bs, takeaways and suppliers. EU rules on food allergens will cost British restaurants many millions of pounds, while elsewhere in Europe the new regulations will be ignored, leading chefs have warned . The rule demands that every ingredient in each fresh dish served is checked for 14 specific allergens, including cereals, eggs, milk, nuts and fish. Allergy experts hope the move will help prevent some of the ten UK allergy related deaths each year. But chefs fear the rules will burden the industry with £200 million in extra costs, which will have to be passed on to customers. Italian-born chef Aldo Zilli said: ‘It’s a regulation too far. Diners know what they want and will tell us. ‘Changing the menu is hard enough, without checking which of hundreds of ingredients include one of 14 allergens. Italian-born chef Aldo Zilli (pictured) called the step a 'regulation too far' ‘In Italy, chefs are not going to like it and to be honest they won’t even be listening. 'French chefs, even worse. But in this country, we have to comply.’ A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: ‘Many businesses won’t incur additional costs because they already voluntarily provide these details.’","Other EU nations will ignore the new regulations, leading chefs have warned .

"Warning: Tory group Renewal said it is up to David Cameron to 'right the wrong' of the party opposing minimum wage . David Cameron must increase the minimum wage because many poor voters no longer believe in capitalism, Tory MPs warn today. Echoing Ed Miliband’s critique of predatory capitalism, the Conservative group Renewal, which campaigns for the Tories to broaden their appeal with working class voters, today warns the Prime Minister that he must do more for the North or risk losing the next election. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow has already won the nickname ‘the most expensive MP in Parliament’ after persuading Chancellor George Osborne to freeze fuel duty to help voters who are feeling the squeeze. Today he calls for the National Minimum Wage, currently £6.31 an hour for the over 21s to be raised - a move being considered by the Low Pay Commission and the Chancellor. He said: ‘It was a big mistake for the Conservative Party to oppose the minimum wage. We must right that wrong by at least increasing it in line with inflation. We should not make the same mistake. ‘We must move on to ensure that everyone, in the north and the south, on low wages as well as high, can benefit from the proceeds of growth. If we say that the Conservative Party is on the side of hard working people then we have to really mean it.’ Renewal announced that they will now begin work on a project called ‘Renewing Capitalism’, to come up with ‘new ways to create a genuinely competitive economic environment in which the consumer and the low-paid are protected, competition is cherished and anti-competitive, monopolistic behaviour is cracked down on’. They will also explore ideas to create wealth in parts of the country that have been struggling to share in prosperity since the 1980s, notably deindustrialised towns in northern England. David Skelton, founder of the group, said: ‘The Conservative Party needs to come to terms with the fact that many people, particularly the low paid, don’t think that capitalism is working for them. ‘We need to do more to show that capitalism can work for everybody in every part of the country. Being pro market isn’t the same as being pro big business. 'Where there are instances of abuse - in either the public or the private sector - Conservatives should come down hard to protect the consumer.’ Chancellor George Osborne is now considering the move as the Conservatives court voters . That critique is a stark echo of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s view that Britain needs a ‘new kind of economy’. The Labour leader is due to make a speech later this week in which he will spell out more ideas about what aides say is his determination to temper the excesses of traditional Anglo-Saxon market economies and create a society more like that of Germany or Scandinavia where businesses and unions work more closely together. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The government is helping hardworking families across Britain and offering them financial security by letting people earn £10,000 before they pay tax, cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax. ‘Ambitious projects like HS2 and the electrification of local rail services in the North - key elements of our long-term economic plan - are vital to Britain’s recovery.’","Tory group Renewal calls for £6.31-an-hour rate for over 21s to be raised .

"Angela Merket was joined by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as more than a million people took to the streets to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. A spectacular 15 kilometre-long string of 7,000 illuminated helium balloons traced the course of the barrier that once snaked through the city, cutting across streets, between families and even through graveyards.

Germans, whose national pride was shattered by Nazism, the Second World War and the Holocaust, have proudly focused on the peaceful East German revolution that felled the Wall as a crowning moment in their modern history. Festivities to mark the anniversary drew more than one million Berliners and tourists to the heart of the once-divided city. Earlier today German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the celebrations calling it an example of the human yearning for freedom. Ms Merkel said the celebrations also honoured those who helped bring down the barrier that for 28 years symbolised the Cold War. 'The fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true,' Ms Merkel said at the main memorial site for the Wall on Bernauer Strasse. 'Nothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are. ‘It showed that we have the power to shape our destiny and make things better,’ she said, noting that people in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere around the world should feel heartened by the example of the Wall's sudden demise. ‘It was a victory of freedom over bondage.’ She also placed a flower in a crack in the wall, along with Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit. The crowd also cheered when former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, widely admired in Germany for his role in paving the way for the Wall's collapse, stood and waved. He ominously warned in a speech in Berlin on Saturday that a new Cold War was looming over the Ukraine crisis. The 83-year-old has accused the West, particularly the U.S. of giving in to 'triumphalism' after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc a quarter century ago. He warned: 'The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it's already begun.' Failure to achieve security in Europe would make the continent irrelevant in world affairs, he added.

Accompanied by Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit (right) Ms Merkel places a flower in a joint of concrete segments of a remaining part of the Berlin Wall at the Berlin Wall Memorial . Elsewhere this evening, Peter Gabriel played a powerful rendition of ‘Heroes’ and several German artists performed on stage as well. Despite the fog and cold, many wandered along the former ‘death strip’ where the Wall stood and where the illuminated helium balloons forming the ‘Lichtgrenze’, or Border of Light, were perched 3.6 metres (11.8 feet) high on poles matching the height of the barrier built in 1961 by Communist East Germany. ‘We're the happiest people in the world and we're thrilled that you brought the Berlin Wall down 25 years ago,’ Berlin's Mayor Klaus Wowereit said as the first balloons were sent aloft. ‘Nothing and no one can stand in the way of freedom.’ The anniversary of the Wall's fall was marked around the world. Pope Francis told tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square that it should spur people to try to topple other walls. ‘Where there is a wall, there is a closing of hearts. We need bridges, not walls,’ he said. Balloons are let into the air as part of the 'Border of Light' installation in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate . Fireworks illuminate the historic Brandenburg Gate - the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989 . At least 138 people were killed trying to escape to West Berlin and many who were captured ended up in jail . The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to stop East Germans fleeing to the West. It began as a barbed wire and cinder block wall and was then fortified as a heavily guarded 160 km (100-mile) white concrete barrier that encircled West Berlin. At least 138 people were killed trying to escape to West Berlin and many who were captured ended up in jail. Communist regimes collapsed in the face of popular uprisings across Eastern Europe in 1989, signalling the end of the Cold War, of which the Berlin Wall had become the starkest symbol. On the night of November 9, 1989, thousands of East Berliners streamed through the once-closed border crossings after communist authorities caved in to mounting pressure and relaxed travel restrictions that had prevented their citizens from going to the west for decades. The fall of the Wall was the climax of weeks of popular protests spurred by changes that had already taken place elsewhere in eastern Europe. Ms Merkel noted the important examples set by the democracy movements in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and praised East Germans who were inspired by them to stand up to the dictatorship.

"They may sound like two of the most unlikeliest pairings ever to be considered in the beverage world, but Pepsi, the makers of Mountain Dew, has confirmed it is looking into creating a Dorito's nacho-cheese flavored version of the soda. Disgusting though it may sound, the soft drink giant claims it is already testing a special brew among students at universities across the country - and the reviews aren't all that bad. The company appears to have worked out how turn the addictive cheesy flavor of its tortilla chips snack into a drink. Gross or brilliant? PepsiCo is testing a soft drink that combines the cheesy flavor of Doritos chips with the sugar-bomb soda Mountain Dew . Liquid cheese in a botte: The reviewer wrote, 'Honestly wasn’t too disgusting. It just had a really strong Doritos aftertaste, which was odd.' Its not known if the drink will be on sale anytime soon . News of the bizarre new flavor spread online when a Redditor posted an image of an orange liquid he said Pepsi was giving out at a 'Mtn Dew Dewitos' booth. 'They were giving samples of this,' user joes_nipples captioned the photo. 'It actually tasted like Doritos.' The Redditor went on to state that the sample of the classic sugar-fueled soft drink and the processed cheese masterpiece that is Doritos, 'wasn't that disgusting.' 'It tasted like orange with a doritos after taste. It tasted like straight doritos afterwards though. Weirdest thing I've ever drunken.' Spit or swallow? Students at Kent State University had the opportunity to 'Do the Dewitos.' Photos were posted showing a black stand emblazoned with 'Mtn Dew Dewitos' holding small taste-testing cups full of a bright orange soda . Familiar flavors: In 2008 Dorito's created a Mountain Dew flavored chip. Now they're making the reverse! The new combination drink was spotted by the freshman at Kent State University in Ohio who tasted the 'DEWitos' drink when samples were being offered on campus. The user added that the flavor was 'like if you shoved a handful of Doritos in your mouth and chugged some Dew at the same time.' 'Someone at the Mountain Dew design department was getting really high,' Other flavors up for consideration, according to the freshman, are lemon ginger, mango habanero and rainbow sherbet, which he said tasted like medicine. Pepsi has now confirmed that the rumors are in fact true. 'We are always testing out new flavours of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us,' a Pepsi representative said. 'We opened up the DEW flavour vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.' It's not known when the drink may be available in stores, however this isn't the first time Doritos have been combined with Mountain Dew. In 2008, FritoLay released a chip called 'Doritos Quest,' a 'mystery' chip whose secret ingredient was later revealed to be Mountain Dew. However, a nacho-flavored beverage seems much worse!

"The two Americans freed from captivity in North Korea have touched down in the United States to a tearful reunion with their families. Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller were freed from the reclusive communist state on Saturday following a secret mission by the top U.S. intelligence official. Last night, the pair landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state about midnight ET (9pm local time). Scroll down for video . Ecstatic: Kenneth Bae's mother ran over to her son at a Washington air base on Saturday two years after he was captured in North Korea and sentenced to 15 years behind bars for alleged anti-government activities . Emotional embrace: Matthew Miller, 24, beamed as his mother rushed over to the plane to hug him . Bae, who was jailed in 2012 for alleged anti-government activities, was the first to step off the plane emblazoned with stars and stripes and onto the tarmac into the arms of his family members. The Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, laughed and beamed as he hugged his mother who ran over to him. He was followed by California-born Miller, 24, who was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. With a shaved head, Miller looked happy but subdued as he walked down the steps and into his beaming mother's arms. His father wrapped an arm over his shoulder and took one of Miller's two small bags to carry. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation. While Miller went home with his family, Bae and his sister Terri Chung address a press conference. Freed: Bae was freed along with Miller after a lengthy intelligence operation by the top US official . Family: He was joined by his children, sister and brother-in-law based in Washington . 'I've grown': Bae told reporters he has learned a lot in his two years of hard labor at his private prison . Bae's family have thanked President Obama for not abandoning their relative . Bae thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him, and said 'it's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot.' He started his speech by saying: 'I just want to say thank you all for supporiting me and standing by me in this time and it's been just [an] amazing blessing to see so many people being involved getting me released in the last two years - not to mention the thousands of people praying for me. 'I just want to thank you for lifting me up and not forgetting me, not forgetting the people of North Korea as well.' 'This has been a tremendously difficult time for my family. 'I just want to thank President Obama and the state departments working tirelessly to bring me home, and North Korea. 'It's been an amazing two years. I learned a lot, I grew a lot lost, a lot of weight - in a good way - and I'm standing strong.'

Miller (right) was detained after allegedly ripping his tourist visa . Obama tabled the mission last week and it was approved by Congress, which sent intelligence official James Clapper to North Korea with a presidential letter. Bae and Miller were the last US nationals held by the dictatorship following the release last month of Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio resident detained for nearly six months. Bae's delighted son, Jonathan, told Reuters from Arizona that he received a call Friday night and spoke to his father. 'The brief time on the phone, he sounded good,' Jonathan said. 'I'm sure he will be back to his old self in no time. 'It came out of the blue. One minute he was doing farm labor and the next minute they are saying, 'You are going home.' Just like everyone else, he was surprised.' The announcement about Bae and Miller came one day before Obama travels to Asia for a three-country visit.

"A British tourist has gone on trial in Tenerife accused of attacking a couple with a meat cleaver and a knife. Martin Leonard, 64, from Crossways, Dorset, denies attempting to murder fellow Britons Andrew and Wendy Stewart at the Next Door Bar in the Malibu Park hotel at Playa de las Americas on south coast of the Canary Island in January 2012. Leonard allegedly slashed Mrs Stewart, leaving her left ear hanging by a thin piece of skin, and wounded Mr Stewart in the shoulder and face. Martin Leonard, 64, from Dorset, denies attempting to murder fellow Britons Andrew and Wendy Stewart at a hotel bar at Playa de las Americas (pictured) on south coast of the Canary Island in January 2012 . The defendant, who has been held on the island since his arrest a day after the incident, was a regular winter visitor and had an apartment at the park. Prosecutors said Leonard became involved in a heated argument with Andrew Stewart and his wife Wendy. According to witnesses, Leonard was asked to leave the premises after the altercation but returned minutes later, wielding a 7' kitchen knife and a 13' meat cleaver. Without warning, he lashed out wildly at Mr Stewart, slashing him in the head and left shoulder. Doctors said Mr Stewart suffered a deep wound from the bridge of his nose to his hair line and needed 15 to 20 stitches. His wife sustained serious facial injuries as she tried to protect her husband and required 21 stitches to sew her ear back on after it was nearly completely sliced off by a blow with the cleaver. Doctors told the court that the ear was 'hanging on by the skin' when she was admitted to hospital for urgent treatment. A third person, Lynn Gilliard, who was working in the bar that night, had tendons severed in three fingers of her right hand as she stepped in to protect Mrs Stewart. Leonard, who has been held on remand on the island since his arrest a day after the incident, was a regular winter visitor and had an apartment at the park . The court heard that Leonard was eventually restrained by father-of-two Paul Matthews, a former car salesman from Stourbridge who was on holiday in Tenerife at the time. Leonard appeared in court wearing a blue tracksuit top, checked shirt and black trousers and walked with the aid of a crutch. Mr Stewart described how he was having a quiet drink on his night off work with his wife when Leonard, who was a complete stranger to the couple, approached them and engaged in conversation. His wife Wendy told the court that she saw Leonard approach Mr Stewart and then strike him with the cleaver before turning to attack her. She said: 'My ear was nearly chopped off and, just as he tried to hit me again, my friend Lynn stepped in and was cut badly when she put her hand in the way to protect me'. The alleged attack took place at the Next Door Bar in the Malibu Park hotel (pictured) at Playa de las Americas . Lynn Gilliard described how she had ordered Leonard out of the bar after the initial argument and saw him return a short time later. She said: 'I don't think he was using the knives to intimidate. For me, he wanted to kill.' Ms Gilliard added that she has partially lost the use of her right index finger as a result of the attack and admits to suffering 'nightmares and insomnia' since the incident. In his opening statement to the court, Leonard - who acknowledged that the two large knives had 'probably come' from his apartment - admitted causing bodily harm but pleaded not guilty to the attempted murders of Mr and Mrs Stewart. When pressed by the judges as to why he was now admitting guilt, he said: 'It is clear that three people were injured and I was responsible, although I remember nothing about it.

"The world's leading points scorer Dan Carter will join French club Racing Metro on a three-year contract after next year's World Cup, a move that will almost certainly bring an end to his  international career. The 32-year-old had been widely expected to leave New Zealand after the 2015 tournament in England following a horrendous run with injuries. It will be Carter's second foray into French club rugby after he signed a seven-month deal with Perpignan in 2008 but only played five games before a foot injury. Dan Carter will become rugby's highest-paid player in the world when he joins Racing Metro . All Blacks star Carter will join French club Racing Metro on a three-year deal after the World Cup . Racing Metro president Jacky Lorenzetti gives a press conference with a picture of Carter in the background . Carter will earn a reported £1.3million a year at Racing, making him the highest-paid player in the world. 'Carter will be the best paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits,' said the millionaire owner of the club Jacky Lorenzetti. 'We count on his experience to help the other players grow,' coach Laurent Labit added. Racing's other coach, Laurent Travers, said Carter would play either as fly-half or inside centre. 'He can play 10 or 12. He does not have a priority. He just wants to bring something to the team.' And Carter said in a statement: 'It's going to be an awesome adventure for me and my family.' 'Having said that, it's the immediate future that is exciting me at the moment. 2015 is going to be a big year and I'm looking forward to getting into it.' He joins Australia veteran Adam Ashley-Cooper, who said earlier he would join Bordeaux-Begles on a two-year contract, and former Wallabies captain James Horwill who will join English club Harlequins following the World Cup. The exodus from New Zealand and Australia is expected to grow, with reports that All Blacks inside centre Ma'a Nonu is fielding overseas offers. Carter signed a seven-month deal with Perpignan in 2008 but only played five games due to a foot injury . The All Blacks fly half burst on to the scene when he starred in his side's 3-0 whitewash of the Lions in 2005 . All Blacks centre Ma'a Nonu is also reportedly fielding overseas offers from a number of different clubs . Both countries have selection policies that preclude players based overseas from playing for the national sides. Carter's move is unsurprising given his run with injury since the 2011 World Cup, where he suffered a torn groin muscle before the All Blacks' final pool game and was ruled out of the rest of the tournament. He has appeared in just eight of the All Blacks' 28 tests in the past two seasons after problems with his Achilles' tendon, groin, shoulder and a broken leg. He was identified by coach Steve Hansen two years ago as a 'red-flag athlete', whose workload needed to be carefully managed to get him through to the 2015 World Cup. Carter had a NZRU-approved six-month sabbatical earlier this year to allow him time to recover from niggling injuries but then broke his leg in the Super Rugby final in August and played just two tests on the end of season tour this year. Carter missed the latter stages of New Zealand's 2011 World Cup triumph after he sustained a groin injury .","Dan Carter's move is expected to end his international career .

"Luuk de Jong scored a hat-trick and Memphis Depay netted the winner in the third minute of stoppage time as PSV Eindhoven beat Feyenoord 4-3 in a thrilling clash that put them four points clear on Wednesday. De Jong equalised twice for the hosts and then put them 3-2 ahead, before Feyenoord striker Colin Kazim-Richards seemed to have salvaged a point by heading home a cross with just a minute remaining. Depay scored a simple tap-in three minutes into stoppage time, however, to seal a victory for PSV that extended their lead at the top of the standings and put a serious dent in their opponents' title hopes.

"Tony Abbott's daughter has received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister, it has been revealed. The news comes on the same day that thousands of students have protested across Australia about the cuts to tertiary education funding, announced in Mr Abbott's federal budget. Frances Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors. Scroll down for video . Frances Abbott was awarded a $60,000 scholarship at Whitehouse Institute of Design in Sydney . 'Frances definitely was a student with us and received a chairman's scholarship,' Leanne Whitehouse, director of the Institute told Guardian Australia. The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said. Mr Abbott has not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events. Revelation: Tony Abbott's daughter received a scholarship for a univeristy degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister . Prestigious: Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 from the Whitehouse Institute and is currently working for them as a teacher's aide in Melbourne . Current laws rule that members of the House of Representatives are required to declare gifts of more than $300 when they are given to themselves, their spouses and dependent children and come from non-official sources. However, a spokeswoman has denied that Mr Abbott needed to disclose his daughter's scholarship as it did not constitute a gift. 'Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' she said in a statement. Angry: A student protester is moved on from Spring Street, near the Victorian parliament house . Surrounded: Young protesters blocked trams from operating in Melbourne . Face off: students were met by a line of police officers and mounted police as the mood of the rallies intensified . 'If alternative advice is provided, Mr Abbott will meet the amended requirements.' Guidelines currently say gifts from family members or personal friends 'need not be registered unless the member judges that an appearance of conflict of interest may be seen to exist'. Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said. When Mr Abbott was in opposition he received clothing from him as a gift in February 2012 and April 2013. Family: Tony Abbott, seen here in Sydney with his wife Margie Abbott, and daughters Louise, Bridget and Frances in 2013, has denied any wrong doing . 'While the exact cost of the gifts were not known, it was clear they were higher than the $300 threshold and were appropriately disclosed, with Mr Abbott providing all the information required by an opposition member,' Mr Abbott's spokeswoman said. Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 and is currently working for Whitehouse as a teacher's aide in Melbourne. She aims to continue her studies with a Masters degree course later this year and is now a regular front-row fixture at Australian fashion shows. Details of Frances' scholarship emerged as students campaigned against the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education in cities around the country. In a major shake-up, universities, TAFEs and colleges will be able to chose the tuition fees they want to charge for their courses from 2016. This is estimated to save the government $1.1 billion over the next three years. The institute that Frances attended is likely to benefit from the federal government's changes to subsidies, which previously did not cover private colleges. Mr Abbott attended last year's graduation ceremony at the institute in support of his daughter and gave a speech praising its work. On Wednesday masses of students turned out for a national day of protest, organised by The National Union of Students. Trouble: On Monday, former Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella (left) had to be escorted by police out of a lecture at Melbourne University after it was disrupted by protesters. On Friday, at Sydney University, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (right) was mobbed by students who were angry about planned changes . Melbourne saw the most tense conflict, however demonstrations in Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane also caused chaos. In Sydney, a man in his 20s was arrested for picking up an already-lit flare and 'bundled to the ground by about six police officers,' AAP reported. Hundreds of police officers wearing fluoro vests packed the streets around Melbourne's parliament house as young people marched. In Queensland, similar scenes led to the shutting down of chunks of the Brisbane CBD. In Canberra, furious young men and women banged on the windows of government buildings. The Prime minister was forced to cancel a scheduled visit to Deakin University in Melbourne due to the demonstrations on Wednesday. National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor told the ABC the cancellation of his visit was a missed opportunity for protesters to have their voices heard. 'If [Coalition frontbenchers] are there to sell a budget that will savage higher education, we're not going to cop it on the chin easily,' she said.

"Former Colombia striker Faustino Asprilla has revealed he will leave his home city of Tulua after being threatened by a gang of criminals seeking extortion money. Asprilla, who played for Parma and Newcastle United in the 1990s, said on Tuesday that masked, armed men entered his homestead on the outskirts of Tulua in southwest Colombia where he has been living with his family. 'They were four (men) in two cars... they threatened me, they told me to contact their chief because if I didn't they would kill my family and me,' Asprilla was quoted by the daily El Tiempo as saying.

Asprilla's case, one of many similar incidents in southwest Colombia, has been taken up by national police chief Rodolfo Palomino, who guaranteed him and his family protection while they sought to identify and capture the culprits, police sources said.

"This is the birth certificate that reveals Hugh Grant has had a third love child, this time a son with a Swedish TV producer. The 53-year-old actor's son was born in September 2012 to Anna Elisabet Eberstein, three months before Grant's lover, Tinglan Hong, gave birth to her second child by him, a son named Felix. Grant's paternity was only publicly revealed when Miss Eberstein's baby's birth was re-registered, giving the father's name as Hugh John Mungo Grant, last month. Apparently the original birth certificate had a blank where the father's name should go. The birth certificate for the son Hugh Grant has had with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein . Hugh Grant, 53, is said to have had a son with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein 16 months ago . The son is the first child to be registered with Grant's surname. His other two children were registered with their mother's surname. Ms Eberstein, who is said to have met Grant at a London party where she pitched an idea to him, is said to have moved into a £3million house near the actor's home shortly before she gave birth to the baby boy 16 months ago. She was 'supported by Hugh all the way', it was reported, and is still believed to be living in the townhouse with her child. Miss Eberstein is reportedly living with her son in a £3million house near Grant's home in West London . 'Anna lives in a very comfortable property in West London and knows that Hugh is there for her,' a source told the Sun. 'Anna's parents in Sweden know all about the relationship and she has their blessing.' However it is unclear whether the two women were aware they were both expecting the About A Boy star’s child around the same time. Ms Eberstein, a former promotions producer for the ESPN sports channel, and Grant had an instant attraction for each other, it was reported today, and the pair went on several dates. She is a keen tennis player and plays for the smart west London Queen's Club women's first team. Her mother, Susanna Eberstein, is a well-known feminist campaigner in Sweden who campaigned to have a picture of a topless woman taken down from the country's parliament building. Miss Hong, . who was already the mother of Hugh’s daughter Tabitha, gave birth to Felix on . December 29 2012 and registered the new arrival on Valentine’s Day 2013. According to the birth certificate, Felix Chang was born at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London . At the time the actor tweeted: ‘In . answer to some journos. Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother. Adore . them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.’ Single man: Mr Grant is not believed to be dating anyone and devotes his time to the Hacked Off campaign . Miss Hong, above, and Miss Eberstein would have both been pregnant with Grant's children at the same time . He added a short while later: ‘And to be crystal clear. I am the Daddy.’ Felix’s . arrival came almost 17 months after Miss Hong gave birth to the . couple’s first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant, at London’s . Portland Hospital, in September 2011. In an interview with American chat . show host Ellen DeGeneres, Grant admitted that while coming as something . of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive ‘life-changing’ effect . on him. Other mother: Tinglan Hong is the mother of Grant's daughter Tabitha and son Felix . He said: . ‘Everyone was right all these years, saying: “Hugh, why don’t you have . some children? It changes your life.” Now that I have a child, it is . life-changing. I recommend it. Get some. ‘I . can’t pretend it wasn’t a little bit of a surprise. But it’s a very . nice surprise. In fact, the baby’s name in Chinese, because the mother . is Chinese, means ‘happy surprise’. Miss Hong, who was born in Zhejiang . province in eastern China and moved to Britain in 2003, is understood to . have met Grant in a Chelsea wine bar in 2008. The pair struck up an unlikely friendship before embarking on a relationship in January 2011. Tabitha’s . arrival was kept secret for two months until the actor’s spokesman . released a statement confirming the birth, but adding that Grant – who . rose to fame in Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994 – was no longer in a . relationship with Miss Hong. It read: ‘I can confirm that Hugh . Grant is the delighted father of a baby girl. He and the mother had a . fleeting affair and while this was not planned, Hugh could not be . happier or more supportive.’ Grant dated Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and remains close . to the model  - he is the godfather to . her son Damien. Following their amicable split he then started dating Jemima Khan for . three years. He is currently believed to . be single. A spokesperson for Hugh Grant has been contacted for comment. Hugh Grant previously dated divorced heiress Jemima Khan for three years,  from 2004 to 2007 . Long term love: Hugh was with model/ actress Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and they remain close . Hugh Grant now has three children by two different women. Daughter Tabitha, 2, was born in 2011 after Grant started a relationship with Tinglan Hong. He has since had two sons born within a few months of each other. His first son, now aged 16 months, was born to Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Ebersetein on September 3, 2012. Mother and son currently live in West London, near to Grant's home. At the same time Ms Ebersetin was pregnant with her son, Grant got Miss Hong pregnant again.

The German, who left Red Bull at the end of the season after losing his title to Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton, spent three days at the Italian team's factory meeting key people and driving a 2012 car.

"Atletico Madrid swept into the last 16 of the Champions League with a game to spare after Mario Mandzukic netted a hat-trick in a crushing 4-0 win at home to Olympiacos on Wednesday. Last season's beaten finalists secured a fourth straight victory since falling 3-2 to the Greek side in their opening game in September and have 12 points from five matches, three ahead of second-placed Juventus, who won 2-0 at Malmo. Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic (centre) heads in a goal against Olympiacos . After a typically intense start from the Spanish champions, Raul Garcia struck in the ninth minute following a howler from Olympiacos goalkeeper Roberto and another defensive error, this time from Roberto's Spanish compatriot Alberto Botia, let in Mandzukic to tap home seven minutes before the break. The Croatia forward made it 3-0 in the 62nd minute when he nodded in an Arda Turan cross and he completed his treble with another header from Gabi's free kick three minutes later as Atletico progressed from the group stage of Europe's elite competition in two consecutive seasons for the first time. Atletico's Mario Mandzukic embraces coach Diego Simeone after scoring third goal . 'The most important thing is that we keep on winning and keep on playing well,' Garcia said. 'It is always more difficult at the start of the season but we have kept working hard and we are getting better and better with every game,' added the Spain midfielder. Forward Mandzukic celebrates after scoring for Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night . Atletico roared out of the blocks at the Calderon and Garcia and Mandzukic both went close before the opener, which came after Roberto, a former Atletico youth player, passed the ball straight to Juanfran on the right of the penalty area. The Spain fullback sent a low cross back into the danger area and Garcia was on hand at the near post to clip a shot high into the net. Mandzukic beats Olympiacos keeper Roberto Jimenez to score the second goal . Atletico doubled their lead in the 38th minute when Botia fluffed an attempted clearance and the ball ran through to an unmarked Mandzukic. Olympiacos, coached by former Spain midfielder Michel, created a rare chance in the 61st minute when Kostas Mitroglou headed over but Mandzukic made the game safe with the first Champions League hat-trick for an Atletico player. If Atletico win or draw at Juventus in their final game on December 9 they will be assured of top spot and avoid fellow group winners in the draw for the knockout stages.","Raul Garcia opened the scoring before Mario Mandzukic scored hat-trick .

"Chase Elliott became the youngest champion in NASCAR history on Saturday when he wrapped up the Nationwide Series title at Phoenix International Raceway. The 18-year-old rookie is the youngest driver to win a title in any of NASCAR's three national series. He broke the mark set by Brian Vickers, who was 20 when he won the Nationwide title in 2003. Elliott, the son of Hall of Fame inductee and 1988 NASCAR champion Bill Elliott, clinched the title with his fifth-place finish at Phoenix. It moved him 52 points ahead of teammate Regan Smith with only next week's season-ending race remaining. Young winner: Chase Elliott, driver of the #9 NAPA Auto Parts Chevrolet, celebrates after winning the NASCAR Nationwide Series Championship following his fifth place finish . Celebration: Chase Elliott, 18, celebrates  after winning the NASCAR Nationwide Series Championship making him the youngest ever winner . A high school graduate in May — his mother made him juggle school with his budding racing career — Elliott wasn't even sure he'd be racing this time last year. He had no prospects for a full-time ride in any of NASCAR's top series, and his deal to drive a Nationwide car for JR Motorsports didn't come together until January, . 'This race a year ago, we had no plans of racing Nationwide this season and was uncertain what our future was going to be,"" Elliott said. 'It truly has been a dream come true for me to even be competing this season.' Elliott's official celebration will have to wait until next week's season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but he was greeted near the finish line by his parents and the family proudly posed for photos. 'They said just enjoy it,' Elliott said of his parents. 'This certainly has not set in for me, by any means. I am going to enjoy every bit of it until the green flag at Daytona (in February). This is a dream come true for me.' The Elliotts become the fifth father/son duo to win NASCAR national series championships. The others are Lee Petty and Richard Petty, Ned Jarrett and Dale Jarrett, David Pearson and Larry Pearson, and Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Happy family: Chase Elliott, 18, celebrates his NASCAR Nationwide Series Championship with his mother Cindy Elliott, after finishing fifth at the NASCAR Nationwide Series auto race at Phoenix International Raceway . Giving thanks: Nationwide points leader Chase Elliott waves to fans during driver introductions before the NASCAR Nationwide Series auto race at Phoenix International Raceway . But this title also made Dale Earnhardt Jr. a champion car owner — something his late father accomplished when Earnhardt Jr. won Nationwide titles in 1998 and 1999 driving for his dad. The championship for JR Motorsports was the first for the organization, which is owned by Earnhardt Jr., his sister, Kelley, and Rick Hendrick. It comes in a season of turnaround for JRM, which has entered full-time entries in the Nationwide Series since 2006 but won just 12 races in its first eight seasons. JRM has nine victories this year, three by Elliott. Brad Keselowski won the race with a pass of Kyle Busch following a restart on the two-lap overtime sprint to the finish. Busch led 187 of the 206 laps but was denied the victory because Keselowski was given the final chance to catch him after a caution with one lap remaining in regulation. 'It was kind of a shame, he had the race won but the yellow came out,' said Keselowski. 'I could understand if he was upset about that.' Busch questioned the need for the caution — it was because Alex Bowman ran out of gas on the track — and wondered if it was thrown to prevent him from winning his eighth win of the season. 'It's pretty pathetic NASCAR throws these Kyle Busch cautions, it's really getting old and aggravating for us in this Nationwide Series,' Busch said. 'It's their prerogative, it's their series and they get to do what they want to and I just have to settle for second and miss our opportunity on another owner's championship this year.' Elliott Sadler was third, followed by Ty Dillon, Elliott and Erik Jones. It was Keselowski's 32nd career Nationwide victory and fifth of the season. The Team Penske entry driven by Keselowski goes into the finale with a 29-point lead over Joe Gibbs Racing in the race for the owners' championship.

"Prince Harry returned to Afghanistan today on behalf of the Queen as he led emotional tributes to his friends who died in the name of war. It was a highly meaningful return for the Prince, who was posted to the country on a tour of duty in 2007-08 and again in 2012-13. The 30-year-old left a personal wreath at Kandahar Airfield which read: 'There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. They will never be forgotten. Harry.' Scroll down for video . 'They will never be forgotten': Prince Harry lays a wreath at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan today, where he led a service for the Queen . Emotive: The highly personal message on the Prince's wreath, which was left as part of the service. He served alongside other soldiers during his secret first deployment to Afghanistan in 2007-08, then again when he returned to the country in 2012-13 . Tribute: The 30-year-old also read from John 15 in the Bible, the passage from which he took the quote on his poppy wreath . Salute: Today's visit came just weeks after it was revealed British combat operations had come to an end after 13 years of conflict . The quote came from John 15:13, a Bible passage which Harry read as part of a Remembrance Sunday service at the dwindling base where he also met colleagues from his former unit. The full quote comes as Jesus addresses his disciples, and reads: 'My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. 'You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.' It was believed to be the Prince's first return to Afghanistan since his operational role came to an end in January 2013. The Ministry of Defence confirmed Harry's role this afternoon - only after he had safely left Kandahar - after he was notably absent from the Remembrance Sunday commemorations in Whitehall which included his brother. There are just a few hundred remaining troops in Afghanistan, where their combat role officially came to an end on October 26. Harry served in Afghanistan twice, but his maiden deployment had to be cut short after a foreign publication broke a strict media blackout on details of his whereabouts. The Prince lined up with fellow servicemen to hear The Last Post and Reveille played by musicians from the Royal Artillery Band. Sparse: There are just a few hundred remaining troops in Afghanistan, where their combat role officially came to an end on October 26 . Combat: The first return since January 2013 was an opportunity for the Prince to be reunited with some of his old colleagues . Flying visit: Pilots showed the Prince inside the cockpit of an RAF Tornado on his brief trip to Kandahar Airfield this morning . For security reasons the visit remained under a media blackout until the Prince left, much like his first deployment in 2007-08 . After the service he met personnel from Joint Force Support (Afghanistan) and 904 Expeditionary Air Wing, including members of 31 Squadron RAF serving their final tour of Afghanistan. He climbed into the cockpit of a Tornado GR4 and learned how the jet has served in recent operations, a Ministry of Defence Spokesman said. The Prince, whose second deployment was as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner, was the first royal to see active combat since his uncle the Duke of York fought in the Falklands. Since his two tours of duty the Prince, a captain with the Blues and Royals since 2011, has quit the Army Air Corps for a desk job organising events including the Invictus games for wounded servicemen. A royal spokesman said: 'Prince Harry was honoured to be able to attend the last remembrance service in southern Afghanistan, especially given his personal experience of operational service. 'He felt it important to mark this significant milestone, remembering all those who have lost their lives during the campaign.' There was a sombre atmosphere today as the remaining troops in Afghanistan remembered the 13-year fight which has claimed more than 450 British lives. International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) personnel and civilians gathered for remembrance services in Kabul and Kandahar - likely to be the last involving British military based in Afghanistan. The ceremony in Camp Souter Kabul today was led by the Reverend Dr Jim Francis CF and attended by personnel from all three services, along with senior representatives from the international coalition. Camp Bastion in Helmand is due to close in a few weeks and the final British troops are due to be pulled out of Afghanistan by the end of the year. Top gun: The Prince, a captain with the Blues and Royals since 2011, quit the Army Air Corps in January for a desk job organising events . Warm welcome: The Prince arrived basked in golden morning sunshine as he arrived in secret in the mountainous terrain of Kandahar . The Prince arrived on an RAF C-17 transporter plane as part of the commemorations in Afghanistan, where 453 Brits have died . One among many: Harry joined other soldiers in falling silent today to pay tribute to all those who have died in armed conflict . Light relief: Despite the briefness of the visit there was still time to share a joke with other soldiers at the base in southern Afghanistan . Laughs: The Prince met soldiers before being flown back out of the base in secret. His role was only revealed once he had left . Commander Joint Force Support (Afghanistan), Brigadier Darrell Amison, said: 'We will forever be in debt to all those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We will never forget their extraordinary courage and dedication, and our thoughts will always remain with the families and friends of those we have lost. 'The final Remembrance Sunday ceremony in southern Afghanistan has significant poignancy as we pay tribute to the 453 men and women who have given their lives since 2001, along with the many hundreds who have suffered life changing injuries. 'We are incredibly proud of what they have achieved. Thanks to their sacrifice, Afghanistan is a better country and we walk in safer streets at home in the UK.' Since last year's Remembrance Sunday, seven members of the British armed forces have died on operations. LCpl Oliver Thomas, Cpl James Walters, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, Flt Lt Rakesh Chauhan, Capt Thomas Clarke, Sapper Adam Moralee and Capt Richard Holloway all died in Afghanistan - five of them in a single helicopter crash in April. The youngest, 32 Engineers Regiment Sapper Moralee, from Newcastle, was just 23. Speaking after today's service in Kabul, Brigadier James Stopford said: 'Our annual remembrance commemorations are always moments of deep reflection as we honour those who have fallen in conflict across the ages. 'This year is particularly poignant as we mark the centenary of the Great War. 'For those of us serving here in Afghanistan on operations, we remember with enormous pride the terrible sacrifice by our UK Armed Forces colleagues and those of our coalition partners, and in particular the very brave members of the Afghan security forces. 'Our shared sacrifice has made a significant difference to this country and ours and continues to do so - we will remember them.' Solemn: Troops at Kandahar Air Base today. The 13-year conflict claimed 453 British lives and those of many thousands more civilians . Those who remain: The few British troops left in Afghanistan are there to offer support to Afghan forces in their effort to keep the peace .

"About 90 per cent of snails eaten in France come from Eastern Europe according to French producers who are demanding a limit on exports. A campaign has begun to specify the origin of snails on boxes so people know exactly whey they are from.

The Roman snail (pictured) is used by top chefs in their dishes but the French are calling for boxes of the delicacy to say exactly where they are from . But according to expert Jacky Pommier, who organises an annual snail-eating festival in August, it is quite clear that snails from France are better. Burgundy snails, or Helix pomatia, are now protected by a ban which prevents them from being harvested during the reproductive season which falls between April 1 and June 30.

"Home from home: Roman Abramovich  is pictured at Chukotka. He quit his political role there after 14 years in office today . Billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abromovich has quit his role as head of parliament in an autonomous state in far eastern Russia. The tycoon, who had been in office in the Chukotka region for 14 years, is reported to have spent as much as $2.5billion (£1.6billion) in improving the area since 1999. He is said to have quit his role as speaker in parliament there to comply with a new law introduced by President Vladimir Putin last month preventing state officials from keeping bank accounts and shares abroad. Key investments of Abramovich include London-listed Evraz and Highland Gold in his $10.2 billion (£6.7billion) fortune which are registered abroad. Abramovich had headed the region's parliament since 2008 and served as a governor there for eight years. He is said to have bought modern amenities to Chukutka - an icy wasteland region - and contributed significantly to the construction of schools and hospitals in the area. A statement released by the regional government in Chukutka said today:  'Roman Abramovich will continue to take part in the like of the Chukotka Autonomous Region. 'In part, the implementation continues of a number of major regional business projects that will significant increase the tax base of the region in the future'. Abramovich's oil company Sibneft was registered in the region before it was bought out by Gazprom, which moved its headquarters to St. Petersburg in 2005. He got involved in Chukotka when the most powerful men in Russia were encouraged to take part in development projects in the most neglected parts of the country. Generous: Mr Abramovich leaves a helicopter at Chukotka peninsula in the Russian Far East, near the village of Lorino in 2002. He has pumped some $2.5billion dollars into the area since 1999 . The region is home to about 50,000 people and is some 3,850 miles away from Moscow. The area sits directly opposite Alaska across he Bering Strait. Mr Abramovich was named Russia's most generous philanthropist in April. He has donated in excess of $300million (£197million) to good causes in the past three years. The announcement comes as Mr Abramovich celebrates ten years in charge at Chelsea.

"Health officials are urging people suffering winter vomiting bug to stay at home rather than visiting A&E or their GP . Patients with the winter vomiting bug are being urged to stay at home as it already rife in some hospitals. Figures show there were 18 outbreaks in hospitals last month with nearly 200 patients and staff struck down. Although this is no higher compared to previous years, officials warn that it is highly contagious and unpredictable . Public Health England – the agency responsible for preventing illness – is urging patients with symptoms not to visit their GP or A&E. The virus causes sudden vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and a temperature that normally go away by themselves between 24 and 48 hours. Yet it can be very serious for the elderly who are already very ill in hospital and lead to severe dehydration and death. John Harris, an expert in norovirus at Public Health England said: ‘October usually marks the start of the norovirus season and the bulk of cases will occur between now and April next year. ‘No two norovirus seasons are the same and there is no way of predicting how busy a season will be. What we do know is that many people will be affected across the country and they will probably feel very unwell for a couple of days but will get better. ‘For patients already ill in hospital, this virus could cause further health complications, making it vital to prevent introducing the virus into the hospital environment. ‘We strongly urge anyone affected to stay at home and to telephone NHS111 for advice.’ Figures for last month show there were 18 outbreaks at hospital – most of which led towards being closed – with 130 patients and 57 staff affected. This is slightly lower compared to last year and significantly down on 2012 when a new strain of the virus caused far higher rates than normal. There is no treatment and patients are advised to drink plenty of water and rehydration drinks such as Dioralyte sachets. Although it is far commoner in the colder months, the virus is prevalent all year round and is often caught by eating oysters, where it lives. But each winter it puts the NHS under huge strain because hospitals have to close off wards to prevent the spread which limits the numbers of patients that can be admitted. Staff must then have to find space elsewhere in the hospital for all those patients while the ward is thoroughly cleaned. The winter vomiting bug - also known as norovirus - is highly contagious and can be very serious for the elderly who are already very ill in hospital and lead to severe dehydration and death .","Public Health England says patients should call the NHS 111 line instead .

"Troubled supermarket giant Tesco was facing fresh questions last night after it emerged it had purchased a new corporate jet worth £31million. The Gulfstream 550 aircraft arrived just days after it was revealed profits at the struggling supermarket had been overstated by £250million. The jet - which was ordered in early 2013, ironically, just as the group was scaling back its international operations - will raise further questions over the tenure of former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was ousted in July. Scroll down for video . The Gulfstream 550 aircraft (like the one pictured) arrived just days after it was revealed profits at the struggling supermarket had been overstated by £250million . Tesco sparked a storm of shareholder fury in 2012 when it emerged they had spent nearly £29million on private plane journeys since 2005 despite falling sales and the rising cost of the jets. The supermarket giant had pledged to put all its executive jets up for sale in a bid to rebuild investor confidence. A source close to the company told the Financial Times: ‘If you want an indication of what has gone wrong at Tesco [it was that] we ordered another Gulfstream.’ The purchase of the jet will raise further questions over the tenure of former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was ousted in July . The news comes as the group attempts to recover from a spate of bad news, including three profit warnings in three months and the revelation that the Financial Conduct Authority was investigating its accounting practices. Tesco’s new chief executive Dave Lewis was brought in on September 1 from Unilever to replace Mr Clarke after the second profit warning a month ago. People inside the company said one of his first decisions was to sell the aircraft, though the group has not yet announced this publicly. The retailer was this week registered as the new owner of a Gulfstream 550 on the website of the Civil Aviation Authority, according to the Financial Times. The 29-metre-long G550, which can seat up to 18 passengers, has a range of up to 12,500km and can fly non-stop for up to 12 hours. To charter a G550 for a 12-hour flight would cost nearly £67,000 – more than twice the average UK salary of £26,000. Since the financial crisis, companies have been unwilling to be seen flying corporate jets, for fear of being attacked by investors and the public for extravagance. One senior executive in the private aviation industry told the Financial Times: ‘There has been a fundamental change – corporates don’t want to be seen owning aircraft in Europe.’ Tesco shares have sunk to an 11-year low since the latest profit warning last week. The jet may prove to be the most short-lived purchase for the group.

"Half of children are not ready for school at the age of five, a report has found. Only 52 per cent of children in England have reached a ‘good’ level of development when they move from reception to their first year of school, the data shows. University College London researchers said the figure fell to as low as 28 per cent in some parts of the country. The study by University College London found that barely a quarter of five-year-olds in Leicester showed a level of development that meant they were ready to start school, while in Greenwich almost three-quarters were ready by the end of reception. Professor Sir Michael Marmot said Britain was falling behind in terms of child development, compared to almost every other western country. He said: ‘How can this still be happening? For three years the Institute of Health Equity has published evidence showing we are failing our children. ‘It is unacceptable that only half of our five-year-olds are achieving a good level of development.’ Sir Michael said England was ‘bumping along the bottom’ in the rankings. The figures have dropped by 7 percentage points from 2011, when 59 per cent of children had a good level of development by the age five. In the best performing area, Greenwich in south-east London, 69 per cent of five-year-olds had reached their expected level of development. But in Leicester, only 27.7 per cent attained this. The richer children were, the more ready they were to start school. The study found that children from the wealthiest families (on the right of the graphic) were more than five percentage points more likely to show a good level of development at the end of reception than children from the poorest families (on the left). Sir Michael said: ‘We are doing really badly. One strategy for reducing these avoidable inequalities in early childhood development is to reduce deprivation and improve living standards for families with children.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘No child should start school behind their peers. This is why our plan for education is providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare. ‘We are raising the status and quality of the early years workforce by introducing rigorous new qualifications so practitioners are highly skilled and can help all children reach the expected level of development.’","Only 52 per cent of children have 'good' development level at the age of five .

"An MP has blasted Hartlepool United's manager after he revealed his desire to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. The club's manager Ronnie Moore this afternoon revealed his hopes of signing Evans, who was released from jail in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape but has refused to apologise to his victim or accept his guilt. Hartlepool MP Iain Wright said he was outraged at the prospect of Evans joining the club, calling the disgraced footballer a 'pariah'. Scroll down for video . MP Iain Wright (left) has blasted Hartlepool United's manager after he revealed his desire to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans (right) The Welsh forward had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United retracted last month after a public outcry over the decision. Despite the controversy, Hartlepool manager Ronnie Moore, who took over as boss of the club this week, said he was looking into signing the 25-year old. A furious Mr Wright said: 'I really hope we don't. I love my club, I love Hartlepool United. There's a reason why no other team in the Football League wants to sign him - he is a pariah. 'I was at the match today. There were lots of young lads there supporting Hartlepool United. I just think it sends out such a wrong message to young men in terms of it being OK for a rapist to play football. It's entirely wrong.' Moore revealed his desire to sign Evans after this afternoon's 1-1 home draw with Oxford United. He said: 'It's a possibility. It could happen, I would want it to happen. He is a proven scorer; he's served his time and the boy wants to play football. Ronnie Moore, who took over as boss of Hartlepool this week, said he was looking into signing the 25-year old . Evans was released from jail in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape, but has refused to apologise to his victim or accept his guilt . 'If there is a chance he might come here, I don't see any reason why he shouldn't. 'He has made a mistake and maybe he hasn't apologised in the right way - and I know he has an appeal case pending - but if he gets on the park, he would go a long way to getting us out of trouble.' Campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition called on Moore to carefully consider any possible move for Evans. Sarah Green, spokeswoman for the group, said: 'Ched Evans is an unrepentant convicted rapist. 'Any club who sign him need to think hard about the message they are sending to their fans, to the local community and to all football supporters in allowing him to rejoin the beautiful game.' Last month, television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team. Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk. Sheffield United retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction. Hartlepool fans on the Poolie Bunker forum were split about the potential signing, with some suggesting the striker could help them escape relegation from the Football League, while others feared a backlash. While some supporters of the Football League's bottom club took the view that a proven international goal scorer could fire them to safety, others feared a backlash. PoolieinNottingham wrote: 'I really hope this is just a rumour. Thanks to Jeff Stelling (the Sky Sports presenter and Hartlepool fan) loads of people have a soft spot for Pools, whereas if this is true we'll get no end of bad will. 'If we've got money to spend on wages now there will be other players who can do the job instead of him.' However, another fan replied: 'I would take him in a heartbeat, what's done is done, served his sentence, move on people!' Ched Evans has continued to protest his innocence with girlfriend Natasha Massey at his side . Evans made 13 appearances for Wales before his rape conviction, scoring one goal for the national side . In November, Evans was linked with a move to Tranmere Rovers after club chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old. Oldham Athletic have also debunked rumours that the club was considering signing him in recent weeks. Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire. Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later. Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge. Since his release, Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement. Meanwhile the victim has been forced to change her name and move away from her home after Evans' supporters 'outed' her online, breaching her right to anonymity as a victim of a sex crime. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended his actions and the pair are now engaged. Ms Massey has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. May 30, 2011: Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales.

"Around 15 years after it was lost from a wayward tee shot, a missing and long-forgotten golf ball has been found - inside a tree branch. These amazing pictures show how the lost ball became embedded in a tree, which simply grew around it. The 'one in a million' find was made by baffled greenkeepers at Scarborough South Cliff Golf Club, North Yorkshire, who were chopping up wood from felled trees around the course. Assistant greenkeeper Jack Sleight (pictured), 16, found the ball lodged in a branch at Scarborough South Cliff Golf Club, where it is believed to have been hidden for around 15 years . Tree wood: Club staff believe the ball got lodged by the tree branch, which then simply grew around it . Assistant greenkeeper Jack Sleight, 16, and head greenkeeper Paul Sleight, his father, discovered the long-lost Pinnacle golf ball, which staff think has been hidden there for 15 years. Manager of the golf club Shaun Smith said: 'It's amazing. We think it's been hit and lodged in the 'V' of the tree, where the branch separates from the trunk, and the branch has just grown around it. 'I've never heard of this happening before. The chance of finding it at that exact point - where our greenkeeper cut the branch - must be a million to one really so it's quite a find. 'We counted the rings on the tree to see how long it had been there and counted about 14 or 15 so it's been there a good while.' Mr Smith added that the ball was likely to have been lost after a wayward tee shot as the tree is just a few yards from the edge of the second fairway. Shaun Smith, manager of the Scarborough South Cliff Golf Club, North Yorkshire, said the ball was likely to have been lost by a wayward tee shot at the second fairway . The 'one in a million' find was made by baffled greenkeepers who were chopping up wood from felled trees around the course. Pictured: Jack (right), head greenkeeper Paul Sleight (left) and Mr Smith (centre) 'We put a post up on the club's Facebook page to see if anyone wants to claim their ball back but we've had no takers,' he joked. The club, which will host the English Amateur Championship in 2016, are looking to either use the log as a display item in the club or as a trophy, but no decision has been made yet. Under official R&A golf rules, players only have five minutes to find a lost ball before they must continue playing with a new one. If the ball had been found in the tree, it would likely have been deemed unplayable. The unfortunate player could have moved the ball back to where it was hit from or directly backwards by two club-lengths. This would have incurred a one-shot penalty.","Golf ball is found lodged in a tree around 15 years after it was lost .

"Designer sunglasses are all the rage, with celebrities such Kate Moss, Megan Fox, Cara Delevigne and Ryan Gosling often pictured hiding behind an expensive pair. But in terms of eye protection, they might not be worth the money. Discount sunglasses were just as good at blocking our harmful rays as expensive designer pairs, an investigation by U.S. eye specialists has found. Celebrities such Kate Moss (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) are often photographed sporting expensive designer shades - but now an investigation has found many offer no additional eye protection . Dr Dennis Fong, a professor at the School of Optometry at the University of California Berkeley, found discount sunglasses costing less than £10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays. Choosing the right sunglasses is important as opticians recommend wearing them whenever in strong sunshine for longer than 10 minutes. This means from mid April until the end of September - when the levels of UV rays are three times higher at midday than they are during the winter. The levels of UVB during the summer can be as much as ten times higher. It is well known that UV light can cause damage to the eyes which often accumulates over the years, leading to sight problems. The UV rays from the sun - in particular UVB, the same spectrum of ultraviolet that causes the skin to burn - are most damaging to the eyes. UVB causes cataracts to form, meaning the eye’s lens becomes cloudy in places. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness in the world. Sun damage can also cause macular degeneration of the eye, which can lead to loss of vision as well as growths on the cornea, the surface of the eye, which sometimes effect vision and are usually considered ugly. When choosing sunglasses look for one of the following: . Source: NHS Sun Awareness . Other long-term damage includes pinguecula, harmless but unsightly yellow fatty deposits in the white of the eye thought to be caused by UV damage to the collagen in the conjunctiva (the clear coating on the white of the eye). Photo keratitis - also known as snow blindness - can occur - when intense sun kills off the outer layers of the cornea (the clear part of the eye at the front of the eyeball). There is also the risk of skin cancer of the eyelid. As part of the new investigation into cheap versus expensive sunglasses, Dr Fong bought sunglasses from designer labels Coach, Ray-Ban and Smith. All the designer sunglasses cost over $100 each (almost £62). He also bought 11 cheaper pairs from shopping centre kiosks, pharmacies, fashion stores and street vendors which all cost about $10 each (£6.20). A spectrophotometer- a specialist machine which can measure light- was used to measure the UV light passing through the lenses. He found that the cheap sunglasses performed just as well as the expensive ones, with all pairs living up to their promise of blocking 100 per cent of UVA and UVB rays. While there was no difference in terms of the protection against harmful rays, Dr Fong said pricier glasses often do have more durable frames, higher-end design and a more comfortable fit. The investigation was shown on Good Morning America by ABC News. In previous investigations, opticians have warned that dark coloured lenses don't necessarily provide better protection than lighter coloured lenses. The UV filtering, the coating added to lenses so that they block out harmful rays, comes from a film incorporated into the lens not through the actual colour of the lenses. An eye specialist from the University of California, in Berkeley, U.S., found that discount sunglasses costing less than £10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays as designer pairs costing more than £50 .","Discount sunglasses costing less than £10 were equally good at blocking out harmful UVA and UVB rays as designer pairs costing more than £50 .

"Defiant: Shaun Wright, pictured with Ed Miliband in 2012, was working 'as normal' on Thursday despite increasing public pressure to resign . David Cameron added his weight to the growing demands for Rotherham’s crime tsar to quit his £85,000-a-year role in the wake of the child exploitation scandal. In an unequivocal statement, the Prime Minister said that Shaun Wright should ‘resign and take full responsibility for what happened’. But Mr Wright, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, was still clinging to his job last night. He continued to work ‘as normal’ even while protesters gathered outside his office and his deputy quit, calling for him to do the same. Tracey Cheetham had been under little public pressure to go. However, the mother-of-three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over Mr Wright’s defiant stand. She said: ‘It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign. 'This has become even more apparent given the overwhelming opinion of the public – as they are the people to whom the commissioner is ultimately accountable. ‘I am incredibly sad that this issue has become centred on one person and we seem to have lost focus on the most important factor in all this – the 1,400 victims who were failed.’ Mrs Cheetham, who earned £45,000 as Mr Wright’s number two, criticised the ‘political point-scoring’ and instead called for more to be done to bring the criminals to justice. One Rotherham victim, who was abused at 14 by an older man, told the Mail that Mr Wright ‘should be ashamed of himself’. Jessica, now 29, said: ‘The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward. ‘He needs to accept his part in it and quit.’ Mr Wright, who was a member of the Labour party until he quit on Wednesday and has met Ed Miliband, cannot be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012. Police commissioners can only be removed from office at the polling booths or if they have committed a serious crime. Local crime boards are able to suspend PCCs if they are charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of more than two years. They can then be sacked if they  are convicted. Labour backbencher John Mann, who has called for an outside police force to investigate the Rotherham scandal, said such arrangements  were ‘absurd’.‘The police commissioner roles are ridiculous,’ he said. ‘They should be scrapped.’ Resignation: Tracey Cheetham, deputy police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire (right), resigned from her post on Thursday. Mr Cameron said that Mr Wright should 'resign and take full responsibility' Mr Mann wrote a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May calling for Mr Wright to be investigated for ‘wilful neglect of duty’. In his letter, he wrote: ‘The report by Alexis Jay OBE states in great detail that during his time as the portfolio holder responsible for children’s services Shaun Wright received three  separate reports concerning child abuse and failed to act on them. It is clear that as a democratically elected councillor with the specific responsibility for children’s services Shaun Wright failed to act despite three separate warnings. ‘Not only did Shaun Wright fail to act, he failed to inform other  members of his own party of the serious problems of young girls being abused, raped and beaten on a systematic basis.’ Mr Mann’s letter added: ‘It is my view that the facts provided in the Alexis Jay report provide evidence of the potential for wilful neglect of duty by public officials, including the current South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. ‘I look forward to an appropriate police investigation to determine whether such an offence has been committed and if so by whom.’ There was no sign of Mr Wright either at his home or at his office in Barnsley yesterday. His spokesman said he was working.","Prime Minister said Shaun Wright should 'resign and take full responsibility'

"Helen Hancock felt the sort of guilt familiar to most working mothers when she left her daughter at a playscheme for much of last year’s school summer holidays. But it was only when she took Rhiannah, ten, for a sight test in September that she realised how right she had been to worry. For after spending several hours a day on computer games, Rhiannah’s vision had deteriorated rapidly over the summer months. ‘I asked her optician if he thought it was because Rhiannah had spent so much time on computers while I was working and he said that the increase in her prescription had been so rapid that he couldn’t imagine what else could have caused it,’ recalls Helen. ‘He recommended limiting her access to screens to slow the decline. ‘There were plenty of other things Rhiannah could have done at the playscheme but, given the choice, like a lot of children, she would always opt for computer games.’ The draw of the computer screen is familiar to parents everywhere, but few of us are aware of the physical toll they are taking on our children’s eyes. ‘I felt terribly guilty thinking that I could have prevented the deterioration in Rhiannah’s sight,’ says Helen. ‘While she has worn glasses since she was eight, she now has a prescription of -4.75, more than two whole points worse than it was before last summer. She really struggles to see without her glasses.’ Gaming fan: Teo Poulter, five, was prescribed glasses aged just three . And little Rhiannah’s not alone. Opticians in Britain are reporting an increase in the number of young children they see who are myopic — or short-sighted — and are putting it down to the amount of time youngsters now spend staring at iPads, laptops and smartphones, instead of playing outdoors as previous generations did. While the majority of diagnoses of myopia in children used to happen around puberty, increasing numbers are needing glasses younger and younger. And it’s children from comfortable backgrounds who are driving this increase. Why? In part, because they are wealthy enough to have access to all those seductive screens and gadgets, says Joanne Hancox, a consultant in paediatrics at London’s Moorfields Eye Hospital. ‘We are seeing a general trend towards myopia,’ she says. ‘And studies suggest that children from better socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to be affected. ‘It’s also much more common in cities. One of the theories is that children who play outside are less likely to have myopia. Outside you have more cause to look into the distance than inside, where you’re more likely to be doing close-up activities involving reading, writing and screens.’ Laser eye surgeon David Allamby of Focus Clinics has called the condition ‘screen-sightedness’. ‘When myopia or short-sightedness occurs, the eyeball grows from front to back, and becomes egg-shaped instead of round,’ says Mr Allamby. ‘We think this is down in part to genetics, but also because of environmental factors. ‘In other words, if someone with the genes for myopia was spending lots of time outdoors and not looking at a screen, they might never develop myopia at all.’ Experts say children may be particularly vulnerable to this because their eyes are still developing. Screen addict: Teo spends up to four hours a day playing on his Nintendo Wii, as well as smartphone games . ‘There are a number of factors involved in the increase of myopia, but I have no doubt that the early use of handheld computers play a big role,’ says Dr Maria Liu, head of the new Myopia Control Clinic at the School of Optometry, Berkeley. She explains that if the eyes do a lot of close-up work while they are still developing, they will interpret nearsightedness as ‘the normal state’ and be less efficient at looking at long distances. Back in Cambridgeshire, Rhiannah’s mum Helen, 47, doesn’t allow her daughter to play on the streets outside their home unsupervised. ‘I always played out growing up, but it just doesn’t feel safe to allow my daughter to do that. But I’ve now set our desktop computer so that the internet cuts out after half an hour. It’s not a foolproof system as she can log back in if I’m not around to stop her, and it’s very easy as a busy, working parent to lose track of time. ‘As well as the computer, she loves playing games on her Nintendo DS and my Samsung Galaxy phone and can easily notch up three or four hours a day glued to a screen, more at weekends. I think these games provide the kind of stimulation that Rhiannah’s brain needs. She is a very intelligent child, with a reading age of 15 or 16, who also gets through a book every couple of days.’ Miss Hancox advises parents to encourage their children to do activities involving looking into the distance, such as ball games, running and other sports. And she has a warning for those parents whose children have already been diagnosed with short-sightedness: it is likely to keep getting worse. She explains: ‘If you’re short-sighted, it means your eyeball is bigger than average and, if this happens when you’re very young, as you keep growing your eyeball keeps growing so you’re likely to end up significantly short-sighted.’ This is a big concern for Suzanne Poulter, 39, and husband Paolo Barone, 41, whose son, Teo, has been playing games on his siblings’ phones since he was just two years old. Teo was diagnosed as short-sighted at the age of three. Aged five, he already measures -4.75 in his right eye and -5.25 in his left. He spends up to four hours a day playing on his Nintendo Wii, as well as games on his older sister’s smartphone. He has six older siblings, three from each of his parents’ previous marriages, who are aged 11 to 18, and Paolo says that gaming has helped bridge the age gap between them. Young gamer: Teo has been playing games on his siblings' phones since he was two . ‘As a parent, it’s the easiest thing in the world to leave children playing games while you get on with other things,’ says Paolo, a security officer from High Wycombe, Bucks. ‘But neither my wife and I, nor any of our older children, wears glasses, and if someone could tell me categorically that Teo is short-sighted because he was introduced to screens at the age of two and spends too much time on them, I would feel very guilty. ‘I don’t want to believe it, but perhaps I’m just shielding myself from the unpalatable truth. ‘I think it’s important that he learns to manipulate a mouse and operate a computer. If I’m honest, I think short-sightedness is a price worth paying for that,’ says Paolo. A fifth of children under the age of 13 have never had a sight test, although they are free on the NHS, so the problem could be even more widespread than opticians realise. Antonia Chitty, a trained optometrist, was upset when her son, Jay, was prescribed glasses for short-sightedness aged just six. Obsessed: Jake Chitty, eight, loves playing on his Nintendo DS, and was prescribed glasses aged six . Now aged eight, Jay is the only one of Antonia’s three children who is drawn, magnet-like, to electronic games — and the only one who needs spectacles. ‘He is obsessed with playing on the iPad, Nintendo Wii and DS,’ says Antonia. ‘And it’s very hard to get him off once he’s started. Given free rein, he would be on it for 12 hours a day.’ At home in Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, Antonia, 43, and husband David, 45, a civil servant, try to limit Jay’s screen access to a couple of hours a day at weekends and an hour during the week, but admit that it can creep up. ‘I’ve worn spectacles since the age of 11 and I do wonder, if we had banned all computing, would Jay have needed glasses later and would his short-sightedness be less severe?’ says Antonia. ‘I admit that there might be a link between Jay’s computer gaming and his early short-sightedness. One thing I’m glad of is that children can get contact lenses from 11 — as I know from experience, it can be very hard being a teenager with glasses.’ Aged ten, Rhiannah is already so self-conscious about her spectacles that she has persuaded mum, Helen, to explore the possibility of getting contact lenses. ‘She has been teased about her glasses and when she’s picking a new frame it’s always with a view to what other children might say about them,’ says Helen. ‘She once had a bright red pair, which attracted a lot of attention, and no longer wants anything so noticeable.’ However, if the growing addiction to gaming and trend towards short-sightedness continues, it will soon be the children without glasses who stand out from the crowd.","British opticians are reporting an increase in short-sighted youngsters, due to the amount of time spent staring at screens .

The South Australian company were halal-certified for two years before the aggressive social media campaign last week urging a boycott on Halal products throughout the country. The Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt Company lost a $50,000 deal with Middle Eastern airline Emirates after scrapping its halal certification on Friday due to backlash from anti-halal groups . Sales and marketing manager Nick Hutchinson said they pulled the pin due to negative publicity, but hoped the ditched deal wouldn't effect redundancies or lost hours for employees. 'The publicity we were getting was quite negative and something we probably didn't need and we decided we would pull the pin and stop supplying Emirates Airlines,' Mr Hutchinson said. 'When our small customer base in South Australia are reading this and starting to question us we thought, yeah maybe the negatives outweigh the positive.' Facebook pages like Halal Choices and Boycott Halal in Australia suggested the halal certification was a religious tax, that it was cruel to slaughter animals and that the $1,000 fee could be used to fund Islamic extremists abroad. Halal certified foods have been specially prepared or slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. 'We thought this was a great coup for the company, it would bring great publicity, great advertising and we decided to go ahead with it,' Mr Hutchinson said. 'It's been quite successful for the company, but unfortunately over the last few days, a lot of negative publicity has come in about this Halal certification and where this money, where we are paying fees is being spent.' The South Australian company started supplying Emirates with its halal-certified yoghurt two years ago . The company took to Facebook to announce the news last Friday, but has since deactivated its account . The eight-year-old company hopes to save the deal with Emirates, but maintains the prospect remains unlikely. 'Milk as a dairy product does not have to be Halal certified by law, and neither does yoghurt, which we were supplying, unless it contains gelatine,' he said. 'Now our yoghurt doesn't contain gelatine so we can definitely argue the fact that it doesn't need to be certified for Emirates [but] they play it safe. Anything that goes on their planes needs to be certified, so if they're asked, they can automatically answer 'yes'. 'What we are going to try and do is get our products tested, get some certificates that prove that our products don't contain gelatine and try to continue to supply Emirates, if they'll give us permission without the certification, but I mean that is unlikely.' The eight-year-old yoghurt company hopes to save the deal with Emirates, but maintains the prospect remains unlikely because of its strict halal certification policies . Australian pie company Vili's has also been the target of anti-halal campaigns, but said it refuses to bend to social media pressure, The Advertiser reports. 'From a purely economic viewpoint, halal certification brings a lot of money into Australia,' a Vili spokesman said. 'When you look at these sites you get the impression that a lot of the comments are written in the same voice and probably come from the same source.' He said he hoped Fleurieu Milk Company wasn't 'being influenced unnecessarily'.","Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt Company dropped its accreditation on Friday after being targeted by anti-Halal groups on social media .

"A short-sighted woman is suing high street optical chain Optical Express for £1million claiming that laser surgery ruined her dream of becoming a policewoman. Stephanie Holloway, 28,  spent £2,900 to improve her vision because her poor eyesight was preventing her from fulfilling her ambition to join the police, a court heard. But the procedure went disastrously wrong and has left her so sensitive to light she has to wear sun glasses in the shower, it was claimed. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Holloway (left) with her mother Heather Brace is suing Optical Express, as well as the surgeon who carried out the operation, Dr Joanna McGraw (right) She wears dark-tinted glasses almost all the time and her mother has to act as her guide when she goes outdoors, Central London County Court heard. She is suing DMC Optical Ltd, the company behind high street laser surgery chain, Optical Express, as well as the surgeon who carried out the operation, Dr Joanna McGraw. Her lawyers value her damages for pain, suffering and loss of earnings at £1million. Nicholas Yell, Miss Holloway's barrister, told the judge she was 21 and working as a buyer for an antiquarian books dealer when she decided to have the photo-refractive keratectomy procedure at the Southampton branch of Optical Express. Over the last few years, laser eye surgery has become a mainstream treatment for poor eyesight. A whole host of celebrities, including Cilla Black, Spice Girl Mel B, Nicole Kidman and Brad Pitt, have had the operation. Laser eye surgery works by removing tissue from the cornea to change its shape. There are different types of laser eye surgery but LASIK - which stands for Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis - is the most common. The procedure involves applying anaesthetic drops, after which a small flap is made on the surface of the cornea using a hand-held femtosecond laser device. The vast majority of operations pass off with no ill-effects. There are many advantages: there is little or no pain, recovery is quick and both eyes can be treated at once. However, the cutting of the flap requires skill and in one to four per cent of cases, this can cause problems. The flap can be damaged or even lost; stray particles can get trapped under the flap; there is a minor risk of infection; there is even a small risk of penetration of the eye by the very fine surgical blade used to cut the flap, which could potentially cause blindness. The other problem is that, apart from being a doctor, no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out laser eye surgery. He said: 'The procedure was intended to improve or correct her myopia. She wanted to join the police force.' Mr Yell said she was left with severe photophobia by the laser procedure in February 2008, which is an extreme sensitivity to bright light. It means she has to wear dark glasses the majority of the time. He added: 'She is in a considerably worse position than before treatment and  is visually disabled.' He also said she had developed clinical depression as a result. Mr Yell went on to say there was a failure by Dr McGraw to properly explain the treatment to Miss Holloway and warn her of the risks. From the witness box, Miss Holloway, of Lee-on-Solent, in Hampshire, said she had lost her job in the antique books trade and could not find alternative employment because her vision was so impaired. She said: 'I was in a good position in my life. I loved to read and I loved to look at art. I was unaware of the risks and I was never told of any of the risks.' She went to explain that, post surgery, her eyes were so bad she couldn't cook for fear of burning herself and needed help to go outside and dress herself. But, Simon Cridland, representing Optical Express, put to Miss Holloway that she was clearly warned by Dr McGraw she risked being left with 'a very bad result' because of the type of eyes she had. He also claimed that Miss Holloway was exaggerating her post-operative visual difficulties. The hearing involving laser surgery  that went wrong is being heard at Central London County Court, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice (above) 'You were able to see sufficiently well in 2011, and now, to dress yourself,' Mr Cridland said, accusing her 'putting it on' and 'grossly exaggerating' her problems. Mr Cridland told the judge that video surveillance evidence 'entirely contradicted' her claims about the extent of her visual disability. Outside court, Miss Holloway's mother, Heather Brace, said: 'The laser eye surgery business is not properly regulated and anybody can walk in off the streets like my daughter and have their life ruined. 'Of course accidents happen, but people need to know the risks.' The hearing continues.","Stephanie Holloway, 28, spent £2,900 on laser surgery to improve her vision .

"A 16-year-old girl was almost blinded after suffering an extreme allergic reaction to a beauty treatment that she let her friend perform as a 'favour'. Katie Thompson was left with raw, blistered skin after her friend, who was studying beauty therapy, performed an eyelash tint on her last month. The schoolgirl's face was so swollen that she could barely open her eyes - and the strong chemicals caused her eyelashes and eyebrows to burn off. Reaction: Katie Thompson, 16, was barely able to open her eyes after suffering an extreme allergic reaction to her friend's eyebrow tint treatment, which left her face red, swollen and covered in painful blisters, left . Recovery: Katie, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, now has to go for check-ups at Walsall Manor Hospital three times a week to make sure the skin around her eyes heals correctly. Above, Katie's skin is still slightly red . But doctors warned that the treatment could have left her permanently blind. Katie, from Bloxwich, West Midlands, said: 'My friend is training in beauty therapy at Walsall College. 'She is learning to do eyebrow and eyelash design there so I thought I was doing her a favour, as much as she was doing me one. 'The products were just in white tubes. Everything was fine and I went to bed but the next day I woke up with heavy, severely swollen eyes. 'I looked in the mirror and I was shocked. I looked like a completely different person. 'I couldn't really see. My left eye was almost completely shut. 'I was fine at the time of the treatment. But the pain got a lot worse the next day. I just wanted to pull my eyes out. It was quite scary really.' Shocked: Katie said that the morning after the surgery she 'looked like a completely different person'. She said that the swelling was so bad that she couldn't really see - and that her left eye was almost completely shut . Katie, who is studying health and social care, rushed to the walk-in health centre at Walsall Manor Hospital - fearing that she would be left scarred for life. She added: 'The doctor told me I was very lucky to have my eyesight. I knew myself but the doctor told me it was an allergic reaction to the eyelash tint. 'The doctor said it must have been something in the eyelash tint that caused the reaction. 'They prescribed me with steroid tablets, cream, eye drops, penicillin, antihistamines. I was on all sorts. I had finished all my medication by about eight days. 'My friend was very apologetic. I think she was more shocked about it all. She didn't know I was going to react the way I did. Terrified: Katie, who is studying health and social care, rushed to the walk-in health centre at Walsall Manor Hospital, pictured, fearing that she would be left scarred for life after the extreme reaction . 'She has done lots of other treatments before on other people and they have all been fine. 'It has scared me about having things done again. It has been painful, very uncomfortable. 'I don't blame my friend. It was a genuine accident. She feels distraught about what happened.' Katie, who lives with her mother Patricia, 39, and her brother Ben, 10, now has to go for check-ups at the hospital three times a week to make sure her skin heals correctly. Her mother said: 'I was very shocked when I first saw her face. The second day was worse, it was really bad then. 'It could have been a lot worse for Katie. She is certainly going to be much more careful in future.'","Katie Thompson allowed her friend to practise the treatment 'as a favour'

"Margaret Thatcher once faced a diplomatic row about roses. The incident, which saw the UK mediate between Germany and Japan over who could name a rose after her, stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files. The Tory leader was asked by the German Central Horticultural Association if it could name a flower in her honour. Scroll down for video . Margaret Thatcher ended up at the heart of a row between Germany and Japan, who had an ongoing dispute over who should be allowed to name a rose after her. Details of the incident spans 40 pages in her 1984 files . In a speech to delegates who had travelled for a 'proper tea' at Downing Street, she remarked that she was 'deeply touched by the honour'. Mrs Thatcher added: 'A blue rose would be too much to expect. '(I am) Delighted however to note that according to the grower, Mr Kordes, the rose is robust, stands strong on stems, and is very long-lasting.' But she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a Margaret Thatcher rose to be created by Japanese firm Takatori. The story of the German rose made international headlines and Mr Takatori wrote to the Prime Minister in complaint. Amid threats of legal action, a young diplomat named Peter Ricketts, now Ambassador to France, concluded that, although legally the German's may have done nothing wrong, they had acted disingenuously. After a drawn-out series of memos, it was eventually decided that the Japanese should be appeased. Personal papers found in Thatcher's 1984 files show the correspondence sent during the 'rose' dispute . A response was sent, reading: 'The two roses are different in appearance, but if an error has been made, the prime minister very much hopes that it can be satisfactorily and easily resolved. 'We can understand your concern, and would like to assure Mr Takatori of our high regard for the masterpiece he named.' The matter was quietly dropped but not without occupying hours of the prime minister's time. Historian Chris Collins, from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said: 'It goes to show that Yes Minister really happened. 'It took up a lot of time but all they could really do was grin and bear it. 'Perhaps what's most surprising is they were utterly humourless about the whole thing.' She even cancelled her hairdo . Calm and unflappable in a crisis, Thatcher showed resilience worthy of her reputation as the Iron Lady when the Brighton hotel bomb struck, the files reveal. She was so focused on continuing as normal that she even remembered to personally write to a hairdresser after cancelling an appointment in the aftermath. She had taken the difficult decision that the Conservative Party conference must go on in spite of the atrocity, which killed five people and injured 31 on October 12, 1984. Among the dead were two high-profile Tories, and Mrs Thatcher herself narrowly escaped injury, but she refused to allow the tragic event to get to her. In the aftermath of the horrific IRA bombing in Brighton on October 12, 1984, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (above) still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment . She carried on as usual the following day, attending meetings and meeting ministers but she did allow less essential appointments to slip. The files, newly released by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust, show that she instructed a secretary to cancel a hair appointment with Ruffles Hair Salon in Hove, East Sussex. But not content with this courtesy, Thatcher wrote a personal note to thank hairdresser William Thorne for his work earlier in the week. She added: 'I was very pleased with the way you did my hair, and the fact that it lasted so well through Friday was the real test.' According to Mrs Thatcher's appointments diary, her dressmaker, Daphne Scrimgeour, had been due to visit her at Chequers the following day but this was also cancelled. The phrase 'lunch at Chequers' is rubbed out, suggesting she also cancelled a meal with friends. It was not until she attended a church service on the following Monday that she was seen to publicly weep, saying on television: 'This is the day I was not meant to see.' The letters sent from Downing Street confirm Mrs Thatcher's hair appointment for the 1984 Tory conference . Newly-released letters sent from Downing Street reveal how Thatcher wrote to her stylist, William Thorne, apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the IRA Brighton bombing  and offering to pay him anyway . Historian Chris Collins, from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said: 'Her reaction was partly out of necessity and her instinct to carry on. 'I think she would have also been comforted by returning to her usual schedule. 'But also it was a natural human reaction - I'm sure many of us are familiar with the phenomenon of being in a car crash and not realising the harm that's been done until later.' She was inundated with hundreds of letters from world leaders, political rivals and friends. Mr Collins said: 'The number of her responses is so abundant and the touch so personal, we can see that she must have spent many hours of her time the following week handling that correspondence.' In one of the personal letters, her private secretary John Coles said: 'We shall remember - not the bomb or the ruined building - but your courage, calm and nobility in the aftermath. 'I can imagine how much shock and sorrow you had to overcome to show those qualities so splendidly. You turned evil into inspiration.'","Margaret Thatcher once at heart of row over who could name rose after her .

"Hitting back: Mohammed Mattar plans to sue the Home Office after he spent two years awaiting trial . An imam accused of conducting almost 600 sham marriages plans to the government for putting him through 'two years of hell' after a Home Office blunder forced prosecutors to drop charges. Mohammed Mattar demanded a personal apology from UK Border Agency chiefs today for 'making a mug' of him after the case against the 62-year-old collapsed. The Egyptian-born bookseller said investigators searched 'every last inch' of his home and an Islamic bookshop he ran in Bayswater, west London, which has since shut down. He said at his home in Kilburn, north west London: 'This has been going on for over two years - it’s been hell. I’m discussing what action I am take with my lawyers. 'This has upset my family greatly, it has affected me psychologically, my wife has been left worried that the police will come to the house every day. 'I’m glad my name has now been cleared.' Mr Mattar's was the second sham marriage case to be catastrophically bungled by Home Office officials in a week when it was revealed yesterday. Days earlier, ministers were left red-faced over the collapse of Britain’s biggest sham marriage case against a vicar amid allegations of serious misconduct by border officials. A judge ordered charges against father-of-six Mr Mattar to be dropped last month after prosecutors accused the Home Office of not preparing evidence in time. That meant it could not hand over the evidence to Mr Mattar's defence solicitors, as required by the law. A judge refused prosecutors' bid to extend the time limit. Police first raided Mr Mattar's home and the Dar Al Dawa Islamic centre on July 11, 2012. 'They went though all our private possessions,' Mr Mattar said. 'They broke into anything like a suitcase or drawer that they couldn’t open. 'When they couldn’t find anything here they went to the centre and searched through everything, even in the books like they were going to find something.' Mr Mattar, who became an imam in the 1970s, openly admitted he had carried out Islamic marriages for just £100 a time - but insisted they were completely legal. 'We carried out up to three marriages a month,' he said. 'It was a small part of our business. We had all nationalities of Muslim, British, Pakistani, Malaysian. 'They were for people who wanted to be married under Islamic law. We made sure they had all of their identification and everything was legal. 'Once we had the ceremony they went to the council and registered it there. We have never broken the law, it was a big mistake.' Scroll down for video . Fiasco: The case of Mohammed Mattar (left) emerged days after controversy over Rev Nathan Ntege (right) Bookshop: The imam said 'every inch' of his Dar Al Dawa Islamic centre in Bayswater, London, was searched . Mr Mattar’s son, Ismail, is a serving officer in the Metropolitan Police. He added: 'I’m not interested in breaking any laws, I have lived here for most of my life, my children have grown up here, we respect this country and its rules. 'We did everything by the law, we had all the right certification, we had all the inspections and regulation, I can not see why this happened.' He added: 'I’m now trying to rebuild my life and, hopefully, start the business again in a new place.' A massive investigation into Mr Mattar, who was accused of conducting the weddings between 2008 and 2012, was launched two years ago costing tens of thousands of pounds. Bungle: A trial was due to start two weeks ago at Isleworth Crown Court, but it will no longer take place . He was also charged with concealing criminal property via money transfers to the value of £1,887,262, contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act. This charge was dropped in April. Yesterday prosecutors made clear Home Office blunders were to blame. A CPS spokesman said: ‘In early 2014 we identified a large amount of potentially relevant material and we advised the Home Office investigation team to obtain and look into the material for the purpose of disclosure. Questions: Theresa May has faced a backlash over several scandals involving border controls . ‘In August it became apparent that this work had not been completed and therefore we would not be able to fully discharge disclosure obligations in the case before the trial. 'We therefore applied for an adjournment. This was refused by the court and we had no option but to offer no evidence.’ A Home Office spokesman said there were ‘lessons to be learned’ to prevent something similar happening again. He added: ‘The decision not to take this matter to trial is disappointing, particularly after such a long investigation.’ Yesterday a damning report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee slammed growing asylum backlogs, ‘lost’ illegal immigrants and the write-off of some £1billion of taxpayers’ money on failed IT projects. A series of damaging revelations prompted the leaders of both major parties to each demand the other apologise for their handling of the immigration system. At Prime Minister’s Questions Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of making the system worse, while the PM hit back over the ‘shambles’ he inherited from Labour. It follows the collapse of the £1million trial of a vicar suspected of running Britain’s biggest sham marriage racket, due to ‘serious misconduct’ by Border Agency staff. Last week charges were dropped against Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, who was accused of overseeing a ‘matrimonial conveyor belt’ of Eastern European brides. The Uganda-born clergyman walked free after Judge Nic Madge accused two Border Agency officials of perjury and perverting the course of justice. They have both been suspended and may face criminal charges themselves.","Mohammed Mattar said UK Border Agency had made a 'mug' of him .

"A woman accused of trying to kill her mother by spiking her Diet Coke admitted thinking about killing her after she was beaten and slapped during a violent row. Kuntal Patel, 37, is accused of putting the deadly poison abrin in her mother Meena’s drink in a murder plot inspired by TV series Breaking Bad. She told jurors yesterday she had felt like an ‘overweight buffalo’ and never had a boyfriend before she fell in love with a man from an Asian dating website. 'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left), from east London, is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot . But after she was forced to call off the wedding, the graphic designer said she had hit ‘rock bottom’ and considered killing herself and her 60-year-old magistrate mother. Patel said: ‘I was having thoughts about killing myself, and I have to tell you that I also had thoughts – and I can’t believe I’m going to say this – about killing my mother,’ she told Southwark Crown Court. ‘I know it’s a terrible thing and I feel ashamed for having those thoughts. I was in a really bad mental state of mind. I couldn’t cope. I was researching these websites constantly to the point where I became obsessed with doing research on it. It was all I thought about.’ Patel, who worked for Barclays in Canary Wharf, lived with her mother and sister in Plaistow, East London, and was from a strict Gujarati background. Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard Patel (pictured in a court sketch) describe how her mother started 'slapping her on and off' after growing bitter about the relationship . Role: Mrs Patel, a magistrate who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London, drank the poison last December, but survived . Her mother kept tabs on her movements ‘24/7’ and was ‘controlling’ towards her daughters. Patel said she was unhappy about her looks and had confided to a friend that she felt like an ‘overweight buffalo’ and had never had a boyfriend. She turned to Asian dating website Shaadi.com to find a man she could marry and have children with. She met IT worker Niraj Kakad, from Arizona, US, and the pair made plans to marry. But her mother, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court, did not accept him and allegedly called him a ‘fat, black b******’ and her daughter a ‘f*****-up-brain girl who can’t be my blood’ for falling for him. At this point, her mother started beating her and slapping her, the court heard. Peter Rowlands, defending, asked Patel how she would have felt if she had killed her mother. She replied: ‘I would be lost and I would be devastated and, to be honest, I probably would have ended up killing myself too. It was just thoughts I was having in my head.’ Last December, she allegedly bought abrin off the ‘dark web’ and slipped it into her mother’s drink. But her mother survived. Patel told the court she became ‘addicted’ to the hit US series Breaking Bad in which one of the characters is killed off with the poison ricin. She said: ‘I was watching one a day. I became addicted to it.’ Abrin is more poisonous than ricin, the court heard. Patel, denies trying to murder her mother and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She has pleaded guilty to attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin last December. The trial continues.

"Looking pale but alert, this is little Ashya King yesterday after his first day of long-awaited cancer therapy. The five-year-old brain tumour patient, whose parents fought to secure proton beam treatment for him, underwent the first of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in Prague. The session followed a week of tests after Ashya was flown to the Czech capital from Spain by private jet. Scroll down for video . Hope: Ashya King after the first proton beam treatment on his brain tumor at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, Czech Republic . Concern: Naghmeh King waits by an ambulance as Ashya is transported to the Proton Therapy Centre yesterday . His parents Brett and Nagmeh King sparked a controversial international manhunt after they removed their son from Southampton General Hospital without doctors' permission in a bid to take him abroad for the specialist treatment, which is not available on the NHS. The Proton Therapy Centre in Prague released a schedule for the first day of Ashya's treatment for a brain tumour, which saw him leave the University Hospital Motol this morning to undergo irradiation. His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: 'There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has - and there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.' Mr and Mrs King faced a legal battle to get their child to Prague after removing Ashya from hospital on August 28, with a High Court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain. Ashya now faces 30 visits to the Proton Therapy Centre, with the first 13 focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was. Optimistic: Ashya King is transported to the Proton Therapy Centre to start his proton treatment yesterday morning. Czech doctors saying 70-80 per cent of patients in Ashya's condition survive . In a statement on its website, the Proton Therapy Centre outlined the difference between proton beam therapy and conventional radiotherapy. It said: 'Proton therapy can be much better modulated and precisely focused into the tumour volume. In case of irradiation of medulloblastoma in Ashya, it is necessary to apply the highest possible dose into the former location but protect the tissue around as much as possible. 'In Ashya's case, those are vital structures of the heart, lung, liver and intestines.' Proton therapy would decrease the dose to other parts of the body, including the heart, liver and intestines and trachea by up to 80 per cent, the PTC said. 'This means decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders, breathing disorders or metabolic disorders on the first place and better protection of the swallowing functions and normal food intake,' the statement continued. Upset: Brett King and his wife Naghemeh were allegedlly warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities . Care: Mr King leans over his son to kiss him on the cheek as they arrived at the centre over the weekend . According to the PTC's website, Dr Ondrova specialises in cancer in children and is a member of the Czech Society for Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics. Last week, Ashya's father claimed British authorities threatened to remove his son for 11 years after he challenged doctors over his treatment. British doctors opposed the plan to take Asha to the Prague clinic, saying it was not suitable for his condition, but the family disagreed and sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from hospital without permission and took him to Spain. Mr King said: 'They said to me if I question anything and ask questions as a father…they would take my son away from me, not just for the treatment but until he was 16... I wouldn't be able to see my son for 11 years.' 'I said to my wife this is something so serious that our son could be taken away until he is 16...11 years without us, he wouldn't know his parents, his brothers, his sisters or anyone,' he added. 'We knew we couldn't let that happen... We couldn't question them any more. We couldn't let them know our feelings because one mistake on our side and they'd take him away,' he went on to say. Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe . Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors late last month and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment. University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened. After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights. They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga. Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August. The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology. Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas. The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim. A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.

"She never minced words...it was her trademark. And at the height of the miners’ strike the stage was set for Margaret Thatcher’s hardest-hitting speech yet. For the Tory Party conference in 1984, her writers had drafted a damning critique of Labour’s unwillingness to condemn picket-line violence during the bitter year-long conflict, thuggery she described as a ‘dark shadow’ over our free country. But before she could deliver the strident words, a more sinister shadow fell. Scroll down for video . Margaret Thatcher had planned to savage Labour with a hard-hitting speech at the 1984 Tory party conference (left) but was forced to change the nature of her address after the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton (right). The papers featuring her original speech have now been released by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust . The never-seen-before papers from the former Prime Minister's personal file in 1984 show her first attempts at writing her Conservative party speech . Her original speech accuses the Labour leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking of the law . Chris Collins of the Thatcher Foundation said it would have been a ‘great’ speech and more controversial than her ‘enemy within’ address to the 1922 Committee of Tories in July 1984 . On the day she was due to address colleagues at the Brighton Centre, her hotel, the Grand, was hit by an IRA bomb. Five Tory colleagues were killed and others seriously injured. As the nation reeled at such an attack on the heart of Government, the Prime Minister famously insisted on continuing with the party conference agenda, but with a radically revised speech to declare Britain’s defiance in the face of terror. Now the original text, which historians believe would have eclipsed her address branding miners the ‘enemy within’ a few months earlier – has been revealed in her personal papers from 1984, which are held at Churchill College, Cambridge and released today by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust. It accuses the Labour leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking the law. She was set to accuse the party's leader Neil Kinnock of being 'a puppet' of the militants - unprepared to face them down. It reads: ‘From this dark cloud falls an acid rain that eats into liberty. It can be seen above all in the natural home that these views and voices now find in the Labour Party. ‘It explains why that party is so muted in its condemnation of picket violence; so muted in its praise for the hard-pressed police; so muted in its advocacy of an NUM [National Union of Mineworkers] ballot.’ The draft of Mrs Thatcher's address was written following the previous week's Labour Party conference, which had been dominated by the miners' strike. The then Prime Minister intended to accuse Mr Kinnock of vainly trying to convince his party that it should try to win power 'through the ballot box, not through insurrection'. She was to add: 'Mr Kinnock’s own words… show just how far the enemies of democracy have advanced inside the modern Labour party. Mr Kinnock, for all his words – and there is no shortage of those – has been hijacked, first by Mr Scargill, then by the anti-democrats at his own party conference. In name he may be leader. In reality he is a puppet.' A first draft of the speech the former Prime Minister was going to give at the Tory party conference reveals how she planned to attack Labour and the miners' strike . Margaret Thatcher's torn up notes of the speech she intended to give on the day of the Brighton bombing have been released by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust . The original handwritten notes reveal how she was planning to launch an attack on Labour but she changed her speech after the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel . The Prime Minister had just survived an assassination attempt and was grieving for colleagues who were not so lucky. But while battling to hold together a party and a nation in shock, Mrs Thatcher also remembered to cancel a hair appointment. After briefing her secretary to let local stylist William Thorne know she would not be coming, she wrote to him herself to thank him for his work on her hair earlier in the week. ‘The fact that it lasted so well through Friday [when the bomb hit] was the real test,’ she told Mr Thorne. Her private secretary John Coles later wrote to Mrs Thatcher, saying: ‘We shall remember not the bomb or the ruined building but your courage, calm and nobility in the aftermath.’ In the aftermath of the IRA bombing in Brighton, Margaret Thatcher still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment . In newly-released letters from Downing Street, the former Prime Minister wrote to her stylist,  Mr Thorne, apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the tragedy . The conference came just months after the Battle of Orgreave in South Yorkshire, on June 18, when thousands of police and striking miners clashed. Dozens on both sides were injured. Mrs Thatcher’s speech describes the Labour Party as being ‘infiltrated by extremists, riven with factions’, adding: ‘We meet today as free people in a free country. 'But every one of us here senses the shadow that has fallen across this freedom since last we met. ‘The shadow I speak of is the violence and intimidation which has scarred and wrecked the coal industry, and particularly the working miners and their families. ‘The shadow grows darker as influential men and women in our society question, even repudiate, the ideas of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.’ The speech was torn into sections and later taped back together – possibly by the Iron Lady herself. In her 1984 Conservative party conference speech (above), Margaret Thatcher instead chose to condemn the IRA and declare Britain's defiance in the face of terror . The Grand Hotel in Brighton was hit by an IRA bomb in October 1984 in an attempt to kill Thatcher and her Cabinet. It killed five people and injured a further 30 .

Debris lies at the foot of Mrs Thatcher's bed,  the sheets pulled back in readiness for her to retire for the night. The dramatic pictures of the Prime Minister's suite show how close the IRA came to succeeding in its assassination attempt . Thatcher escaped the bombing without injury but five people were killed in the early morning attack in October 1984, including a cabinet minister's wife . In her original speech party conference, Thatcher was going to blast Labour and the miners' strike. Pictured: The picket line at Tilmanstone Colliery, near Dover, Kent . Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, being arrested on the picket line at Orgreave, South Yorkshire in 1984 during the miners' strike . She narrowly avoided death in the IRA attack, as the blast hit her bathroom. Following the bombing in the early hours, she toned down her script. The resulting words, spoken just hours later, were much more conciliatory and she paid tribute to those killed. Chris Collins of the Thatcher Foundation said it would have been a ‘great’ speech and more controversial than her ‘enemy within’ address to the 1922 Committee of Tories in July 1984. The original text shows she was prepared to go further and launch an all-out offensive on Labour. Mr Collins said: ‘She would have taken some convincing to deliver such an attack on Labour and only done so with extreme provocation as such partisan politics were against her nature … [It] would have defined her career.’ Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis (pictured together in the immediate aftermath of the bombing) were lucky to escape uninjured after bomb hit the hotel room .

His wife was left disabled by the attack (together in 1987) Margaret Thatcher pictured with her husband Denis on stage at Conservative party conference in Brighton following the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in 1984 . Margaret Thatcher once faced a diplomatic row about roses. The incident, which saw the UK mediate between Germany and Japan over who could name a rose after her, stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files. The Tory leader was asked by the German Central Horticultural Association if it could name a flower in her honour. She said she was ‘deeply touched’, adding in a nod to her party’s colours: ‘A blue rose would be too much to expect.’ But she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a Margaret Thatcher rose to be created by Japanese firm Takatori. After a series of memos, it was eventually decided the Japanese should be appeased. Germany and Japan once bickered over who could name a rose after the former Prime Minister.

"Migrants in Calais have clashed in a turf war as tensions in an illegal camp spilled over into violence. Riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to contain the hundreds of East African men as they fought running battles early yesterday morning. The rival groups from Sudan and Eritrea are battling for control of an area of land which is the best location for attempting to climb into lorries heading for Britain. Scroll down for video . Turf war: A fight breaks out yesterday despite French police keep a close watch on migrants queuing for charity food handouts in Calais after days of violent clashes between Eritrean and Sudanese migrants . Fight: More than 50 migrants have been injured in overnight clashes in Calais after rival African groups started fighting at a food distribution centre. Above, a migrant is pictured pushing a waste bin over during the clashes . Brawling in the streets: The fight between Sudanese and Eritrean migrants broke out in the French port at around 7.30pm yesterday, and was initially halted by police, according to local government officials . One man was shot in the head and 51 others injured. It comes as a leaked police memo revealed French authorities are ‘alarmed’ by the soaring number of migrants arriving in the country. Most have made their way from Italy after escaping East Africa. An extraordinary 61,591 migrants landed in Italy in the first six months of this year compared with just 7,913 for the same period in 2013 and 4,301 in 2012. The trouble in the camp – which has come to be known as Jungle 2 – has been rumbling on since Sunday night after groups of the young men clashed at a soup kitchen for supplies. Sunday’s incident left 13 injured. The following evening violence again erupted between the ethnic groups as they gathered at the food distribution centre and it continued into the early hours. The man was shot in the head with what is understood to be an air rifle. He was airlifted to hospital but his wounds were not life-threatening. Wreaking havoc: But early today, riot officers were forced to intervene with tear gas and rubber bullets as the migrants continued to clash. Above, migrants run down the street during the brawl, which left 51 injured . Incident: The clashes started shortly after the migrants had been served rice and stew by a group of charities . Last night, dozens of police and aid workers stood guard at the outdoor soup kitchen. At one point, a fight broke out and migrants from both camps immediately picked up stones and prepared to join in. But the large police presence helped to calm matters and it died down. The huge influx of migrants from Africa comes after the re-opening of the ports in Libya – a main jumping off point to Europe. Migrants . from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan who have been gathering there for two . years can now leave – and an estimated 300,000 are said to be waiting to . head across the Mediterranean for a new life. The . change of policy came after Libya said it would help them head to . Europe if the EU did not give it financial help to cope with the influx. From January to April this year, 42,000 migrants were recorded by EU border agency Frontex – 25,650 of them crossing from Libya. Tensions have been at breaking point between the desperate men, who have crossed thousands of miles of desert and undertaken the perilous boat ride across the Mediterranean in their quest to reach Britain. While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. The number of arrivals has spiked in recent months following the breakdown of borders in Libya after Colonel Muammmar Gadaffi’s fall in 2011. Thousands of migrants have flooded through the newly porous borders to undertake the risky crossing to Italy offered by people traffickers. Many drown on the trip. Once in Europe, most make their way to Calais and camp in the town until they manage to board a lorry undetected and get to Britain. Some have been trying for at least a year. Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town. Fight: It is the third clash in 48 hours between migrants massing in Calais in a bid to cross the English Channel to Britain,.Above, migrants from east Africa queue for charity food handouts at a camp in the French port . Rapidly rising numbers of arrivals have raised tensions in the camps. Yesterday, police divers dragged canals in the town, possibly searching for weapons, while police confiscated knives from young men heading to the nightly outdoor soup kitchen. Eviction deadlines on illegal migrant camps ran out on Sunday night and police prepared to move in, but following the outbreaks of violence officers delayed the evacuations and instead pledged to send in delegates to talk to the migrants. Thomas, 30, from Eritrea, who said he has spent two months in Calais attempting to get to Britain, said Monday night’s fighting with the Sudanese was over territory. He said: ‘They attacked us because they want to control the land next to the ferry. ‘They wanted to take it for themselves. This means they are the ones that can get to the lorries. They came at midnight and beat us up. They had knives and told us that no one else was allowed to enter the area. I was cut when I was hit in the face by a rock.’ Basic: Eritrean men cook eggs together outside their shelter at an illegal Calais camp, known as 'Jungle 2' One 17-year-old Eritrean boy looking to gain passage to Britain said that knives and stones were used in the attacks at the food distribution centre. He said: ‘It was scary. It was between Eritreans and Sudanese. The Sudanese used knives and stones. They were hitting my sisters over the head.’ The teenager, who declined to be named, said he had not been in contact with his parents for the past three months as they remain in Africa.","Fight broke out between African migrants at centre in Calais last night .

"The DJ who made the royal prank call that led to a nurse’s suicide broke down in court yesterday as she apologised to grieving relatives. Mel Greig, 32, said she had ‘waited so long to say sorry’ at the conclusion of the inquest into Jacintha Saldanha’s death. The coroner ruled that the hoax, in which Greig and another DJ impersonated the Queen and Prince Charles in a call to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Prince George, had been ‘pressing upon’ Mrs Saldanha’s mind when she committed suicide three days later. Scroll down for video . Concerns: Senior management wanted to discipline Jacintha Saldhana (left) after she had put the call from Mel Greig (right) and a colleague through to another nurse at the King Edward VII's Hospital . Support: The family of Ms Saldanha, including her husband Benedict Barboza (third left) and two teenage children Lisha and Junal (far left, and far right) speak putsideat the Royal Courts of Justice for the final day of the inquest today, with MP Keith Vaz (centre) Bereft: Jacintha Saldanha's daughter Lisha weeps as her brother describes their life without their mother . Greig said in a pre-prepared statement: ‘I am so deeply sorry for your loss. I have wanted to say this to you for so long. ‘This tragedy will stay with me and serve as a constant reminder. I was always concerned for the wellbeing of the nurses and I wish I had tried harder to stop the prank call from being aired.’ She added: ‘This has been a tragic and hard time for all involved. I hope everyone here today has found the answers they so desperately needed and that the Saldanha family can continue their lives in peace without the continuing headlines.’ Speaking outside the court, Mrs Saldanha’s son Junal, 18, said: ‘My dad, my sister and I miss our beloved mum every day and will do so every day for the rest of our lives.’ Prank: A nurse found dead after answering a hoax call asking after the Duchess of Cambridge told her colleagues she believed the prank call made by Australian radio DJ Mel Greig (pictured today) was a genuine call from the Queen, an inquest heard yesterday . Call: Mrs Saldanha was the first nurse to answer the call by Miss Greig (pictured today) and her co-host Michael Christian, and passed them on to a second nurse on Kate's ward . Speaking after the inquest her son Junal said: 'We miss our beloved Mum everyday and will do so for the rest of our lives' Leicester MP Keith Vaz, speaking on behalf of the family, said: ‘Over the last two days, the family and the world have heard about her nobility, her dedication to her patients, her love of her job and her fantastic professionalism. ‘It is an irony that four calls made in 115 seconds, which were the cause of so much mirth in Australia, could have deprived Benedict (her widower) of his wife and Lisha and Junal of their beloved mother.‘These despicable and cruel actions, this hoax, has changed their lives forever.’ He added that the family was taking advice over possible legal action. Mrs Saldanha, from Southmead, Bristol, had been on the night shift at London’s King Edward VII hospital on December 4, 2012, when radio presenters Greig and Michael Christian made the call. Believing it was genuine, she transferred it to another nurse who gave out private medical information about the Duchess, who was suffering from acute morning sickness. The call was then broadcast on Australian radio. Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox found that four further prank calls made by the radio station were ‘almost certainly’ received by Mrs Saldanha. She was found hanging in the hospital’s nurses’ accommodation three days later. Her internet history showed she had researched suicide prevention and suicide methods. Treatment: The Duchess, pictured leaving the King Edward VII Hospital with her husband Prince William, was being treated there for acute morning sickness . Dr Wilcox said that three suicide notes ‘provide evidence of an intention to take her own life’, adding: ‘The hoax call was pressing upon her mind.’ The inquest previously heard the nurse sent messages to colleagues saying: ‘It’s all my fault. I’m ready for any punishment.’ She left a suicide note addressed to hospital managers holding the DJs responsible and asking that they pay her mortgage. Yesterday, it emerged that Mrs Saldanha’s boss did not consider the call a ‘disciplinary matter’. The coroner ruled that adequate support had been offered to Mrs Saldanha, adding that her suicide was ‘not reasonably foreseeable’.","Mrs Saldanha, 46, worked at hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge .

"Calais was at crisis point last night as French riot police prepared to raze a camp of East African migrants desperate to make their way to Britain. Police vans patrolled the town ahead of the imminent crackdown as a court deadline for migrants to leave the illegal camp known as Jungle 2 expired.

Numbers have swollen in recent weeks as more and more people from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan make their way to the already crowded settlement and the surrounding countryside. But aid workers last night criticised the planned raids, insisting that closing the camp would not deal with the problem if no alternative solution was proposed. The Jungle 2 camp is situated on the edge of a busy road used by lorries heading to the cross-Channel ferry terminal on land used by a factory for non-toxic waste disposal. The migrants, who are mostly young men in their 20s, started camping out about three months ago. In recent weeks their numbers have increased. The original Jungle, which was razed in 2009, housed almost 800 Afghans and Iraqi Kurds escaping war and persecution. Chin up: A Susanese man gives his friend a shave in a squat at a former recycling factory, close to the camp in Calais . Basic: Eritrean men cook eggs together outside their shelter at an illegal Calais camp, known as 'Jungle 2' But the large majority of the latest wave of migrants come from Eritrea in east Africa with others from neighbouring Ethiopia and nearby Sudan. Officially, there are 500 migrants at the illegal encampment, but numbers are more like 1,000 say observers. Last Monday, a court in Calais gave the migrants seven days to quit – a deadline which expires this morning. A pipe the migrants cut holes in to use as a water supply has also been cut off and they are now forced to rely on mineral water brought by aid workers. Authorities in Calais claim they are unable to deal with the huge numbers at the camp. In an interview with a French newspaper last week, the mayor said the centre was needed to relieve pressure on the police. Natacha Bouchart has previously called for the border to be moved to Dover rather than Calais so Britain would have to deal with the migration. She has also called on Britain to take responsibility for the migrants and claims that they are attracted by our generous benefits system. ‘The economic development of Calais is affected by the presence of migrants at the port and in all other zones,’ she said. Waiting game: How the Mail reported the migrant queue at Calais on Saturday . The original Red Cross camp at Sangatte, which was home to 2,000 migrants, was shut down in 2002. After the closure, Britain accepted hundreds of migrants in a deal with the French government but others were forced to move to a makeshift camp which became known as The Jungle. It was razed in 2009 and, since then, the mostly Afghans and Iraqi Kurds have had to occupy squats in the town and camps near the ferry terminal. In recent months, the French government has adopted a tough stance, razing camps and throwing migrants on to the street. But an increasing number of East African arrivals who have flocked to the Jungle 2 camp have caused tensions to rise again. There are also thought to be thousands living in makeshift camps in the French countryside, with settlements having sprung up as far away as the Belgian border. Last night, aid workers insisted that police raids would not deal with the problem. Jean-Claude Lenoir, of the charity Salam, which has been feeding the migrants, said: ‘It’s intolerable that these expulsions are being carried out without an alternative being proposed.’","Court deadline for migrants to leave illegal camp expires this morning .

"'Devastatated': Rebecca Richardson, 48, is pictured with her pet dog Scooby, who slipped a disc in grass . A dog owner plans to sue a council for thousands of pounds after her pet slipped a disc in grass while chasing a cat. Scooby, a three-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, was injured after getting his leg caught in long grass on council-owned land in Brighton, East Sussex. His disabled owner Rebecca Richardson, 48, claims that she now faces a £5,000 veterinary bill which she cannot afford to pay as she lives on benefits. Campaigners criticised Mrs Richardson and her husband Steven, 49, for their claim and said it was yet another example of the ‘compensation culture gone mad’. But Mrs Richardson said Brighton and Hove City Council, which owns her house and the land outside it, was negligent and ‘completely responsible’ for what happened to her pet. She claimed that she and other neighbours had been asking for the long grass outside their homes to be cut for a month before the accident. The mother-of-one also said that the council, which says it yet to receive a complaint from her about the grass, was ‘lying’. ‘I was walking my dog and when we got close to my home, he noticed a cat and chased after it,’ she said. ‘He chased the cat up a bank and caught his leg in the grass and now he has a slipped disc. Surgery will cost around £5,000. ‘The grass was too long, it was much taller than Scooby - he was buried in the grass. We’ve been complaining to the council for four weeks about the length of the grass outside our home. ‘All the tenants on the road have been trying to get the grass cut because it is so long. I reported it to the council straight away but they claimed nothing was ever reported to them, which is a complete lie. ‘I would like to pursue it and sue them because they are completely responsible and liable for what happened to my poor dog.’ Scroll down for video . Claim: Mrs Richardson claims Brighton and Hove City Council (pictured) was 'completely responsible' for what happened to her spaniel. She says she now faces a £5,000 veterinary bill which she cannot afford to pay . Mrs Richardson said the accident has left her husband and their son Rhys, 17, feeling ‘devastated’ because the family may have to give up Scooby if they cannot raise the money for his operation. The couple claim Disability Living Allowance because they are unable to work due to back and hip problems. Mrs Richardson last worked 18 years ago as a cleaner in a hotel but had to leave the job due to mental health issues. Meanwhile, her husband was a binman in Dorking, Surrey, but was forced to retire 10 years ago because of his back problems. Mrs Richardson said: ‘I want to take further action with the council - I would like to sue them. ‘It is so unfair we have a dog who needs an operation, but we do not have the money to pay for it - we may be forced to give him up. ‘We will have to send him to a vet surgery for an operation and then they will find him a new home. But I can’t do that, he is part of our family.’ The couple have another dog, a nine-year-old Corgi and Pomeranian cross called Babe. ‘I want to take Scooby out for a walk with Babe, but he obviously cannot come,' said Mrs Richardson. 'He is depressed, being unable to go on long walks is clearly getting him down. He loved chasing balls and loved going out for walks - it is so sad seeing him like this. ‘We are all absolutely devastated, my son broke down when we told him we may have to give Scooby up. This is affecting us every day.' 'Facing a huge bill': Mrs Richardson (pictured with Scooby) says she and other neighbours had been asking the council to cut the long grass outside their homes in Brighton, East Sussex, for a month before the incident . She added: 'He could be paralysed, he needs surgery as soon as possible - but we just do not have the money. ‘Being in our situation, it is difficult - we are on benefits. I want to sue the council but we do not have any money to sue them, but it is unfair because the council are definitely liable for what happened. ‘They should pay for the surgery, it is their fault and I am pointing the finger at the council.’ Andy Silvester, from the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is a perfect storm of council neglect and compensation culture gone mad. ‘The council has got to do a better job of looking after the local area, but it’s ridiculous that taxpayers will be left with a potentially huge bill.’ A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said it will investigate any complaint Mrs Richardson makes.","Scooby the spaniel slipped a disc after getting his leg caught in long grass .

"We've all experienced the humiliation of struggling to manoeuvre a car in a tight space in front of a crowd. But for this woman, the price was higher than mere embarrassment. Her mistake was to try to do a three-point turn outside the home of new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Scroll to down for video . The Foreign Secretary's minders apparently decided to take action after the woman veered towards their BMW . One minder, who had been waiting outside Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's house, decided to take action after watching the woman's three-point turn deteriorate into a seven-point turn in the middle of the road . The minders called in armed officers after becoming concerned and the woman's keys were confiscated and her Toyota Yaris searched (pictured). It was then decided the car would be towed away from the scene . The woman ended up watching her black Toyota (front right) being towed away after the officers took action . And as her disastrous attempt soon became a seven-point turn, plain-clothes protection officers became suspicious. When her Toyota then veered sharply towards their black BMW, the policemen swooped. After questioning her and searching her vehicle, they discovered she was driving without a licence and called in back-up to the narrow street in Belgravia, one of London’s wealthiest areas. Armed police officers arrived on motorbikes moments later to issue the hapless driver with a ticket. She then watched as her black car was towed away. A witness said: ‘The officers were outside Mr Hammond’s house waiting for him to come out. She [the motorist] was trying to make a three-point turn and looked as though she was about to crash into them. ‘One of the officers sounded the horn to stop her and then they got out and questioned her before calling uniformed officers in. The woman looked really fed up and had to get the bus home.’ The incident occurred at 8.30am on July 19, just four days after David Cameron’s reshuffle, in which it was announced that Mr Hammond, 58, would be replacing William Hague as Foreign Secretary. The woman appeared frustrated as she was questioned by police officers following the unfortunate incident . The protection officers called in uniformed armed police after becoming concerned as the incident unfolded . A tow truck could be seen removing the woman's car from the residential street in central London (above) Seemingly oblivious to what had unfolded outside his home, Mr Hammond left the house later that morning to be escorted to Westminster by the minders. The average price of a terrace house on the exclusive street is £3.6million, and the surrounding area has been home to Margaret Thatcher and James Bond actor Sir Roger Moore. Oxford-educated Mr Hammond, who is thought to be worth £9million, also has a nine-bedroom house in Woking, Surrey. As Foreign Secretary he can use two grace and favour homes – £20million Carlton Gardens, near Buckingham Palace, and Chevening House, a 115-room mansion in Kent. The Foreign Office declined to comment on the incident. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the woman’s car was towed because she was driving without a licence.

"Charlea Armstead, 12, is one of only 82 people in the UK suffering from a rare form of dementia . Like many girls her age, 12-year-old Charlea Armstead dreams of being a ballerina. She is seldom happier than when she’s dancing around to her favourite pop star Justin Bieber, or cuddling up with her mother on the sofa watching a DVD. But despite her tender years and lust for life, the smiling schoolgirl is battling the debilitating effects of dementia, a disease more commonly associated with the elderly. Her very rare neurological condition, Niemann-Pick Type C, is making her old before her time. It is gradually robbing her of memory and mobility, and causing her to suffer other indignities such as incontinence and confusion. There is currently no cure. Yesterday her 29-year-old mother Danielle Craig, from Oldham, told of her daughter’s incredible bravery in a bid to raise awareness of the degenerative condition. ‘We don’t know when this cruel disease will take Charlea. 'We were told it could be two years or ten. Charlea is 12 and she’s still fighting. She never stops smiling,’ she said. ‘She has big dreams for a wonderful life. I just hope a cure is found soon so all her wishes come true.’ Charlea was born seemingly healthy, but at two weeks old she had to go to hospital after developing jaundice and a swollen stomach. Doctors then tested her for Niemann-Pick. Miss Craig said: ‘The condition is so rare that a skin graft was taken from her arm and sent for analysis to France. It was six months before we got the devastating results.’ Charlea was eventually diagnosed as one of only 82 people who currently have the disease in the UK; there are thought to be just 500 cases worldwide. Unbeknown to Miss Craig, both she and Charlea’s father Mark Armstead carried the gene responsible for the disease. ‘We were told she may never walk or talk properly and if she did she would lose these skills at an early age. Rarely do people with NPD-C live into their teens,’ she said. Her mother Danielle Craig, 29 (pictured left with her daughter now and right when she was six months old) said she hopes a cure for Niemann-Pick Type C will be found soon . ‘I remember feeling utterly stunned that I might not see my baby girl grow up, but after going through a mix of emotions I decided to get on with life and raise Charlea as if she had a whole future ahead of her.’ The condition causes an excess of cholesterol to build up in cells which affect the brain and other organs. But Charlea defied the odds, learning to talk at 12 months, and walk three months later. However, at the age of six she became quite unco-ordinated, had trouble holding a pen and showed frequent signs of confusion. Charlea (pictured left aged seven and right aged 11 with her brother, seven-year-old Tyler) defied the odds by learning to talk and walk but started to become unco-ordinated when she was aged six . The young girl joined professional ballet dancers on stage during a day out in 2013 arranged by the Make A Wish Foundation . Nevertheless, she still managed to join professional ballet dancers on stage at a rehearsal of Swan Lake in Manchester, during a special day out arranged by the Make A Wish Foundation in 2009. As the disease took hold, Charlea also developed an associated condition called cartoplexy, which means she collapses to the floor when she laughs. Charlea’s younger brother Tyler, seven, has overtaken her in reading, writing and drawing – but Miss Craig said he tries to help her with the basic skills. ‘When I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up he said, “A doctor! So I can fix Charlea”,’ she added.","Charlea Armstead, from Oldham, has rare condition Niemann-Pick Type C .

"At two years old, Samuel Dymott is too young to realise just how incredibly dear he is to his parents. He knows they love him. But it will be some time before he comprehends just how much money – and heartache – they invested during the four years they spent trying to have him. His mother Jo Sharpe had been told by an NHS specialist she would never conceive with her own eggs after blood tests showed she was perimenopausal, meaning she was heading for early menopause. Happy mum: Jo Sharpe, 38, and her husband Miles Dymott, 42, from Brighton, had son Samuel, pictured aged six months, after several rounds of IVF and alternative treatments costing £60,000 . But after she endured two failed rounds of IVF at a private clinic, and countless alternative therapies, Samuel was finally conceived after a third round of IVF. By then his parents had spent more than £60,000 ensuring his arrival. He was born on March 26, 2012, weighing 9lb 3oz. Their struggle to become parents has left Miss Sharpe, a recruitment manager, and her husband Miles Dymott, an IT manager, around £20,000 in debt. But Samuel is worth every penny to them. Miss Sharpe, 38, said: ‘Every day I think how lucky I am to have had my own biological child. It’s such a massive thing for me.’ The couple, from Brighton, began trying for a baby soon after marrying. Mr Dymott has a daughter, Aisha, now 13, from a previous relationship but they wanted a child together too. Price for joy: Samuel, pictured recently, was finally conceived after a third round of IVF, leaving Ms Sharpe, and Mr Dymott around £20,000 in debt . If the woman is under 35, doctors usually tell couples they cannot have tests until they have tried for 12 months without success to become pregnant. But after only three months Miss Sharpe, who was 32 at the time, and her husband went to their GP in 2008. ‘I lied and said we’d been trying for a year,’ she said. It was then that blood tests showed she was heading for early menopause and her only hope was donor eggs or adoption. But she refused to give up hope and threw herself into researching fertility. After making appointments with a private fertility clinic and a Chinese medicine practitioner, she replaced alcohol, sugar, caffeine and carbohydrates with wheatgrass shots and maca powder, a supplement made from a South African root which is purported to boost energy. She also tried acupuncture, reflexology, yoga and pilates. Then came the two unsuccessful rounds of IVF, using her eggs and her husband’s sperm, both in 2009. Failing to become pregnant was heartbreaking, but Miss Sharpe was determined to try again and found a clinic in London with a different – and more expensive – approach involving more extensive tests. She had to get up at 4.45am to travel to London for daily blood tests before heading back to work, and had 14 days of hormone injections before two embryos were put back into her womb. The day before she was due to have a pregnancy blood test at the clinic, her husband, now 42, convinced her to take a home pregnancy test. ‘I was too nervous to look at it so I handed it to Miles. When his face lit up I knew it was positive,’ she said. As for the alternative therapies, she is sceptical about how much they helped her to conceive, but says they gave her a psychological boost. She also ordered the controversial drug DHEA, a hormone supplement which is thought to boost oestrogen levels, off the internet, but says it gave her boils on her face, chest and back. The couple used bonuses, overdrafts and credit cards, plus help from her parents, to pay for the ever rising cost of having Samuel. Since his birth, they have tried for another child and Miss Sharpe has had two more rounds of IVF, costing £10,000 each, boosting their pregnancy bill to a total of £83,200.","Jo Sharpe, 38, and her husband Miles Dymott, 42, had son Samuel in 2012 .

The group claimed the sport has attracted increasing numbers of children since the 2004 Hunting Act, which banned hunting foxes with a pack of hounds. Most of the gatherings now practise trail-hunting, in which participants follow a trail across the countryside laid with a rag steeped in fox scent. A young rider leads her horse through Lambourn High Street as part of the Vine and Craven Boxing Day hunt . The town square in Chipping Norton was packed full of hunt supporters both young and old to welcome the Heythrop Hunt . Yesterday a Countryside Alliance spokesman said: ‘There are a lot of young people hunting. There’s a new generation of people hunting who have come into it since the ban came into force. ‘They are as devoted as everyone else to countryside traditions and feel that hunting in its proper form is entirely justifiable and should be allowed to re-convene ... there’s a real feeling that something fundamentally wrong happened ten years ago when the Act was brought in.’ Yesterday, the Mail reported how hunt supporters are plotting to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election.

But the Countryside Alliance said the result could be very different if Scottish MPs – who are largely Labour – were barred from voting on the issue as it is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. It said English and Welsh MPs would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now.","Young hunt supporters were out in force for traditional Boxing Day meets .

"Jazz legend Acker Bilk, best known for his chart-topping hit Stranger On The Shore, died yesterday aged 85. The clarinet-player and singer passed away in hospital after a short illness with his wife Jean by his side. Bilk’s goatee, bowler hat and colourful waistcoats became almost as recognisable as his style of playing – which he attributed to losing half a finger while sledging in his youth and to the teeth lost in a school punch-up. Jazz singer and clarinettist Bernard Stanley 'Acker' Bilk has died at the age of 85, his manager said today . His signature tune, Stranger On The Shore, was the UK’s biggest-selling single of 1962 and made him the first artist to have a simultaneous chart-topping hit in both Britain and the US. Last night his personal manager Pamela Frances Sutton said he was a ‘wonder of a man’ adding: ‘He lived for music – and music was his life.’ Mrs Sutton, who worked as his personal manager for 45 years, said: ‘He was a great mate and a marvellous musician. Every minute spent with him was a pleasure. ‘He had a special tone to his clarinet playing, he was fun-loving and very much a Somerset guy. His last concert was simply brilliant. He could really charm an audience.’ The much-loved entertainer was born Bernard Stanley but he was nicknamed Acker – slang for a friend or mate in his native Somerset. Bilk tried a number of careers and dabbled with boxing before borrowing a clarinet and copying recordings of famous jazz musicians as an 18-year-old in the Army. Posted to Egypt with the Royal Engineers during his National Service, he found himself with plenty of spare time in the desert and was leant a marching clarinet. Hooked, he smuggled the instrument back to his home village of Pensford. Number one: Bilk's 1962 tune Stranger on the Shore, originally called Jenny after his daughter, was number one in the US and the UK, and sold one million copies . Successful career: Jazz musician Acker Bilk, pictured left in his trademark hat and waistcoat, and right,  after receiving his MBE at Buckingham Palace in 2001 . Family first: Acker Bilk, pictured with wife Jean  and daughter Jenny at their home in 1961 . He formed his first band in Bristol after demobilisation – and his style later personified the trad jazz revival of the 50s and 60s. Clocking up 12 hits altogether, Bilk sold millions of records and toured worldwide during his 50-year career. During the Eighties, he was a regular on the BBC’s early magazine show Pebble Mill At One. Bilk was awarded an MBE in 2001 for services to the music industry. But he had a couple of major health scares along the way. Bilk gave up smoking after he suffered a heart attack in 1976 and in 2000 he battled cancer of the throat. In later life he returned to Pensford and played his last live concert at the Brecon Jazz Festival in August last year. Bilk leaves daughter Jenny, son Peter and wife Jean – his childhood sweetheart whom he had known since the age of five. The musician maintained that when he wrote his biggest hit – an instrumental – he didn’t immediately realise it was special. He said: ‘I didn’t think it was much different from any of the rest of it. It was just a thing that came out of my head, that’s all.’ Among the tributes on Twitter last night, George Freeman, the Tory MP for Mid Norfolk, wrote: ‘Happy memories of going to hear him play in my first week at University.’ Poet Ian McMillan tweeted: ‘Goodbye Acker Bilk, creator of one of the great earworms. That shore was strange, but memorable.’","Jazz musician Bernard Stanley 'Acker' Bilk MBE, has died aged 85 .

"Tom Parker Bowles has been dragged into an alleged abuse scandal at his old prep school after a former pupil accused two teachers of sexual assault. He has been urged to report to police any inappropriate behaviour he may have witnessed at Summer Fields, Oxford, where he studied at the age of seven in the 1980s. The Duchess of Cornwall’s son claimed the school was ‘a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now’ and reportedly said one master would join boys in the shower. The boarding school attended by Tom Parker Bowles (pictured with wife Sarah) is facing legal action from another former pupil who claims two teachers there sexually assaulted him . Yesterday a lawyer acting on behalf of a former pupil, who is taking legal action against the school, praised Mr Parker Bowles for his comments in an interview last week. Liz Dux, who specialises in abuse cases, confirmed that she is representing a man who attended the school from 1972, aged eight. He claims one teacher assaulted him on four occasions, including once when he was made to kneel on a bed naked from the waist down while being punished. He says he was touched and caned on his bare bottom. He further alleges another teacher was present when the boys had baths and touched him and other boys inappropriately. Both teachers are believed to be dead. Miss Dux, of lawyers Slater and Gordon, said the case is in its initial stages. If the former pupil began a court action, it would be a claim for damages for the actual assaults and for any psychological injury caused as a result of assault or abuse. She said: ‘We would urge anyone with any information to report the matter. We applaud Tom Parker Bowles for speaking out about his time at the school but if he witnessed any inappropriate behaviour he should report it to the police.’ The Duchess of Cornwall's son has claimed his prep school, Summer Fields (pictured) in Oxford, was 'a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now' Tom Parker Bowles, (pictured aged five in 1980), was packed off to boarding school at the age of seven . Miss Dux said it has taken a long time for the former pupil to speak about what happened and ‘he feels that other members of staff must have known about the abuse and that the school must take responsibility for what happened’. She said: ‘In my experience of dealing with claims about abuse within schools, other members of staff sometimes had either direct knowledge of what was occurring or at least reasonable suspicions.’ Summer Fields, which charges boarding fees of £25,953 a year, is a feeder school for Eton, where Mr Parker Bowles went. The motto is ‘mens sana in corpore sano’ – a healthy mind in a healthy body. In the interview with The Times last week, Mr Parker Bowles said Camilla regretted sending him away to board so young. A Summer Fields spokesman said that allegations of historic abuse have been reported to police and authorities. He added: ‘The school treats allegations of this nature with the utmost seriousness, regardless of how long ago they occurred. ‘It is very upsetting that the Summer Fields of today, which prides itself on its pastoral care, should be associated with allegations of this nature.'","Tom Parker Bowles made the claims about Summer Fields school, Oxford .

"Walking miracle Darek Fidyka was paralysed from the waist down in a frenzied knife attack by a love rival, he revealed yesterday. The fireman was set upon in the street by his then girlfriend’s jealous ex-husband after trying to stop him vandalising his car. Mr Fidyka, 40, was paralysed in the attack, but is now able to walk again thanks to a pioneering British treatment. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘He stabbed me 18 times. It was a planned, surprise attack with a knife.’ Scroll down for video . Darek Fidyka, a keen hunter, was paralysed from the waist down in the frenzied knife attack . But Mr Fidyka has been able to walk again after receiving pioneering treatment which has repaired his severed spine. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries . The 40-year-old fireman was left with no movement or feeling from the waist down . Asked whether his attacker served a jail term, divorced father-of-one Mr Fidyka claimed: ‘No, he didn’t. He thought I’d kill him because of what he did to me. So that night he killed himself.’ The terrifying incident in July 2010 left Mr Fidyka with no movement or feeling from the waist down, and facing the rest of his life in a wheelchair after one of the wounds severed his spinal cord. But he made world headlines this week when it was announced that he has learned to walk again two years after undergoing revolutionary treatment in a British-led breakthrough. His amazing recovery has allowed him to revive his hobby of hunting and also to drive an adapted car. ‘Physically, I feel great,’ he said. ‘I’m able to walk again — and that was a very nice surprise.’ Before the attack, Bulgarian-born Mr Fidyka was a painter and decorator in Poland as well as a volunteer fireman. He described the recovery as ‘being reborn’. ‘When it starts coming back you feel as if you have started your life all over again,’ he said in an interview for the Panorama special To Walk Again, shown on BBC1 last night. In the breakthrough procedure, cells from his nose were transplanted into the damaged part of his spine to repair his spinal cord. After months of physiotherapy, he sensed feeling in his legs. The treatment, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cell Foundation, brings hope for millions of paralysed people. It was carried out by neurosurgeons in Wroclaw, Poland. Yesterday, Professor Geoffrey Raisman, whose team at University College London discovered the technique, said Mr Fidyka’s wound presented the ‘ideal situation’ to test it on a human. Dr Dusko Ilic, senior lecturer in stem cell science at King’s College London, counselled caution: ‘It is known from animal studies that some transplantations of olfactory ensheathing glial (OEG) cells led to marked improvements; in other cases not. We need to enrol more people in the study to get a better idea of how reliable this approach is.’ The Brits behind the triumph: Maverick surgeon 'experts' sneered at . It’s too soon to say what the history books will make of Geoffrey Raisman. If he really has discovered a cure for spinal injuries, the professor may one day rank among the greats of medical science alongside the heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard or IVF researcher Sir Robert Edwards. For now, following his pioneering surgery on the paralysed Bulgarian fireman Darek Fidyka, he is a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of people around the world unable to walk because of spinal cord injury. Professor Geoffrey Raisman, from the University College London, discovered the pioneering surgery Mr Fidyka received . Like many of the great medical pioneers, Raisman is a maverick. A fiercely anti-establishment figure — he once named Tony Benn as his favourite politician — he came from a poor, working-class background and worked his way to the very top of his profession. Colleagues describe him as an obsessive, meticulous researcher who has devoted his life to one cause — exploring how neurons, the cells in our brains and central nervous system, can regenerate. Born in 1939, Raisman was the only son of a Leeds tailor. Raisman’s father encouraged his son’s interest in science and later persuaded him to study medicine. Raisman excelled at grammar school and aged 17 he won a scholarship to Oxford University — his father made his interview suit. His rebellious, stubborn streak was apparent even then. At a time when Oxford expected students to be single, Raisman risked his college place by marrying his sweetheart Vivien aged 18. She gave up her place at Edinburgh University and lived with him in one room in Oxford. Raisman lost his scholarship but clung on to his place at the college. He qualified as a doctor and stayed on at Oxford as a research neuroscientist. Then in his 20s he made an extraordinary discovery. Using an electron microscope that magnified cells up to one million times, he found that the brain and central nervous system have an amazing ability to rewire themselves after injury. If the brain is damaged, new connections spring up around the damaged area. The process — which Raisman named plasticity — was scientific heresy. At the time, the established thinking was that once a brain was injured, or a spinal cord severed, the damage was irreparable. He turned out to be right. Today, it appears in every textbook about the brain. In the Seventies, when Raisman suggested that brain damage could be reversed, he was accused of pushing ‘dangerous’ ideas that would create false hopes. But he was determined to show the world that brain and spinal cord damage could be repaired. In the Eighties, he had a second breakthrough when he discovered that the neurons involved in taste and smell have the unique ability to regenerate after they have been badly damaged. In the Nineties, he transplanted these cells into the severed spinal cords of laboratory animals. They did their job and repaired the damage. He repeated the experiment dozens of times before moving on to people. His pioneering work culminated with the extraordinary success this week. Other neuroscientists yesterday tried to play down the ‘breakthrough’. But as we have seen, scientists underestimate Prof Raisman at their peril. The father who never gave up hope . When Daniel Nicholls plunged into the ocean off Sydney’s Bondi Beach, life could hardly have been better. The 18-year-old — celebrating the end of his A-Levels in 2003 with a holiday to Australia — had his whole life ahead of him. David Nicholls with his son Daniel who was paralysed after diving into the sea in Australia . But, as he dived into a wave, his head hit a hidden sandbank, severing his spinal cord and breaking his neck. He was left unable to walk, with no feeling in his legs, and little movement in his arms. Sixty per cent of spinal injuries are ‘incomplete’ — meaning that the spinal cord isn’t completely severed and that there’s a remnant of feeling or movement in the limbs, which can be built on. But Daniel’s accident was among the other 40 per cent of spinal injuries, when the spinal cord is completely severed — these are injuries that you supposedly have no chance of recovering from. Yet, out of this terrible tragedy, an extraordinary silver lining has emerged. Thanks to the exceptional dedication of Daniel’s father, a historic breakthrough has been made in the field of spinal surgery. David Nicholls, a British former chef and hotelier, was told by doctors that Daniel had no chance of any recovery. But he refused to take no for an answer. He assured his son that he would find a cure. Through a decade-long whirl of fund-raising — helped by celebrity friends in the culinary world — Mr Nicholls raised £1 million to provide basic medical research into a cure for spinal injuries such as his son’s. Now, using those funds, surgeons in Wroclaw, Poland, have treated Mr Fidyka, left paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago. Like Daniel Nicholls, he’d had his spinal nerves completely severed, and, despite six months of physiotherapy, there had been no improvement. His revolutionary treatment — performed for the first time — saw cells from his nasal cavity transplanted to the affected part of his spine. Today, two years after his operation, not only can he walk with a frame, he can also drive, and even go hunting with his old friends. Mr Nicholls, still determined to make good on his promise, now hopes that his ‘son will be near the front of the queue’ for the treatment. ‘It was the most devastating thing in my life, seeing a fit, healthy, lean, good-looking 18-year-old boy in bed unable to move,’ he said. Galvanised by the tragedy, he set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation to raise funds for medical research. After the latest triumph, and with more money needed to continue the medical trials, Mr Nicholls has vowed to keep fund-raising at a furious pace. He has a promise to keep.","Bulgarian was left paralysed after he was stabbed 18 times in knife attack .

"Survivors of the Himalayan trekking tragedy told yesterday how they faced the life or death dilemma of whether to stay in a flimsy teahouse at 17,000ft or brave a killer blizzard. Around 100 people, including many inexperienced trekkers, took refuge in the wooden shack after a sudden snowstorm on the popular Annapurna Circuit. The teahouse’s owner told trekkers they were putting their lives in danger if they stayed. Scroll down for video . Safe: Jade House (right) and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis (left), both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck . He then declared he was shutting the shop near the Thorung La Pass and, it is claimed, demanded 1,000 Nepali rupees – around £6.30 – each to guide them to the nearest village, Muktinath. Some decided to stay behind after he agreed to leave the lodge open and, despite a cold and hungry night, survived. But most set off behind him and several died – amid claims he abandoned them when the deadly blizzards and avalanches took hold last week. Yesterday Kobi Megreli, 24, an Israeli medical student who was among those who opted to stay in the teahouse, said: ‘I don’t trust someone who asks me for money to save my life. ‘My friends who went with him told me the owner had left them halfway down. In the snow. In the storm. He left them because they were too exhausted to continue.’ The search for survivors of the devastating storm in which at least 39 people died was called off by rescuers in Nepal yesterday as they began focusing instead on looking for bodies trapped in the snow. Unharmed: Peter Roddis, 26, an electrical engineer, from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck . More than 500 people, including 230 tourists, have been rescued from the Annapurna mountain range trail, which is nicknamed the ‘apple pie’ circuit because the lodges along the route sell home-baked food. Fears remain for at least three Britons who were in the area and are still listed as ‘missing’ on a website set up by local rescuers. Their names are Martin Warner, Katie Hill and Jay Devine. Last night the website said that Christopher Pugh, whose name had been on the missing list, was safe. Several others whose names appeared on that list have since contacted home to say they are safe and well – and, in some cases, that they were not near the disaster scene. Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck. Nigel Vardy, 46, of Belper, Derbyshire – known as Mr Frostbite after losing his fingers on a previous adventure – has also contacted his family to say he is safe.

Yesterday Briton Andrew Kimmerling, 54, who was on honeymoon in Nepal with his Danish wife Suzanne and had been feared dead, turned up safe and well. Management consultant Mr Kimmerling, who moved to France 15 years ago from Cambridgeshire, contacted relatives by text and phone call to say that he and his wife are both fine. Peter Roddis, 26, an electrical engineer, from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck on the 150-mile trail, which loops round Annapurna, the world’s tenth tallest peak. The Foreign Office said yesterday that it has still received no information about any British injured or dead. The dead include Canadian, Indian, Israeli, Japanese, Nepalese, Polish and Slovak trekkers. Mr Megreli told The Sunday Times of the terrible dilemma in the teahouse after he was discharged from a hospital in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, with only minor injuries. He and the others who refused to pay to be led down the mountain made it to safety the next morning after ‘huddling together for warmth’ and not sleeping for fear of hypothermia. They walked to an area where military helicopters flew them to Kathmandu. Eitan Edan, 31, an Israeli social worker who followed the teahouse owner but survived and is being treated for frostbite, said: ‘They let us think we had to walk if we wanted to stay alive, but everyone who stayed in the teashop lived.’ Four of his friends died, he added. The fate of the teahouse owner was not clear last night. Reports locally said Pasang Tamang, a porter who had earlier been hired by some of those in the teahouse to help them on the trek, was hailed a hero after dying having rescued more than 20 stranded people during the descent. But some survivors have claimed the 45-year-old father of two, who was reportedly paid £9 a day, made a deal with the teahouse owner to share the trekkers’ ‘escape payments’. He died of suffocation and exhaustion during the descent. His employer, Laxman Ghimire, said 22,500 rupees (£141) and $100 was recovered from his body, which he had earned on his previous trek.

"School days are often said to be the happiest of your life. But for Tom Parker Bowles, being packed off to board at the age of seven is not an experience he wishes to repeat for his own children. The Duchess of Cornwall’s son yesterday claimed his prep school was ‘a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now’, and reportedly revealed that one master would join naked boys in the shower. Tom Parker Bowles' former headmaster has dismissed as 'complete rubbish' the food writer's claims his old primary school was a hotbed of impropriety . In a candid interview, he said of Summer Fields school in Oxford: ‘It was just certain things that weren’t right and I’d say to my dad and he’d say, “Well, you tell me if anything happens”, and it never did. So perhaps I’m speaking totally out of turn.’ It is understood the unnamed master was not himself naked in the shower. But the anecdote is bound to raise questions about what is acceptable for a teacher acting ‘in loco parentis’. The food writer and Mail on Sunday restaurant critic, 39, was a pupil at the school – motto ‘mens sana in corpore sano’ or ‘a healthy mind in a healthy body’ – in the early 1980s before going to Eton. Last night Nigel Talbot Rice, 76, who was headmaster of Summer Fields when Mr Parker Bowles was there, before retiring from the post in 1997, dismissed any suggestion of impropriety, and said no official complaints were received. Asked about Mr Parker Bowles’s comments, Mr Talbot Rice added: ‘It is complete rubbish. He was a very happy little boy.’ The school, where boarding fees are currently £25,953 a year, is one of the main feeder schools for Eton. The Duchess of Cornwall’s son has claimed his prep school, Summer Fields (pictured) in Oxford, was ‘a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now’ Tom Parker Bowles, (pictured aged five in 1980), was packed off to boarding school at the age of seven . After being contacted yesterday by the Mail about Mr Parker Bowles’s comments in The Times, a Summer Fields spokesman said: ‘There is no one available to talk about it and the school does not wish to comment.’ Mr Parker Bowles and his wife Sara Buys, a fashion editor at Harper’s Bazaar, send their children Lola, seven, and Freddy, four, to London day schools. He told how his mother Camilla regretted sending him away to board so young. After Lola’s seventh birthday earlier this month, he said to his mother: ‘You sent me away eight months after this.’ He continued: ‘My mother was slightly appalled, saying she’d never do it again, but it was the thing you did, you know.’ In the wide-ranging interview to promote his new cookbook, Let’s Eat Meat, Mr Parker Bowles also spoke of his reaction to his mother’s long affair with Prince Charles, and her divorce from his father Andrew Parker Bowles, who was Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. Tom on: Charles and the ‘Camillagate’ tape . Prince Charles had a highly intimate late-night mobile phone conversation with Camilla in 1989. A transcript of the ‘Camillagate’ call was made public in 1992, weeks after news had broken about the ‘Squidgygate’ tapes involving Diana and her lover James Gilbey. It caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family because it included details of how the prince had told his lover that he wanted to be her ‘tampon’. Tom Parker Bowles has revealed how he did not want to look at newspapers when transcripts of the 'Camillagate' call, involving his mother and Prince Charles (pictured above), were made public . Yesterday Mr Parker Bowles said: ‘I sort of remember not looking at the paper because you know, Jesus, the things that we’ve all said to people that we love or girlfriends or boyfriends that you wouldn’t want the world reading! ‘I just felt pissed off. I wasn’t going to read that sort of stuff about my mother, just as much as she wouldn’t want to read it about me, or my kids certainly wouldn’t want to read it about me. I don’t think I’ve ever listened to it.’ Tom on: His Parents' doomed marriage . Asked if he felt his parents got on while he was growing up, Mr Parker Bowles said: ‘Perfectly well. I mean, I think as a boy when you’re away a lot you see less, but always.’ He added: ‘They divorced when I was 18. I think you had a sort of inkling perhaps but I always felt that it was just a normal way of things happening. ‘God knows my mother has been called every name under the sun. I suppose we have as well. We’ve never really cared. ‘My mum’s got an iPad now and I was like, “Don’t read the below-the-line stuff,” and, of course she’s [saying], “You’re not going to believe what they just said here! Check this out.” Tom on: Being caught in tabloid drug sting . Mr Parker Bowles was caught bragging about taking cocaine by the now closed News Of The World at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 when he was a junior ‘fixer’ in showbusiness publicity circles. But yesterday he said he bears no grudge. Mr Parker Bowles yesterday described his mother Camilla, called ‘Gaga’ by his children, as ‘a brilliant grandmother’ He told The Times: ‘That was entirely my fault. I wasn’t moaning and groaning about an intrusion of privacy. You know the position you’re in and if you muck up you pay the consequences and that was the end of that.’ Mr Parker Bowles said the incident stopped him using the Class A drug. He added: ‘If a few toffs get caught taking coke and that’s the price you pay for Press freedom, well bring it on. I cannot tell you how strongly I believe that one of the cornerstones of democracy is a free Press.’ Tom on: Smoking, only thing I did well at Eton . Despite his reservations about boarding at prep school, Mr Parker Bowles enjoyed his time at Eton and intends to send his son there when he is 13. But yesterday he claimed he didn’t work very hard at the top school until his father threatened to send him to a comprehensive. He said: ‘My mother couldn’t care. When I had bad reports, she’d be by the window making faces behind my father going, “You’re going to comprehensive if this happens again”, and he meant it. “I’m not going to spend all this money on you if you’re not going to pull your f***ing finger out.” ‘He drove me past Corsham comprehensive [in Wiltshire] and I remember thinking how many pretty girls there were but also tough-looking boys – not like the sort of boys at Eton. ‘And so, third year, GCSEs, that’s when I bucked up and did some work.’ But he added: ‘I was rubbish at everything. I was good at smoking. ‘We knew a couple of pubs where you could drink underage, but apart from a couple of English prizes I moved like a ghost through that school.’ Tom on: The brilliant granny we call ‘Gaga’ Mr Parker Bowles yesterday described his mother Camilla, called ‘Gaga’ by his children, as ‘a brilliant grandmother’. ‘I mean, she works incredibly hard. She’d be the first to say that she didn’t really have a job apart from being our mother, which she was very good at, and suddenly age 55 she is working,’ he said. ‘She’s worked incredibly hard, really, really, really hard.’ Asked if she would be queen one day, he said: ‘I have no idea. That is one for far greater minds and constitutionalists than me.’ The self-confessed monarchist doesn’t feel royal himself. ‘Christ, no! I’m a good old pleb,’ he said.","Tom Parker Bowles made the claims about Summer Fields school, Oxford .

"The BBC was yesterday forced to defend its decision to feature a rape scene in EastEnders after receiving 278 complaints about the episode. Viewers complained the scenes were inappropriate, especially as the episode was broadcast an hour before the watershed. Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter was raped by her nephew Dean Wicks in the controversial episode, which went out at 8pm on BBC1 on Monday. Scroll down for video . Linda Carter, played by Kellie Bright, left, was raped on screen by her nephew Dean Wicks . Despite the rape being implied rather than explicitly depicted, a further 34 complaints were also made to television regulator Ofcom. In a statement, the BBC said: ‘EastEnders has a rich history of tackling difficult issues and Linda’s story is one of these. ‘We have worked closely with Rape Crisis and other experts in the field to tell this story which we hope will raise awareness of sexual assaults and the issues surrounding them. Traumatic: Following on from her attack, Elaine tries to get her daughter to open up but struggles to get through to her . ‘We have been extremely mindful of the content within the episode and the timeslot in which it was shown and at no point have there been any scenes of a graphic nature. In fact, the attack on Linda was implied and was not explicit.’ The watershed begins at 9pm and material unsuitable for children should not, in general, be shown before 9pm or after 5.30am.The episode was watched by a peak audience of 7.3 million. It is not the first time EastEnders has been involved in a controversial or harrowing rape storyline. In 2004, seven viewers complained to the BBC about an episode which focused on the distress of Little Mo Slater, who was assaulted in the Queen Vic pub by a customer. Six complaints were received by Ofcom, which said it was concerned at the content, ‘given the mixed age ranges in the audience’. The BBC agreed it ‘was a degree more adult in tone than was appropriate’ for the pre-watershed time slot. In 1988, Kathy Beale, played by Gillian Taylforth, was raped by James Willmott-Brown. Harrowing: Actress Kellie Bright, who plays Linda, said of the scenes: ' I think it's been done in a really sensitive way' Speaking last week, actor Matt Di Angelo, who plays Dean Wicks, said he did not mind getting ‘abuse’ for playing a rapist if the shocking storyline helped real-life victims. He said: ‘This show is so popular and you’re in people’s houses every night so to be associated with that crime, like I said if I have to get abuse on Twitter or a punch in the mouth, I’m fine with that as long as one person speaks out.’ In an interview with the Radio Times last week, actress Kellie Bright, who plays Linda Carter, was asked if she thinks EastEnders should be tackling such an issue pre-watershed. Criticised: The show received 278 complaints about the episode . Response: EastEnders are now having to defend their decision to broadcast the distressing scenes one-hour before the watershed . She said: ‘Yes. EastEnders is a programme that is supposed to be reflective of real life and this issue is part of our society. ‘Why shouldn’t it be tackled? I think it’s been done in a really sensitive way. ‘It’s out there so it’s not going to be a shock to viewers and they have the option to make a decision not to watch it. It’s a way to educate people.’ The BBC was criticised for airing the scene, featuring Dean Wicks, played by Matt Di Angelo, right .","The BBC broadcast the distressing scenes one-hour before the watershed .

"Question: Councillor and father David Scott has told of his frustration at the deepening political fallout . The father whose question led to Lord Freud’s remarks suggesting some disabled workers were ‘not worth’ the minimum wage told yesterday of his frustration at the deepening political fallout. David Scott said his exchange with the Welfare Minister at the Conservative Party conference last month had been taken out of context as he spoke movingly of the inspirational life of his severely disabled daughter Moira, who died six years ago. Meanwhile Nick Clegg added to the criticism of Lord Freud’s comments, while Labour renewed calls for the minister to explain himself. Mr Scott, 63, a Tory councillor for Tunbridge Wells in Kent, asked Lord Freud a question about getting the disabled into work during a fringe meeting at the Tory conference. In his response Lord Freud said: ‘There is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…’ The minister’s response was seized on by Ed Miliband on Wednesday, when he read out a transcript of the exchange in Prime Minister’s Questions. Mr Scott suggested he was more concerned with getting across his own message than the political row, saying: ‘Major politicians can look after themselves.’ He said he wanted to find ways of better integrating disabled people into society – including paying them for work in addition to the benefits they receive. Scroll down for video . Severely disabled: Mr Scott, 63, spoke movingly of the inspirational life of his late daughter Moira (above) ‘My main concern is how to enhance the lives of severely disabled people and get support for them in the community,’ he continued. ‘Community means not just at home or in shops, but at the workplace and everywhere else. ‘What I’m talking about is finding some way of bringing severely disabled people into the workplace because it can make them feel valued and enhance the lives of those they’re working with. And that feeling of value has nothing to do with money. Many disabled people are helped into work by a government organisation called Remploy, which tries to match them with suitable jobs. It was set up in 1944 by the then Minister for Labour Ernest Bevin, and two years later opened its first factory at Bridgend in South Wales. Many of its workers, who made items such as furniture, were disabled ex-miners. But as the factory network grew it also employed soldiers returning from the Second World War. At its peak in the late 1980s, the factories employed more than 10,000 people. The Government subsidised each job to the tune of £27,000 a year. But state funding was gradually withdrawn because of the growing view that disabled people should be helped to find mainstream jobs, and the factories were closed. Employment Minister Esther McVey announced earlier this year that Remploy – which now helps disabled people into work through placement schemes – was to be privatised. ‘When someone goes out to work, whether they are disabled or not, they benefit greatly from that. They benefit from doing something, from interacting with people.’ He added: ‘I want severely learning disabled people to have their value recognised, which will include money over and above the benefits they need to live.’ Mr Scott said Moira, who had brain damage, was blind, could not talk and used a wheelchair, was too severely disabled to work. But many of her other experiences had shown him disabled people should be given as many opportunities as possible. With the help of a charity, Mr Scott and his wife Jillian, also 63, were able to arrange for Moira to live in a specially adapted house near their own home, where she lived with housemates as well as her carers. And in the last year of her life she had the chance to groom and feed horses at a nearby stables. Mr Scott said: ‘It’s about giving people a level of independence and involvement so they can say, “I am living my life” rather than life being done to them. ‘So many parents of the severely disabled feel that. They want their child to be treated as a valued human being.’ Mr Clegg said Lord Freud’s comments had ‘caused huge offence’. But he told LBC radio: ‘That shouldn’t stop any of us having a discussion and, frankly, a difficult discussion, to get more people with disabilities and with other disadvantages in life into the workplace.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) added to the criticism of the comments made by Lord Freud (right) Charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, once said the minimum wage had jeopardised jobs for 1,000 disabled people, it emerged yesterday. In 2000, the charity said: ‘The minimum wage has helped many people with learning disabilities. But people who have severe learning disabilities are also employed, even though they may have a productivity rate of 30 per cent of the average. ‘An employer may say that they will pay someone £15 a week for doing 15 hours work... Unfortunately, if employers have to pay the minimum wage, they may have to let these valuable members of their staff go.’ A Mencap spokesman said: ‘In the last 15 years, the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed and debate has moved on, as has our position on this issue.’ A father said his disabled son would be ‘over the moon’ to work for less than the minimum wage - because he would take ‘three times as long’ as another employee to do the job. Julian Mason said his son Ben, 32, who has learning difficulties caused by the genetic condition Fragile X syndrome, would be happy to be paid £2 an hour to stack shelves in a supermarket. On BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday, the retired engineer, 69, said his son ‘would need fairly constant supervision’ as he struggles with concentration, but that he gets a ‘profound sense of achievement’ from working. Rewarding: Julian and Judith Mason, of Derbyshire, with their daughter Anna (left) and son Ben (right) ‘If Ben was receiving a wage packet ... of say, £2 an hour, he would just be over the moon,’ he added. Mr Mason, from Darley Bridge, Derbyshire, said it would not be right to pay all disabled people less – but for those who require supervision it could be fair.","David Scott says exchange with Welfare Minister was taken out of context .

"It is a typical family album snap of its era – but for the 11-year-old schoolboy on the right, being photographed would soon become a regular event. This 1952 picture of John Lennon in blazer and cap, with his aunt Harriet and cousin David Birch, is one of several being auctioned next month. Another shows a young Lennon pulling a funny face while on a holiday with cousin David and relatives in Edinburgh in 1952. Family snap: John Lennon aged 11, right, with his cousin David Birch and aunt Harriet in Woolton in 1952 . Mr Birch is selling the photos, along with a Gretsch 6120 guitar Lennon gave him after he used it on The Beatles’ 1966 hit Paperback Writer and which could fetch up to $1million (£630,000). The average house price across the UK is £189,306. But the auctioneers are confident the guitar will be hotly contested for by collectors because it comes with a truly extraordinary provenance. Lennon gave the guitar to his cousin, David Birch, in November 1967, a year after Paperback Writer was recorded in April 1966 at London’s Abbey Road studios. Mr Birch said he had fancied forming his own band and asked if he could have one of his famous relative’s guitars on a visit to Lennon’s country mansion Kenwood in Weybridge, Surrey. ‘I was just cheeky enough to ask John for one of his spare guitars,’ he said. ‘I had my eye on a blue Fender Stratocaster lying in the studio, but John suggested the Gretsch and gave it to me.’ Young joker: John Lennon, far left, pulls a funny face with David and family members in Edinburgh in 1952 . Ride on: This photograph shows Lennon cycling near the home of his aunt Mimi in Liverpool in 1951 . Mr Birch has owned the guitar ever since. It is even more remarkable because Lennon was photographed playing it during the Paperback Writer recording session, and the photograph was published in the Beatles Monthly Book magazine in June 1966. The photographer also took several close-up shots of the woodgrain on the guitar’s headstock. Experts say when these images of the wood grain are compared to the wood grain on the headstock of the actual guitar the two can be seen to match up identically. The guitar is being sold together with a copy of the Beatles Monthly Book photograph and some charming shots from Mr Birch’s family album. While My Wallet Gently Weeps: Lennon's Gretsch 6120 is expected to fetch up to $1million (£630,000) One of these shows a pre-fame Lennon pulling a funny face while on a holiday with his young cousin Mr Birch and relatives in Edinburgh in 1952. Another shows the two cousins as schoolboys in uniform with Mr Birch’s mother Harriet ‘Harrie’ Birch. A third is of an 11-year-old Lennon riding his bike near the home of his Aunt Mimi, who brought him up, in Menlove Avenue, Liverpool. Tuesday, Paul Wane, of auctioneers TracksAuction.com, said: ‘John used to go to Edinburgh during the summer holidays when he was young to stay with his aunt Mater and his uncle Robert Sutherland. ‘They then used to travel up to the North West coast of Scotland where they had a small cottage near the sea. John always spoke fondly of the time that he spent in Scotland on his summer holidays. ‘It’s true you could probably buy several houses for the cost of this guitar, but it’s a very rare opportunity to buy a unique collectible with an iron-clad provenance. ‘Beatles’ guitars have been sold before, but they have normally been passed around so much over the years that it’s hard to establish their origin 100 per cent. ‘It’s hard to remember when a Lennon guitar of such provenance was last sold, if ever.’ Mr Wane said Beatles’ fanatics including rock star Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis, have been informed, but he is expecting most interest to come from private collectors in the U.S. Online bidding begins on November 14 at TracksAuction.com, ending with a live auction on November 23 at Le Meridien Hotel, Piccadilly, London.","Photographs of a young John Lennon to be auctioned off next month .

"Jailed paedophile: Norman Shepherd lived a double life . A mother turned detective to catch the ‘monster’ who abused her son by covertly recording him admitting his vile crimes. She confronted retired dentist Norman Shepherd, a trusted family friend, after her son, now in his 20s, broke down and told her he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times between the ages of five and 12. During the conversation Shepherd, 78, a former churchwarden, admitted the crime – but when the mother tells him she plans to go to the police, he replies: ‘Alright. It’s going to be his word against mine.’ Unbeknown to him the entire exchange was being recorded by the mother, against the advice of police who had told her not to go near him. Shepherd was later jailed for 15 years and four months after she helped uncover the perverted double life of the supposed pillar of society. Yesterday the mother, from an affluent area of the Home Counties, said: ‘I had a total determination that the monster will go to prison.’ She said that when her son – who she described as ‘an inspiration who is making a success of his life’ – first told her of the abuse ‘it felt like my heart had been ripped out’. On the day her son broke down in September last year she rang Shepherd and asked him to explain himself, recording the conversation on a mobile phone. Throughout the exchange, which has been heard by the Mail, married Shepherd’s tone remains matter of fact as he tries to play things down. After he says: ‘I’m not denying we were very close…’, the mother insists on a face to face meeting with him the next day at his Grade-II listed home in the village of Poling, West Sussex. THE PHONE CALL . MOTHER: I’ve just been talking to my son and he’s broken down... He’s told me the things you used to do to him as a little boy, and what you did was absolutely unforgivable and I want to know your comments. SHEPHERD: I don’t know… . MOTHER: What do you mean you don’t know? I’m going to be contacting the police… So you better think about what you did over all those years. It was… when [my husband] used to bring him down to your house and he was tucked up in bed at night you used to go into his bedroom… . SHEPHERD: No, he used to come into bed with me… . MOTHER: He used to come into bed with you, did he? SHEPHERD: I’m sorry. MOTHER: Ok, well you will be sorry… because you are not going to get away with this. My son was the most beautiful, beautiful, innocent child… and you abused him over all those years, and now you are going to try and deny it. SHEPHERD: Wait a minute, what brought it on? MOTHER: He’s carried this burden for all these years… he bottled everything up. And I tell you now, he has broken down… . SHEPHERD: I’m sorry. MOTHER: Is that all you’ve got to say? Are you going to deny it? SON: It’s affected me quite a bit. SHEPHERD: I’m not denying we were very close… . SON: Very close? What do you mean? You used to come to my bedroom. (They arrange to meet the next day at 11am at Shepherd’s house). THE MEETING . MOTHER (voice trembling with emotion): Have you abused any other children? This went on for years, every time he came down with [his father], you used to wake [my son] up in the middle of the night and sexually abuse him. SHEPHERD: No… . MOTHER: Yes you did. SHEPHERD: No, no… I love him too much actually. MOTHER: What did you do to him? Spell out exactly what you did. SHEPHERD: I’m not saying I’m not guilty, I’m guilty of being too friendly to him. MOTHER: [My husband] came down here, to do work for you, and all the time you were abusing his son, his most precious possession. He idolised our son, if he knew you laid a finger on his head he would… . SHEPHERD: I never forced him to do anything… . MOTHER: He was a child! He was a boy, an innocent… He was the quietest child, he would never say boo to a goose. All his teenage life he’s been quiet and humble, and he’s had the abuse you caused him locked in his body. You don’t know the damage you’ve done to this boy… you are not going to get away with this. SHEPHERD (to her son): I’m sorry. I just hope that sometime you can forgive me. MOTHER: The police are going to be involved. SHEPHERD: Alright. It’s going to be his word against mine. These are edited versions of both transcripts. Following a sleepless night, she told police what had happened and that she was going to see Shepherd. She said: ‘They told me under no circumstance to go near him. I ignored them – but thank goodness I did. I recorded the whole meeting and he admitted it.’ She and her son, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, went to Shepherd’s house together. Victim: The boy pictured in the 1990s . She used the same mobile phone to secretly record the conversation as she challenged him over why he abused her son. The attacks happened while her son stayed overnight at Shepherd’s home with his father, who had counted Shepherd as a friend and was helping him with some work, and at social gatherings. Shepherd, whose wife was present at the meeting and did not know he is a paedophile, sickeningly claimed to ‘love’ the boy. He then tried to excuse his attacks by claiming he was himself abused by his biology master at school. Shepherd was arrested and later admitted abusing three other young boys. Eventually he pleaded guilty to 27 counts in total against his four victims, including 12 of indecent assault and two of attempted rape on the boy whose mother confronted him. Sentencing Shepherd at Chichester Crown Court on May 9, Judge Christopher Parker QC told him that behind a ‘sham facade’ he had spent 17 years between 1993 and 2010 grooming, gaining the confidence of and sexually abusing his victims ‘out of deviant lust’. Shepherd must serve nine years in prison before becoming eligible for release. Yesterday Sussex Police confirmed that material recorded by the mother formed part of the case against Shepherd. A force spokesman said: ‘However, this was not presented in court as evidence as the case did not go to trial as Shepherd pleaded guilty.’","Norman Shepherd sexually abused boy hundreds of times over seven years .

"A woman has died after apparently being bitten by the UK’s most venomous spider, in what could be the country’s first such death. According to her family, grandmother Pat Gough-Irwin fell ill after being bitten on the finger by a false widow spider. She had to have the end of the finger amputated after weeks of ‘absolute agony’, her daughter said, but the 60-year-old’s health deteriorated further and she died in hospital on Friday. Scroll down for video . Pat Gough-Irwin's family posted this Facebook tribute to the grandmother who died following a spider bite . Last night, hospital managers confirmed they were investigating whether the bite may have triggered her death. If proved, she will have been the first person to have died in Britain as a result of a spider bite. False widows – cousins of the infamous black widow spider – give very painful bites which often swell as the body tries to combat the venom. Some people have reported being left unconscious by the bites, but to date there have never been any confirmed deaths from them. About the size of a 10p piece, with a bulbous body and white markings, the false widow spider is now a fairly common sight in people’s homes, where it seeks refuge in autumn as the weather turns. Some false widows are native to Britain, but the most venomous, the noble false widow, was first imported in fruit crates from the Canary Islands more than a century ago. Since then, they have spread northwards from the South Coast. Mrs Gough-Irwin first went to her GP after being bitten in her home in Aldershot, Hampshire, a month ago. It is believed she was told that, although painful, the bite was highly unlikely to cause serious problems. Mrs Gough-Irwin was bitten on the tip of her finger by a false widow spider, pictured, a cousin of the venemous black widow spider . But rather than subsiding, the pain intensified, and she ended up being admitted to hospital. Last Saturday, Mrs Gough-Irwin had an operation to have the top of the bitten finger amputated. However, her condition went downhill until she was left ‘confused and hallucinating’, according to her family. One of Mrs Gough-Irwin’s four daughters, Julie Lungley, 43, said she had been left ‘numb and in total shock’ by her mother’s sudden death. Neighbours described Mrs Gough-Irwin as a friendly woman who helped out many people. One said: ‘I am devastated, gutted. She was genuine, warm and caring – and a good friend.’ Her death comes just weeks after The Mail on Sunday reported that one of the world’s deadliest spiders, a Brazilian Wanderer, was delivered hiding in a bunch of bananas to a South London home by Waitrose. After feeling unwell after being bitten, Mrs Gough-Irwin was admitted to the Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley, Surrey, pictured . Mrs Gough-Irwin’s family fear poor care at Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley, Surrey, might have contributed to her death. In a Facebook posting, Mrs Lungley, who runs a Church-based breakfast and after-school club for children in Farnborough, claimed ward staff ‘knew nothing’ about the bite. She alleged they had not read her mother’s GP notes in full, and wrote that she was ‘unhappy with the lack of care and attention’ given. The family will be meeting hospital managers this week to discuss the care Mrs Gough-Irwin received and the possibility that the bite may have played a part in her death. A hospital spokesman said she could not make any comment about Mrs Gough-Irwin’s death for reasons of patient confidentiality. But she added: ‘I can assure you that the case is being reviewed.’ Earlier this year the Mail on Sunday reported how a deadly spider was found in a bunch of bananas in a Waitrose delivery . Dr Tim Cockerill, presenter of the BBC’s Spider House, said the noble false widow was the most venomous of false widows but the zoologist said this spider’s bite was not in the same league as the black widow’s. Dr Cockerill said: ‘Its bite is about as bad as a bee sting. In the UK, several people die of bee stings every year because they have an allergic reaction. But most of the stories in the press show evidence of tissue damage or necrosis and there is nothing in the false widow spider’s venom that can do that. ‘When you see these cases of necrosis it’s almost certainly down to a bacterial infection or something like that.’ Dr Ron Daniels, a critical care consultant and chief executive of the charity Sepsis UK, said it was ‘entirely plausible’ that Mrs Gough-Irwin had developed a secondary infection as a result of the bite.","Pat Gough-Irwin was bitten on the tip of her finger by a false widow spider .

"Interview: Dame Sally Davies said she ate hash cakes at university and hallucinated . Earlier this week, England's top doctor called for a ban on smoking in parks - to set a better example for children. But yesterday, Dame Sally Davies spoke again about the time she ate hash cakes and hallucinated. The chief medical officer, who has previously admitted taking cannabis at university, blamed the bad experience which made her stop dabbling with the illegal drug on 'contaminants' in an interview. Her drug experience sparked guffaws from smokers' group Forest who accused her of double standards and derided her notion of adults as role models. Anti-drugs campaigners said her 'contamination' comment was 'dangerous', 'careless' and even 'nonsense'. They say the mind-altering chemical THC in cannabis is more likely to make users hallucinate - as 'contaminated' cannabis is practically unheard of. Recalling the 'three or four times' she ate hash cakes, Dame Sally, 64, said in the interview with The Times newspaper yesterday: 'The last time there were contaminants in it and I had hallucinations.' The Government's most senior medical adviser first revealed she had tried cannabis baked into cookies while studying medicine at Manchester University in the late 1960s and early 1970s on BBC Radio 3's Private Passions last year. On that occasion she said: 'I never smoked, so I couldn't smoke joints, but I did have some cookies until on the third or fourth occasion I had hallucinations and I have never touched it since. I think I understood through that what my father said to me when I told him I was going to try it. He said drugs de-civilise you, you stop being a civilised person.' The mystery 'contaminants' in her latest telling of the hash cake hallucinations incident has led to raised eyebrows among anti-drugs campaigners. Mary Brett, chairman of drugs prevention charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: 'It's a careless thing to say. It implies contaminants are responsible for the hallucinations when it is more likely THC was responsible. 'To toss it off as 'contaminants' is a throwaway remark that really could be quite dangerous. 'Cannabis is something that has never really been badly adulterated with anything else. I remember reading someone ground up glass and put it in cannabis a few years ago, but apart from that I have never read anything about it being contaminated. 'It sounds most unusual. Does she know what the contaminants were or who put them there? Did she eat a whole cookie instead of half this time? She needs to answer that.' A National Drugs Prevention Alliance spokesman: 'People take cannabis because cannabis effects the brain and quite a few people do have a bad experience as a result, either short term or long term. 'How could she know if it had contaminants in it? Did she have it analysed? The whole thing is a nonsense. We would expect rather more rational comments from the Chief Medical Officer.' In her wide-ranging Times interview, Dame Sally warned that since her student days 'cannabis has got much stronger and I worry about that. Cannabis used by people whose brains are still developing, adolescents, is not a good idea, particularly in high doses.' A National Drugs Prevention Alliance spokesman said 'People take cannabis because cannabis effects the brain and quite a few people do have a bad experience as a result, either short term or long term.' She also told how 'the things that damage our health - whether it's diet leading to obesity, smoking or addiction - are individual choices' and said: 'I think it's very important we don't sidestep that by becoming a nanny state.' Earlier this week she backed a plan for smoking to be outlawed in public parks in London, saying: 'We all know smoking is bad for health. So I welcome any measures to reduce both active smoking and its role-modelling in front of children.' Campaigners have denounced the plan as an attack on civil liberties. Yesterday Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said: 'She was happy to eat hash cakes when she was young. Now she wants to stop people smoking a legal product in the open air where there is no risk to anyone other than themselves. 'The idea that adults have to be role models for the next generation is ridiculous. Let today's youth find their own way, just as Dame Sally did when she was young. Educate but don't over-regulate. 'Unfortunately today's public health industry is driven by control freaks like Dame Sally who want to micro-manage our lives in a way they would never have accepted when they were young.' The dangers of long-term cannabis use, including mental health problems, were recently laid bare in a 20-year study by Professor Wayne Hall, a drugs advisor to the World Health Organisation. He found cannabis doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia.","England's top doctor blames bad experience on 'contaminants' in the drug .

"Lord Kinnock warns the party is committing 'political suicide' by questioning Miliband's leadership . Labour is committing ‘political suicide’ by questioning Ed Miliband’s leadership, the party’s former leader Lord Kinnock warned last night. The peer, a mentor of Mr Miliband, emerged to spearhead an effort to shore him up as allies issued an extraordinary ‘put up or shut up’ challenge to MPs undermining his position. Mr Miliband’s new election campaign chief, Lucy Powell, admitted that briefing against him was leading to concern among voters ‘about whether he’s got the leadership qualities to lead his own party, let alone the country’. Speaking on BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics, she said of the plotters: ‘They need to decide what their plan is, and get on with it, either way. Show your colours.’ Labour endured claims yesterday that 20 shadow ministers will call for Mr Miliband to stand down if former home secretary Alan Johnson agrees to take over, and a poll showing his support among the party’s own voters is at an all-time low. Only 34 per cent of the ‘core vote’ which backed Labour under Gordon Brown in 2010 say Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister. Mr Johnson said yesterday: ‘I am very supportive of Ed and I think he is doing a good job. But even if I didn’t, anyone who thinks that having a regicide six months before a General Election of your leader who is neck-and-neck in the polls and has the prospect of winning the election after one term in opposition, which has only happened once in 80 years, should get a grip.’ Critics privately suggest Mr Miliband has just weeks to save his job and a poor showing in the Rochester by-election on November 20 – a seat Labour held until 2010 on slightly different boundaries, but now looks set to finish third behind Ukip and the Conservatives – could tip him over the edge. Former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said yesterday Mr Miliband ‘should go’ and would be removed by the end of the week if ‘one MP with the guts’ told him to quit, while Mr Brown’s former spin doctor, Damian McBride, added: ‘If anyone was prepared to come forward now and actually do a formal challenge, I think the Miliband camp would fold very quickly.’ Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, named last week in Westminster as one of those pushing for Mr Miliband’s removal, said: ‘The numbers show us that he is not popular with the electorate and that’s the reality of it. ‘So, what we need to do is to spread the load amongst the Shadow Cabinet and push some of them to the fore. Let’s not believe that more Ed, as I have heard said, is the way to win in the General Election in 2015.’ Asked if Mr Miliband ‘has what it takes’, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, who backed Mr Miliband’s brother David for the party leadership, replied: ‘I think he does but he needs to show it. People want leadership.’ Scroll down for video . Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, right, said Mr Miliband, left, needs to show he has what it takes to lead . Mr Darling also criticised Mr Miliband’s mansion tax proposal, saying: ‘I suppose as a former Chancellor, I am not a big fan of new taxes.’ In addition, the Tories claimed that Mr Miliband’s 2013 announcement on an energy bill freeze could end up increasing family bills because some firms have already frozen prices until 2017 – despite the fact that wholesale prices are falling. Not one member of the Shadow Cabinet was prepared to appear on Sky News’s flagship political programme to defend Ed Miliband’s leadership, the channel claimed yesterday. The Murnaghan programme said it had asked all of the Labour leader’s top team to appear, but was turned down. Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, Damian McBride, said: ‘It’s extraordinary that no member of the Shadow Cabinet is prepared to come out today to speak for Ed.’ Energy spokesman Caroline Flint later appeared on broadcast media later to discuss the issue. Shadow Cabinet minister Caroline Flint backed Mr Miliband but admitted some of her colleagues were having ‘jitters’. Education spokesman Tristram Hunt, a darling of Labour’s Blairite rump, dismissed claims he had described Mr Miliband’s strategy for winning the election as a ‘total failure’ as ‘nonsense’. Otherwise, there was an ominous silence from the senior figures in the Shadow Cabinet. The job of leading the fightback was left to Lord Kinnock, still a toxic figure for many voters in Middle England, and former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who insisted Mr Miliband would become ‘the most significant Prime Minister since Margaret Thatcher’. He added: ‘My one criticism of Ed Miliband: he was far too nice to all the old Blairites that he kept on and they’re now stabbing him in the back. They’re complaining because Miliband’s moving us back to being a proper Labour Party.’ Lord Kinnock, putting on a bizarre Indian accent, quoted his newsagent as having said to him of the plotters: ‘What are all these crazy people doing to our party?’ He told BBC Radio that the threat to Mr Miliband’s leadership was ‘not substantial’ but was causing ‘a degree of damage’. ‘As far as I can see, their tendency is towards political suicide,’ he said. ‘There’s no real substance in what they are saying. And the claims that they’re making, so far as you can identify them, are totally unjustifiable. Because after four years, Ed Miliband is a leader of proven courage, high intelligence, he’s got a great quality of leadership, of great leadership, which is being resilient, calm and defiant.’ Lord Kinnock admitted Mr Miliband was portrayed as ‘remote, cerebral, weird if you like’ but this was ‘in total contrast with the man he really is’. A source close to Mr Miliband said: ‘Given the relentless barrage Ed has had over the last two or three weeks, it’s not particularly surprising that his personal ratings are down. The truth is that despite a relentless hammering, we are still, on average, ahead in the polls and we are the only party that can reasonably expect to win a majority.’ Of the claim in the Labour-supporting Observer newspaper that 20 shadow ministers had turned against the leader, the source added: ‘I not only fail to recognise it, I specifically deny it.’","Ex-Labour leader rushes to Miliband's defence amid mounting crisis .

"Home again: Jeremy Clarkson after landing at Heathrow . Jeremy Clarkson said yesterday that ‘lives were at stake’ during his escape from Argentina. He and fellow Top Gear presenters Richard Hammond and James May had to hide under beds as an angry mob searched their hotel, he said. Now safely back in the UK, the motormouth TV host reverted to his trademark style, finding a tactless comment or two irresistible. He said the ‘silver lining’ to the ordeal was that it gave the show’s Christmas special a better ending than they had planned. Clarkson also said he would have chosen ‘W3 WON’ as his number plate ‘if I’d been trying to ruffle feathers’. The trouble was started by a car number plate, H982 FKL, which sparked fury among locals and war veterans who claimed it referred to the 1982 Falklands conflict. Yesterday Clarkson, 54, said the Porsche he drove during the special edition of the BBC motoring show arrived in Argentina with the H982 FKL plates, but they were removed two days later after a Twitter user pointed out the problem. By the time the stars reached Tierra del Fuego, south Argentina, the car ‘had no plate at all on the front and a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers on the back,’ he wrote in The Sunday Times. 'And no, it wasn’t W3 WON. Which it would have been if I’d been trying to ruffle feathers’. He added: ‘The number plate then wasn’t the issue, but something was causing more and more people to arrive at the hotel. Twitter was rammed with messages from locals saying they wanted blood. One said they were going to barbecue us and eat the meat.’ Clarkson said he, Hammond and May ‘hid under the beds in a researcher’s room while protesters went through the hotel looking for us’. Government officials told the Top Gear crew they were no longer welcome and that their safety ‘could not be guaranteed’. Yesterday Clarkson accused the government of allowing the visit simply to ‘make political capital from ejecting us when we arrived’. Controversy: The number plate that caused offence and led to a violent reaction from Argentinians . Backlash: The Top Gear team's cars were attacked, including James May's red lotus, above . The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said. The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991. FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent. The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA. Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner. It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80. Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred. Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. Filming took place near Ushuaia port from which the General Belgrano sailed before it was sunk by a British submarine. There were questions about the attack’s legitimacy as the Argentine ship was outside the exclusion zone. Clarkson said the team knew anti-British feelings were still strong there so ‘were on our best behaviour’. But they faced ‘mobs with pickaxe handles, paving stones and bricks’. He, Hammond, and May and the women in the team flew to Buenos Aires, thinking the stars’ absence would calm things. But it did not and the remaining 29 crew members had to escape to Chile by car, including the Porsche. Bricks were thrown at the vehicles and two people were cut by flying glass. Word spread that an ambush was awaiting them. Clarkson said: ‘The nine of us who had escaped were … working through the night to find a plane and an airfield from which they could get out because, make no mistake, lives were at stake.’ The crew abandoned the cars and, ‘chased by the thugs’, fled to a remote border crossing into Chile. Argentine papers said Clarkson’s comments, blaming the government for the attack, were ‘a new provocation’.","Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear crew hounded out of Argentina by a mob .

"It is a problem common to Sunday League football pitches up and down the country. But for one player in a Christian league, his objection to dog dirt on the turf forced him to take an early bath. Lance Perry was given his marching orders while representing Rowley College in the West Midlands Christian Football League after warning his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch. The Christian league has a zero tolerance policy on swearing, so the referee brandished a red card and sent Perry from the field. A footballer in a Christian league was sent off after he warned his team mates about 'dog s***' on the pitch . The player's well-intentioned warning came in a bottom of the table clash against St Thomas Aldridge and the referee's actions took both sets of players by surprise. Rowley boss Pete Bennett said: 'The league does have a zero policy to foul language and referees can sometimes interpret that rather crazily. 'We couldn't believe it when the red card came out. He protested as far as he could.' Birmingham County FA has now wiped the record clean and dropped a one-match ban after being informed the expletive was not a critique of the referee. Disciplinary boss Mike Fellows said: 'We have looked at the words used, and the way they were used. 'Obviously if the response had followed a question about how the ref was performing, the red card would have stayed. 'Actually, s**t is in the Oxford English Dictionary. Clearly in this case the word was not used as a term of abuse. 'However fully support the stance of the West Midlands Christian Football League in their zero tolerance to foul and abusive language. 'A considerable amount of their teams play in public parks. For users of these park and their families, it's the last thing they would want to hear.' The player raised a problem common to many Sunday League teams, but his language earned him an early bath (stock image) Despite Perry's absence, Rowley College (who play in black and red stripes) romped to a 5-1 win, which leaves them three off the bottom of the division. Boss Bennett added: 'Thankfully common sense has prevailed. In fairness, the league has been very good.' The West Midlands Christian Football League was formed in 1979 and features both Christian and non-Christian players. Its mission statement says it exists to allow men to play in a league 'that is morally, decently and ethically sound of action and speech, and is honouring to the name of Jesus Christ.'","Lance Perry sent off while playing in the West Midlands Christian League .

"It is fondly remembered as the most moving moment in the First World War - a momentary pause from the bloodshed, fighting and senseless deaths. And now, the Christmas truce in the trenches has been re-created in a video game for the first time. The online game, Verdun, set in the First World War, will give players the chance to stage a Christmas truce by playing football and singing carols instead of the customary shooting. Scroll down for video . The online video game, Verdun, gives players the chance to re-create the famous Christmas truce of 1914 . Players can take a break from the usual shooting on the First World War game and enjoy the ceasefire . The game re-creates the truce of 1914 where soldiers from both sides enjoyed a temporary ceasefire . It offers gamers the opportunity to play football with friends online, make fires and throw snowballs . The video 'Celebrate Christmas in Verdun' shows players exchanging Christmas greetings and singing. It even offers the opportunity to play football with friends online, simulating the real matches that broke out at Christmas in the trenches, and throw snowballs. Fighting will still be possible, as normal, but the developers have created sections of the game that players can go in to and enjoy the brief peace if they wish. There will be competitions to help keep the event festive — including prizes for the best video of the event or screenshots. The Christmas Truce was a series of widespread, unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front in Flanders Fields around Christmas 1914. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, many soldiers from both sides independently ventured into no man's land, where they tentatively socialised to host joint burial ceremonies, several meetings and carol-singing. Troops from both sides were also friendly enough to play games of football with one another, in one of the truce's most enduring images. The Christmas truce of 1914 is one of the most enduring images of the bloody First World War . The game is based on the battle of Verdun in 1916, which was one of the costliest battles of World War One . In the game, players have the chance to enjoy the brief moment of peace amid the bloodshed and fighting . Verdun is a multi-player game, inspired by the infamous battle of Verdun in 1916, in north-east France. Verdun was one of the costliest battles of the First World War and exemplified the 'war of attrition' policy pursued by both sides, which led to an enormous loss of life. The battle, which lasted from 21 February 1916 until 19 December 1916, led to more than 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). The Germans staged the attack in the hope of 'bleeding' the French army to death and then targeting the British alone on the Western Front, which could be brought down by Germany's submarine blockade. Although the Germans made initial gains and caught the French unprepared, the French fought back which resulted in a bloody stalemate where neither side could claim victory. Away from the gaming world, German and English graffiti artists have come together to create street art murals commemorating the 1914 Christmas truce in Shoreditch, East London.","World War One video game allows players to re-enact the Christmas truce .

The former football star has rarely been seen in public since his hospitalisation during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox, but is now said to have taken up a healthy diet and exercise regime. Last month, he admitted that ‘the only person who can save me is me’, and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him. The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge. During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day. Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly. Since returning to his home in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted during his outing to the off licence.

"When Nasrin Hamalaw's 30-year-old daughter Rangin was killed fighting Islamic State jihadis near Kirkuk in Iraq, she was left heartbroken. Now Ms Hamalaw, 55, a veteran of battles against a vengeful Saddam Hussein during the 1970s, plans to take revenge - by returning to the front line to massacre the terrorists herself.

'I'm proud of every single thing she ever did and I have so many good memories of her,' adds her sobbing mother. 'She never did anything that I couldn't be proud of. To me, she's not a martyr. She's alive and she's going to stay with me for ever.' Devastated: Mr Majid shows off a badge emblazoned with a photo of the daughter of whom he was 'so proud' Vengeance: Ms Hamelaw, a veteran fighter, has vowed to return to the frontline to get her revenge on IS . Talented: According to her parents, Ms Yousef was enormously talented and wanted to become a politician . Proud: Mr Majid says he taught his daughter to fight for her country's freedom from an early age . Rangin, the first woman from the Iraqi-Kurdish peshmerga to be killed, died after a mortar exploded near her position during heavy fighting, leaving her body riddled with shrapnel. Her mother was fighting alongside her at the time. 'I started teaching her to shoot when she was 11,' she smiles through her tears. 'She learned with me, her mother. And when she was killed, she was with me, her mother, as well. We were on the front line and they were shooting at us.' Mr Majid, also a veteran fighter, was with his battalion further down the front line when news of his daughter's death arrived. 'The day my daughter was injured, my wife was there with her on the front line,' he remembers. 'I was further down in a place called Zirka, which is also on the front line. I got a message to say that my daughter had been injured.' Critically wounded, Rangin died 10 days later in hospital. Now her parents are returning to the front line - and have vowed to kill as many IS jihadis as they can before they are killed themselves. 'From the day of the first IS attack, we knew about the possibility that we might have to die for our country,' explains Mr Majid. 'That is why we chose to be peshmerga. The word peshmerga means ""face of death"". Being a peshmerga means you have to face up to death. That is why we chose to be peshmerga. 'We want to get freedom for our own country. If we hadn't chosen that, my daughter wouldn't have been killed. But it is what is right.' Women have long fought as frontline troops with the peshmerga which was, until recently, one of the few military organisations to allow it. In Britain, men were, until earlier this year, the only ones allowed frontline combat roles although women can and do play an important part in all three services. Despite the loss of his daughter, Mr Majid says the peshmerga's stance on female fighters is the correct one. 'I believe in equality from day one,' he explains. 'I don't see any difference between men and women on the frontline. I respected my daughter's ability. Hard work: Ms Yousef, far right, had recently been promoted to captain thanks to her exceptional fighting skills . Sad: Ms Yousef's commander, Colonel Nahida Ahmad Rashid, says she is heartbroken at the loss of her friend . 'When we trained together, they asked us to  hit targets [in a firing range]. I couldn't do it but my daughter hit it every time. 'Always, there has been equality between us. Any woman can be as good with weapons as a man. My daughter could have been any Kurdish person's daughter.' The peshmerga, who are being supported from the air by British planes, have enjoyed some success in recent weeks and are pushing the jihadists back towards Mosul. A small, all-male, detachment have also travelled to Turkey to join the fight against IS in Kobani, the Syrian border town that has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days. Nevertheless, the fighting in northern Iraq remains intense, with Ms Hamalaw saying that the former Ba'ath party men who have flocked to join IS in the north are making the situation ever more dangerous. 'The IS people are all ex Ba'thist guys,' she sniffs scornfully. 'The governor of Mosul is Saddam Hussein's nephew. Most of them are Ba'athists.' Tough: The peshmerga has long put its female fighters in frontline combat roles, including against IS . Dangerous job: After months of heavy fighting, the peshmerga have begun to push IS back towards Mosul . Despite the couple's defiance, they admit that they have been left heartbroken by the death of their daughter and say the only thing left for them to do is avenge her death. 'I taught her from childhood to take care of Kurdistan and work for independence,' adds her father. 'Her whole family have been revolutionaries and my grandfather, my brother, my uncle and my cousins were all killed fighting for our country. 'I didn't teach her any other thing - only that. She died for freedom and independence.' But, he adds, the current battle is not about politics. Instead, it's about ending the scourge of IS. 'We have no ideology,' he says. 'We just want to fight the terrorists. We fight to finish the terror.' And if that means risking death, then, says Ms Hamalaw, so be it. 'From the day we become peshmerga, we put our souls in our hands,' she explains. 'Any day, our souls can, like a bird, fly away. We are the face of death -  we are peshmerga. We go to fight, we go to fight IS. 'Of course you might get killed. Of course you will kill someone else. That is how it is.' Of their daughter, whose soul has already flown, they have only memories. 'She wanted to be a politician,' smiles her father sadly. 'She was a candidate for mayor as well but her life has been snuffed out. She's gone.'","Rangin Yusuf, 30, was killed during heavy fighting in Khurmatu last week .

"Two female police officers have been assaulted and four teenagers were arrested after an angry mob of teens turned on police following a wild house party. The police helicopter, Polair 2, and 21 crews were called out to the party after the teens became violent, hurling bottles at police officers. Several complaints had been made by the public about the behaviour of guests at the residence in Redbank Plains, west of Brisbane’s CBD,prompting police to visit the scene shortly after 11pm on Boxing Day. Scroll down for video . Four teens are taken into custody by police when an out of control party became violent . Upon arrival, police issued an ‘out of control event’ direction and teens, some as young as 14, spilled out of the house onto the road. The 120-person strong crowd soon became aggressive, throwing bottles at police and assaulting two female officers. However, the officers did not sustain any physical injuries. Four people, aged 14 to 17 years, were transported to the Ipswich watch house and charged with various offences such as public nuisance and assault or obstruct police. A further three teenagers were issued with infringement notices for public nuisance. Investigations are continuing and Queensland Police urge members of the public to share any information through an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers.

"Weathered and war-weary, these are the Dad's Army warriors fighting to free a country for which many have fought before. They are the  Kurdish volunteers on the battlefield of Iraq's bloody war against the  Islamic State jihadis ravaging their homeland. And while many look like they'd better belong in line for a free bus pass than on the frontline, their advancing years belie their bravery. Scroll down for video . The group of Kurdish volunteers pose with their rusty AK47s  from previous wars in handed-down uniforms . I meet them in the Iraqi town of Taza Kharmatho, just south of Kirkuk city, where war is raging. Dressed proudly in handed-down uniforms, they yield weapons leftover from bygone wars, including AK47s dating from the 1960s. One day, alongside a tank, Russian grenade launcher and a handful of machine guns, these were all they had to fight with. By contrast, the ISIS fighters are armed  with state-of-the-art weaponry stolen from the Iraqi army or seized from wayward U.S. airdrops meant for Peshmerga Kurds. Where these seasoned soldiers negotiate the muddy roads (we saw heavy rain for five days here) in four-wheel-drives, ISIS have hummers. Nevertheless, they have no choice but to fight with what they have - despite hollow promises from the U.S. and Europe to arm them adequately. One, who did not want to give his name but has returned to Iraq from London where he has lived for many years, told me his AK47 is indeed from the 1960s. 'My weapon is an AK47 that I saved up my own money for and bought on the black market to fight ISIS to save my country,' he tells me proudly, holding his rattling rifle with both hands. General Jamal is among the men lost one of their eyes during the Persin Gulf War. Undeterred by the bloody conflict in the 80s, he has taken up arms to defend his native Iraq . The group's repertoire of weapons include rusty AK47s from the 1960s including this one, bought by a fighter on the black market . Dressed proudly in handed down uniforms from by-gone wars, the fighters said they desperately need modern guns in order to go up against ISIS jihadis . Many of the men are grandfathers determined not to stand idly by as their country is ravaged by terrorists . 'Of course we want better guns but we have no choice. 'Yes, we desperately need modern guns, any type would be better than this. It's no different to you using needing a new car, PC or laptop. 'Technology has changed so we have to be like all other countries that have proper armies with everything new and modern weapons.' He is very clear as to where the new weapons should come from. 'They should come from the countries that created this situation; the countries that brought their armies to Iraq then left. 'But if any countries will send us weapons it would be greatly appreciated.' On the resources held by ISIS, he says: 'They have good weapons from the United States as well as all the weapons which Nouri al-Maliki gave them. 'Their weapons are much stronger than ours - there is such a huge difference ... but we can still beat them.' Many of the men bare  scars of  the bloody First Persian Gulf War of the mid-1980s, when they fought with Iran against forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. Some  left after that war, emigrating to Europe in search of a better life for their families. But amid a new threat to their homeland, they have returned in their droves to fight. One of the men stands proudly on the Taza frontline dressed in a US Army hand-down uniform . Wearing sweaters, shirts and lace-up shoes, the unlikely army has managed to fend off advances from ISIS on some of the region's roads . In makeshift accommodation near the frontline the men gear up for another day of fighting in mismatching uniforms . The men stand in makeshift uniforms looking out across the Taza frontline with their rusty weapons by their side . Despite their advancing age and rusty resources, the small army of vigilantes has been able to defeat ISIS in small victories, such as taking back control of a seized road . A rusty grenade and a water pouch rest on a man's belt made from a scarf, his rifle tucked under his arm . An elderly fighter rests his gun on a make-shift look out point in the desert in Taza, Iraq, where ISIS have been storming towns and ravaging villages . Many of the men fled the Middle East in the 1980s for Europe in search of a better life for their families but have returned amid the threat of ISIS . Cleaning their rusty rifles, two Kurdish fighters sit cross-legged on the Taza front preparing for yet more conflict . Many of the men bear scars from the Persian Gulf War in which they fought alongside Iran against forces loyal to Saddam Hussein . While older fighters lead the dysfunctional army, youngsters have followed by example, many wishing to be like their fathers and grandfathers as men . Most of the weapons used by the group have been bought on the black market collected from previous wars . A few machine guns lined up to overlook the Taza front are among the group's only weaponry . The group prepares a meal together in their accommodation on the Taza frontline still dressed in their uniforms . Bulletproof vests are among the rare items which resemble modern army uniforms worn by the group . With their weapons cast off nearby the men pray behind closed doors before re-entering the frontline. Right, a fighter climbs atop their only tank . I am shocked at how many of the men have only one eye - the others, many tell me,  were blown from their sockets by malfunctioning, poorly-made mortar's of that First Persian Gulf War. Some tell me I am the only journalist they have seen here in months. Others say I am the first one they have ever seen. Last week, they lost the road to ISIS Chechens, but retook it a few days later, killing three enemy fighters. Moving about is difficult here too. The roads are littered with hidden mines, left by retreating ISIS fighters who are paying local farmers to booby-trap their land. Yet this is a position of key strategic significance; just 500 metres to the south, I can see ISIS flags with my bare eyes. Some of the group haven't seen a journalist in the area for months, while others claim none have been at all . With the Kurdish flag flying proudly the men lookout from their position atop a hill in Taza Kharmatho . While ISIS operates in hummers, the small group have no choice but to navigate the treacherous roads in 4x4s . A young boy stands on the army's only tank behind a wall of dirt and dust on the frontline . Soldering on: One of the men poses with a youngster proudly toting a gun. Despite their poor resources and ill-fitting uniforms, the army is made up of the bravest fighters seen for miles . Hope: A Kurdish flag waves from the back of one of the group's few vehicles despite the region's roads being compromised by ISIS fighters . I don't even need binoculars to see smoke rising from their kitchens or the black shapes of men running from house to house. The Kurds however are not frightened by such proximity.  For them death is part of their natural fate. They accept it will happen to them sooner or later - if not tomorrow then next week, next year or in a decade's time. When it was time for me to go back in Erbil, the Kurdish capital in Northern Iraq, they drove me along one of the most dangerous roads in the area after hearing the usual route was cut off. Even if they look like an army from another century, they are some of the bravest men I have ever met; they will defend their country to the end.","The veterans have taken up arms in Iraqi towns threatened by ISIS .

"A driver who whizzed across 26 miles of New York City in 24 minutes was convicted on Thursday of reckless endangerment for a stunt trumpeted in dashboard-camera video posted online. Now he's fled the country and is staying in Canada. Adam Tang wasn't in court to hear the verdict, and it wasn't clear at first where he was instead: The Canadian citizen was deemed a fugitive after failing to show up for court on Wednesday. Prosecutors portrayed Tang, 31, as a dangerous daredevil who put lives at risk by circling Manhattan in a BMW Z4 convertible at an average of 69 mph, sometimes hitting nearly 100 mph, and flaunted it in a YouTube video that has drawn more than 875,000 views. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Convicted and in Canada: Convicted driver Adam Tang aka Afroduck who lapped Manhattan in 24 MINUTES has fled to country and is living in Canada . Need for speed: Adam Tang, seen here at his 2013 arrest, is allegedly Afroduck--the YouTube user who recorded and uploaded his reckless and record-breaking 24-minute race around the island of Manhattan . 'The city's roadways are not a racetrack,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. But defense lawyer Gregory Gomez suggested that while Tang might have pushed the envelope on traffic regulations, he didn't commit a crime, reports NBC. Gomez said Thursday he respected the verdict and would focus now on getting Tang to court, arguing for 'an appropriate sentence' and determining whether to appeal. Tang faces up to a year in jail for his misdemeanor conviction. His sentencing is set for Dec. 8. Tang — known to the YouTube world as 'AfroDuck' — was arrested in September 2013, after the video appeared and police traced him through his computer's Internet address. 'I am a car fanatic,' Tang told officers when they arrived, according to a prosecution court filing. The stock trader said he'd wanted to break unofficial speed records for looping Manhattan, but he insisted he didn't do it recklessly, the document said. 'I put a lot of esteem into driving and being a conscious and aware driver,' he said. The nighttime footage captured a car zooming along highways and streets that ring Manhattan, weaving around other cars as brake lights flash at its approach, but also stopping for six red lights. In March, Tang rejected a plea offer that would have entailed two months in jail. His lawyer said then that Tang, married to an American woman, wanted to avoid any criminal record because of possible immigration complications. Tang was arrested again in April, after police said they found him driving in the Bronx although his license had been suspended because of his earlier arrest. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving, a traffic infraction, and paid a fine, Gomez said then. The ride: Prosecutors portrayed Tang, 31, as a dangerous daredevil who put lives at risk by circling Manhattan in a BMW Z4 convertible at an average of 69 mph .

"North Korean students will take part in a media studies course funded by taxpayers, amid fears they could just learn how to pedal propaganda about Kim Jong-un because the regime controls the media. More than 40 students from North Korea will take part in a media course in the UK, funded by British taxpayers. The course, which has been organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, aims to show students how British media works as well as teach them how to build websites. But there are fears the training will merely give the 46 students the means to pedal propaganda for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, because the media is notoriously tightly controlled in the country. Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, has accused the foreign office of 'investing in people who are official mouthpieces of the regime,' the Sunday Express reported. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has confirmed it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.' There are claims it could cost £70,000. But the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country. In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.' She added: 'The project aims to expose participants to the UK media, instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources.' The students took part in a pilot workshop in Pyongyang in October. The study tour to the UK will take place in early 2015. Scroll down for video . North Korea has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world, precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country. Journalists have to be a member of the Workers' Party and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds. There is just one agency service for the country. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'The UK has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in North Korea. Last month, the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the United Nations. News of the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il took two days to be released because of the tight controls on the media in the country that sees what can be reported as restricted by the regime . The Foreign Office confirmed it would be funding the media training for the 47 students from North Korea . 'This project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the DPRK. It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.' A United Nations report earlier this year found that North Koreans are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology. It said: 'There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.' The report said that propaganda is used by the State to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished, with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the 'ultimate' punishments. An example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when Kim Jong-il died in 2011, but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released. North Korea is one of the most controlling media environments in the world. All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored. There is just one news agency, the North Korean Central News Agency, that operates throughout the country. Internet access is poor, with many north Koreans only able to access a form of an intranet. But mobile phones have appeared after a ban was lifted in 2008. Radios and televisions supplied to North Koreans come pre-tuned to Government-controlled stations such as Korean Central Television. Since Kim Jong-un took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country. This has included an interview Dennis Rodman gave to CNN after travelling to the country earlier this year, following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong-un. But a lot of the news coming from north Korea has been seen as being staged and managed, merely to just imply access has improved. North Korea also allowed American prisoners to be interviewed by the news channel, but the process again seemed controlled as the prisoners appeared to have been coached about what to say as they asked American officials for help. A photo released by North Korean Central News Agency shows Kim Jong-un at military training . Before the death of Kim Jong-il residents were bombarded with positive news about the former leader, such as his visits to industrial projects. Information about the country's economic difficulties of famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences. In 2013 some controls were relaxed as visitors were allowed to bring their mobile phones into the country. However calls between locals and foreigners are still prohibited. A black market, reportedly at the border with China, appears to be in operation and enables North Koreans to watch some South Korean shows.","North Korean students to take part in course to learn about British media .

"Support for Ed Miliband is plummeting even among his party's supporters, an opinion poll reveals. YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago. The poll – for The Sunday Times – found that 42 per cent no longer think he could do the job at all, against 28 per cent last month. Ed Miliband, pictured at the Cenotaph yesterday, has come under growing pressure to improve his personal ratings six months before the general election . The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader. Labour are also now behind the Conservatives when Ed Miliband's name is mentioned to voters – but would move back into the lead under either former home secretary Alan Johnson or David Miliband, the poll revealed. The two main parties both recorded 33 per cent support, with Ukip on 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 7 per cent. But when Ed Miliband's name was mentioned in association with Labour, the Tories took a two-point lead, on 33 per cent to 31. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock last night warned the party is committing ‘political suicide’ by questioning Mr Miliband’s leadership. Lord Kinnock, putting on a bizarre Indian accent, quoted his newsagent as having said to him of the plotters: ‘What are all these crazy people doing to our party?’ He told BBC Radio that the threat to Mr Miliband’s leadership was ‘not substantial’ but was causing ‘a degree of damage’. ‘As far as I can see, their tendency is towards political suicide,’ he said. ‘There’s no real substance in what they are saying. And the claims that they’re making, so far as you can identify them, are totally unjustifiable. 'Because after four years, Ed Miliband is a leader of proven courage, high intelligence, he’s got a great quality of leadership, of great leadership, which is being resilient, calm and defiant.’ Lord Kinnock admitted Mr Miliband was portrayed as ‘remote, cerebral, weird if you like’ but this was ‘in total contrast with the man he really is’. Ex-leader Neil Kinnock warned ousting Mr Miliband would be 'suicide' but shadow cabinet minister Caroline Flint admitted some of her colleagues have 'jitters' about the leadership . If Mr Miliband's brother David returned to the Commons and became Labour leader, the YouGov poll suggested the party would have a six-point lead over the Tories. But neither Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper nor her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, would do anything to improve Labour's prospects as leader, it found. Of all voters, only 7 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband has been a strong leader, with 59 per cent viewing him as weak. A separate poll, by Survation for The Mail on Sunday, showed that if Mr Miliband were replaced by Mr Johnson or suave business spokesman Chuka Umunna, Labour's four-point lead over the Tories would double. That extra support could gain Labour an extra 50 seats, pollsters say. When asked to choose between Mr Miliband, Mr Umunna, Miss Cooper, Mr Balls or Mr Johnson in 15 categories, Mr Miliband came last in eight of them. Mr Johnson won six categories and Mr Umunna five. Today Mr Umunna leapt to his leader's defence, insisting general election victory in May was still possible. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna insisted election victory was within touching distance for Labour . He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'You get noises every now and then, but on the whole, these are anonymous and off-the-record. 'If you speak to the overwhelming majority of our MPs, of our supporters, people recognise this is going to be a tough for election but are absolutely up for it. I . 'f we look at our progress, during this parliament, there's been a lot of talk about polls. Those go up and down, but under Ed's leadership we are now in touching distance of a general election victory.' Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint insisted those calling for Mr Miliband to quit were 'a few' against the 'many' who want him to stay. She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'These things happen, they are a few voices against the many in our party who are very focused on winning the election under his leadership. 'I think Ed is very focused on what we need to do to win. He focuses on what he has to do for the British people.' Mr Miliband's critics in the Labour party were urged to put up or shut up yesterday in a high risk attempt to end the plotting against him. Lucy Powell, the Labour leader's new general election enforcer, ordered plotters to 'show us your colours' or move on, as it emerged one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbench team is ready to call on him to go. The Labour leadership has sought to play down the threat to Mr Miliband, publicly blaming the media for fuelling attacks on him in retaliation for his calls for press regulation. But after a terrible party conference speech, in which he forgot the deficit, a series of botched photo opportunities and the erosion of Labour's poll lead over the Tories, behind the scenes there is a growing sense of dismay about the prospect of Mr Miliband leading the party to defeat. Ms Powell, who Mr Miliband made vice-chairman of the general election campaign in the reshuffle earlier this week, issued a direct challenge to his opponents in the Labour ranks to end the anonymous briefings. She told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live: 'Well what I would say to those people is be careful what you wish for because if your analysis is right, that there are people that are concerned about Ed but yet don't want a leadership contest then what they are doing in briefing anonymously and, in my view, cowardly briefing newspapers, they are bringing about the worst of all worlds. They need to decide what their plan is and get on with it either way.' She added: 'Either show us your colours and put names to quotes or let's just move on and have a different conversation.'","Support for Ed Miliband is plummeting even among his party's supporters .

He then carefully snipped the red and yellow foam and secured the shapes together to form a helmet using hot glue in a workshop at his Burlington home. The devoted father, who works at Triad Stage, later placed the finished creation on Collier's head as he lay in his mother's arms in intensive care on October 31.

"A tenant who signed a lease to pay $10 a month for 50 years for a New York City apartment is being taken to court. Jud Parker, 47, signed the deal for the West Village 1,400-square-foot duplex, which has two bedrooms and a back yard, in 2009. But the new landlord Pari Dulac claims the elderly owner Wilfred Schuman had dementia when it was allegedly signed and has an affidavit from Schuman's brother who agrees his brother suffered from the condition. A tenant who signed a lease to pay $10 a month for 50 years for a New York City apartment (pictured) is being taken to court . Schuman, who died in 2010 in his seventies, had owned a pair of three-story town houses on a West Village street - he lived in the basement of one of them, reports the New York Post. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court last week Dulac claims Parker fooled Schuman and then subletted the apartment for $2,500 a month after his death. But Parker, who grew up on the same street where Schuman lived, insists the lease was a 'gift' before he looked after Schuman. Jud Parker signed the deal for a West Village ­for the 1,400-square-foot duplex, which has two bedrooms and a back yard, in 2009. But the new landlord Pari Dulac (pictured) claims the old owner had dementia when it was allegedly signed . '[Dulac] wants me out because she's greedy,' he added. Dulac bought the the buildings from Schuman's estate this month for $2.75 million - she believes the apartment could be rented for $6,000 a month. The suit claims Parker manipulated Schuman into signing the lease or forged his signature and alleges in the years leading up to his death Schuman was treated for alcoholism, dementia and bleeding of the brain after a fall. David Burnett, who lived above Schuman, and collected the rent on his behalf, said he had only seen Parker twice in 20 years except for a three-week period in 2009 when he visited more frequently. Laurie Dowdeswell, who lived in the same townhouse, said Parker asked for Schuman in August 2010 and unaware that he had died, according to the lawsuit. According to the suit, Parker then showed her the lease claimed it was his apartment before allegedly demanding that she sublet for $1,500 a month or vacate the apartment - her rent increased to $2,500 two years later. 'This lease is outrageous and unconscionable,' said Dulac's ­attorney Steven Sladkus.","Jud Parker signed the deal for a West Village ­for the 1,400-square-foot duplex, which has two bedrooms and a back yard, in 2009 .

"Christmas chocolate, sweets and biscuit boxes are getting smaller as the prices stay the same, but at least those considering a New Year diet will have fewer pounds to shift. Researchers have found that cartons of festive treats have shrunk by as much as 14.8 percent in the last year, while shoppers are still paying the same amount for their favourite snacks. Manufacturers say rising costs of ingredients and even a lighter sort of chocolate are behind the shrinking boxes, as well as pressure from health chiefs to reduce the sugar and calorie content in their products. Shrinking: Boxes of Maynards Wine Gums (left) and Bassetts Jelly Babies (right) are among the Christmas treats that are getting smaller, with the weight of a £4 box falling from 540 to 460g . According to research by the Sunday Mirror, the weight of a £4 box of family favourites Maynards Wine Gums and Bassetts Jelly Babies have plummeted from 540g to 460g. The Fabulously Fox's Biscuit Selection, which costs £6, is now 50g lighter at 600g, and the £5 Cadbury Biscuit Collection has dropped from 380g to 335g. And chocolate lovers will find there is less to go around with £6 boxes of Nestle Black Magic which once weighed 376g now coming in at 348g, and £4 boxes of Terry’s Chocolate Orange Segsations  down 30g at 300g. Selection box: The Fabulously Fox's Biscuit Selection, which costs £6, is now 50g lighter at 600g .

Biscuit manufacturer Burtons, which makes the Cadbury pack, told the newspaper that their boxes have the same number of biscuits, but they weigh less because they are topped with a different sort of chocolate. 'We changed the recipe and this has resulted in slightly reduced weights per biscuit,' said a spokesman. Foxes said their biscuits may weigh less than before, but the product is now of a higher quality, and Nestle said there will still the same number of sweets in the Black Magic box. Uniform: Cadbury said the shape of the Terry's Chocolate Orange Segsations packaging had changed to mirror other products on sale . Cadbury said the shape of the Chocolate Orange Segsations packaging had changed to mirror other products on sale, while the size of the Wine Gums and Jelly Babies packs had been reduced because of 'economic factors', with the smaller boxes meaning customers were not paying more for them. Last year, Mars UK shrank its popular Mars and Snickers bars, reducing a Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g as part of a pledge to cut calories in its products to a maximum of 250. As a result of the size changes, the number of calories in a Mars bar dropped from 260 to 229 and in a Snickers bar from 280 to 245. Manufacturers have also had to deal with the rising cost of ingredients, in particular cocoa butter, the price of which has jumped 28 percent this year to more than £5,000 a tonne because of strong demand and limited supply. The price of cocoa beans, from which cocoa butter is extracted, has also risen to a three-year high this year.

"The origins of an enormous rocky moose, which is only clearly visible from the sky, has baffled archaeologists since it was discovered in 2011. But now experts say that children from a lost civilisation helped to create the huge antlered artwork 6,000 years ago. The moose, which lies close to Lake Zyuratkul in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia, is the world’s oldest known geoglyph. Scroll down for video . Man-made moose: Experts say that children from a lost civilisation helped to create the huge antlered artwork (pictured) 6,000 years ago. The moose is only visible from the sky and is the world's oldest geoglyph . It is made from stone and predates Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years. The geoglyph was found in 2011 using satellite images of the area and is older than British equivalents such as the White Horse in Uffington, Oxfordshire or the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, archaeologists have confirmed. ‘The most interesting development is that tools found at the site indicate it was worked on assiduously by children as well as adults in a large-scale community accomplishment,’ The Siberian Times reported. Stone tools uncovered in recent archaeological digs at the site show that some were made to fit the hands of children who took part in a massive community effort to construct the moose, which stretches for about 902ft (275 metres) and depicts an animal with four legs, antlers and a long muzzle. Stone tools uncovered in recent archaeological digs at the site (pictured) show that some were made to fit the hands of children who took part in a massive community effort to construct the moose, which stretches for about 275 metres and depicts an animal with four legs, antlers and a long muzzle . The moose was discovered by chance in 2011 by local researcher Alexander Shestakov after he spotted it trawling through satellite images from Google Earth. Originally it would have been visible from a nearby ridge but the growth of trees since ancient times means that it was substantially hidden (pictured) What: A large moose design made on the ground from rocks that is visible from a height. Location: Near Lake Zyuratkul in the southern Ural mountains, Russia. Age: 6,000 years. Architects: An unknown ancient civilisation. Tools indicate that children helped build it. Length: 902ft (275 metres). Discovered: In 2011 from satellite images. Raison d'être: A mystery. Experts suspect the creation of the geoglyph was linked with worship. Stanislav Grigoryev, a senior researcher from the Chelyabinsk History and Archaeology Institute, said: 'Judging by the different sizes of the tools - from 17cm-long and weighing about three kilograms to some being just two centimetres - we can assume they were used by both adults and children. 'We can also assume it means that everyone participated in creating the moose. 'But it was not a kind of slave labour of children. They were involved to share common values, to join something important to all the people.' Some 155 implements have been found near the geoglyph, mostly for digging or breaking stones. The moose was discovered by chance in 2011 by local researcher Alexander Shestakov after he spotted it trawling through satellite images from Google Earth. Originally it would have been visible from a nearby ridge but the growth of trees since ancient times means that it was substantially hidden. Despite the discovery of small tools, scientists are still puzzled about exactly who built the moose and why. The moose, which lies close to Lake Zyuratkul (marked on the map) in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia, is the world’s oldest known geoglyph . The Russian moose artwork is the world’s oldest known geoglyph and is made from stone and predates Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years. Giant hands forming part of the lines in the  desert are shown . Some 155 implements have been found near the geoglyph, mostly for digging or breaking stones. A shot of the excavation site is pictured . No-body knows why ancient people created the geoglyph (illustrated) which stretches for about 902 ft (275 metres). Theories include that it was used to worship gods, denote postcodes, or even attract aliens . Stanislav Grigoryev (pictured), a senior researcher from the Chelyabinsk History and Archaeology Institute, said: 'Judging by the different sizes of the tools - from 17cm-long and weighing about three kilograms to some being just two centimetres - we can assume they were used by both adults and children . They assume it was made to impress the gods in ancient times, but local archaeologists have failed to find evidence of ‘a culture with sufficient refinement’ which would have been able to construct it between 3,000BC and 4,000BC. ‘The figure would initially have looked white and slightly shiny against the green grass background,’ said Dr Grigoryev. Researchers hope that they will unearth ceramics at the site, giving them clues as to the identity of the mystery civilisation. ‘It may help if we find ceramics on the site. Ceramics could help us with the date and with understanding who these people were that created the geoglyph,’ he said. ‘It's not quite clear who the builders were. It is obvious that its creation has a big social importance. Geoglyphs are the symbols of unity.’ Local archaeological digs by the nearby lake found no evidence of a population likely to have built the moose. ‘People have lived here since the Neolithic era but there was no sign of large social structures, nor that they did anything other than hunting and fishing,’ Dr Grigoryev. The Russian geoglyph was found in 2011 using satellite images and is older than British geoglyphs such as the White Horse in Uffington, Oxfordshire (pictured) or the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset . Experts assume that the moose marking was made to impress the gods in ancient times, but local archaeologists have failed to find evidence of ‘a culture with sufficient refinement’ which would have been able to construct it between 3,000BC and 4,000BC . Different sized tools (pictured) found near the geoglyph indicate that its creation was a community effort and not a kind of slave labour for children. 'They were involved to share common values, to join something important to all the people,' Dr Grigoryev said. ‘So it puzzles me very much. It is a kind of mystery: who built this and for what purpose?’ The research team found traces of two ancient fireplaces at the site of the moose, both used only once, possibly in a significant ritual, he said. ‘The geoglyphs in Nazca are younger as are those in the UK, though there might be some of comparable age in Britain,’ he added. ‘But at the moment Zyuratkul's is the most ancient, and is the world's largest figure image. ‘By figure image we mean geometrical or zoomorphic figures, because there are very long lines in Nasca, and here we speak about the figure. So it's not the largest geoglyph, but the largest figure image. ‘It could become a tourist attraction and with a museum, but we need to think how it might be implemented."" Some 50 geoglyphs with various shapes and sizes, including a massive swastika, were recently discovered across northern Kazakhstan. Some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars, planetary events like sun solstices, or constellations (illustrated) A number of theories have been put forward on why ancient man built the geoglyphs. Geoglyphs are large designs made on the ground from  rocks or durable elements of the landscape, such as stones, stone fragments, live trees, gravel, or earth. They often form animals and can be most easily seen from the sky, or a high viewpoint. Worship: They are seen as an early form of statue, used for religious worship. This might apply to the Long Man of Wilmington, in England, which is thought to date as far back as 2,000BC and is the tallest in Europe. Some experts say the figure is a representation of an Anglo Saxon war god and the site is considered sacred by Pagans. Prayer and ritual points: The discovery of fireplaces on the site of the Russian moose and other geoglyphs adds to speculation they were used for rituals. There is a theory that the Nazca used to dance along the lines of their geoglyphs when they prayed for rain, with many of the same images featuring on pottery from the time. Ancient postcodes: Geoglyphs may have been a way in which civilisations marked their own territories in clear and visible ways. More often than they are giant structures in areas that can be seen from a distance or from a high vantage point, leading some experts to say they were used to mark ownership of the land. Astronomy: Some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars, planetary events like sun solstices, or constellations. However a 1968 study by the National Geographic Society found that while some of the Nazca lines did point to the positions of the Sun and Moon, it was no more than could be expected by mere chance. Aliens: A widespread yet bizarre theory sees the markings as signals to visiting aliens. Some have claimed that the straight lines of Nazca, for instance, were created as runways for spaceships, but why extra-terrestrials would attempt to land on geoglyphs in the shape of monkeys, spiders, or giant Russian moose is another question.","Giant stone picture of a moose was discovered from satellite images in 2011 .

"One of the country’s oldest cinemas has been forced to replace all its seats for the first time almost 100 years - because British bottoms keep getting bigger. Malvern Cinema in Worcestershire has removed all of its 17in-wide seats to as customers can no longer squeeze into the older model. The historic cinema, which has welcomed Elgar,George Bernard Shaw and CS Lewis in the past, has been forced to reduce its 380 capacity by 40 because of the change. Malvern Cinema in Worcestershire has removed all of its 17in maroon seats to make way for bigger customers . British women's waist size are thought to have increased by an average of 7in since 1951. The cinema, which opened in 1885, said it felt the need to update their seats to compete with American-style multiplexes. 'It’s a fact that our hips are getting slightly wider so we have had to act to making it a more comfortable experience for cinema-goers,' Nic Lloyd, chief executive of Malvern Theatres, said. 'Films are quite long anyway but we now also have satellite links with the Met and watching a four-hour opera in small, uncomfortable chairs is a lot to expect from people. 'The seats were just not right for modern society. 'We haven’t had anyone get stuck but we know it can happen and we’re aware of the changes that have been made to things like aeroplane seats. 'We did quite a bit of research and looked at what other cinemas had done and these new ones are the standard size in cinemas now. The cinema has been open since 1885. It is one of the few remaining in Britain which still offers visitors the choice to sit in dress circle . The old fashioned chairs were suitable for customers in decades past but are not for 'modern society' All of the seats were snapped up for £30 a pair by members of the public following a social media campaign . Making room: The wider seats are 21in wide and are more suited for watching longer films, an employee said . Twin seats are still available at the back of the theatre for couples or people who enjoy having more space . 'If we are to compete with the multiplex cinemas we need to offer the level of comfort people have come to expect even though it means losing 40 seats.' All 40 of the maroon seats have been sold to members of the public after being advertised on social media. Mr Lloyd said: 'I ordered a skip to get rid of the old chairs but we put out a notice saying we’d sell them and they all went, in one day. 'We’re now hoping to hear from people about what they plan to do with them.' The cinema will keep are keeping old fashioned twin seats for couples or people who like more space. Malvern Cinema is one of the few remaining in Britain to still offer customers a choice of sitting in the stalls or circle and people are still shown to their seats by an usherette equipped with a torch. The average woman's body shape has expanded dramatically in the last 50 years and is now heavier . Aircraft have introduced larger seats for obese passengers as the general population continues to get fatter . In the UK, 64 per cent of the population are classed as being overweight or obese and Public Health England has estimated that 60 per cent of men, 50 per cent of women and 25 per cent of children could be obese by 2050. In 2012 Airbus revealed it would add two-inches to  aircraft seats to make room for larger passengers. Two 20-in seats would be placed on each side of the aisle instead of the standard 18in seat. Earlier this year it was revealed super-size graves were to be built in Lincolnshire, with the standard size now too small for Britain's obese. Armitage Shanks also made a steel toilet capable of holding the weight of a 70-stone person.","Malvern Cinema in Worcestershire is to swap seats for larger furniture .

"Russia today charged 'drunk' snowplough driver Vladimir Martynenko in connection with the air crash that caused the death of Total chief executive Christophe de Margerie. He was accused of violating safety regulations in the Moscow airport horror that killed one of the world's most respected businessmen on 20 October. The Falcon private jet struck 60 year old Martynenko's snowplough as it took off for Paris, killing the French oilman and three crew members. Formally charged: Still wearing his snowplough driver's uniform, Vladimir Martynenko sits in the defendants' cage at the Basmanny Court in Moscow, where he was remanded in custody upon his arrest . The plane exploded in a fireball giving those on board no chance to escape. Within several hours, Russian investigators claimed that Martynenko was drunk when he drove his snowplough back onto the runaway at the moment the jet was taking off at close to midnight. The driver strongly denied he was intoxicated but reports say he had drunk coffee laced with a liquor before taking charge of his vehicle. 'Today snowplough driver Vladimir Martynenko was charged,' said the powerful Russian Investigative Committee, not mentioning the alcohol claim. Earlier rookie air traffic controller Svetlana Krivsun, 23, was charged over the crash and if found guilty faces up to seven years in jail, amid suggestions that blame was being pointed at junior figures when major failings in safety procedures and equipment are crucial factors. Charged: Svetlana Krivsun, 23, pictured arriving in court, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty .

Her union claimed the suspects were unfairly treated like 'dangerous criminals'. Krivsun's superior chief air traffic controller Alexander Kruglov, 40, supervising her at the time of the crash, was also charged this week. While she gave the signal to the pilot to take off, he was formally in charge. Chief engineer of Vnukovo airport service Vladimir Ledenev, and flight director Roman Dunayev were also charged. They also face up to seven years in jail if found guilty. De Margerie was seen as a pro-Russian businessman who lambasted the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia.

"The rookie air controller involved in the Moscow crash that killed leading French oil chief Christophe de Margerie was today formally accused of causing his death. Svetlana Krivsun, 23, currently under house arrest, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty of giving the order to Total boss's Falcon business jet to takeoff when a snowplough was on the runway. The plane clipped the vehicle moments after leaving the ground, and exploded in a fireball, killing de Margerie and the three crew. Charged: Svetlana Krivsun, 23, pictured arriving in court, faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty . 'Trainee traffic controller Krivsun has been charged with violating part 3 of article 263 of the Russian Criminal Code (violating safety rules for the exploitation of an aircraft leading to the accidental death of two or more persons). 'She has been questioned as an accused person', said Russian Investigations Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin. Further charges maybe made but so far she is the only one of five held in custody or under house arrest to be formally accused in connection with the death of the 63-year-old Total oil boss. Her supervisor Alexander Kruglov, 40, 'drunk' snowplough operator Vladimir Martynenko, the head of air traffic controllers at Vnukovo airport, and the chief of runway cleaning have also been held. 'The investigation suggests that these people did not respect the norms of flight security and ground operations, which led to the tragedy,' it said. 'They have been detained as suspects'. Detained: Svetlana Krivsun gave the order for Christophe de Margerie's doomed jet to take off on the night it crashed, killing the French oilman and three crew . Glamorous: Krivsun is a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia . The fallout from the tragedy continued today as the international airport's general director Andrei Dyakov and his deputy Sergei Solntsev both resigned 'due to the tragic event'. Neither was detained. Mr de Margerie, chief of French oil conglomerate Total, and three crew died in the accident, which happened when their Dassault Falcon clipped a snowplough with its front wheel on take off from Vnucovo airport. It span and slammed into the ground, bursting into flames and killing everybody aboard. The crash is seen as doing huge damage to Russia's reputation for air safety, but the oilman's death is in itself a blow to the country. Mr de Margerie was one of Russia's leading friends in global business and was returning to Paris from a meeting with premier Dmitry Medvedev. Krivsun - a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia - is under suspicion for giving the order to the Falcon's pilot to takeoff before the snowplough had cleared to a safe distance. A colleague described her as 'dedicated and extremely competent'. The airport added it was doing all it could 'to ensure the aviation incident is investigated quickly and objectively'. Investigators have already accused the airport authorities of 'criminal negligence'. Christophe de Margerie and his wife outside the Elysee Palace in Paris: Members of Mr de Margerie's family were reported to be on their way to Moscow to return his body to France, to be buried in Normandy . Martyenko was formally arrested and remanded in custody for two months today after investigators said he was 'drunk' in control of the snowplough. Investigators released the results of his blood alcohol test, which they said showed a level of .06 percent. Russia has zero tolerance of alcohol for all drivers, let alone those working at airports, but that is below the .08 percent that is the legal limit for driving in the U.S. and Britain. Interfax news agency reported that he had admitted drinking coffee with a liqueur before taking the wheel of the snowplough. 'If he remains at liberty, Martyenko can hide from the investigation, put pressure on witnesses and destroy evidence,' a hearing was told. But his lawyer told a Moscow court today that the medical evidence that his client was drunk was 'absurd'. Alexander Karabanov said the 'drunk' medical opinion was based entirely on 'visual examination' not on a blood or other test. It was made immediately after the crash when Martynenko was suffering acute shock, he said. 'Why should we trust this?' he asked Basmanny Court. 'We can only trust the analysis findings, which we don't have.' Formally arrested: Still wearing his snowplough driver's uniform, Vladimir Martynenko sits in the defendants' cage at the Basmanny Court in Moscow, where he was today remanded in custody for the next two months . An investigator looks at the wreck of Christophe de Margerie's Dassault Falcon at Moscow's Vnukovo airport . Mr Karabanov queried why it would take up to a week for the detailed medical results. But the court rejected his plea to put Martynenko under house arrest. Judge Natalya Dudar said: 'According to preliminary examination data, Martynenko was under alcoholic influence, the final results will be known within five or seven days.' Martynenko, speaking to the court, admitted he felt 'horribly bad' over the crash. He admitted his involvement in the accident but protested he was not drunk, and insisted he obeyed orders. 'I know that I won't escape anywhere. I co-operate with the investigation,' he said. 'I feel that I am involved in this incident. I feel horribly bad now.' The daily newspaper Izvestia had earlier reported speculation in the wake of Tuesday's tragedy about an inexperienced air traffic controller being involved. 'The aircraft's actions were really run by girl trainee,' said a source at Vnukovo airport. 'The instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee,' and can intervene at any time. 'In addition, there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers. 'However, in the case of the Falcon crashed at Vnukovo air traffic controllers were not able to do anything.' Another insider said: 'No one could see the vehicle. There was strong fog.' But this source complained the 'quality of display equipment' was 'very poor'. 'As a result, when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised, it was not seen.' Members of Mr de Margerie's family were reported to be on their way to Moscow to return his body to France, to be buried in Normandy. It remains unclear when investigators will release the body.","Svetlana Krivsun, 23, charged with causing death of Christophe de Margerie .

"Earlier this year, mysterious craters began to appear in Siberia, sparking countless theories as to their origins. Now scientists think they were caused by the explosion of gas underground. And the explanation could explain the loss of ships and aircraft in the controversial area known as the Bermuda Triangle. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year, mysterious craters appeared in Siberia (shown). Scientists now claim that an underground gas explosion was to blame. They examined the largest crater and found evidence of gas hydrates. The theory could also explain why planes and boasts have vanished in the region known as the Bermuda Triangle . Three giant holes were spotted in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas provoking claims that they were a man-made hoax, meteorites or even stray missiles. But now, after probing the largest of the craters, scientists said the they were most likely created by underground gas explosions. 'Heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions, and from below, due to geological fault lines, led to a huge release of gas hydrates,' reported The Siberian Times - citing scientists from the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum-Gas Geology and Geophysics in Novosibirsk. US Government agency The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said that foul weather and poor navigation are likely to blame for any mishaps in the area between Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in the area. But Noaa said the number of vehicles missing there is no different to elsewhere in the world - and the theory that some mysterious supernatural force is sinking boats and planes is a myth. 'There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,' the agency stated on its website in February. Gas hydrates are ice-like forms of water containing gas molecules, notably methane. They exist in permafrost regions such as northern Siberia, but also under the oceans in some parts of the world. 'The main element - and this is our working theory to explain the Yamal crater - was a release of gas hydrates,' said scientist Vladimir Potapov. 'It turned out that there are gas hydrates both in the deep layer which on peninsula is several hundred metres down, and on the layer close to the surface. 'There might be another factor, or factors, that could have provoked the air clap. Each of the factors added up and gas exploded, leading to appearance of the crater.' He stressed that the crater is located on the intersection of two tectonic faults. Yamal peninsula is seismically quiet, yet the area of the crater looked into had quite an active tectonic life. 'That means that the temperature there was higher than usual,' Mr Potapov said. Crucially, recent warm summer weather has melted gases trapped in layers just below the surface. Three giant holes (one shown) were spotted in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas earlier this year provoking claims that they were a manmade hoax, meteorites or even stray missiles. But now after probing the largest of the craters, scientists say the theory that they were caused by explosions of gas underground is most likely . Pictred are Siberian scientists working at the site. 'Heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions, and from below, due to geological fault lines, led to a huge release of gas hydrates,' reported The Siberian Times . The explanation for the formation of this crater might also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the area referred to as the Bermuda Triangle, according to the experts. The area stretches from the British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean to the Florida coast, to Puerto Rico. Russian scientist Igor Yeltsov, the deputy head of the Trofimuk Institute, said: 'There is a version that the Bermuda Triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions. 'They start to actively decompose with methane ice turning into gas. It happens in an avalanche-like way, like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas. 'That makes the ocean heat up and ships sink in its waters mixed with a huge proportion of gas. Pictured is one of the Yamal craters. It is in the area's Taz district near the village of Antipayuta and has a diameter of about 49ft (15 metres). According to local residents, the hole formed on 27 September 2013 . 'The same [method] leads to the air getting supersaturated with methane, which makes the atmosphere extremely turbulent and leads to aircraft crashes.' Reporting the claims, the journal Science in Siberia dubbed the craters 'a distant relative of the Bermuda Triangle'. Scientists conducted detailed research at the crater, including taking samples to a depth of 985ft (300 metres). 'We checked magnetic and radiation backgrounds, and found no abnormalities there,' said Oleg Kushnarenko, chief engineer of a mission which lasted four days. Mr Potapov said that their theory will be studied further. 'We all have to keep suggesting hypotheses and testing them,' he said. 'The crater itself is incredibly interesting from a scientific point of view.' The explanation for the formation of this crater might apparently also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the so-called Bermuda Triangle region. The area, which is said to have 'swallowed' boats, stretches from the British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean to the Florida coast, to Puerto Rico (shown) This first giant crater, shown, measured around 262ft (80 metres) and was found in far northern Siberia. It is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures and a gas explosion in the area . He added there was a need to identify other areas in the world where such underground gas explosions can occur. 'We must also pay attention to areas where the same thing might potentially happen,' he said. Mr Kushnarenko also revealed that security concerns meant the research team were not allowed to go inside the crater which is around 230ft (70 metres) deep. 'There was a great temptation to go down the crater, but the Institute didn't give the go ahead, saying it was too risky,' he said. The crater they studied is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous, some 19 miles (30km) from the Bovanenkovo gas field. The original crater was found in the Yamal Peninsula, baffling scientists, before two further craters were found in the Taz district and Taymyr Peninsula . This third crater is in the Taymyr Peninsula and was accidentally discovered by reindeer herders who almost fell into it, in the vicinity of the remote outpost of Nosok. The funnel is a perfectly formed cone, said locals who are mystified over its formation. Its depth is estimated at between 200 to 330ft (60 to 100 metres)","Earlier this year, mysterious giant craters appeared in Siberia .
And now scientists claim an underground gas explosion was to blame .
They examined the largest crater and found evidence of gas hydrates .
Theory could also explain why planes and boasts have vanished in the region known as the Bermuda Triangle .
This is a hypothesised region on the west of the North Atlantic Ocean .
Many, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, claim its existence is a myth ."
"If you've left your Christmas shopping until the last minute, the place to go for the best bargains this year is undoubtedly Moscow, with astonishing savings on leading brands due to the collapse of the Russian rouble. On a range of glittering potential gifts, we found savings of thousands of pounds compared with British high streets thanks to the Vladimir Putin effect - and, what's even better, you can be there and back before Christmas Eve. Savvy shoppers could be coming home with some of the most sought after items of the year - including those all-important Frozen toys, iPad Minis and even Cartier bracelets - while saving themselves almost £37,000. Moscow's stores are currently putting the savings on offer during Black Friday to shame, with visitors to the country able to take advantage of prices which have remained unchanged since before the rouble's drop in value. But it comes with a stark warning: analysts believe the country is on the brink of a recession, and Russians have been bulk-buying imported products ahead of the current prices rising - which has already started to happen. Parents can grab a bargain by travelling to Moscow to buy the latest Frozen goodies: these miniature figurines cost £5.82 less than they do in the UK . Significant savings can also be made on this Nikon camera - which costs just 2,970 as opposed to £4,769 in the UK - and thisTAG Heuer Carrera Calibre 6 Heritage Automatic watch, which costs £4,660 less in Moscow . There are also plenty of savings to be made if you fancy a new TV this December - this Samsung costs £162 less in Moscow than it does in London . Even flights appear to have dropped in price: we found a return trip to Moscow on Sunday, December 21, returning on Tuesday, December 23, for £199 with Transaero. The falling rouble also means you will be able to stay at some of the country's top hotels for a third of the cost before the drop. Previously, staying at a five-star hotel would set you back £300+ a night. But, according to booking.com, two nights at the iconic and luxurious Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya - where rooms boasts panoramic views of the city's historic centre - will set you back just £89 at the moment. The historic Metropol, close to the Bolshoi Theatre and also Lubyanka the headquarters of the former KGB, is offering two nights for £158. For a view of the Kremlin, you could opt for the National Hotel - where Vladimir Lenin lived after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 - for £173 for two nights. Back in Britain, two nights at the Hilton on Park Lane will set you back somewhere in the region of £235.75. Flights with Transaero to Moscow cost £199 next week - cheaper than many train tickets in Britain . The prices of top hotels have also dropped considerably since the rouble's troubles - staying at the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya will cost just £89 for two nights . And then there's the cost of the goods in the shops. For example, toys based on this year's hit cartoon Frozen are significantly cheaper: you can get Elsa and her castle for just £25.50, instead of an eye-watering £44.99. You can also save more than £5 on a set of the popular characters, which are selling for just £17.17 in the Russian city. Savings can also be made when grabbing a few gifts for the teenagers. The latest iPad Mini, for example, is just £243, as opposed to £319 in the UK. Among the other bargains on offer is the prestigious Nikon D4S camera, at £4679 in Britain - found by MailOnline  on sale in Moscow for £2970, a saving of £1709. Another is the TAG Heuer Carrera Calibre 6 Heritage Automatic Watch 39 mm, with a UK price of £8,250. This luxury accessory is available in Moscow for just £4,590. For women, the Aquaracer is retailed in Britain for £4,495.00 while in Russia it is on offer for a more affordable £2,532. Or the steel and ceramic diamond Formula from TAG Heuer sells for £1,995 in Britain, compared with £1,020. Fancy some Cartier for Christmas? The Paris Nouvelle Vague Bracelet is for sale at £47,800 in UK, while it was shown in Russia this week thanks to the rouble collapse. More modestly, the Juste Un Clou Long Necklace which retails for £20,800 in Britain was priced at £14,891 in Russia due to Putin's sinking currency. Our Moscow bargain-hunters also found a Versace bias cut military dress selling for £56.22 - compared to £1,690 in Britain. From the same brand, a V-Ray Blue watch priced at £1,200 in London is selling in Moscow for £698. Juste Un Clou Long Necklace is £œ5,909 cheaper in Moscow than it is in the UK . While buying Cartier's Paris Nouvelle Vague Bracelet in Moscow will save you £œ13,489 on the asking price in Britain . With other brands the savings were not so great but still significant. For example, a rope detail tweed Stella McCartney dress  costing £1,475 in the UK was listed as £999 in Moscow. A floral printed silk skirt on sale for £920 pounds in Britain retails currently for £771 in Moscow. However, taking advantage of these bargains isn't quite as simple as just hopping on a plane. British citizens travelling to Russia do need a visa, and this must be obtained before travelling. Luckily, this can be got on an express service - meaning you can get your visa within two working days. The standard service takes six working day. The collapse of the rouble triggered a spending spree . The value of the rouble has tumbled on the back of the falling oil price and worries about the outlook for the Russian economy. The price of oil has plummeted in the last few months - which has hit Russia hard, as those two items account for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues. But Russia has also had to contend with being hammered by sanctions imposed by the West over its land grab in Ukraine. The two things combined have seen the value of the rouble half. This time last year, £1 would get you about  53 roubles. At the close of the markets on Tuesday, it would have got you more than 121 roubles. There has been a bit of a recovery since that peak, with the rouble now hovering around 93 to the pound. But the shops have yet to catch up: the prices are still about the same as they were last year - meaning your pound is now going far further in Russia. However, this is likely to be short-lived: Russians have been rushing to the shops to stock up on imported goods before the prices go up. Already, Apple and Ikea have started to up prices to reflect the change in the exchange rate.","A fall in oil prices has hit Russia's currency hard .
Pound is now worth almost twice as much in Moscow as it was a year ago .
But prices on imported goods from the likes of Apple  have yet to increase .
Means Frozen toys are as much as £25 cheaper, iPad Minis are £73 less and £œ13,489 off a Cartier bracelet .
But analysts warn the country is at risk of falling into recession ."
"Russian diplomats are to demand access to a boy and a girl from Russia whose American parents want to reverse their adoption, claiming the children are 'mentally ill'. Vladimir Putin's commissioner for children's rights has told MailOnline that the move by the unnamed couple from New York, as 'despicable' and said his country's consul must be allowed to see its citizens. The couple have gone to court to ask a judge to end their legal parenthood of the 12- and 14-year-old, who are being cared for in state mental health facilities in New York. They claim that when they adopted the children six years ago, via two adoption charities which then worked in Russia, they were not told the children had severe mental problems, and were falsely told they were brother and sister. Russia's children's rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov (left), a key aide to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin (right), has said Moscow's diplomats will demand access to two Russian children adopted in the US whose parents want to overturn the adoption, claiming the boy and girl are mentally ill. Case: A Long Island couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders. Above, a file picture of Russian orphans in Rostov-on-Don . The couple claim that although the children were reportedly described by the agencies as 'healthy and socially well-adjusted' siblings, the opposite was the case . A judge is to begin hearing their case next month. Their identities have been kept secret by the court. However, Russia's Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov has now called for immediate access to the children, and accused the parents of failing to bring them up properly. Astakhov made clear he wants the Russian consul in New York to meet the children, though under present arrangements there was no way they could come back to Russia until they reach the age of 18 and choose to do so. 'They remain two underage citizens of Russian Federation,' he said. 'They are protected by our laws. The Russian consul has a right to meet them, to access them. This is what must be done right now - to get access to these children. 'This is what the Russian Consulate in New York must be occupied with now ~ to meet and chat with them. 'There is little chance to bring them back to Russia. The Americans will not give them away. The children can go back only when they reach the right age and make such a decision.' Astakhov also accused the parents of 'covering their inconsistency by blaming the poor children, who have already been placed in a psychiatric clinic. This is despicable'. He claimed the children have been labelled and are imprisoned in mental institutions. 'This is deceit,' he said. 'They want not merely to surrender the children, they are seeking to cancel adoption, alleging the children's diagnoses were somehow concealed from them,' said Astakov. 'This is utter nonsense,' he said. 'The American couple had a complete dossier on each child and had the right to consult any doctor. They could have sought additional medical opinions if they had wished.' The children were adopted in April 2008 through two U.S. agencies - Spence-Chapin and Cradle of Hope. The parents are now asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively. Case: In an unusual move, Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III (pictured) has agreed to keep the courtroom open, citing public interest in the 'disturbing facts' surrounding the adoption . Orphans: Judge McCarty III said around 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental problems, while 18 have died through violence by their new parents (file picture) His outspoken comments come as relations between the US and Russia are at their lowest ebb since the Cold War, with adoption an especially sore issue. In 2013, Russia approved legislation dubbed the Dima Yakovlev law, which imposed a ban on the adoption of Russian children by American nationals. The law is named after a Russian toddler who died of heatstroke in 2008 after his American adoptive father left him in an overheated car for hours. Russian officials allege at least 19 Russian-born children have died at the hands of their US adoptive parents since 1999. He claimed that there were no such problems with other Western countries where parents had adopted Russian children. 'I think it is to do with the American mentality, their lifestyle and stereotypes,' he said. 'This is the way ""the right family"" should be, ""the right children"" should be, 'the right relations' between parents and children. 'This is where all these dramatic stories with adopted Russian children are coming from. 'Each time we hear one and the same thing - alcoholic conception syndrome, lack of affection syndrome. These are two topics they always make big [about Russian children when adoptions go wrong]. 'And the third reason, which is becoming popular now as a motive of rejecting the child, is that 'it can't be controlled and he is a danger to our life and security'. The parents are  asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively. And in an unusual move, Judge McCarty III has agreed to keep the courtroom open, citing public interest in the 'disturbing facts' surrounding the adoption. Home: The parents, who are from Long Island (pictured), New York, adopted the youngsters, then aged six and eight, in 2008. The children, now aged 12 and 14, are currently living in state mental health facilities . The case was first reported by the New York Law Journal. The judge said an estimated 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental issues, making the hearing one of wide public interest. If this particular adoption is dissolved, the children would become wards of the state, which could see them either remain in mental facilities or be eligible for ­foster care. Speaking in court, attorney Irene Steffas said: 'If agencies had to warranty that children are in good health, agencies would shut down.' But she added that adoptive parents should be entitled to 'every doctor’s report, every shred of evidence about the child’s health and background.' Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, agreed that parents must receive accurate records so they are prepared for the challenges their children will face. 'They don’t get sufficient training. And they don’t get the support and services they need,' he said. Over the past two decades, more than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans, at a total cost of around $330million. In 2013, Russia banned U.S. couples from adopting its children in a move that was widely seen as retaliation for a controversial bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in December 2012. The couple's attorney and the two agencies involved have declined to comment to MailOnline.","Couple, from Long Island, adopted children, then six and eight, in 2008 .

"The rookie air traffic controller who gave the go-ahead for the jet carrying French oil boss Christophe de Margerie to take off has been jailed amid fears she has been  deprived of sleep and food for days. Svetlana Krivsun - in her early 20s - appeared in tears in a Moscow court this morning, wearing a hood and with her face covered. Earlier union chief Sergey Kovalev claimed she was taken away to detention in handcuffs after she had no sleep or food for two days, and said authorities were treating her like a 'dangerous criminal'. Scroll down for video . Svetlana Krivsun appeared in a Moscow court this morning, crying and pleading with the judge to be let out on bail, as her union leader said she had been deprived of sleep and food for three days . Krivsun, a trainee air traffic controller, is being held with three others after pro-Moscow oil boss Christophe de Margerie died in a plane crash on Monday . Detained: Svetlana Krivsun, believed to be 24, was the 'girl trainee' who gave the order for Christophe de Margerie's doomed jet to take off on the night it crashed . He claimed that the trainee and three other airport officials were detained as 'suspects' over the crash - in which the Falcon business jet struck a snowplough on the runway, killing all four on board including the boss of Total oil. He said the group were questioned without lawyers before being formally detained. 'We are outraged with the horrendous actions of the Investigative Committee of Russia who have detained and took away our colleagues at 2am on 23 October after 48 hours interrogation,' said Kovalev, president of Russia's Federal Trade Union of Air Traffic Controllers. 'These air traffic controllers before that have just finished their night shift. They were interrogated without lawyers. They treated them like dangerous criminals, they took them out in handcuffs. 'They were morally and physically depressed. They were without food and sleep for almost three days. Glamorous: Krivsun is a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia . 'The trainee air traffic controller needed medical help. An ambulance was called. We think that their detention is groundless, they agreed to cooperate with the investigators.' The union has begun a 'nationwide and international campaign of solidarity with their detained colleagues', he said, claiming a 'decision on whether to strike or protest has not been taken yet'. He said: 'We will provide them with lawyers and will ensure that air traffic controllers were released from custody.' Pleading with a court judge to be released on bail, Krivsun said: 'I am a simple trainee controller,' she said from the cage in the Moscow court room. 'I am just learning under the guidance of an experienced professional, obeying his commands.' The court rejected her bail demand and put her under house arrest until 21 December. She was forbidden to leave the rented apartment where she lives with her sister and her husband. She is banned from discussing the case with anyone other than investigators and her lawyer. The chief engineer of Vnukovo airport Vladimir Ledenyov was remanded in custody after the court was told he 'permitted the snowplough, with driver Vladimir Martynenko at the wheel, to roll onto the airfield without an escort and when the radio contact was lost, he was unable to order the vehicle back, but at the same time failed to warn the control tower.' The court also remanded in custody Alexander Kruglov, 40, the air traffic controller who was identified as supervising Krivsun. 'I'm not guilty. I accomplished my duty in full,' he told the court. Investigators alleged that 'the detained persons failed to provide safety requirements concerning flights and on-ground works and it led to the tragedy'. They also strongly denied that the airport employees including Krivsun were 'brutally treated'. Spokesman Vladimir Markin claimed they were handcuffed because they had refused to present themselves voluntarily for questioning. 'I can say that it had initially been suggested to the suspects that they voluntarily arrive at the Russian Investigative Committee for investigations,' he said. 'The investigators were willing to provide them with transportation for this purpose, but for some reason the airport employees refused.' Formally arrested: Still wearing his snowplough driver's uniform, Vladimir Martynenko sits in the defendants' cage at the Basmanny Court in Moscow, where he was today remanded in custody for the next two months . As a result, the Investigative Commitee sent detectives to Vnukovo to detain and question the suspects, he said. 'The allegations about violations of the detainees' rights are not true. Lawyers were present at all the interrogations, including the first few sessions. 'There have been no health complaints either from the suspects or from their lawyers. And, of course, it is untrue information that the detainees were treated brutally.' Earlier it was reported that investigators were seeking house arrest for Krivsun, whose age has been given as between 21 and 25 by the Russian media. Vladimir Martynenko, the snowplough driver, has been detained in custody for two months. Alexei Morozov, the head of the commission for investigations into air accidents of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), said: 'The crew saw an object they identified as ""a vehicle crossing the runway"" 14 seconds after the plane started moving. 'Seeing the object did not cause the crew's concerns and the takeoff continued in the standard manner in accordance with the standard procedures.' The plane collided with the snowplough 14 seconds later, he said. An investigator looks at the wreck of Christophe de Margerie's Dassault Falcon at Moscow's Vnukovo airport . Morozov also said the plane was in the air at the time of the commission and its speed was some 248 km/h. 'After the collision, the plane started intensively tilting to the right, which caused the plane to hit the ground. No failures in the work of the plane systems and its engines before the plane hit the ground were registered,' he said. He claimed that the runway was clear when the air traffic controller gave permission for the takeoff . 'When the air traffic controller gave permission for the aircraft to take off, the runway was clear. The crew confirmed the permission for takeoff.' Approximately ten seconds after the crew confirmed the takeoff permission, 'a snowplough was seen moving on the left side of the snowplow lane towards the intersection,' he said. The air traffic controller did not receive any request for the snowplow to cross the runway, he stressed. No conversations were registered after the crew confirmed the permission for takeoff, Morozov said. Air traffic controller Alexander Alexandrov said: 'Everyone - the snowplough driver and the traffic controllers - were tested for alcohol immediately. 'If any of the tests had been positive, it would have been announced already.' But there were complaints about poor equipment used by the airport's air traffic controllers, some of it 30 years old. 'The equipment they are working with right now makes serious mistakes in measurements, so they often do not trust it,' he said. 'False spots often come out on the screen, as if there are planes or cars out there when in reality they are not there. It makes an air traffic controller waste his time to double-check this data.'

"The 'girl trainee' air traffic controller in charge of French oil boss Christophe de Margerie's flight when it crashed on takeoff has been detained by Russian police. Svetlana Krivsun, believed to be 24, along with her supervisor Alexander Kruglov, 40, have both been held over the business jet's crash along with 'drunk' snowplough operator Vladimir Martynenko. The head of air traffic controllers at Vnukovo airport, and the chief of runway cleaning were also held, said the Investigative Committee, Russia's equivalent to the FBI. Scroll down for video . Detained: Svetlana Krivsun, believed to be 24, was the 'girl trainee' who gave the order for Christophe de Margerie's doomed jet to take off on the night it crashed, killing the French oilman and three crew . 'The investigation suggests that these people did not respect the norms of flight security and ground operations, which led to the tragedy,' it said. 'They have been detained as suspects.' The fallout from the tragedy continued today as the international airport's general director Andrei Dyakov and his deputy Sergei Solntsev both resigned 'due to the tragic event'. Neither was detained. Mr de Margerie, chief of French oil conglomerate Total, and three crew died in the accident, which happened when their Dassault Falcon clipped a snowplough with its front wheel on take off from Vnucovo airport. It span and slammed into the ground, bursting into flames and killing everybody aboard. Glamorous: Krivsun is a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia . The crash is seen as doing huge damage to Russia's reputation for air safety, but the oilman's death is in itself a blow to the country. Mr de Margerie was one of Russia's leading friends in global business and was returning to Paris from a meeting with premier Dmitry Medvedev. Krivsun - a graduate of Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School, the largest in Russia - is under suspicion for giving the order to the Falcon's pilot to takeoff before the snowplough had cleared to a safe distance. A colleague described her as 'dedicated and extremely competent'. The airport added it was doing all it could 'to ensure the aviation incident is investigated quickly and objectively'. Investigators have already accused the airport authorities of 'criminal negligence'. Martyenko was formally arrested and remanded in custody for two months today after investigators said he was 'drunk' in control of the snowplough. Investigators released the results of his blood alcohol test, which they said showed a level of .06 percent. Russia has zero tolerance of alcohol for all drivers, let alone those working at airports, but that is below the .08 percent that is the legal limit for driving in the U.S. and Britain. Interfax news agency reported that he had admitted drinking coffee with a liqueur before taking the wheel of the snowplough. 'If he remains at liberty, Martyenko can hide from the investigation, put pressure on witnesses and destroy evidence,' a hearing was told. But his lawyer told a Moscow court today that the medical evidence that his client was drunk was 'absurd'. Alexander Karabanov said the 'drunk' medical opinion was based entirely on 'visual examination' not on a blood or other test. It was made immediately after the crash when Martynenko was suffering acute shock, he said. 'Why should we trust this?' he asked Basmanny Court. 'We can only trust the analysis findings, which we don't have.' Formally arrested: Still wearing his snowplough driver's uniform, Vladimir Martynenko sits in the defendants' cage at the Basmanny Court in Moscow, where he was today remanded in custody for the next two months . Mr Karabanov queried why it would take up to a week for the detailed medical results. But the court rejected his plea to put Martynenko under house arrest. Judge Natalya Dudar said: 'According to preliminary examination data, Martynenko was under alcoholic influence, the final results will be known within five or seven days.' Martynenko, speaking to the court, admitted he felt 'horribly bad' over the crash. He admitted his involvement in the accident but protested he was not drunk, and insisted he obeyed orders. 'I know that I won't escape anywhere. I co-operate with the investigation,' he said. 'I feel that I am involved in this incident. I feel horribly bad now.' An investigator looks at the wreck of Christophe de Margerie's Dassault Falcon at Moscow's Vnukovo airport . The daily newspaper Izvestia had earlier reported speculation in the wake of Tuesday's tragedy about an inexperienced air traffic controller being involved. 'The aircraft's actions were really run by girl trainee,' said a source at Vnukovo airport. 'The instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee,' and can intervene at any time. 'In addition, there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers. 'However, in the case of the Falcon crashed at Vnukovo air traffic controllers were not able to do anything.' Christophe de Margerie and his wife outside the Elysee Palace in Paris: Members of Mr de Margerie's family were reported to be on their way to Moscow to return his body to France, to be buried in Normandy . Another insider said: 'No one could see the vehicle. There was strong fog.' But this source complained the 'quality of display equipment' was 'very poor'. 'As a result, when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised, it was not seen.' Members of Mr de Margerie's family were reported to be on their way to Moscow to return his body to France, to be buried in Normandy. It remains unclear when investigators will release the body.","Svetlana Krivsun, her supervisor and two more airport officials are arrested .

"One unsuspecting bride received a very special surprise after her husband enlisted several celebs to congratulate her on her wedding day. Peter Capaldi, who plays Doctor Who, Game of Thrones' Kerry Ingram and Pat Sharp were just some of the celebrity well-wishers to take part in a recorded video organised by the groom. Not satisfied with your average wedding speech the groom Jamie McKee, from Cardiff, wanted to treat his new wife Nicole Crees to a surprise video and a surprise it was. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jamie McKee arranged for actors from his wife's favourite TV shows to record a special message for her on her wedding day . Jamie, 32, tricked his bride into thinking it was just your average wedding video with the first few messages coming from Jamie himself, his sister Sara Owen, Nicole's best friend Toni Jones and the best man Christopher Bliss. However, once Christopher had finished his recorded message for the couple, to the bride's surprise Neighbours star Alan Fletcher (who plays Dr Karl Kennedy) steps in to congratulate the happy couple. He is then followed by the likes of Peter Capaldi, Pat Sharp and Broardchurch star Joe Sims all of whom had recorded their own unique message. Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi was enlisted to help out, luckily both Jamie and Nicole have appeared as extras on the show so Jamie was able to contact him . The video went down without a hitch with the 25-year-old bride left utterly astounded and Jamie admitted it really had been a labour of love. Jamie, who met Nicole when they starred in a student film together and married in St Peter's Hall in Cardiff on September 27 said he took months to organise the video but was really pleased with the results. 'It wasn't easy and I think Nicole thought I was spending a bit too much time on my phone but I'm really pleased with the results and she laughed and cried, which is something I hoped she would do.' Other celebrities who recorded personal messages included Game of Thrones actress Kerry Ingram (left) and Ewen McIntosh, who played Big Keith in The Office (right) Luckily for Jamie he was able to make the impossible possible with his handy connections within the acting industry. 'I managed to get hold of some people via Facebook or Twitter, but Nicole and I have both worked as extras on Doctor Who so I asked one of the crew if he could ask Peter Capaldi for me and he emailed me the video a couple of days later.' In his message the Doctor Who star plays on his TV character saying: 'Hi Nicole, many, many happy congratulations on your wedding to Jamie. Neighbours star Alan Fletcher told the bride that she was lucky to be marrying such a great guy . 'I don't know whether I am early, late or on time, I don't know whether I am coming or going because I play a Time Lord as you know and all that really matters is that you two are going to have a wonderful time together and you're going to spend the rest of your lives together. So, have a wonderful happy life, all the best from Doctor Who.' Alan Fletcher, was quick to remind Nicole how lucky she was to be marrying Jamie and was one of the more excitable celebrities on film. 'How exciting is this? You are getting married! And not only that you are marrying a great guy in Jamie and not only that you are getting married in one of my favourite places in the world, Cardiff.

"Art fans better be sure to turn the thermostat down as this sculptor can't take the heat. Nick Elphick, 35, creates his incredibly accurate sculptures using chocolate as his main medium. Nick's cocoa creations include a six foot tall sculpture of the Queen's head and a 15kg carving of Motorhead lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister. Nick Elphick  sculpted images of the Queen using chocolate for the Diamond Jubilee . The full-time sculptor, from Llandudno, north Wales, has even created a number of animal sculptures using the tasty treat. Nick's sweet sculptures have been earning him quite the name for himself, so much so that the artist has even been approached by his celebrity subjects. 'Lemmy heard that I was doing the sculpture of him and I was told he was interested in it. Nick's sculptures can take him up to five months to complete in full . Nick works with chocolate in a similar way sculptors work with clay . 'I invited him down and presented it to him - it was an incredible moment. I've never felt to starstruck before - he's a really genuine guy. 'I was always a fan of his music growing up and he used to live and work in north Wales so it was a great thing to do for him.' Nick's devotion to his idol was second to none with the piece taking him almost half a year to complete in full. 'It took around five months to complete - around the same amount of time it took to make the bronze head of the Queen. One the projects that Nick is most proud of is his sculptures of Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead . Lemmy heard about Nick's project and was so interested in his work that he came to see the piece himself . 'I did that one especially for the Jubilee in 2012 so it was a very special sculpture.' As well as his celebrity tributes Nick has also created an impressive range of animal sculptures include a giant-sized dog head, a lion and a deer carving. The vast scale of his work means that Nick has to dedicate an ample amount of time and money to his craft. 'I have to sacrifice a lot to be able to commit to being an artist and sculptor. 'It's not cheap at all - I've been sculpting things for 20 years and there are always new challenges.' Nick says that his sculptures are edible and you could potentially nibble on them . 'They take a lot of time and effort to make - I sometime find that I lose myself in the work. 'But I'm a real perfectionist to I've taken between two and six months on some pieces of work - it's vital that they're done to the highest standard possible.' Nick has created several successful models now but says it is hard to choose which one he likes the best. 'It's hard to say which ones are my favourite because I've done so many. 'But the punks ones are definitely fun to look at because they're so quirky.' Nick has began to experiment more and more with the cocoa treat and says that technically his sculptures are edible. 'More and more of my pieces are being made from chocolate so in theory you could actually nibble on them.'","Nick Elphick uses chocolate to create giant sculptures of celebrities .

"Anger: Vladimir Putin's spokesman said that the new EU sanctions ignore the Russian leader's 'initiatives to end the bloodshed and achieve peaceful settlement of the conflict in southeast Ukraine' Vladimir Putin today threatened Europe with 'retaliation' for new sanctions that hit its Kalashnikov gun-making plant as the West rushed to stockpile gas for winter amid fears Russia may turn off the tap. The row over the new action, which hits energy giants and bans exports to the Kalashnikov gun-making plant, came amid new claims that Moscow has moved almost 100 armoured vehicles including tanks and Grad missile launchers onto Ukrainian territory. 'Regarding retaliatory measures, the government is thinking . about them, but only those that will create better conditions . for us will be applied,' he said after a meeting of the Shanghai . Cooperation Organisation security bloc. 'We won't do any damage to ourselves, he added in Dushanbe, . capital of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan in Central . Asia. Putin's spokesman said earlier that the new EU sanctions ignore the Russian leader's 'initiatives to end the bloodshed and achieve peaceful settlement of the conflict in southeast Ukraine'. Brussels 'either does not see or does not want to see the real state of things', he said. 'Naturally, the sanctions are going to create a certain discomfort for the Russian side. At the same time, we cannot but understand that European companies and taxpayers will also have to pay a cost for these sanctions, which, in fact, is already happening,' he said. Meanwhile, it emerged the EU's 28-member countries have been hurriedly stocking up on gas supplies for fear of a European energy crisis in the wake of the Ukraine crisis gripping the region. Already Russia has cut off all gas supply to Ukraine since the crisis began with talks to resolve the row long-since collapsed. Ukraine has survived since June by using its gas reserves. But with winter fast approaching, they are running out. 'There is something very nasty building and as long as Russia continues to use gas as an instrument in its broader dispute with Ukraine, Europe's gas supplies will be under threat,' John Lough, a Russian expert at the Chatham House think-tank, told The Independent. Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born energy consultant, told the paper: 'Russia uses energy strategy much more effectively than military power. The energy threat is much more powerful and much more dangerous. Russia understands that the world can't find different sources of energy.' If Russia were to halt gas supplies to its European neighbours, the result could prove catastrophic. Europe imports about a third of its gas from Russia, about half of which flows through Ukraine. Battlefield: A destroyed tank lies on the road out of Donetsk. The row over the new action, which hits energy giants and bans exports to the Kalashnikov gun-making plant, came amid new claims that Moscow has moved almost 100 armoured vehicles including tanks and Grad missile launchers onto Ukrainian territory . Checkpoint: A separatist fighter mans a checkpoint   in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. Ukraine's president said on Friday there could be no military solution to his country's crisis and said he hoped 'a very fragile' ceasefire in the east would hold, allowing him to focus on rebuilding the shattered economy . Cut off: Already Russia has cut off all gas supply to Ukraine since the crisis began with talks to resolve the row long-since collapsed (pictured: a woman walking along a deserted road in Ilovaisk, Ukraine) No gas: Ukraine has survived since June by using its gas reserves. But with winter fast approaching, they are running out . The widely trailed measures hit major energy giants Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft and three defence companies Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation and Uralvagonzavod which face curbs on raising finance in London and other EU capital markets. Exports of dual-technology equipment balled to nine Russian defence companies, including Kalashnikov Concern, Russia's largest producer of automatic and sniper combat arms. Two dozen prominent Russians were also named on the sanctions list including father and son pro-Kremlin politicians Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Igor Lebedev from the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. The list avoided naming any big name oligarchs with links to Britain but included pro-Moscow rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Solidarity: Petro Poroshenko also said a new wave of European Union sanctions against Russia underlined Western solidarity with Kiev . Russia's envoy to the EU Vladimir Chizhov warned Moscow would hit back, with possible bans on imports of cars and textiles. Moscow may also ban Western airlines from overflying Siberia on routes to Asia. Kiev military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk warned that Russia is now 'rotating' its troops in Ukraine. While some had left during the current ceasefire, more had arrived. 'We cannot yet rejoice that Russia is leaving Donbas,' he said. The State Border Service of Ukraine reported almost 100 units of Russian combat equipment entering Ukraine including tanks, APCs and Grad missile launchers. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president said on Friday there could be no military solution to his country's crisis and said he hoped 'a very fragile' ceasefire in the east would hold, allowing him to focus on rebuilding the shattered economy. Petro Poroshenko also said a new wave of European Union sanctions against Russia underlined Western solidarity with Kiev, and that the Ukrainian and EU parliaments could both ratify a deal on closer economic and political ties on Sept. 16. Ukrainian forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine for five months in a conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed. The two sides have been broadly observing a ceasefire since last Friday, despite sporadic violations. 'There is no military solution for this crisis,' Poroshenko told EU and Ukrainian lawmakers and businessmen at the annual Yalta European Strategy conference - held in Kiev, not Yalta, due to Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March. 'I hope the very fragile but efficient peace process which started exactly one week ago will have a continuation, for the (sake of) stable peace and security on the continent,' he said, speaking in English. Poroshenko said Ukraine's 'association agreement' on closer EU ties, due to be ratified next week, provided a road map for the reforms that he said would be his top priority after parliamentary elections on Oct. 26, provided that peace holds in the east. He said he had assembled a team of experts to help fight pervasive corruption, which he likened to 'a cancer' eating away at the foundations of the Ukrainian state, but that improving the security situation remained the paramount concern. 'Investors will come when they feel safe in this country. That is why we are reforming the very ineffective security system and army, our court system ... If we do not reform these things, even after the war, investors won't come,' he said. 'I know personally how harmful the state can be for the investment climate,' added Poroshenko, a billionaire former businessman once nicknamed the 'Chocolate King' for who making his fortune in confectionery.","Putin says new EU sanctions ignore his 'initiatives to end the bloodshed'

'This is why we've launched a 100% British organic range at an affordable everyday low price.' Tony added that he wanted to do away with exclusive nature that so often comes with fresh and natural products. 'At Aldi we believe it's important for organic produce to be available to everyone.

"Disney's Frozen became the top grossing animated film earlier this year, with its story of two sisters winning the hearts of every little girl who saw it. And so for its next venture Disney is demonstrating that it is best to stick with what you know as their new CG animation will too, feature a female protagonist. Moana will be set in the South Pacific and explore the journey of a teenage girl who explores the oceans in search of a legendary island in the fantasy land of Oceania. Scroll down for video . Disney have released the first artwork image of their new film Moana, set to be released in late 2016 . During the course of her journey Moana is joined by a demigod, Maui, who helps her in her search of the lost island. Many details of the film are still being kept top secret however the animation company have released the first image of the artwork for the story, which sees two characters aboard a boat. Set to be released in late-2016 it will be directed by Ron Clements and John Musker who also co-produced The Little Mermaid and The Princess and the Frog. The directors behind the new film also produced The Princess and the Frog, which reported disappointing box office sales . The choice in direction may come as a slight surprise after The Princess and the Frog was dubbed a 'flop' after disappointing figures at the box office with Disney fearing that the word 'Princess' in the title scared off boys. The film giants have since adapted the titles of their female-lead films accordingly with following titles including Tangled (replacing the female orientated Rapunzel) Brave (dubbed Disney' first feminist) and Frozen. In their recent female-lead films, Disney has avoided using 'Princess' in its film titles to prevent alienating a male audience . Despite previous struggles Ron Clements says he was excited to work with John Musker once again and says it has been one of the pair's highlights. In a statement Ron said: 'John and I have partnered on so many films. Creating Moana is one of the great thrills of our career. It's a big adventure set in this beautiful world of Oceania.' John added that Moana is a character he hopes will capture the audience's hearts. 'Moana is indomitable, passionate and a dreamer with a unique connection to the ocean itself. She's the kind of character we all root for, and we can't wait to introduce her to audiences.'","Moana is the latest CG animated film to be produced by Disney .

"We've all been there. The involuntary pained facial expression that comes with drinking a shot of a straight spirit. Now one London photographer has captured the unavoidable squirm in a series of photographs. Tim Charles' Shot Face series captures 34  priceless facial expressions before, during, and after knocking back a shot of tequila. Tim Charles created the photo series, Shot Face, where he took a picture of his subjects after drinking a shot . The subjects were photographed before, during and after drinking their shot . From the gritting of teeth to a gasping tongue, for anyone who has ever had that immediate intense regret that comes with a round of shots will be able to relate to these images. The 33-year-old photographer, who is originally from Norfolk, found his group of willing subjects for the photo experiment in unconventional ways. Half were friends of Tim's (and the photographer even took part himself) and others he found on casting websites and by placing adverts on Gumtree and Craigslist. Subjects were given one shot of tequila however Tim also provided gin and sambuca in case they were particularly offended by the spirit . The project was done over two sittings between June and July earlier this year. The photographer says he mainly gave the participants tequila, however as some people had developed a severe aversion to the drink, he also had Sambuca and gin as a backup. Tim came up with the inspiration behind the project while on a night out doing shots himself and wanted to capture the unpleasant experience on camera. 'I'm not sure where we were (not because of drinking too much!), but it was in London and it was around mid-March.' Tim was inspired to create the series after seeing his girlfriend's reaction in a bar . For half of Tim's subjects he recruited his friends to take part . Tim says that he has his girlfriend to thank especially for pulling the most spectacular grimace. 'Someone had the bright idea to get a round of shots in and after watching my girlfriend pull the most grimacing face I can ever imagine someone pull, I immediately thought this would be a great project to do. This image of Elsa was Tim’s favourite as he says it looks as though she is begging for mercy . 'So I guess I can thank her and her grimace! It was such a raw form of expression, a face that people can't really control and also a moment that is actually quite socially common.' When putting the idea into motion, Tim wasn't sure how many people he would be able to recruit but he says he was pleasantly surprised. The other half of his subjects were  discovered through websites such as Craigslist and Gumtree . 'The response from the adverts was great, which I was happy about as I was unsure anyone would want their photograph taken by a photographer they've never met who's going to give them alcohol! Not dodgy at all.' Although Tim says that many of the first images taken captured the priceless reactions he was after, a few of his subjects insisted on having a second take. Tim even took part in the project himself pulling this objectionable face . 'I was made to do one, I guess I couldn't make my friends do it without doing one myself. For the most part everyone was only photographed once and it was this first reaction I wanted. 'That said there are a couple who demanded another shot (at around 2 in the afternoon!), they shall remain anonymous.' Tim says he has quite a few favourite photos from the series, even some that did not immediately stand out to him, have become favourites. Tim, who has always had an avid interest in art and photography, studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography . 'You start to appreciate some of the subtleties people display. My original favourite is the one of Elena (in the pink and white top), I love the way her arm is up in the air, almost as if she's saying ""stop"" or ""give me a minute"", it always makes me laugh when I see it.' Tim, who has always had an avid interest in art and photography, studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography. 'However much I enjoyed my course it became obvious that I was lacking creativity in my life, this is when I picked up my camera again and it just felt right. I was soon spending more time taking pictures than attending my course!' Subjects only needed to pose for one photo but some insisted on a second take .","Tim Charles captured the reactions of 34 people after drinking a shot .

"Get your razors at the ready as it was revealed today that a beard can make men look up to ten years older. Even a light stubble can age a man by three years and having a moustache can add up to five years to a man's age. Beards have become trendy again with celebrities such as David Beckham, George Clooney and Ben Affleck helping to improve their popularity. A study has shown that by having a beard men can increase their age appearance by up to ten years, a panel agreed that George Clooney looked five years younger without his beard . However, despite the surge in furry faces much of the public agrees that these A-listers would be better off beard-less. A panel of 300 people was shown pictures of various celebrities who regularly change their facial hair. They were asked to guess how old the stars looked according to whether they were clean shaven, had stubble, a moustache, a beard or a heavy beard. Football manager Roy Keane added seven years to his age of 43 when he had a full beard . And it was the uber-fashionable trends for beards that most people agreed were causing the men to appear older. Participants agreed that football manager Roy Keane, who has recently taken on the beard aged most markedly  with his facial hair adding ten years to his age. Keane, who is 43, was adjudged to look 50 with his bushy beard. Clean shaven, he was said to look just 40 – three years younger than his real age. The study found that David Beckham's recent habit is causing him to look 40, however when he shaves he looks 35, four years younger than his actual age . David Beckham's, who is famed for spear heading men's fashions, current shaving habits are not serving him well. The panel aged him at 35  four years younger than his real age when he was clean shaved, however they said that his current habit for facial hair was causing him to look 40. Robert Pattinson is another recent convert to substantial stubble. The panel agreed that with his facial hair he looked true to his current age of 28. However, the panel also agreed that the actor could potentially look younger looking just 25 when clean shaven. George Clooney was another actor who could potentially lose a few years  looking 53 - his real age - with a moustache but just 48 when he had had a shave. Brad Pitt was the only celebrity to defy his years both with and without a beard. The panel aged the 50-year-old at 49 with is goatee and just 45 when clean shaven . Brad Pitt was the only celebrity to defy his years both with and without a beard. The panel aged the 50-year-old actor at 49 with is goatee and just 45 when clean shaven. The research was carried out by Britain's leading hair transplant centre, Crown Clinic in Manchester. Surgeon Asim Shahmalak says that he agrees with the panel and that the way to remain looking youthful is to lose the stubble. 'There is no doubt that facial hair and beards in particular do tend to make men look older.' Despite this Dr Shahmalak says that having a little facial hair is better than no hair at all when it comes to self-confidence. 'Studies consistently show that men who go bald early in life suffer from lower self-esteem and can even earn less than men with full heads of hair. The panel agreed that with his facial hair Robert Pattinson looked true to his current age of 28, however, the panel also agreed that the actor could potentially look younger looking just 25 when clean shaven . 'They can look at least ten years older than contemporaries who have kept their hair. That is why we have seen a 25% increase in men seeking hair transplants in the last two years. 'Men no longer have to put up with being bald, particularly as medical science improves and transplants leave men looking so much better.' Dr Shahmalak has pioneered the introduction of beard and sideburn transplants in the UK. These before and after pictures show a patient who had naturally thin sideburns and had a sideburn transplant at Crown Clinic to make them bushier. Dr Shahmalak says that since the treatment the client has felt completely reinvented. 'He was a farmer and he craved a bushier brow to make him seem more manly. He was delighted with the results.' Crown Clinic is Britain's most popular celebrity transplant clinic.Dr Shahamalak has carried out hair transplants on a number of celebrities including the model Calum Best and Christian Jessen, presenter of the Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies.","A study has shown that a beard can age a man by up to ten years .

"Pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine paraded dozens of prisoners of war through the streets today with shouts of 'Fascists! Fascists!' as the conflict plunged new depths. Around 80 detained Kiev troops were marched through Donetsk followed by road-cleaning trucks spraying water to 'wash the streets of traces of the captives', said a separatist source. The chilling scene along Artem Street to Lenin Square, a main thoroughfare, was a deliberate rerun of Stalin's display of 57,000 captured Nazi PoW officers and men in Moscow 70 years ago on 17 July 1944 during the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Dozens of prisoners of war were paraded through the streets of Donetsk to shouts of 'Fascists! Fascists!' Around 80 detained Kiev troops were marched through Donetsk in a PoW parade . The 'anti-fascist rally' organised by the self-declared pro-Moscow People's Republic of Donetsk was intended as a spoiler to Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations in Kiev when the pro-Western government put on a show of military might ahead of a new campaign to destroy 'terrorists' in the east of the country. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ordered the firepower and troops to be 'dispatched straight to the area of combat operations' in east Ukraine, where Kiev claims the Russian military is fighting inside his country's borders. The pro-Moscow insurgents routinely label as 'fascists' the pro-Western forces now in control in Kiev since the toppling of Russian-leaning President Viktor Yanukovych. Weapons captured from Ukriaine in the six month conflict were also displayed, some daubed with swastikas, including multiple launch rocket systems, howitzers, infantry and airborne combat vehicles. They were followed by road-cleaning trucks spraying water to 'wash the streets of traces of the captives' A pro-Russian supporter (left) reacts as a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war walks past across central Donetsk . A pro-Ukrainian Donbass battalion fighter firing at pro-Russian rebels with an anti-aircraft gun in Ilovaysk . One man emerged from the crowd to slap a 'fascist prisoner' across the face. Some of the captives had their hands tied behind their backs. Ahead of the parade, Colonel Sergei Petrovskyi, deputy defence minister of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), said:'We will also take fascist prisoners there and make them walk through the city, just as their inspirers - the Nazis - were paraded in Moscow.'

Today's PoW march through Donetsk has chilling echoes of the July 1944 parade of German captives through Moscow. The Second World War PoWs from the Russian front numbered around 57,000 officers and men. They were marched at gun-point through the streets of Moscow on the way to prison camps somewhere in the east after being captured during Operation Bagration, the Red Army's spring blitzkrieg, in 1944. Not since the time of Napoleon had Moscow witnessed such a parade. Just like today's march, the streets were scrubbed after them. Some 80 prisoners from pro-Western Ukrainian forces were paraded through the city, with the crowd shouting 'on your knees'. 'A water truck followed them that 'washes off all the dirt they left:,' said journalist Ekaterina Sergatskova, of Ukrainian Pravda, who dubbed the scene one of 'boundless evil'. In Kiev, Poroshenko revealed a £1.8 billion boost in military spending to tackle the civil war underway with separatists. 'It is clear that in the foreseeable future there will always, unfortunately, be the threat of war,' Poroshenko told 20,000 people during the military parade. 'And we not only have to learn to live with that. We must always be prepared to defend our independence.' He warned that Vladimir Putin was seeking to further expand his empire - having already swallowed Crimea - in an alarming echo of the build-up to the Second World War. 'War has come to us from over the horizon where it was never expected,' he said. 'In the 21st century, in the centre of Europe, there is a flagrant attempt to breach the border of a sovereign state without declaring war. 'It is as if the world has returned to the 1930s, the eve of World War II.' Ukraine has lost 722 soldiers in a death toll of 2,300 in the bloodshed.","Around 80 soldiers were tied, slapped and doused in water in eastern city .

"We all know that the perfect way to finish a meal is with a strong cup of espresso, but we also know that this is followed with a night of tossing and turning. However, now coffee lovers can indulge in a flavourful hot drink in the evening without the caffeinated side effect as a revolutionary new beverage is unveiled. The espresso looks just like a regular shot of coffee however it is crafted entirely from tea. Can you tea-leaf it? The Red Espresso is made using caffeine free Rooibos leaves . The drink is created using ground Rooibos leaves, a tea bush that only grows in a tiny corner of the Western Cape in South America. It is made by forcing water through Rooibos grounds at high pressure creating a drink that has the same thick and creamy look of an espresso minus the caffeine. The ingenious beverage, called Red Espresso, is not only caffeine-free but boasts five times the antioxidants of green tea. Just like the real thing: It is made by forcing water through Rooibos grounds at high pressure creating a drink that has the same thick and creamy look of an espresso minus the caffeine . Old favourites: The Red Espresso can be used to create barista favourites such as cappuccinos and lattes . Coffee lover Carl Pretorious, came up with the invention for Red Espresso after realising his habit of six espressos a morning was affecting his health. The idea came to him  when he spotted a bag of Rooibos tea, a staple in his native South Africa, and decided to experiment by putting the leaves in his espresso machine. Coffee lover: Carl Pretorious came up with the idea after his six-espresso-a-morning habit was damaging his health . Since then he has managed to refine the brew into an intense drink with a creamy layer of foam just like his favourite caffeinated drink of choice. However, unlike his usually coffee fueled morning his new drink of choice aids his health rather than damages it. The concentrated tea leaves are full of antioxidants that can help aid digestion, sooth headaches and boost the immune system. Natasha Lache, Red Espresso's global brand manager, says that Carl's invention is incredibly easy to use and is competitive with many devices. 'The leaves are ground into a special patented espresso grind and it then works like any other ground coffee - you can use it in an espresso machine, a French press or a stove-top pot.' The versatile tea can also be used to recreate caffeine free versions of your favourite barista treats. 'You can use it to make all your favourite coffee drinks like a cappuccinos, Americano, macchiato or latte. 'It tastes amazing and it's got five times the antioxidants of green tea.' Natasha believes that Carl's invention can satisfy any coffee drinker as he himself was such a die-hard fan of the stuff before making the change to the tea espressos.

"'Time poor' middle class Britons are abandoning their weekly shop in favour of buying 'little and often' from convenience stores, a study has found . Middle class Britons are abandoning their weekly shop in favour of buying 'little and often' from convenience stores in a bid to save money, a survey has revealed. Families who are short on time are grocery shopping at least twice as often as they were five years ago as they look to reduce food wastage. The change in shopping habits has already resulted in a 20 per cent drop in the amount of food thrown out over the past seven years, according to research carried out by Waitrose. It has also seen shoppers select ingredients specifically for one or two meals while spending is up in convenience stores with a quarter of consumers visiting one every day. Waitrose managing director Mark Price said: 'The twin pillars of convenience and technology mean that people shop more often, and in ways that suit them. 'We have seen that Britain has become a lot thriftier, probably for the better. 'Shoppers have refused to let go of the shopping habits they adopted during the recession.' Shoppers who are 'time poor' are increasingly turning to pre-prepared food  with sales of Mexican meal kits up a fifth, Thai meal kits up 15 per cent and on-the-go breakfast products up ten per cent on last year. The convenience factor has stretched as far as preparing a drink, with the retailer's sales of ready-to-drink alcohol such as gin and tonic in a can up 40 per cent on last year. The supermarket says it has responded to the change in shopping habits with plans to have opened 21 Little Waitrose convenience stores across the UK by the end of the year, including eight in London. Mr Price added: 'We are fast becoming a nation of foodies. Increasing numbers of people have moved from seeing eating as functional to seeing it as an experience to be relished and enjoyed. 'Today, more than ever before, people see food and cooking as a hobby. All these factors feed into how we eat in 2014.' At breakfast time, people are increasingly choosing honey over jam while consumers developed a taste for Austrian wine (up 25 per cent), premium tequila (up 100 per cent) and alcoholic ice tea. Food trends saw sales of flower sprouts - a cross between Brussels sprouts and kale - take off, while venison and bone marrow both increased in popularity, till figures show. Families are grocery shopping at least twice as often as they were five years ago as they look to reduce food wastage (file picture) Consumers are now four times as likely to buy a katsu curry kit as they are tikka masala, the report reveals. Sales of Tunnock's tea cakes increased by 62 per cent after they featured in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, and sales of South American wines were up 50 per cent during the World Cup in Brazil. Looking ahead to next year, the supermarket has predicted consumers will continue to move on from drinking tequila slammers to 'savouring and appreciating' the spirit, and will branch out to try Japanese whisky. It is also tipping Peruvian food as a new trend, while snacks and drinks will go 'upmarket' in the form of new ready-to-drink cocktails with premium ingredients and doughnuts with alternative shapes and fillings. And seventies dinner party classics such as beef bourguignon will reappear but with lighter ingredients such as vegetable stock. A survey found four in 10 people now say that the weekend has become more of an 'event' in terms of what they eat, while a fifth of households are cooking for friends at weekends more often than they were a year ago.","Families opting to buy fewer ingredients but more often in cost cutting bid .

"Hannah Norman visits four tanning salons a day and also uses fake tan and bronzer to maintain her deep golden skin colour . A young woman has become so obsessed with achieving the perfect tan that she has allowed it to take over both her life and finances. Unable to rely on the British weather for her desired bronzed look Hannah Norman spends £1,000 a month on her habit, applying layers of fake tan as soon as she wakes up in the morning and visiting up to four tanning salons a day. The 19-year-old, from Cwmbran, South Wales, is forced to visit so many beauty parlours as the maximum time that each salon allows for tanning is 15 minutes. Nowhere near enough time for Hannah to achieve her extreme bronze shade. Despite having already spent 40 minutes under various sunbeds, Hannah, who works in a clothing store, then returns home to top up her tan with bronzer. Single Hannah first started building up her tan when she was just 14, despite the fact the legal age for using the sunbeds is 18. She would go along to salons with older sister Claire, and claims to have never been asked for ID. Although her parents caught her sneaking out of the house to visit the booths she continued to go, and by the age of 16 was hooked on looking as brown as she could. Hannah says that she is not happy unless she performs her tanning ritual each day. 'I try and go to about three or four places a day for 40 minutes so I can maximise my tanning chances.' Hannah says that she has become such a regular at some salons that they have even started to provide her with a discount. 'Everyone in the shops know me, they charge around £1 a minute but I get discounted mate's rates. 'There is a hairdressers not too far from my house that start asking me where I am when I don't go in.' The obsessive bronzer squeezes her tanning in wherever she can, beginning her beauty regime from the moment she gets up. Scroll down for video . 'I put fake tan on as soon as I wake up, then if I can I go for one session on a sunbed, then when I'm at work I use my breaks to go for more.' Hannah often squeezes bronzing sessions into her lunch breaks at her part-time job . Hannah says that she applies a layer of fake tan as soon as she wakes up in the morning . The shop assistant is often teased for her appearance with people calling names such as 'Oompa Loompa' The image-conscious teen is so hooked on sunbeds she even gets anxious and starts to feel down if she misses just one session. 'If I see somebody in the street who's darker than me I get jealous and envy them and wish I looked like that.' Hannah says that she feels more confident the browner she is. Hannah is noticeably darker than her friends who appear not to favour the fake tan look . Hannah attempted to stop tanning briefly but says that her self-esteem completely dropped . 'It makes me feel happier when I'm darker, I feel better in myself. It is how I like to look. It's my thing. 'People compliment me all the time when I have a tan, they tell me I have a nice glow. If I don't go on sunbeds I start to feel down and anxious.' Hannah tried to give up the habit two years ago, but after just a week began to become depressed at her pale skin. 'I tried to give up completely but it just couldn't. I could see other people with their tans and I just thought being pale is not me. Being tanned is just part of me.' Hannah, who lives at home with her parents took on her part-time job at the clothes shop to fund the habit. Hannah has learnt to ignore negative comments that she receives and says that as long as she is being teased it means someone else is left alone . She currently earns £1,500 a month with a £1,000 going towards her tanning addiction. 'I do spend around £1,000 a month on it all, I still live at home and I give my mum about £200 a month in rent. 'It doesn't leave much to live on, I don't have much money to go out and buy new clothes, but it's worth it to have a tan.' The 19-year-old's devotion to her skin tone has not gone unnoticed with Hannah often being teased for looking like a real-life Oompa Loompa. However Hannah is not bothered by the negatives that come with her constant tanning, whether that is the name calling or dry skin, she is happy with her appearance. 'It doesn't bother me when people say things to me, I let it go over my head. People call me 'Oompa Loompa' and shout out, 'you've been Tangoed!' but I love the way I look. 'Also, it they are taking about me then they are leaving someone else alone, which is always a positive. 'My skin gets really dry, especially on my chest and neck, unless I moisturise all the time. It can ache if I don't do something about it. I always have moisturiser with me. I use it as much as I can, there is a pot in every bag.' Hannah's extreme tan appears even more dramatic when she stands next to her best friend Elizabeth Sullivan, a self-confessed goth who prides herself on being pale. Elizabeth, 19, even spreads on a special white cream to ensure she is the complete opposite of her pal. 'Elizabeth is quite Gothic really, we are the absolute opposite ends of the scale. 'I think it's a bit of a shock to people when we go out because we are so different. 'She's used to it now, when I'm sat there adding fake tan she has this special cream from the internet to make sure she is really pale. 'I've tried so many times to get her to put fake tan on but she won't have it!' Hannah's use of sunbeds is dubbed as excessive and not recomended. Hannah says that she is aware of the cancer risks of tanning but had not yet been affected. 'Obviously if anything like that happens to me I wouldn't keep doing that because my health is at risk, but until then I'll keep going.' But leading cancer charities would like to urge young women and men to avoid using sunbeds to avoid the risk altogether. Hannah's best friend Elizabeth is a self-confessed goth who whitens her skin to look the opposite of her pal . Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'We urge people not to use sunbeds for cosmetic reasons.' Sarah added that rather from enhancing your appearance overuse of sunbeds can have a negative effect on your aesthetic. 'Far from improving your looks, the radiation given off by sunbeds leads to premature ageing - making skin look wrinkled, leathery and old, and it also damages the DNA in skin cells. 'Over time this DNA damage can build up and may lead to malignant melanoma - the most serious form of skin cancer.' Sarah was also quick to point out that Hannah's habit for fake tan will have no effect on her health whatsoever and she would encourage people to use that over the harmful alternative. The single 19-year-old says that by using sunbeds so often she has been left with dry skin that can be painful . 'We'd like to see more people celebrating their natural skin tone but, if you really want a tanned look, it's safer to fake it.' Jacqui Graves, Head of Health and Social Care at Macmillan Cancer Support also wished to express the dangers that come with achieving the perfect tan. 'There is significant evidence that regular exposure to sunlight, sunbeds and sunlamps increases the risk of developing skin cancer. 'This risk is increased further if someone uses sunbeds and sunlamps to excess.' Jacqui says that she wants to see salons who offer sunbeds to take a stricter approach when it comes to who can use the machines. 'The use of sunbeds is prohibited for those aged under 18 by the Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010. It also states that businesses providing sunbeds must provide information about the health risks associated with their use. 'Skin cancer can be as dangerous as any other types of cancer and if you have any concerns about changes to your skin, you should seek medical help.' Teenagers who use sunbeds are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the most dangerous form of skin cancer as those who have never been to a tanning salon, a study has found. Research has shown that the earlier sunbed use begins, the greater the risk of developing a deadly melanoma before the age of 40. It shows that those who start before they turn 20 are 88 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with a deadly melanoma than people who have never used a sunbed. Studies suggests that people up to the age of 25 may be more sensitive to the dangers of UV radiation, which is emitted from sunbeds at more intense levels than found in natural ­daylight. Of sunbed users diagnosed with skin cancer between the ages of 18 and 29, some 76 per cent were likely to have developed the condition as a direct result of using UV booths. But for those diagnosed around ten years later, up to the age of 39, only 13 per cent of cases could be attributed to sunbeds. The Cadogan Clinic in London. A good way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is to use the ABCDE checklist: . A stands for asymmetrical: Melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape. B stands for border: Unlike a normal mole, melanomas have a notched or ragged border. C stands for colours: Melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours. D stands for diameter: Unlike most moles, melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. E stands for enlargement or evolution: A mole that changes characteristics and size over time is more likely to be a melanoma.

"Forget members only, one set of pranksters were determined to open their strip club to all. The group from the Trollstation comedy team brought a dreary commute a little excitement when they opened an exotic dancing club on board the London Underground. Free lap-dances were offered to passengers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Trollstation created a make-shift strip club in the carriage of a Northern Line tube on Sunday . The south London-based group boarded a Northern Line train at Morden, in south west London, at around 5pm on a quiet Sunday last month. It took them just two stops to hang black plastic bags in the window, and get set up and ready for customers. The 'club' was hosted in a seating area of the carriage complete with music system, bouncers and velvet rope. The act then went on to the end of the line in High Barnet, north London, without any interference from Transport for London officials. The bizarre experience was captured on video where young women in colourful wigs and masks can be seen using the tube railings as poles. Passengers were offered a free lap-dance by the actors . The experience was made authentic with a pair of bouncers who searched guests as they entered the 'club' and a velvet red rope by the entrance . The team had blacked out the windows of the carriage within just two stops of entering the train . The experience was kept as authentic as possible with guests who attended the make-shift club being searched by the bouncers in high-visibility jackets on the way in. Gomes Garcia, 22, is one of the masterminds behind the web-comedy troupe. He said the point behind his latest video was to brighten up people's boring journeys. 'We just wanted to make the Tube more interesting. It was brilliant - the passengers really seemed to enjoy it and laugh along with us.' Two female actors took part in the strip, dressed in brightly coloured wigs and masks . 'Hiring bouncers to guard the red velvet rope into the area was really funny as well. 'I think people genuinely had no idea if what we were doing was official or not.' Gomes added that the group had been so pleased with their initial public transport stunt that they were planning on coming up with more ideas to excite bored commuters. 'We've got loads of ideas for new pranks involving the Tube. 'It's such a necessity for living in London, yet the journeys are always so boring. We hope to spice things up again in the near future.' The comedy group say they have several more tube pranks planned in the next coming months .","Comedy team Trollstation created a make-shift strip club on the tube .

"The San Diego Chargers didn't need a 12th man against the Seattle Seahawks. The blazing sun sure helped, especially when the temperature on the field at kick-off reached 120 degrees. 'Heat was a big issue — that's the first time it's ever happened to me,' safety Earl Thomas said after the Seahawks lost 30-21. Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers tight end, reacts after scoring during the game against Seattle Seahawks . San Diego Chargers quarter back Philip Rivers throws a pass during first quarter of game against Seattle . Seattle's vaunted defense was on the field most of the game, unable to stop the Chargers. At one point, Thomas received an IV. 'You have to fight through it, next man up and try to get out there as quickly as possible,' he said. The Chargers used an old, familiar combo — Philip Rivers to Antonio Gates — to upset the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks. Gates had three touchdown catches, including a spectacular, one-handed grab, and the Chargers controlled the tempo to keep Russell Wilson and Marshawn Lynch off the field to beat the Seahawks 30-21 victory Sunday. The 34-year-old Gates scored on catches of eight, eight and 21 yards. The 21-yarder was epic, as the star tight end split two defenders and extended for Rivers' pass, reaching out with his left hand to gather it in. Flat on his back in the end zone, he held up the ball to show the referee he'd made the catch that gave San Diego a 27-14 lead late in the third quarter. The three touchdown receptions tied Gates' career high. Rivers was 28 of 37 for 284 yards. Seattle was efficient when it had the ball, but it just didn't have it enough as the Chargers dominated time of possession on a steamy afternoon at Qualcomm Stadium. 'They had twice as many plays as we did today,' coach Pete Carroll said. 'It was a great job by Philip and their offense. Antonio Gates was phenomenal today. They were moving it like crazy and they just kept the ball away from us.' Antonio Gates scores another touchdown for the San Diego Chargers against Seattle Seahawks . San Diego Chargers running back Danny Woodhead runs for a short gain against Seattle Seahawks . San Diego (1-1) had blown an 11-point, fourth-quarter lead and lost its opener Monday night at Arizona. Seattle (1-1) had nine days to prepare after an impressive 20-point opening victory against Green Bay. After Gates' third scoring catch, Wilson moved the Seahawks 70 yards, capping the drive with a 14-yard touchdown throw to Marshawn Lynch to pull to 27-21. Seattle turned the ball over on downs on its 10 in the closing minutes and San Diego's Nick Novak kicked his third field goal, from 28 yards, with 16 seconds left. San Diego used long drives all day to control play and wear out Seattle's vaunted defense. 'It was hot today, but they were playing in it, also,' Carroll said. 'Unfortunately, the game wasn't balanced out. We had a ton of plays on defense that wears them down, too. It was a factor in the game, but I don't think that was the deciding factor in this football game.' Percy Harvin gave the Chargers a big gift when he fumbled the kickoff at the 28 after Novak's 43-yard field goal gave the Chargers a 13-7 lead with 4:40 to go before halftime. San Diego Chargers' Danny Woodhead  fights for a pass with Seattle Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril . San Diego Chargers head coach Mike McCoy celebrates victory with Chargers guard Rich Ohrnberger . After consecutive 10-yard penalties gave the Chargers a first-and-goal from the 23, Rivers completed a 15-yard screen pass to Eddie Royal before evading pressure and hitting Gates for their second scoring hookup of the quarter. Wilson wasted no time in leading the Seahawks 61 yards in five plays, hitting Robert Turbin on a 3-yard TD pass to pull to 20-14. Turbin also had a 32-yard catch and a 10-yard run on the drive. San Diego running back Ryan Mathews was carted off the field with an apparent right knee injury early in the fourth quarter. Rivers hit Gates on an 8-yard TD pass early in the second quarter. Dwight Freeney sacked Wilson to force the Seahawks to punt on their first drive. Novak kicked a 50-yard field goal for San Diego. The Seahawks came back with a three-play, 60-yard drive capped when Harvin took a pitch from Wilson, got the edge and ran 51 yards down the left sideline for a 7-3 lead. But Harvin had stepped on the sideline during the run and the NFL said after the game the score was 'incorrectly confirmed.' The league said the ball should have been spotted at the 21-yard line.","San Diego Chargers sprung a surprise as they beat Seattle Seahawks .

"It is one of life’s little  frustrations: you brace yourself with an umbrella on a stormy day, but the moment you step outside it blows inside out.

"A pill that blocks the action of a so-called ‘love hormone’ could be a new treatment for premature ejaculation. The medication – which was developed by UK scientists - is being tested in a clinical trial starting this month. It treatment targets a hormone called oxytocin which is thought to encourage feelings of bonding, and is released in response to touch. Studies show it also increases sexual arousal, and triggers ejaculation. Scroll down for video . Hope: The drug stops the hormone oxytocin - which triggers ejaculation - from binding to cells in the body. The idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked, the moment of ejaculation can be delayed . The new drug is a so-called oxytocin-antagonist, which means it stops oxytocin binding to cells in the body. The idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked, the moment of ejaculation can be delayed. It’s estimated that nearly five million men in the UK suffer from premature ejaculation. The condition means sexual intercourse only lasts a few minutes or even seconds, which can lead to low self-esteem, and relationship difficulties. For many men the condition is present throughout adulthood, but it can also be triggered by conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, high blood pressure, prostate disease and overactive or underactive thyroid gland. Treatments include talking therapies, which are designed to help men develop better control of their ejaculatory reflexes, as well as medications such as anaesthetic creams that have a numbing effect. A type of antidepressant - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - have also been shown to work for some men as they are thought to reduce sexual arousal, although they may trigger side effects such as nausea, headache, insomnia, and dizziness. One selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor has been designed specially to treat premature ejaculation. But the drug, called dapoxetine, is not suitable for men with heart, kidney and liver problems, and can carry side effects such as headaches and nausea. Scientists behind the new treatment, which is manufactured by Ixchelsis, say their oxytocin-blocker may provide a viable alternative, and with fewer side effects. Animal studies at the Université de Versailles-Saint Quentin in France, and published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, have shown that oxytocin blockers can delay premature ejaculation. Now the drug is being trialled on 90 men aged 18 to 60. In the year-long trial, conducted at various centres in the U.S and Australia, the volunteers will take different doses of the drug one to seven hours before sexual intercourse. Commenting on the trial, Professor Raj Persad, consultant urological surgeon at Bristol Royal Infirmary said the drug may benefit patients, but cautioned it should be used alongside psychological therapies. Premature ejaculation means sexual intercourse only lasts a few minutes or even seconds, which can lead to low self-esteem, and relationship difficulties . He said: ‘This drug is very interesting, and if trials are successful it could contribute towards treating this distressing condition. 'But there is more to premature ejaculation than chemical imbalances, and there should always be some input from a psychosexual approach to help deal with relevant background issues that the patient may or may not be consciously aware of.’ Meanwhile, doctors have developed a nasal spray containing oxytocin to treat migraine. In a new trial, patients will use the spray when they start to experience one of the excruciating headaches. The idea behind the drug, known as TI-001 and developed by US-based firm Trigemina, is that the drug travels through tissues in the nose to the trigeminal nerve, one of the main nerves in the face, which relays pain signals to the brain. The theory is that the drug interferes with these signals. Small studies have suggested that the new oxytocin formulation is effective. In one trial, 42 per cent of patients had a significant reduction in pain two hours after using the drug, compared with 11 per cent of those in a control group. A trial with 240 patients is now underway in Australia and Chile.","Treatment targets a hormone called oxytocin, which triggers ejaculation .

"Rita Ora has proven that she is seriously persuasive when it comes to perfume. The 23-year-old singer became the face of DKNY's latest scent MYNY earlier this year and since then the brand has seen sales rocket. Rita has given the Donna Karan fashion house the sweet smell of success with an astronomical 249 per cent uplift on perfume sales. Scroll down for video . Rita Ora became the face of the perfume earlier this summer here she is pictured at the launch in New York with Chrissy Teigen . Despite having only unveiled Rita as their perfume ambassador this summer the American fashion label has seen sales of the perfume increase with the UK selling three-and-a-half times more than August the previous year. The 23-year-old singer who lives in west London, shot the campaign for the fragrance in Times Square this summer and after only a month on sale the perfume is now expected to sell over 250,000 units by Christmas with the campaign anticipated to be the most successful of DKNY fragrances yet. Since becoming the face of DKNY's fragrance Rita Ora has helped to boost sales by 249 per cent . Rita Ora has been an ambassador for DKNY for some time but she has proven she is perfect for the role as it has been rumoured that she has signed a three-year deal with the fashion house this summer for £2.5m. Donna Karen, the woman behind the New York label, praised Rita's performance and says she can think of no one else more suited to the brand. 'If Rita can't sell it, I don't know who can' said the 66-year-old designer. 'I think Rita's a great representative of DKNY. She's full of life, she's about what everyone wants to feel - energy. And I find her ageless. She's like this Energizer Bunny who can wear anything from track shoes to stilettos, DKNY to Donna Karan. I love the girl as a person, too. She walks the talk.' Donna Karen, the designer behind DKNY, says that if Rita couldn't sell the perfume no one could . The money-spinning singer is equally fond of Donna expressing her admiration for the designer. 'Donna's a very powerful and confident woman. She comes across as very strong, and that's what I love about her line. 'It's a very confident, energetic line and it's about women who speak their minds. The fragrance celebrates New York City, which is unlike anywhere else in the world. I love the idea of being part of a campaign that captures the spirit of New York and the stories of women here, passionate about their dreams.' Rita expressed her strong admiration of the 66-year-old designer and says that she loves the brand . The perfume itself is housed in a heart-shaped bottle with a skyline-inspired cap, and the scent has top notes of raspberries, galbanum and pink pepper, a heart of Egyptian jasmine, freesia and orris root, and a drydown of patchouli, vanilla absolute, musk and ambergris. Leading online beauty retailer Rakesh Aggarwal of Escentual.com who stock the fragrance says that he is not surprised to see such an augmentation in sales. 'There has been an unprecedented rise in sales of DKNY fragrance in the past couple of months. This can only be put down to the huge appeal and publicity surrounding the new fragrance with Rita Ora. 'There has been a huge sales uplift of 249% year on year against the same period last year on nearly all of their fragrance lines that we stock but the sales figures for the MYNY fragrance are nothing short of spectacular and it's looking set to be one of the top selling perfumes of 2015.' From the Pope to reality TV star Joey Essex, it seems that most public figures have them. But earlier this year celebrity scents suffered somewhat of a slump with beauty giant Elizabeth Arden seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales. Furthermore, the company said the drop in sales, which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price, was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. The cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of June was £48m – the worst in the company’s 104 year history. Each year, more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market, which began with the launch of Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds for Elizabeth Arden in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles. Sales were at the highest in 2011, when Bieber’s Someday was the biggest selling perfume in America – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch. Elizabeth Arden, which had to cut 175 jobs because of the slump, said at the time that half the loss was due to such products, adding in a statement: ‘The decline in sales of celebrity fragrances, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances, was steeper than anticipated.’ However just a few months after this dramatic drop in sales was reported the celebrity perfume industry saw a helpful boost with the launch of TOWIE star, Sam Faier’s fragrance Bella. Record numbers of the Eau de Parfum flew off the shelves, also placing it in the top three biggest selling scents across all ranges after its launch in June. Sam's newcomer overtook Alesha Dixon's Rose Quartz, which fell into second place, while One Direction's That Moment and Britney Spears' Fantasy took third and fourth respectively. Meanwhile The Fragrance Shop spokesperson Daniel Thompson contradicted the news of dropping sales and said that the company had seen a dramatic increase in sales. '2014 is proving to be a hot year for celebrity fragrances. We're seeing a surge in sales as customers want something new from their fashion and music icons.’","Rita Ora became the face of DKNY's latest scent earlier this summer .

"A terrorist who killed himself and dozens of Syrians in a bomb attack is a father of three from West Sussex. Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, joined Al Qaeda-inspired militants after travelling from his home town of Crawley in what he said was an aid convoy. The devout Muslim, who left for the war-torn state six months ago, regularly spoke to his wife and children through the internet phone service, Skype. But yesterday his family revealed he died at the wheel of a lorry bomb driven into a prison in Aleppo a week ago. As . well as killing dozens, the attack allowed hundreds of inmates to . escape. Scroll down for video . Abdul Waheed Majeed, from Crawley, who is suspected of being a suicide bomber in Syria . Probe: Counter-terrorism officers are examining this house in Martyrs Avenue, Langley Green, Crawley, West Sussex, after reports that a UK jihadi, understood to be Abdul Waheed Majid, 41, carried out a deadly bombing in Syria . It also emerged last night that Majeed was a friend of Omar . Khyam, who is serving life for a bomb plot that targeted UK shopping . centres and nightclubs. Majeed’s death has renewed concerns from UK . security services that jihadis returning from the Syrian conflict could . turn their anger on Britain. In other developments: . Majeed . is the first Briton to undertake a suicide bomb mission overseas since . an attack in Tel Aviv 11 years ago. Three died when Asif Mohammed Hanif, . from London, detonated his device outside a beach café in 2003. History: The end-of terraced house in Crawley was once the home of schoolgirl Sarah Payne's killer Roy Whiting, according to neighbours . Footage . posted online of the run-up to Majeed’s attack last Thursday showed a . man with his fist raised in the air on top of the lorry bomb. The deadly vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat Al Nusra, an extremist faction aligned to Al Qaeda. The militant group announced the man responsible was a Briton known as Abu Suleiman Al Britani. Police . and MI5 suspect this was a nom de guerre for Majeed, who has not . contacted his family since the outrage. They may not be able to formally . confirm his death because his remains have not been recovered. Majeed, who was born in Britain, is believed to have worked for a contractor employed by the Highways Agency. Guard: A police officer outside the house, which is situated on a quiet residential street . He . left his council home in Martyrs Avenue, Langley Green, six months ago . to join an Aid 2 Syria convoy organised by his local mosque. He . regularly called his wife Tahmina, who neighbours said worked part time . at a cinema, and their two boys, aged 18 and 16, and daughter of 12. Relatives . said Majeed was ‘quite happy’ and even turned down opportunities to . return home as he repeatedly extended his stay at a camp on the Turkish . border. But he mysteriously cut off contact around seven days ago after telling his loved ones he was moving to another camp. Investigators . are now examining potential links between Majeed and extremists in . Crawley, which is known for its links to Islamic terrorism. In 2007, . five men were jailed for up to 20 years over Khyam’s fertiliser bomb . plot which targeted Bluewater shopping centre and the Ministry of Sound . nightclub. Sources said Majeed attended an Islamic study circle with . Khyam. Two other Langley Green residents – Waheed Mahmood and Jawad . Akbar – were also convicted after Britain’s biggest terrorism trial. Sources . said Majeed may have travelled to Syria with the brother of one of the . fertiliser plotters. MI5 is also understood to be investigating whether . he attended a terror training camp in Pakistan in the late 1990s. Last . night, Ahsan Ahmedi, of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association, said Majeed . was a mentor to radical youths who followed Al-Muhajiroun. The banned group was founded by hate preachers Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary. Mr . Ahmedi said: ‘They were aggressive – there’s no doubt about that. They . supported jihad whereas we believe in a peaceful Islam. Hope: Community leader Arif Syed (left) and Majeed's uncle Muhammed Jamil (right) addressing members of the media in a nearby mosque . Cut off: Mr Syed said Majeed would phone or Skype his family every three days, but communication was lost with him about seven days ago . ‘They didn’t recognise us as Muslims as we’re Ahmadiyya muslims and would call us kaffirs (non-believers). ‘They used to come to our stalls, create a ruckus and stop people from talking to us. They were there to cause a disruption.’ He . said the men were normally foul mouthed and abusive but Majeed appeared . to have a calming influence on them at one event last July. Majeed’s . uncle, Mohammad Jamil, 65, said the explosion ‘started alarm bells’ among the family last weekend. But he said counter-terrorism detectives have not been able to find out for certain what has happened. He . added that Tahmina had been left in a ‘totally confused state’ by the . conflicting reports of her husband’s fate. Speaking at Langley Green . Mosque, he said no one recognised the name Abu Suleiman Al Britani. ‘If . the family knew about this, we wouldn’t have let him go,’ he added. ‘The family has been in constant touch with him for several weeks, and he has been sending photographs. ‘He . has mostly been working with a charity on the refugee camps and . distributing aid which he has collected from here and other towns in the . UK. Explosion: The suicide bombing on February 6 killed dozens of civilians. Above, smoke rises from Aleppo prison . Driving to his death: This photo shows the modified truck reportedly driven by Majeed during the horrific attack . ‘He was quite happy and enjoying this piece of work. We had communication until about seven days ago. ‘He had said he was going to another camp and there might be switch-off with the communication, which has happened before. ‘He . said, “If I don’t contact you for a few days, don’t worry about it, I . will be in touch again”. That’s the last communication we had. People go . out there for humanitarian works. You don’t have to be religious you . know, it’s just human nature. ‘If you’ve got any humanity and if you . are touched by it then you like to do something. And he was one of . those who took this step.’ Community leader Arif Syed said there was still some hope that Majeed was not behind the suicide bombings. ‘We . are praying that he will walk through the door. It’s a good possibility . that he’s still alive and well, and is just not communicating,’ he . said. But Abdul Jabbar, who is also a Syrian aid worker based in . Bradford, has started raising money to support Majeed’s wife and . children. Writing online, he said: ‘A personal friend of mine . . . was martyred freeing the prisoners of Aleppo. What a beautiful action he . did and sacrificed his wife and three children for the sake of Allah.’ Neighbours described Majeed as a ‘pleasant chap’ who was always willing . to help and volunteered to trim everyone’s hedges. Andrew Powell, 62, . who lives opposite, said: ‘I was shocked because he seemed like a . normal guy, a family man. He was a very jovial chap, you’d see him . joking around with people – a bit of a Jack the lad. ‘He was really . into his car and would wash it every Sunday. Before he left in the . summer I saw that he had put his car up for sale.’ Occupant: The house is believed to be the childhood home of convicted child killer Roy Whiting who is serving a life sentence for the murder of Sarah Payne . Past: A neighbour said that the house's current occupant, believed to be Majid, had moved in after Roy Whiting's father left the property. Pictured is Whiting in 2001 . Mr Powell said police searched the property ‘two or three years ago’ and have also visited in recent weeks. Nita . Bateman, 55, said: ‘I’m beginning to wonder whether it’s something to . do with that house. He was the next person to move in after Roy . Whiting’s dad moved out.’ They said the Majeeds have lived there for . at least 12 years and their sons attended Hazelwick School in Crawley. The town’s MP Henry Smith said the case was ‘very concerning’ and . highlighted the dangers of travelling to Syria. ‘Crawley has very . good community relations involving people of different faiths but it is . particularly shocking if someone from the town is involved in . radicalisation,’ he added. Although Majeed was born in Britain, there is no record of his marriage or the birth of two of his children in this country. Sixteen . people were arrested in January on suspicion of terror offences after . travelling between Syria and the UK. The border between Syria and Turkey . is under intense scrutiny by Western intelligence agencies, because it . is seen as the likely source of the next deadly attack on the West. An . ‘unprecedented’ spying effort is under way to monitor the flow of . foreign fighters – many British – heading in to Syria to join the jihad. Earlier . this month James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, . said there was evidence that one Al Qaeda group in Syria had ambitions . to strike in America. Options include placing suspects under intensive surveillance or applying for a terrorism prevention order.","Officers examine house in Langley Green, Crawley, West Sussex .

"Caring about the poor doesn’t make me a Communist, the pope has insisted. Francis said that he had been labelled a Marxist simply for following church teachings on defending the rights of the less well off. In a six-page speech delivered in his native Spanish, he lamented that ‘land, housing and work are increasingly unavailable to the majority’ of the world’s population, . Pope Francis calls 'for dignity of the rural family, for water, for life and for all to benefit from fruits of the earth' ‘It is strange, but if I talk like this, there are those who say that the Pope is a communist,’ he added. Church doctrine commands Catholics to fight ‘for the dignity of the rural family, for water, for life and for all to benefit from the fruits of the earth,’ he said. He said it was right ‘to combat the structural causes of poverty, inequality, unemployment and [loss of] land, housing, social and labour rights’ Christians must also confront the destructive effects of the ‘Empire Of Money’ – namely forcible displacements and migrations, human and drug trafficking, war, violence,’ he said. Francis was speaking to participants at the World Meeting of Popular Movements, which is holding a three-day conference in Rome this week, partly organised by the Vatican’s Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace. The Holy Father says  the ‘Empire Of Money’ behind forced migrations, human and drug trafficking, war, violence . The global conference, for trade unions, the landless, peasant farmers, precarious workers and domestic workers among others, includes the Argentine Excluded Workers Movement, the Brazilian Rural Workers Without Land Movement as well as Bolivian President Evo Morale who was there to represent indigenous tribes. Francis has been labelled a communist by some hard right elements in the US after denouncing the ‘tyranny of capitalism’, calling the wealth made from financial speculation as intolerable and saying speculation on commodities was a scandal that compromised the poor’s access to food.","Pontiff says he has been labelled a Marxist for standing up for less well off .

"An Italian town has been accused of instituting ‘apartheid’ after unveiling plans for a separate bus for Roma. The mayor of Borgaro outside Turin has backed the controversial plan to create a segregated bus route for residents of the Roma encampment after years of complaints from local residents. Inhabitants of the town have allegedly suffered years of aggression and pickpocketing on the current bus route which passes the huge camp, based in a former barracks off the city's ring road. Plans for a separate bus route for Roma were presented at the town hall in Borgaro (pictured) and were supported by residents . Alleged incidents on route 69, known as ‘the gipsy bus’ have included passengers who were spat on, a young girl whose hair was cut off, and another whose hair was set on fire. Under plans which won the mayor Claudio Gambino's support at a town hall meeting this week, a new bus will run parallel to the current route and end at the Roma camp. Italian newspaper La Stampa said in an editorial that the measures amounted to 'apartheid' but acknowledged that something had to be done. Mr Gambino, of the centre left PD party, denied racism and said it was ‘the only solution.’ The town outside Turin in north west Italy has been accused of instituting an 'apartheid' for its segregation of bus passengers . He told Italian media: ‘This way we will resolve the problem without anyone losing out, ’ adding ‘It is not about xenophobia, but security and legality.’ The decision recalls pre-civil rights America and apartheid policies carried out in South Africa when blacks and whites had to travel on separate public transport. Eight out of ten Italians take extra care with their wallet if they see a Roma person on the bus, according to a poll by Avvenire, a Catholic newspaper.","Borgaro outside Turin has introduced plans for separate buses .

"A couple have transformed a disused city centre factory into one of Britain's  most energy-efficient homes - which costs just £300 per year to run. Julian Marsh and his wife Judy Liebert began the project to convert a former  meat factory into a beacon of green technology in 2009. Now, five years later, the home is in the running to be crowned the greenest  home in Britain. It features a waterless composting toilet, translucent walls to reduce the need  for electric lighting and corridors on the outside the insulate the central  rooms. How it looks now: Architect Julian Marsh and Judy Liebert pictured standing in front of their Eco-home which has become one of the greenest in the country . Before: Julian Marsh bought this disused meat factory building in 2009 for £150,000 with the intention of transforming it into a beacon of green technology . Transformation: The meat factory is now a spacious home filled with natural light throughout the building . Julian, 63, an architect professor at . Sheffield Hallam University, South  Yorkshire, said: 'It's a huge . honour that our house has been named as one of the  greenest in the UK - . and it would be great if it was awarded as the greenest. 'Judy . and I are very proud of the work we have done and it's great that our . efforts have been recognised. It would be an amazing triumph to win but . it isn't everything to us. 'We just want to prove that it is possible, even in an urban environment, to  build homes which are environmentally friendly. 'We haven't got much time to start taking our energy consumption, and the  effect it is having on the planet, seriously.' After spending £150,000 to buy the former factory in Nottingham, the . couple  invested a further £500,000 to knock the building down, . decontaminate the land  and build the property. Costly: The couple spent £500,000 knocking the building down, decontaminating the land and building the new property . Back to basics: The eco-home has a composting toilet which requires the user to scoop a handful of wood shavings provided in the soak box into the toilet bowl . Supplies: As the toilet doesn't flush, the couple keep a soak box well stocked with wood shavings . Office space: Julian Marsh has designed the property to perfectly fit his needs - and has built his own office in the building . Artist . Judy, 67, said: 'It's been a big expense and a big project to take on, . but we have built an efficient, beautiful house, that serves our . practical and  leisure needs perfectly - but does not pollute the . environment any more than it  absolutely has to.' The completed property uses just £300 worth of energy and water a year. Explaining . how the composting toilet works, Julian said: 'It's like a wick . chamber which you have to empty every couple of years. It's perfectly . hygienic - there's no smell.' He added: 'We're great believers in living a low energy life - this is just  taking that to the next level.' Outside . the house there are solar panels on the roof and a central courtyard . with a plentiful supply of fruit and vegetables growing. Up to a public vote: The couple hope their home will be voted the greenest in the UK in a competition in May . Long process: The couple spent a total of five years transforming the property which has been renovated with Eco-friendly materials . Sustainable living: Judy Liebert is pictured in the property's garden where the couple are growing herbs, flowers and vegetables . Passages . and stairs are on the outside of the house to act as a climate buffer . to the living space within. Internal doors and windows have been planned . to allow hot and cold currents to  funnel throughout the winter and . summer respectively. There . is also a cistern which collects rain water to be reused for washing . and  a heat pump which draws sandstone from 70 meters below the ground. Insulation  is made from hemp. Julian, . who is a father-of-two and grandfather-of-three, said: 'We are right by . a bus stop and only ten minutes from a train station too, both of . which improve  our green credentials.' Now the couple have built their dream house they say they have no intention of  leaving. Keeping it green: Filled water bottles, pictured on the left, line the walls of the house to add density to the building and help store heat inside . Award-winning: Julian Marsh was given a Civic Trust Award in 2011 recognising 'excellence in the built environment' Pioneering: The couple hope their home will help inspire others to make their own properties more Eco-friendly . 'We have built a home for life - a home that we can grow old together in,' said  Julian. 'We are both very happy.' But . the couple have said that being shortlisted for the Guardian . newspaper's  green building award - the winners to be announced next . month - is just he icing on  the cake. Julian . said: 'It was very unexpected. We didn't have to enter the competition . or anything, they just got in touch to  say we had been selected. He added: 'We designed the house to fit in with the life we wanted to lead, but  it's great to be recognised. Money saver: The completed property uses just £300 worth of energy and water a year - making it significantly cheaper than less energy efficient homes . Stepping back in time: The couple also use a traditional larder in place of a fridge to keep their produce fresh .

"Prosecutors have requested that an Anglo-Italian bunga bunga girl turned politician be put on trial for fiddling her expenses. Former dental hygienist Nicole Minetti, who was catapulted into politics by Silvio Berlusconi after helping to recruit girls for his bunga bunga parties, is one of 62 politicians from the Lombardy region investigated for submitting expenses for items including lottery scratch cards, bullets, cigarettes, takeaway pizzas and fireworks. Minetti, whose British mother runs a dance school in Rimini, is accused of spending €832 at a Milan hotel and buying an iPad after submitting a claim for 19,000 euros. Probe: Former dental hygienist Nicole Minetti is one of 62 politicians from the Lombardy region investigated for submitting fiddling her expenses . She was reimbursed for sushi dinners, items from IKEA, and even submitted claim for 16 euros for a book about the bunga bunga scandal. The book Mignottocrazia, which translates as 'Whoreocracy', featured a cartoon of herself in an apparent S&M scenario on the cover. Minetti is currently appealing a five year sentence for acting as Berlusconi's pimp in organising girls for his lewd dinners. The former prime minister's trial for sex with Ruby the Heart Stealer heard that at one party she dressed up as a nun before performing a striptease. Minetti is currently appealing a five-year sentence for acting as Berlusconi's pimp in organising girls for his lewd dinners . Minetti was catapulted into politics by Silvio Berlusconi . She and another woman allegedly donned black habits and crucifixes to perform a pole dance before stripping to their underwear. Prosecutors estimate the regional councillors submitted three million in fraudulent expenses in three years between 2008 al 2011, a preliminary report submitted to judges and seen by Italian newspaper La Repubblica said. Shamefully, spending on electronics including smartphone tablet cameras-the expenses increased dramatically at Christmas time. Stefano Gallo of the far right Northern league party was alleged to have successfully claimed 6,000 euros for his daughter's wedding banquet. Other outrageous claims includes 61.50 euros at the butcher, 600 euros for cannoli and cakes, and 391 euros for 24,1 kg of salami and 14 kilos of sausages. Meanwhile, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano testified for more than three hours on Tuesday in an unprecedented appearance in a major trial that accuses the state of holding secret talks with the Sicilian Mafia in the 1990s. Palermo prosecutors seeking to shed light on a murky period when the mob targeted the state with assassinations and bombings questioned a sitting head of state in a mafia trial for the first time in the country's history. Among the defendants are Nicola Mancino, who was interior minister at the time and is charged with giving false testimony, and Salvatore Riina, once Italy's most powerful mafia boss. Riina and eight others in the dock face charges of trying to blackmail the state. All deny any wrongdoing. The 89-year-old Napolitano is not accused of any crime. He was called as a witness who may have knowledge useful to the trial, but the hearing may tarnish the image of a president who has guided Italy in a period of political and economic turmoil. Napolitano responded to questions with the 'maximum amount of transparency and serenity' and without invoking his constitutional right to remain silent, a statement from the president's office said afterward. 'He said he had been a spectator to the events (of 1992-93), nothing more,' Luca Cianferoni, lawyer for the Corleone-born mob boss Riina, told reporters outside the president's Quirinale Palace where the closed-door hearing took place. Prosecutors allege senior politicians and police, hoping to stem mounting violence, held talks with mob bosses after anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards were killed by a mafia bomb planted under a road in 1992. The state's willingness to enter into talks after Falcone's murder actually encouraged further bombings, the prosecutors say, including the one that killed another anti-mafia magistrate, Paolo Borsellino, two months later. The former prime minister's trial for sex with Ruby the Heart Stealer heard that at one party she dressed up as a nun before performing a striptease . At the time of the bombings, Napolitano was president of Italy's Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament. He became Italy's president in 2006. Prosecutors asked the head of state about a 2012 letter to him from his legal adviser Loris D'Ambrosio that referred to 'unspeakable agreements' and implied that Napolitano had known about the talks. 'The president never spoke explicitly of a negotiation' between the state and mafia, and he called talk about any unspeakable agreements 'conjecture without any objective elements of proof,' said Nicoletta Piergentili, a defense lawyer.","Nicole Minetti was catapulted into politics by Silvio Berlusconi .

Andrew Morris, 30, is alleged to have killed chef Henry Stangroom, 21, ‘in revenge’ after his partner Michelle broke up with him. The court was told how Morris repeatedly stabbed his victim in the flat in Battersea, London, they had once shared with Mr Stangroom’s sister before shooting himself with a harpoon gun. She had moved out of the property six weeks before Mr . Stangroom was killed and Morris allegedly blamed him for the break up of the . relationship. The Old Bailey heard how Morris was making a large salary as a financial risk assessor - but was suffering from depression and had turned to drugs. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Marcus Hughes . saw Morris the day after the incident on October 18 last year and said . Morris was ‘bewildered, sweaty, slightly agitated and slightly . confused.’ He was suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms and said he had been drinking three bottles of wine a night. Morris also confessed to taking large doses of cocaine and had also been inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing gas. ‘He said he started to use nitrous oxide more often within the past few months before he was admitted to hospital,’ Dr Hughes said. ‘He didn’t say how often he was using it. He told me in general he was using drugs with Henry and his flatmate and his ex girlfriend Michelle.’ Scene: The trio had shared a flat in Battersea, south west London, before Miss Stangroom moved out . Morris told the doctor than his ex-girlfriend would come to the flat just to take drugs with him and her brother. During the consultation at St George’s Hospital, Tooting, Morris said he would take £150 of cocaine in one go. The actuary had been suffering from depression and has cut his wrists twice. ‘He told me he had taken four or five overdoses,’ said Dr Hughes. Michelle Stangroom, the sister of Henry Stangroom, had split from Andrew Morris six weeks before the attack . Morris had hallucinations and was hearing voices that would order him to change the TV channel, but was not suffering from psychotic symptoms. But according to Morris he had no memory of killing Mr Stangroom. ‘He said the events leading up to his admission to hospital had all been a blur,’ Dr Hughes said. ‘He had no recollection of the fishing spike that had been found piercing his neck.’ Morris had gone to see a psychotherapist Mark Bailey at his Regent Street clinic three months before he killed Mr Stangroom. He told Mr Bailey how he had been beaten by his father as a child who had smashed his head against a radiator. Mr Bailey found he was suffering from depression and booked him in for two further appointments, but Morris didn’t turn up. Mr Stangroom, who worked at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus was repeatedly stabbed in the heart, lungs and head at the flat in Battersea. Morris was found in the bathroom with wounds to both wrists and the harpoon spear sticking out from underneath his chin. He claimed the last thing he could remember was seeing Michelle Stangroom three days before. There is no dispute he killed Mr Stangroom, originally from Odiham, Hants, but Morris denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Andrew Morris, 30, is accused of stabbing Henry Stangroom, 21, to death .

"A self-confessed 'nerd' who has appeared on numerous game shows may be the worst contestant in British history - after failing to win a single one. James Robinson, 26, has been a regular contestant on half-a-dozen programmes since he was 14-years-old but has so far failed to scoop a top prize. But Mr Robinson, from, Milfield, West Yorkshire,  hopes his 12-year unlucky streak will change when he appears on the revamped Fifteen to One on Wednesday. Weakest link: James Robinson, 26, . has been a regular contestant on half-a-dozen of programmes since he was 14-years-old - but has failed to ever win one . Contestant: James Robinson pictured at the age of 15 on Countdown in 2003 when Carol Vorderman was still on the show . Second time... unlucky: James Robinson, then 21, appeared on Countdown for a second time in April, 2009 - but didn't win . He said: 'I haven’t actually won any money on the shows yet but I put that down to just being unlucky. 'I have a Pointless trophy and a Countdown goodie bag though. 'I’ve always liked watching game shows but I particularly like Countdown because of the anagrams, I like figuring those out.' He revealed how his passion for game shows began with his love of learning when he was at school. He said: 'I used to sit and read an atlas in the library in high school to learn all the flags for the different countries. 'I’d learn the capital cities and countries, any knowledge that I could possibly use for game shows really.' Determined: James Robinson, pictured on Junior Mastermind in 2013, has not been deterred by his lack of success - and is still applying to appear on other shows . Zero: James Robinson, then aged 23, pictured on the game show Pointless with his friend Steve Ball in 2011. Despite the added help, they both lost . Unlucky streak: James Robinson, then 24, pictured on the show Breakaway in 2012 - which is also failed to win . But despite his dedication, he is yet to strike it lucky on any of the game shows he has appeared on - including Pointless, Breakaway, Mastermind and Countdown twice. He has also been knocked back from The Chase after making it through the auditions stage 16-months-ago. 'I really want to go on that show,' he admitted. 'But I auditioned and haven’t heard anything back. 'I want to try and get on as many shows as I can and I’ll keep going for as long as it is possible.' His closest brush with glory came when he appeared on Pointless in 2011 with friend Steve Ball but sadly he missed out on his first game show title. Getting ready: James Robinson pictured studying for his next game show appearance . Disappointed: James Robinson has lost six times - but says he hopeful his luck may be about to change . He said: 'Pointless really is a nerd’s dream game show as you have to know such obscure knowledge. 'Me and my mate Steve actually got to the final and gave two pointless answers along the way which is a great achievement. 'But then we gave three wrong answers so unfortunately we were out.' The game show fanatic is also trying to get places on BBC One’s Perfection and National Lottery-Who Dares Wins and also Channel Four’s Only Connect. But before he embarks on a trio of gruelling application processes he has hinted the Wheel of Fortune has turned in his favour on his most recent TV appearance on Fifteen to One. He said: 'I can’t tell you too much but I was quite happy with my performance.'","James Robinson, 26, first started appearing on game shows when he was 14 .

"With his maniacal grin and a hoard of body guards following his every move through an underwater cavern, Kim Jong-Un appears to have found a lair worthy of a James Bond villain. But the North Korean leader hasn't stumbled on to the set of Dr. No, and is actually touring a renovated children's camp. The rather plush looking 'international' children's camp boasts its own aquarium, a swimming pool and football pitch - with places at the camp offered as a reward to the country's highest achieving students. Scroll down for video . In an underwater cavern: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is pictured inspecting an aquarium as he visits the Songdowon international children's camp in Kangwon province . Villain's lair: Kim Jong-Un almost looked like he had stumbled on to the set of the Bond film Dr. No, pictured . The Songdowon International children's camp in Kangwon province opened in the 1960s and has recently undergone a refurbishment. And the 27-year-old looked delighted with the results as he walked around the complex - despite the aquarium appearing to be lacking any fish. The camp is open during the summer for North Korean children who achieve particularly good school grades but also for foreign students for two to three weeks each July. It is unclear exactly how many international students it might attract. Kim's visit comes after photos were released yesterday of him meeting a group of adoring female military personnel known as ‘airpersons’. The women swarmed around him to grab on to their ‘Dear Leader’ in the first meeting of the female flying personnel of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) during a photo session in the capital Pyongyang. Plush complex: The camp also boasts a newly built athletic field complete with viewing stands . Reward: The Songdowon international children's camp, which also has a new swimming pool, is open to North Korean children who achieve good grades . At the event in the notoriously secretive country, Kim Jong-Un also sat for formal pictures with his generals and paraded past the assembled military. The cheerful nature of the North Korean leader is in stark contrast to the latest dark speculation surrounding his leadership, as a national South Korean newspaper has alleged he may have executed his aunt. Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is the widow of recently-executed Jang Song-taek, the uncle that Jong-Un who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed last December. Ms Kyong-hui has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a tv propaganda film, leading to speculation that she has been purged from her exhalted position, or even executed. Scenes from the documentary show Kim Jong-un’s aunt in one scene, but she was cut out when the programme was aired again. Miss Kyong-hui was last seen ‘in the flesh’ at a public concert in September last year - and while her name was among top officials at a committee organising the state funeral of a senior Workers’ Party official, she did not make an appearance. Very happy: Kim Jong-Un appeared delighted with the results as he toured the camp after its renovation .

"Budget retail chain Primark has seen its profits soar by 26 per cent to £298 million in just six months. Parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) put the chain's success down to its rapid expansion after several new stores were launched last year. The move pushed sales up 14 per cent to £2.3billion in the 24 weeks leading up to March 1 while its operating margin increased by 13.1 per cent. There are now 269 Primark stores covering nearly 10 million square feet of selling space across nine European countries - with the company now hoping to launch in the U.S. Soaring profits: Primark has seen its profits rise by 26% in the last six months after sales went up 14% . It plans to open a 70,000 square-foot store in Boston next year with negotiations under way to open further stores in the north east of the country in 2016. The . new store in Boston will be in the Burnham Building, which is currently . being renovated, at Downtown Crossing, in the heart of the city. The . site was previously home to Boston's famous Filene's department store. The retailer said: 'Primark has a strong consumer following in nine countries in Western Europe.  After extensive research it has been decided to take the concept to consumers in the USA.' The United States has been a notoriously tricky market for UK retailers to crack, with Tesco and Marks & Spencer among those to experience failure. But the company is hopeful the brand will be as successful in the U.S. as it has been in Europe. Primark's expansion . in the UK has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities, . with the opening of its second store in London's Oxford Street and . extensions to shops in Newcastle and Manchester. Success: Associated British Foods has seen its share prices rise over the course of the last three months, pictured, as its budget clothing chain Primark continued to perform increasingly well . It expects to add . more than a million square feet of space in the current financial year, . having opened its first stores in France in Marseille and Dijon. Three . new UK stores in the second half include a relocation in Cardiff. The chain's profit announcement comes days after the anniversary of the collapse of an nine-storey factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where Primark clothes were being made. The collapse of Rana Plaza on April 24 last year claimed the lives of 1,100 people making it retail’s worst industrial accident ever. It also highlighted the issue of where Britain’s cheap clothes are made and the conditions and safety of the workers involved. Bonmarche and Matalan were also found to be using workers in the building at the time of the collapse. Many other British retailers were suspected to have used suppliers in the same facility in the period leading up to the collapse. ABF has now started paying $9million (£5.34million) in long-term compensation to the affected families. Tragedy: The announcement came a few days after the anniversary of the Rana Plaza building collapse which killed 1,129 garment workers who were making clothes for British companies including Primark . It is also donating $1million (£595,000) to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, chaired by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). This is on top of the $2million (£1.18million) it has already paid in short-term aid to the families of all the workers employed at Rana Plaza. ABF said the total compensation has come to $12million - $7million of which was included in last year's results while the remaining $5million will be factored into this year's results. Primark chairman Charles Sinclair said: 'We support the International Labour Organization in urging other retailers sourcing from Rana Plaza to donate to the Trust Fund so that it can pay out in full to the remaining victims. 'The safety of the staff we employ both directly, and indirectly through our suppliers, is a high priority for the group, and the Rana Plaza tragedy underlined the imperative for change in the Bangladeshi garment industry.' Shares in AB Foods, whose operations cover sugar, agriculture, retail, grocery and ingredients, opened seven per cent . higher today. With its portfolio of kitchen cupboard brands such as . Ryvita, Ovaltine and Silver Spoon sugar also doing well, the group's . profits rose four per cent to £468 million in the half year.","Sales went up by 14% to £2.3 billion in the 24 weeks leading up to March 1 .

"The Indonesian boyfriend of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has been pictured in police custody after he was arrested for alleged possession of marijuana. Ben Panangian is shown alongside other drug suspects in photos taken at a police press conference wearing orange prison scrubs with a bizarre balaclava covering his face. As police did not reveal the identities of the prisoners, Panangian could only be identified by his prison number 99 which is printed on his overalls. In custody: Schapelle Corby's boyfriend Ben Panangian is pictured in orange prison scrubs marked with the number 99 and a balaclava at a police press conference .

He can be sitting down with other suspects while officers appear to present seized drug evidence to those at the meeting held on Tuesday. It comes after Panagian was allegedly caught with marijuana when he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and later found more in his wardrobe. Arrested: Indonesian police allege Ben Panangian was in possession of marijuana . The 32-year-old faces a maximum of 12 years in prison if he is found guilty, the Herald Sun reported. Following his arrest, Corby's mother Rosleigh Rose has since claimed to Nine News that her daughter is not dating Panangian. Her denial comes despite Corby and Panagian being linked as early as 2006 after meeting in jail while both were serving time for drug offences, according to The Australian Women's Weekly. As Corby is only free on parole in Bali under the condition that she stay away from drugs and crime, she is expected to receive a severe warning and will be monitored more strictly. Police on Friday said they had no plans to investigate Corby because the pair's relationship is unclear. Panangian, who's previously been locked up for drug charges, was arrested in Nusa Dua at about 6pm with two packages of marijuana. Police said they seized a total of nine grams of cannabis and arrested him under the name Bernanrd P. Simanjunta. Witnesses confirmed the man was Corby's boyfriend. Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana to Indonesia. The 37-year-old got back with her Indonesian boyfriend who supported her while she was locked-up a couple of months after her release from jail, Daily Mail Australia reported in July.

Schapelle Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling . The two reportedly met when they were both inmates serving time in prison. Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling. Parole board boss Ketut Artha says officers will now watch the convicted drug smuggler more closely. He may also personally warn her about the company she is keeping - but he won't revoke her parole. 'With this case, we will tighten supervision for her,' he said on Friday. 'We will also warn her and visit her more often. 'Early next month she is due to report [to the parole office] and we will warn her.' Corby's parole officer also said she never mentioned a boyfriend in her counselling sessions.

She was sentenced 20 years behind bars in 2005 but was later granted a five-year sentence reduction. While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide. Her parole conditions state that she must not be involved with crime. She lives with her sister, Mercedes, in the tourist area of Kuta. It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island.

"A seven-year-old cancer victim is being given a final chance to beat the disease - thanks to his little three-year-old brother. Kenzie Atkinson has been fighting leukaemia since he was four and has already defeated it - and a bout of meningitis - once before. But a routine check up revealed the leukaemia had returned and the only potential treatment in the UK is a bone marrow transplant. Kenzie's three-year-old brother Chase has now agreed to donate his own bone marrow in the hopes of saving his sibling's life. Close: Kenzie Atkinson, seven, pictured right, is about to undergo a bone marrow transplant after his three-year-old brother Chase, pictured left, agreed to be his donor . Chase will undergo the operation to donate his bone marrow to Kenzie next month - who will then hopefully be able to produce the white blood cells his body desperately needs. But if the treatment is unsuccessful, the family will have to start looking abroad at other treatments not currently available in the UK. Their mother Gemma Atkinson, 31, from Bristol, said: 'Kenzie has been very brave. I have explained everything to him because I think he had a right to know. 'I heard him telling his friend that he was going to have an operation and if that doesn’t work he would be going to heaven. 'He is only seven - he shouldn’t have to be thinking about things like that.' Kenzie was first diagnosed with the horrific disease when he was just four, but bravely fought it off with the help of months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hopeful: Mother Gemma Atkinson, pictured with her two sons, hopes the bone marrow transplant with enable her eldest son Kenzie to create the white blood cells his body desperately needs . He then developed meningitis during his treatment, forcing him to stay in Bristol Children’s Hospital for a month. Having battled through two life-threatening illnesses, his family were delighted when doctors finally told him he was clear of cancer. But last November a routine check-up revealed the leukaemia had returned. Mother-of-four Mrs Atkinson said: 'It’s been quite hard. When Kenzie was first diagnosed with leukaemia I also had a five-week-old baby to look after. 'As first I thought it was just a virus. I had taken him in for blood tests and a few days later I had a letter saying he was anaemic. Last chance: The bone marrow transplant from his brother Chase is Kenzie's final chance of treating the illness in the UK. If it is unsuccessful, the family will need to raise £10,000 so he can undergo a pioneering therapy in the U.S. 'We went into hospital, but I hadn’t realised what I was taking him in for. A doctor took me to a little room and told me. I was obviously very upset.' Mrs Atkinson has been warned that if the bone marrow transplant fails, the NHS does not offer any further treatment. But she has learned of a pioneering therapy called Beam Light, which has helped children like Kenzie, but is only available in the U.S. The therapy involves a photosensitiser drug which once in the body reacts to light by producing a highly destructive form of oxygen which can destroy a tumour. The treatment would cost up to £10,000 and Gemma’s friends are fundraising - just in case Chase’s bone marrow donation is not successful.","Kenzie Atkinson was first diagnosed with leukaemia when he was four .

She claims one of the men pulled a gun on Anthony but didn't fire it. The argument then continued on Facebook in the lead-up to the boys' murders. She told the Chicago Sun-Times: 'An argument led to this, that’s crazy. Now, I don’t have my son no more.' The mother-of-three also paid tribute to her youngest son who was a sophomore at Bowen High School with a passion for basketball. Jordan's sister Magen Wllis, 24, added: 'Nobody deserves to get killed like that. Not at 16.' Police would not confirm Ms Cochran's claims.

"A one-year-old puppy has been left with casts on both of his front legs after they were broken when a brick fell on them. Bruno, a Chihuahua-terrier cross, was left in agony after fracturing both his front legs in the accident. But after undergoing extensive surgery, the puppy is now on the road to recovery. On the mend: One-year-old puppy Bruno pictured with his front legs in casts after they were both broken when a brick fell on them . Severe breaks: These x-rays show where Bruno's legs were broken - just above his paws on both sides . He will have to wear the casts for a few more weeks and will then be put up for adoption. Dr Zach Crouse, who treated Bruno at MSPCA-Angell’s Emergency and Critical Care Unit in Boston, said: 'This dog’s legs were very obviously and very badly fractured. 'Not only could he not bear weight, but his two front limbs were completely limp.  And he was in severe pain.' Bruno was taken to the centre on March 24 by his owners who claimed he sustained the injuries when a brick fell on him. He was immediately given pain medication while x-rays were carried out. They revealed the severe fractures would need surgery and Bruno was taken into the operating theatre. Help: Bruno's owners took him to MSPCA-Angell in Boston and decided to leave him in the charity's care. He is now being looked after by veterinary technician Andrea Bessler, pictured, until he is adopted . Looking for a new home: Bruno will get his casts off in a few weeks and can then be put up for adoption . Angell surgeons Andrew Goodman and Matthew Cleveland inserted plates and screws to bind Bruno’s leg bones and he was fitted with casts on both legs. Bruno is recovering from surgery but will not be ready for adoption for at least six more weeks. Bruno's owners decided to leave him in the care of the charity. He is currently in foster care in the home of Andrea Bessler, veterinary technician at the MSPCA’s Shalit-Glazer clinic in Boston, which is adjacent to the charity's adoption center. According to Ms Bessler, Bruno is not letting his injury hold him back. She said: 'Of the many dogs and other animals I’ve fostered while they recover from injury or illness, Bruno is one of the most playful, charming and all-around most socialized. 'He gets along perfectly with my other pets and my children and I’m sure that after he’s completely healed he’s going to make one very lucky adopter feel very special.' Bruno is expected to be available for adoption within two months. Playful: Staff say Bruno hasn't let his injuries prevent him from getting around - or begging for treats .","Bruno, a Chihuahua-terrier cross, fractured both of his front legs .

"An architect who transformed a derelict wasteland into a luxury home for just £400,000 is set to make a huge profit as the property goes on the market for £2.25 million. Marcus Lee bought the plot in an industrial cul-de-sac next to a bicycle garage and car workshop for a reported £70,000 and spent a further £330,000 building the home - including £20,000 just on the glass for windows. The eye-catching property has won numerous design awards since its completion in 2007. Mr Lee now stands to make more than five times the amount it cost to build the five-bedroom house in Hackney, east . London, where prices have rocketed by 17 per cent in the last year . alone. But three five-bedroom houses are up for sale on a neighbouring street for significantly less at £899,950 - more than double the £345,000 price tag properties of the same size in the area sold for in 2007 when the 'Frame House' was built. Mr Lee, who spent 21 years working on big projects at Richard Rogers Partnership, was involved in the design of Heathrow’s Terminal 1 and Terminal 5 while with the firm, as well as the Lloyd’s building in London. He went on to co-found the FLACQ company and later became a director at Glenn Howells Architects and principal at Arup Associates. He said he is only selling the property so he can move on to another project. Transformation: Architect Marcus Lee transformed a derelict plot of land into this five-bedroom property in Hackney, east London . On the market: The property, dubbed the 'Frame House' because of its timber frame design, is for sale for £2.25 million - five times the amount it cost to build it . Good investment: Mr Lee bought the plot of land in Hackney for a reported £70,000 and spent a further £330,000 building the house . Award winning: The house won a Royal Institute of British Architecture award in 2009 . Glass house: The glass for the numerous windows in the property cost £20,000 alone . Pricey: The wedge-shaped, timber frame property lies in an industrial cul-de-sac in Hackney where prices have rocketed by 17 per cent in the last year. The average price of a house in the borough is £500,000 . Time for a change: Mr Lee, who previously worked on Heathrow's Terminal 5, said he is selling the property so he can move on to another project .

"The mother of a young girl who was attacked by a neighbour’s dog has criticised police for refusing to get involved - because it happened on private land. Amaia Hawker, four, needed 16 stitches on her face after suffering deep cuts just centimetres from her eye when she was savaged by a Leonberger dog which belonged to the next-door neighbour of a family friend. Amaia's mother Laura, 33, said she was distraught that police can't take action as the incident happened on private land. Injuries: Amaia Hawker, aged four, pictured after she was bitten on the face by a Leonberger dog . 'Distraught': Mother Laura Hawker, 33, says she is distraught that police can't prosecute the dog's owner as the attack happened on private property . Under the current law, the owner cannot be prosecuted because the attack in Redfield, Bristol, was not in a public place. But this is due to change to include incidents on private property in just a matter of weeks. The attack took place last week when Ms Hawker, who works as a carer, was visiting a friend and the neighbour was invited into the garden where Amaia was playing. Although the dog is not a dangerous breed, it lashed out and attacked the little girl. Amaia needed eight stitches on her lip, five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek . Ms . Hawker, who was in the kitchen of the property at the time, said: 'The . dog came into the garden through the back entrance with the owner. 'It walked past my daughter and just bit her in the face. The owner dragged it away. I picked her up and she was screaming. 'I grabbed a tea towel to stop the blood. I was just shouting for help.' Owner Ian Parsons said: 'I had the dog right next to me. The child just barged past the dog and poked it in the eyes and it defended itself. 'It is not a dangerous dog. It may growl sometimes but has never attacked anyone and is friendly.' Paramedics arrived at the house to treat the girl before taking her to hospital for eight stitches on her lip, five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek. The police were also called but Ms Hawker said she was distraught to find out they may not be able to prosecute over the attack. Under current law a dog owner can only be prosecuted if their dog is 'dangerously out of control' in a public place . New laws due to come into force before the summer will extend the rules to include private property. In this case, if the criminal investigation is dropped the family may be able to take up a civil case against the dog’s owner. Avon and Somerset Police said: 'We are carrying out an investigation. We have had no previous incidents reported to us involving this dog.' Law: Amaia's family could take up a civil case if the criminal investigation is dropped . 'Self defence': Ian Parsons, owner of the Leonberger dog (stock image pictured), said it is not a dangerous animal and was only defending itself when poked in the eyes by the child .","Amaia Hawker was at a family friend's house when she was attacked by a neighbour's Leonberger dog .

"Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has been charged with one count of indecent assault. Former BBC presenter Travis, 68, was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault in February but jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court were unable to reach verdicts on two charges. He has now been charged with one further count of indecent assault on a woman in January 1995, and is due to appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday April 24, Scotland Yard said. Back in court: DJ Dave Lee Travis has been charged with one count of indecent assault just two months after he was cleared of 12 counts of the same offence . Travis - real name David Patrick Griffin - last month said the 'nightmare is continuing' after being told he would be charged with the further count of indecent assault. The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman when Travis appeared on The Mrs Merton Show on the BBC in 1995. The Crown Prosecution Service has already said the DJ will be retried over two allegations on which the jury failed to agree in his earlier trial. One alleges that Travis grabbed the breasts of a national newspaper reporter, 'sizing them up like a fruit'. He is said to have carried out the attack at his home in 2008 after offering to take saucy photos of the reporter while his wife slept upstairs. In the other allegation, Travis is said to have pounced on a pantomime stage-hand in his dressing room while he was playing Aladdin's evil uncle Abanazar in the early 1009s. He is said to have only pulled away when he was interrupted by TV comedy duo the Chuckle Brothers. Travis was arrested in 2012 by police officers from Operation Yewtree, the investigation into historic sex crimes sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile. Trial: A court sketch shows Dave Lee Travis at Southwark Crown Court during his trial in January . The investigation has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been paid to the 30-strong detective team. The DJ’s original six-week trial is . estimated to have cost around £300,000, while the second trial may cost . another £150,000. Travis had to sell his £1million house in Mentmore, . Buckinghamshire, to pay for his legal fees for the first trial. Tonight . a Metropolitan Police Service spokesman said: 'David Patrick Griffin, . of Aylesbury, has today, Tuesday, 15 April, been charged with one count . of indecent assault on a woman over 16 years of age in January 1995.

"Stepping down: Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan has resigned his position as the country's intelligence chief . Saudi Arabian Prince Bandar bin Sultan who led the country's hardline stance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been removed from his post as the country's intelligence chief. His departure come just months after he was quoted warning of a 'major shift' from the United States over its Middle East policy. Prince Bandar's removal from the post may help to smooth relations with Washington as Riyadh pushes for more U.S. support for Syrian rebels. Prince Bandar, who has recently spent time in the United States and Morocco for medical treatment, was replaced on an interim basis by a deputy, Youssef al-Idrisi. 'Prince Bandar was relieved of his post at his own request and General Youssef al-Idrissi was asked to carry out the duties of the head of general intelligence,' state news agency SPA said, citing a royal decree. The decree did not say if Prince Bandar would continue in his other position as head of the National Security Council. A former ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar was appointed intelligence chief in July 2012, in charge of helping Syrian rebels bring down Assad, an ally of Riyadh's biggest regional rival Iran. He was also closely involved in Saudi support for Egypt's military rulers after they ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi last year, diplomatic sources in the Gulf have said. However, despite his longstanding connections in Washington and personal relations with world leaders stretching back decades, Prince Bandar proved a sometimes abrasive figure in his efforts to corral Western support for Syrian rebels. Western officials have said in private that his comment in October about a 'major shift' from the U.S. following President Barack Obama's decision not to use military strikes against Assad had complicated cooperation on Syria. Ongoing conflict: Prince Bandar led Saudi Arabia's strong stance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Pictured are Syrian army soldiers sitting on their tank while on patrol in Maaloula village, northeast of the capital Damascus, Syria, this week . A trip to Moscow last year to push President Vladimir Putin to abandon his support for Assad also failed to produce results. 'He had been more or less disengaged from the Syrian file for the past five months. The responsibility was divided between a number of people - officers in the intelligence sphere and other princes. So the reality is that any changes have already happened,' said Mustafa Alani, a security expert with close ties to Riyadh. Saudi support for the rebels, including arms supplies, training and financing, has been hampered by infighting between opposition groups and difficulties in working out which of them pursued militant ideologies that could endanger Riyadh. Earlier this year, Riyadh recalibrated its Syria policy to focus more on preventing militant groups there from posing an eventual threat inside the kingdom, something that was pushed by powerful Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.","His departure comes just months after he warned of a 'major shift' from U.S.

"A coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display as being the cause of one of Britain’s worst motorway pile-ups - but admitted it may have been a contributing factor to poor visibility. Seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, on November 4, 2011. The collision happened at 8.20pm, just five minutes after a £3,000 fireworks display concluded only 200ft away at Taunton rugby club. Seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, on November 4 2011 . Britain's worst motorway pile up: West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose said smoke from a nearby firework display did not cause the crash - but it may have added to the poor visibility caused by fog . In the aftermath of the collision, motorists described driving conditions as like ‘entering a wall of thick fog’ with some likening it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens. Others said thick smog came over their vehicles like a ‘white curtain’, ‘emulsion’ or ‘custard being poured from a jug’. Other drivers have described smelling smoke or gunpowder on the motorway. Grandparents Anthony Adams, 73, and his wife Pamela, 70, from Newport, South Wales; Michael Barton, 67, and his daughter Maggie, 30, from Windsor, Berkshire; battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, 46, from Woolavington, Somerset; and lorry drivers Terry Brice, 55, from South Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, 38, from Cornwall, all died in the crash. A further 51 others were injured. Last year firework contractor Geoffrey Counsell, 51, who had been operating the display at the rugby club, was cleared at Bristol Crown Court of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the crash. West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose told the inquest today: ‘I dismiss the possible cause being the smoke from the firework display itself.’ Fireworks contractor Geoffrey Counsell, 51, left, was cleared of  breaching health and safety laws in relation to the firework display held on the night of the crash . But he then added that he could not rule out the possibility that the smoke had mixed with thick fog and maybe further reduced motorists’ visibility. He said: 'There were in the Taunton area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade. 'Varying plumes of smoke from the firework display - particularly that caught below the inversion area - may have mixed with the fog and therefore I cannot rule out the possibility that they drifted under the inversion to the motorway and may have added to the intensity of the obscuration.' Mr Rose said he was considering using his powers to make recommendations to ensure crashes like this did not happen again. The coroner said he would consider whether firework operators need to be trained in the problems of running displays during fog, whether there should be a minimum distance from major roads for holding public displays, whether public displays should be licensed and whether fog detection devices should be installed on the M5 in the Taunton area. Coroner Rose's comments were welcomed by the relatives of those killed in the crash. Speaking after the hearing, Tonia White, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Adams, said she was pleased with Mr Rose’s conclusions. 'I think the coroner’s recommendations are a big step forward,' she said. 'That’s we were looking for - moving on and making sure this doesn’t happen to anybody else. 'We want to see the licensing of firework displays, the literature changed to include the visibility problems that have arisen. 'I think the coroner has gone as far as he could go and I think we have had our questions answered. 'As the coroner said he cannot rule out the fact the smoke didn’t play a part and that’s quite important to us. The coroner has summed it all up for us in a lot of ways.' Her sister Elaine Adams added: 'I think the outcome today has been very, very positive and from my point of view I would like to see more legislation around fireworks, more so around operators and the way they are allowed to go and set up businesses. 'They certainly need more training and they need people who are accountable. I wouldn’t say I am 100% confident it will happen but I certainly hope that is the way it will go.' In the aftermath of the collision, motorists described driving conditions as like 'entering a wall of thick fog' with some likening it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens . Scene: An inquest heard how there was very dense fog in the Taunton area at the time of the crash . During the inquest, Mr Rose concluded that all of the victims died on the M5, except for Miss Barton who died later in hospital. He . said: ‘All the deceased were travelling in motor vehicles on the . northbound carriageway when the vehicles entered an area of reduced . visibility and collisions occurred as the drivers became disorientated. ‘There . were in the Taunton area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of . such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade. ‘At . the time of the accident the pockets were generally small, save for . areas running alongside water courses such as the River Tone, and at 8pm . there was an area of dense fog running along a line approximately . following the main Bristol to Taunton railway line starting about . quarter of a mile east of Taunton station. ‘Part . of this area of fog may have extended to the perimeters of Taunton RFC . and, in all probability, to a height of 25ft or more to reach the . motorway. 'This incident has been described as one of the worst motorway accidents that have occurred in Great Britain and in the town of Taunton the third most serious in the last 100 years.' Grandparents Anthony Adams, 73 and his wife Pamela, 70, from Newport, South Wales, both died in the crash. Their daughters welcomed the coroners comments during the inquest . Malcolm Beacham (left) and Bristol lorry driver Terry Brice (right) who were killed in the crash on the M5 . During the eight-day hearing, Mr Counsell said he did not consider smoke to be a danger to motorists and insisted it did not drift on to the M5 from his display. The lorry . driver said the build-up of smoke during the display did not give him . any concern and there was ‘no reason whatsoever’ to consider smoke as a . potential hazard. ‘It is not something anybody has been trained in before or told to look for,’ he said. ‘There has never been any mention of it (in literature or training courses).’ But some of the people at the display described seeing a ‘wall’ of smoke drift across the pitch towards spectators. Others said they thought the display was too large and in the wrong place because of its proximity to the motorway. The inquest also heard that a risk assessment Mr Counsell prepared was lost by one of the rugby club’s management committee. Mr . Counsell, an experienced operator, agreed with the question that if . there was a fault that night, it was with the rules, regulations and . guidance. The . inquest heard evidence from expert witnesses that none of the published . material about firework safety warned of the dangers of smoke to road . safety. Tributes: Flowers left on a bridge over the top of the north bound M5 near Taunton after seven people were killed in the M5 motorway pile up . A coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display at Taunton Rugby Club as being the cause of the horrific M5 crash . Geoffrey Counsell, 51, pictured arriving at Bristol Crown Court, where he was cleared last year of any wrongdoing in relation to the M5 crash . Fireworks operator Geoffrey Counsell, 51, was cleared of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the M5 crash. During the trial at Bristol Crown Court last year, a judge directed a jury to find Mr Counsell not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act. Mr Counsell, who ran Firestorm Pyrotechnics, was the contractor hired by Taunton Rugby Club to run the £3,000 display at its ground, which was watched by 1,000 people. He set off 1,500 shots as part of his Jupiter Display in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway. In a leaflet promoting his business, the experienced Mr Counsell described the display as the 'biggest and most lavish' piece of 'unforgettable' pyrotechnics he offered. Nearly a year after the horrific crash – which is one of the worst motorway pile-ups in Britain’s history – Mr Counsell of Ashill, Somerset, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter. However, the charges were later dropped and instead he faced the health and safety charge. In December last year, Mr Counsell was cleared of any wrongdoing after a judge said the case 'weighted heavily on hindsight'. Judge Justice Simon, who directed the jury at Bristol Crown Court to return a verdict of not guilty, said: 'The prosecution case required Mr Counsell to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard.' He added: 'There was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display.' Mr Counsell, who issued a statement outside court after being cleared, said he believed the decision to prosecute him was 'motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of doing so'.","Seven people died and 51 were injured in horrific crash in November 2011 .

"Cautioned: Koree Britton, 22, pictured in his England Under-20 kit, has been formally cautioned by police for voyeurism . An upcoming England rugby star has been cautioned by police after filming a woman as she undressed in a swimming pool changing room. Rugby Union player Koree Britton, 22, was caught when the woman spotted her reflection on a camera phone being held underneath her cubicle door in the unisex changing room. The distressed woman alerted staff and police were called to the scene at the leisure@Cheltenham centre in Gloucestershire at 8.40pm on March 31. Officers then inspected Britton's phone and he was detained. The sportsman, who plays for Gloucester Rugby, was later let go after accepting a formal caution for voyeurism. A Gloucestershire Police spokesman . said: 'Police were called to a report of a male taking a photograph or . video of a woman getting changed in a cubicle. 'The report was that he had taken a photo or video underneath the cubicle using a mobile phone. 'A 22-year-old man from Gloucester has been cautioned for voyeurism. 'It . was deemed appropriate to give him a formal caution. That may be . because he was remorseful, or had not committed any previous offences.' According . to an unnamed source, the unsuspecting woman only realised she was . being filmed when she bent down to pick up her shampoo. They said: 'The leisure centre has communal changing areas with cubicles that are open at the bottom. 'A woman bend down to pick up some shampoo and saw her reflection on a phone. 'She started hammering down the door on the cubicle next to her but the person inside wouldn't come out. 'The police were called and he was arrested.'

A spokesman for Gloucester Rugby Club confirmed they were aware of the incident. He said: 'The club has started an internal investigation into the matter and will not be making any further comment.' Britton joined the Premiership rugby union team as a hooker in 2012 and signed a two year extension in April 2013 to stay on at the club until the end of the 2014-2015 season. He was a key member of the England side that won the 2012 U20 Six Nations title and scored the only try in England's 7th place play-off against Australia at the 2012 Junior World Championships in South Africa. He made his Aviva Premiership debut for Gloucester in September 2012 and has played a number of times this season, including a start against Biarritz in the Amlin Cup Quarter Final tie.

"An allotment holder who tends to his plot all year round has been landed with  an eviction order - because he took a fortnight off. Robert Stone, who has tended to the plot for the past eight years, received a  letter from the council giving him a month's notice on the tenancy after  claiming he was not 'cultivating the plot to the required standards'. The 64-year-old grandfather admits he took a two-week break from tending his plot in Scotchman Road allotments, Manningham, Bradford - but only because of heavy storms and rain. He said: 'For about two weeks we couldn't get on to the ground at all. There had  been a lot of wet and stormy weather and it would have done more harm than good.' Facing eviction: Robert Stone, 64, received a letter from Bardford City Council telling him he is being evicted from his allotment for failing to 'cultivate the plot to the required standards' Keen gardener: Mr Stone says he tends his allotment all year round - growing vegetables and herbs - but admits to having had two weeks off over winter when heavy gales meant he couldn't work on the plot . Mr Stone responded to the letter with a detailed . account of the  vegetables grown on the plot and fruit trees that his . wife Wendy uses to make jams,  but received no response from Bradford . City Council. He added: 'After I received the notice I worked the land for two days and dug up some  plants to give them away. 'The land was 80 per cent cultivated anyway because we grow a  lot of fruit and flowers for the house. I took photographs to show the  condition after two days but have had no response. 'In the first instance I thought it was a genuine mistake. I thought they've  got the wrong allotment and that it would be sorted out. But after sending two  emails I've heard nothing from the council and as far as I'm aware the notice  still stands.' The letter sent to Mr Stone, an aerial and satellite rigger, who grows a vast array of herbs, fruits and vegetables on the plot, also had three photos attached to support the eviction. But Mr Stone said the pictures were taken . during the winter when the allotment was dormant, with  some photos . actually showing an overgrown tree outside the boundaries of his  plot. He . added: 'The pictures they took were just dried plants, which you can't . do anything  about in the winter. The council must have come to plot on . the first dry day of  the year to take the photograph. Working progress: Mr Stone has been slowly cultivating his plot over the course of eight years . Stunned: Mr Stone initially thought his eviction notice must be a mistake after receiving this letter from Bradford City Council . Evidence: Bradford City Council attached three images with the letter as proof that the plot in Scotchman Road allotments, Manningham, was not being 'cultivated' 'I get a lot of . use from the allotment and my grandchildren love it too. They  don't . come to help, they come to eat peas off the pod and grow sunflowers. I . just don't want to lose it.' Mr Stone said he will do everything he can to keep the plot which has become a 'huge part' of his life. He said: 'The letter broke my spirit, if I'm honest. I've had no response from  the Council, and the thought of having to leave is absolutely devastating. 'At the moment I am digging my heels in until someone puts pen to paper and  informs me what's happening. 'I plan to fight my cause, but I hope common sense will prevail. I feel  helpless. I'm just an ordinary man who enjoys growing and planting things, but  I'm here every week, and my allotment is a huge part of my life.' The Council has said it has revamped its allotment services, speeding up the  process of transforming derelict or vacant sites to reduce waiting lists. Devastated: Mr Stone, pictured in his plot, goes to the allotment every week and says he doesn't want to lose such a 'huge part' of his life . Waiting game: Mr Stone has sent a letter of appeal to the council but has still not been told whether it was successful . But Jane Robinson, from the Bradford Community Environment Project, which  allocates temporary starter plots at the Scotchman Road allotments in  Manningham, said that while recent improvements in certain council services had  been welcomed, communication problems still existed. 'We all want uncultivated plots to be moved on swiftly, but the process has to  be effective,' she said. 'This case emphasises how important it is to be careful and get things right. Some long-standing plot holders who have received warnings about their level  of cultivation felt the letters were both unprecedented and heavy-handed.' Belinda Gaynor, Bradford Council's operational estate manager, said 32  tenancies had been terminated so far during 2013/14, with approximately ten of  those evictions leading to appeals. 'There are waiting lists for council allotments and we have a duty to make sure  that those who have plots are actually working them,' she said. Prior to any termination notice being issued plot holders are given a written  warning and advised that improvement is required. Ms Gaynor continued: 'The termination of Mr Stone's tenancy will be put on hold to allow time for  his appeal to be determined.'

'The stolen items included a ring and a glass frame containing Napoleon's hair, a ribbon inscribed by Napoleon in 1815 and a snuff box.' The thieves removed outside blinds and entered through a bathroom of the historic Briars Park homestead in Mount Martha on Thursday night. The museum said the collection was put together by descendants of Englishman Alexander Balcombe, who met Napoleon when he was exiled on the tiny South Atlantic island of St Helena from 1815 until the emperor's death six years later. Balcombe, who settled in Australia in 1846, had 'sat on Napoleon's knee as a little boy', museum coordinator Steve York told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Valuable: Ten items were stolen from the museum on Thursday nights - including these lockets . 'The family were good friends with the emperor when he was sent into exile on St Helena,' he added. Ten items were stolen from the collection, including locks of Napoleon's hair and a silver inkwell set with three gold Napoleon coins which were allegedly in his pocket when he died. Miniature portraits of Napoleon and Josephine were also stolen. 'Really they're priceless because they can't be replaced. We're quite distraught,' York said. The rest of the collection of nearly 500 pieces has now been re-located for safety. Police said the robbery appeared to have lasted just 10 minutes and been a targeted theft. 'We think it's probably destined for a private collection. It could well be stolen to order,' Detective Sergeant Michael Lamb told ABC.","Thieves entered The Briars historic homestead through bathroom window .

"A police box identical to the Doctor Who Tardis has been unveiled by officers as their latest weapon to fight crime. The 5ft by 5ft navy blue phone boxes were a common sight across Britain in the 1920s when they were used by the public to contact the police. But they were scrapped in the 1960s due to the widespread availability of the telephone and they are now more well known for being the disguise for Dr Who's famous time machine. Now Dorset Police have erected a newly-built 10ft-tall police phone box - complete with a blue flashing light on top - in a shopping precinct in Boscombe, Bournemouth. Step back in time: Dorset Police have unveiled a new police phone box which will be manned by officers. Pictured are Assistant Chief Constable David Lewis, Inspector Chris Weeks, Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill and Sergeant Chris Amey . Super fans: Doctor Who fans dressed up as characters from the TV series for the launch of a new Doctor Who-style Tardis police box in Boscombe . Talking point: Police claim the new phone box will act as an 'engagement point' between police officers and members of the public . Standing guard: Police officers won't actually sit in the phone box but will instead be found standing nearby . The steel-framed construction will be manned by a police officer between 10am and 6pn Monday to Saturday.  There is a telephone located on the outside of the box for people to use to contact the police out of hours. As well as being a point of contact for the public, police hope their 'Tardis' will also act as a deterrent to criminals and attract tourists, especially Dr Who fans. The construction has 'Police Box' painted on the top and an A4 sized notice attached to the front, just like the one in the BBC sci-fi drama. The sign reads: 'Police telephone free for use of public. Advice and assistance obtainable immediately. Officers and cars respond to all calls. Pull to open.' Fighting crime: The police phone box has been opened in Boscombe, Bournemouth, so members of the public can use it to speak to officers or report crimes. Pictured are MP Tobias Ellwood with Insp Chris Weeks and Sgt Chris Amey . Port of call: The 5ft by 5ft police phone box is 10ft tall and will be manned by officers between the hours of 10am and 6pm Monday to Saturday . Community spirit: Dorset Police hope the phone box will help deter crime and encourage tourism. Children are pictured surrounding a dalek at the official opening of the new 'Tardis' style box . Inside the box there is a first aid kit, a shelf, two plug sockets and an electric heater. A separate external compartment reveals a bright yellow telephone for people to use in an emergency. The project has been funded by donations from several local businesses. Inspector Chris Weeks, from Dorset Police, said: 'Boscombe precinct is an area that has suffered with anti-social behaviour and criminality. 'We had to do something and we thought why not come up with s police box idea with a 1920s design that we thought would fit the precinct well. Official opening: Sgt Chris Amey, Partnership and Regeneration  Officer for Boscombe, gives a talk at the opening of the new police phone box . Back to basics: Inside the phone box there is only a first aid kit, a shelf, two plug sockets and an electric heater . First visitors: Excited children inspect the inside of the new police phone box which has been opened in the middle of a busy high street . 'We are looking forward to the positive impact this is going to have in relation to public engagement and reducing crime. 'We will endeavour to have a member of staff with the police box as much as is operationally possible during the trading hours in the precinct.' Nick Joy, a Doctor Who fan from Bournemouth, came to watch the Police Box being launched. He said: 'I grew up in a time when people only saw the police box on Doctor Who, we never actually knew it had a practical application. 'So the fact it has gone full circle and is to be used as a police box is brilliant.' Finding fame: The police telephone box has become better known as the exterior disguise for Dr Who's Tardis - pictured left in the 1970s show starring Jon Pertwee and pictured right in the 2005 series starring Christopher Eccleston . Deterrent: The phone box will serve as a new police office to help the town confront anti-social behaviour . Retro: Police phone boxes were a common sight in Britain in the 1920s but most were closed in the 1960s when telephones became more readily available . Replica: The navy blue phone box also has an a4-sized notice on the outside - just like the Tardis in Dr Who . Piece of history: An original police phone box in Scarborough, North Yorkshire . The first ever public police telephone boxes in Britain were introduced in Glasgow in 1891. They were then brought in across the rest of the UK in the 1920s so members of the public could report an emergency. They were designed differently to ordinary telephone boxes, as the phone was located behind a hinged door, and could be used from outside the box. The inside of the box was effectively a miniature police station which officers could use to collect first aid kits, pick up supplies or take down reports. As telephones were not readily available in the 1920s, the police phone box was a vital link between communities and their nearest police station. The typical police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary. They also normally contained a stool, a table, brushes and dusters, a fire extinguisher, and a small electric heater. A light on top of the box would flash to alert nearby officers that they had to contact the station. By 1953 there were 685 police boxes on the streets of London. Police boxes were usually blue, except in Glasgow, where they were red until the late 1960s. Police phone boxes started to be taken out of service from the late 1960s onwards as telephones became more widely accessible and officers began carrying two-way radios rather than relying on fixed kiosks. Today the image of the blue police box is more widely associated with Doctor Who's time machine, the Tardis, which takes the shape of a 1960s British police box.","Police phone boxes were a common sight across Britain in the 1920s .

"Ordeal: Connie Brooker, 31, was threatened that her 15-month-old daughter Freya would be taken into care if she couldn't explain how she suffered burns while at nursery . A couple were threatened with having their daughter taken into care after they took her to A&E with third degree burns she suffered while at nursery. Connie and Terry Brooker rushed their 15-month-old daughter Freya to hospital after they picked her up from nursery and found she had severe blisters and burns on her fingers that staff couldn’t explain. But when the couple, from Gloucester, told doctors they didn’t know how Freya had been injured, medics refused to let her go home with them. It was only when social services stepped in and Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery in Quedgeley, Gloucester, admitted liability for Freya’s injuries that the couple were allowed to take their daughter home. Nursery nurse Mrs Brooker, 31, said: 'It was our worst nightmare come true. We didn’t know what had happened when Freya was at nursery but she came out with burns on her hand. 'We just wanted to get her poor little hand sorted and suddenly we were the ones under suspicion.' Gloucestershire County Council spokesperson said said it is working closely with Ofsted in the wake of the incident and 'regular nursery inspections are taking place'. But the council refused to say whether social services could still remove Freya from her parents. Mrs Brooker picked up her daughter Freya from nursery school to find two of her fingers were blistered and red raw. She asked staff at Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery what had happened, but claims she was told the toddler was fine and the injuries were from Freya sucking on her fingers. Mrs and Mr Brooker, 33, a machine operator, were not convinced and sought advice from a local nurse who suspected it was a burn but told the couple to leave it 24 hours. But when her blisters worsened they rushed straight to A&E at Gloucester Royal Hospital where staff told them that if they couldn’t explain what happened to cause Freya’s injuries, she would be taken away from them and placed in the care of social services. It was only when social services visited the nursery that staff admitted Freya had burned her hand in their care. Freya was then released back into her parents' care. Horrific injuries: Connie and Terry Brooker took their daughter Freya to . A&E after their daughter suffered burns and blisters, pictured . above, to her hand while at nursery school. Staff at Gloucester Royal Hospital then refused to let Freya return home with her parents until the cause of the injuries has been explained . Admission: It was only when Teddy Bear's Picnic Day Nursery in Gloucester admitted liabilities for Freya's injuries that she was allowed back into her parents' care . Mrs Brooker said: 'It was a relief to . hear the nursery admit liability but it did not relieve the distress . about how my baby had been burnt.' Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundations Trust insists hospital staff were just following protocol. A spokesman said: 'When a child arrives at our Emergency Department with injuries, we answer a series of set questions on the front of that child’s patient records. 'These questions will look at whether there has been a delay in seeking treatment, if there are unusual or multiple injuries, a history of injury or confusion about how the injury occurred. 'If unclear, then the assessing doctor or practitioner will ask further questions and may seek assistance from a senior colleague or on occasion, to social care colleagues. 'It is important to emphasise that this is no reflection on parents or responsible adults who bring in their injured child for treatment, but we believe parents will understand the need to ensure that children are safe to be discharged following treatment. 'We cannot comment on this particular case, but if the family have any concerns about their experience, we would encourage them to get in touch with our Patient Advice and Liaison Team to enable us to look into those concerns.' Distressing: Connie and Terry Brooker, pictured with their daughter Freya, described their experience at hospital as their 'worst nightmare come true' Unexplained: Teddy Bear's Picnic Day Nursery conducted a week long inquiry into Freya's burns but is still unable to say how she got them . Freya was referred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where she was treated for third degree burns to her fingers. Mrs . Brooker said: 'For the nursery to suggest that her third degree burns . were a result of her sucking her fingers was just ludicrous.' The couple are still in the dark about what actually happened to their child, who has been left with scarring. Mrs Brooker said: 'Freya wasn’t showing . many signs of distress initially but this is because it turns out her . hand was so badly burnt she had lost feeling in it. 'I don’t understand how something . like this can happen at a nursery and go unnoticed. I just want someone . to explain what has happened to my daughter.' On the mend: Freya, pictured, was treated for third degree burns at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol . Teddy . Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery has admitted liability for Freya’s injuries . and conducted a week long inquiry into the incident but no reason . for her injuries has been supplied. She . said: 'It was first suggested by the nursery that Freya was burned by . her baby food, but the reports from the day recorded all the food . temperature and this possibility was discounted by the consultant at . Frenchay due to the nature of the burn.' Another suggestion was Freya burnt her hand on an exposed radiator pipe, but Mrs Brooker claims the the burns consultant said her daughter’s hand would have to have been pressed against the pipe for a long time to sustain her injuries. Mrs Brooker said: 'We hate the thought of anything happening to our daughter, and other children while in the care of nurseries and we just want to know what happened so we can prevent it happening again. 'We have been through hell with this. My daughter has been left with scars on her hand and she is too young . to tell us what happened. 'It . is not acceptable for these incidents to be dismissed as a result of . normal baby behaviour and we just want to get to the bottom of it.' Mr Brooker said: 'We have had only had verbal apologies, nothing in writing. It really is not good enough.' The couple have consulted solicitors and are now pursuing legal action against Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery and the police are investigating further. A . spokesperson from Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day nursery said: 'We are working . with all relevant authorities in respect of the investigation. 'As the proceedings are ongoing, we are unable to comment further.' A . spokesperson from Gloucestershire Police, said: 'Our public protection . bureau is currently investigating the cause of an injury to a child at a . nursery in Quedgeley. 'No . arrests have been made in connection with the case and as inquiries are . ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.' Unknown cause: Several possible causes for Freya's burns have been suggested by the nursery - including that she was burnt by her baby food or by an exposed radiator .

"Tragic: Robert Berry, 42, collapsed at the finish line of the London Marathon and was later pronounced dead at hospital . A keen runner who collapsed and died at the finishing line of the London Marathon had spoken of his breathing difficulties the week before the race, it has been revealed. Robert Berry, 42, was given medical attention immediately after finishing the race but was pronounced dead at hospital yesterday. IT worker Mr Berry, of Newbury, Berkshire, was an experienced runner who hoped to run the route in less than three hours and 20 minutes. But the father-of-two kept a blog which detailed the breathing difficulties he was suffering in the lead-up to the race. On April 6, he described having to use his inhaler three times in a week, when he usually only needed it three times a year. He wrote: 'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year. 'Today started out very slow and breathing a big struggle but it got much better as the run went on and I finished 12.5 miles. Feeling strong. Last week before the Marathon.' Earlier that week he had written that his breathing was 'still not too good'. He wrote: 'Yesterday I did a gentle five miles as my breathing still not too good and knees a little achy. 'Today on the other hand my eyes were itching, nose running and breathing a big struggle, also in the office all day after the gym. 'Was talking to Nicola from the National Osteoporosis Society via email and she seems to think this is not hay fever but due to pollution and the dust from the Sahara. Hope so as I don't want to be running like this during the Marathon.' Mr Berry, who leaves behind wife Gwen, daughter Hannah, 12, and son Martin, 10, was running the race to raise money for the National Osteoporosis Society after his mother Ann, 72, was diagnosed with osteoporosis 20 years ago. Fundraising: Robert Berry, pictured at the Windsor Half Marathon in September, was running the Marathon to raise funds for the National Osteoporosis Society after his mother was diagnosed with the condition . Mr Berry wrote on his fundraising page: 'I'm running the London Marathon in support of the National Osteoporosis Society for the support given to my mother who was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 52 but whose current condition (we found out later) was triggered from a lifting incident at the age of 47. 'Because of the stress on her lower back, two sets of bones in her lower spine collapsed.' In . a touching message on his own website, he added: 'This page is . dedicated to my mum, who despite being diagnosed with osteoporosis at . the relatively early age of 52 years, has been an inspiration through . the continued positive outlook she has displayed ever since, despite . some quite clear discomfort.' He had completed a half marathon in . an hour and 30 minutes in September last year and achieved a time of two . hours, 36 minutes and 53 seconds at a 21-mile event in March.

"A drug dealer was caught by police after he posed for a picture next to his crop of cannabis plants - and then used it as his mobile phone screensaver. Nicholas Waine, 27, thought he was so untouchable he grinned for the incriminating snap as he was harvesting a marijuana farm he was growing in a suburban house. But the smile was wiped off his face after police seized his mobile phone during raids and spotted the photo of him sat on a stool and grinning for ear to ear as he held out his yield with a pair of scissors placed on his lap. Busted: Nicholas Waine, 27, has been jailed for conspiracy to supply drugs after police found this picture of him covered in cannabis on his mobile phone . It emerged he had served a previous prison stretch for robbery after he was a member of a gang which robbed a branch of the Halifax bank while armed with a Samurai sword. Officers have now revealed how they used the drugs image to help put Waine behind bars for a further four years and eight months. His partner-in-crime Jack Yarwood, 28, was also jailed for four years and eight months. Their accomplice Wayne Keron, 49, was jailed for two years. All admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and Yarwood also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis with intent to supply. Police said Yarwood and Waine, both . from Sale, Greater Manchester, were well-known drug dealers in the . suburb andy used Keron’s home as a hideout to cut up the drugs. But . their crime empire began to crumble in May 2012 when police found an . abandoned silver Mazda that had been crashed on a street. Inside were two mobile phones belonging to Waine and Yarwood containing text messages about previous drug deals, along with a drug debtors list. Officers then raided Yarwood’s home, where officers found cannabis stashed in a black bin bag in the freezer. They also found cocaine in Yarwood’s trousers, a jacket hanging up in the hall and on a shelf in a kitchen cupboard. Another debtors list was concealed in the boiler cupboard. More mobile phones were also found showing that Waine and Yarwood were involved in dealing drugs. Behind bars: Nicholas Waine, pictured left in . 2006 when he was jailed for robbery and right earlier this year, has now . been sentenced to another four years and eight months in prison for . conspiracy to supply drugs . As the investigation unfolded in the coming months, officers acting on a tip off raided Keron’s home on 22 February 2013. As . officers went through the door, Keron, Waine and Yarwood were found sitting . around a jug full of white powder - approximately 1/4kg - which was . later revealed to be cocaine cut with an adulterant called benzocaine. Further . evidence was found throughout the house that the trio had been cutting . up drugs, including a blender and a drugs press. Waine and Yarwood’s . fingerprints were found on a number of the items. In . one of the bedrooms, officers found further bags of cocaine, cannabis . and electronic scales and a large amount of benzocaine, indicating the . group intended to continue cutting drugs at the address. More . mobile phones were also seized showing an extensive drug dealing . business. They included Waine’s personal phone which was found to have . the incriminating image. In . 2006, Waine was sentenced to five years four months after he pleaded . guilty to robbery. He had also been quizzed over an attack on a football . fan in a pub in which a stool was thrown at his head resulting in him . requiring eight stitches. After . a hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court today, Manchester, Det Sgt . Patrick Goodrich of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Waine and Yarwood . were well-known drug dealers in this area. 'From . the overwhelming amount of evidence we recovered, it was clear they ran . an extensive and potentially lucrative drug-dealing operation. Partners in crime: Jack Yarwood, 28, pictured left, and Wayne Keron, 49, pictured right, have also been jailed for conspiracy to supply drugs . 'They used Keron’s home as their hideout from which to cut up the drugs into smaller quantities and sell on to make significant profit. 'And when we went through the doors, we quite literally caught these men red-handed, with fingerprints all over the drugs and cutting paraphernalia. 'Mobile phone analysis not only showed that Waine and Yarwood were close friends, but the sheer volume of text messages about drug debts and deals showed this sort of criminality was their way of life, and their way of making money. 'These convictions are a fantastic result for Greater Manchester Police because two determined drug dealers are now behind bars, but more than anything it is a victory for the community who, for too long, have had to put up with the likes of Yarwood and Waine mistakenly thinking that can ""run"" this part of Sale West and act with impunity. 'Drug dealers like these can all too often cause misery and hardship among law-abiding residents who may be too scared to speak up for fear of reprisals. 'With these men off the streets, we have not only made a huge dent into the supply of drugs in this area but also sent a powerful message that no-one is above the law. 'Greater Manchester Police will work hand-in-hand with residents to remove these corrosive elements from our communities and make them safer places.'","Nicholas Waine happily grinned at the camera while harvesting cannabis .

"A seven-year-old boy crashed headfirst into a wall after the throttle on his £300 quad bike jammed. Cody Watts had just jumped onto the electric cart when the throttle 'jammed', sending the machine hurtling towards his house.Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, . The entire incident was captured on CCTV - showing the moment the youngster slammed into the sidewall at the top speed of 13mph. His face took the full impact as he was catapulted into the brickwork but luckily he was wearing a Star Wars helmet which protected his head. Cody was taken to hospital where he was given the all-clear except for his grazed knuckles and a bruised knee. Moment of impact: CCTV captured the moment Cody Watts went headfirst into the sidewall of his home after the throttle on his quad bike jammed . Lucky escape: Cody Watts was wearing a full-face helmet when he hit the wall so escaped any head injuries . His father Geoff, 34, who runs a business coaching company, said: 'He was very shocked - he's a really nice kid and his first reaction was to say sorry for breaking the wall and the bike.' Cody was given the £315 Electric Mini Quad Fun Bike by his grandfather as a sixth birthday present. The 800 watt 36 volt electric motor boasts three speeds - 5mph, 8mph and 13mph - and is recommended for children aged six to 12 years. Cody has used the machine to race around his parents' quarter-acre back garden in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, without incident for the last 18 months. But when he hopped on it last Saturday it suddenly shot backwards out of the shed as soon as he switched it on. The quad smashed into the playhouse - knocking off the roof - and a panicked Cody then put the machine into 'forwards'. But the bike then shot forward at full speed and slammed into the house. Out of control: Cody put his quad bike into 'forwards' mode but it then shot off at full speed . Powerful: The 800 watt electric quad bike then headed straight towards the sidewall of Cody's family home in Cheltenham . Caught on camera: CCTV footage shows the moment Cody hit the wall headfirst . Protected: Cody's helmet protected his head so he only suffered grazed knuckles and a bruised knee . His mother Alison said: 'He was helping his dad paint the shed but when he got bored with that he got the quad bike out. 'As he got it out he put it in reverse and it shot backwards and hit our wendy house. 'I assume he thought he'd done something wrong so he put it into drive and it just shot forwards. 'The throttle stuck, he couldn't move it back into neutral and it propelled him forward and only stopped when it hit the wall.' The whole incident was captured on the CCTV system installed at their home. Alison, who carries out administrative work for her husband's company, added: 'When I saw the video I was really shocked. 'I wasn't here when it happened and children can be quite dramatic but when I saw it I thought thank god my husband took him to A&E. We feel very lucky.' Birthday present: Cody, pictured with his mother Alison, got the bike for his sixth birthday. It worked perfectly for 18 months until the throttle jammed on Saturday . Warning: Cody's family are now urging all parents to make sure their children wear full-face helmets when using quad bikes . Mother-of-two Alison, 35, is now urging other parents to make sure their children wear full-face helmets. She said: 'He used to wear just his bike helmet but as he got more confident we insisted he wear a full-face one. 'Luckily he quite liked it and was happy to wear it because he thought it made him look like someone out of Star Wars. 'The side of his head took most of the impact and if he hadn't been wearing the big helmet we're pretty sure he'd have broken his jaw or cheekbone.' Alison and Geoff say the bike is still jammed in 'full speed' mode as soon as it is switched on and Cody's grandfather is due to alert Fun Bikes to the issue. Fun Bikes have declined to comment on the matter.","Cody Watts got the £315 Electric Mini Quad Fun Bike for his sixth birthday .

"Unhappy: Matthew Quinn, pictured with his girlfriend Jacqueline Scott, wants to sue the producers of The Jeremy Kyle Show for making him 'look bad' A violent boyfriend who appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show to confront the girlfriends he tormented is now trying to sue the producers for making him 'look bad'. Matthew Quinn, 25, went on the ITV show twice - his first appearance on an episode called 'You'll beat and abandon your fiancee... just like you did me!' and the second time as part of a love-triangle. But the serial-womaniser believes the editing of his latest appearance on the show - called 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out our house!' - vilified him and he is now trying to find a lawyer to take on his case. The part-time singer told the Daily Record: 'It was all supposed to be about me confronting my ex. Then Jeremy started having a go at me and I was like, ""What the hell"". 'I . didn’t think I would be portrayed like that. I’m looking for . compensation. If they want to settle out of court, I’ll settle out of . court. If they want to humiliate themselves, they can be my guest and go . to court.' Quinn, . who has been engaged four times in the last three years, first appeared . on The Jeremy Kyle Show on an episode called 'You'll beat and abandon . your fiancee... just like you did me!' in April 2012 when he proposed to . his then girlfriend Alice Peters. His . appearance came shortly after he was given a two-and-a-half year . Community Payback Order at court for punching Ms Peters in the head in . January 2012. He will be sentenced this month for breaching the order. Ms Peters last night expressed her disgust at Quinn's attempt to get money off the back of his appearances on the show. She . told the Record: 'He is the lowest of the low. I lived in fear of him. It is a scandal he is trying to get money because of the way he beats up . women.' Ms Peters says she was attacked by . Quinn on a weekly basis during their relationship and they went on The . Jeremy Kyle Show to address his violent outbursts. 'Vilified': Matthew Quinn, 25, has twice appeared on The Jeremy Kyle . Show. He is pictured on his most recent appearance in a February . episode entitled: 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out of . our house!' Claims: Quinn, pictured second from the right, says he only went on the show for a second time in February to confront his ex girlfriend Laura Lynskey, pictured left, over cheating on him but was instead made out to be the 'bad one' His . first fiancee Sonja Colognori, who he dated for two months in 2011, . also went on the show and revealed how she broke up with Quinn after he . hit her in the face. Quinn admitted attacking both women 'in self-defence', adding: 'Isn’t a person allowed to make mistakes?' During the show, Quinn also proposed to Ms Peters and was immediately ridiculed by Kyle. Quinn responded: 'What will it take? I am a wife-beater and I need help.' But Quinn now claims the producers put him up to the proposal. He . said: 'The producers bought me a wee stupid Argos ring and said the . best thing to do after I’d been confronted was to get down on one knee . and propose.' His relationship with Alice ended in March last year. A month later, Quinn moved in with Laura Lynskey, 20, and they were engaged by June. History: Quinn, pictured on the February show with his current girlfriend Jacqueline Scott, previously went on Jeremy Kyle for an episode about domestic violence in 2012 . Admissions: Quinn, pictured on Jeremy Kyle in February, previously admitted physically attacking two of his partners in 'self-defence' when he last appeared on the show in 2012 . In October, a friend of Ms Lynskey's, . Jacqueline Scott, also 20, moved in with the couple at their flat in . Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. Quinn then split from Ms Lynskey after she allegedly cheated on him and he started dating Ms Scott in November. Quinn . and Ms Scott then got engaged while they were still living with Ms . Lynskey. All three then appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show on a programme . titled: 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out our house!' in . February. Quinn told . the Record he intended to confront Ms Lynskey on the show for cheating . on him but the Jeremy Kyle rounded on him instead. Both woman agree that the show’s editing vilified Quinn. A . spokesman for The Jeremy Kyle Show said: 'Mr Quinn has made no . complaint to us and our records show he both signed a consent form and . saw our aftercare team following the show.

"For . decades, Helen Campbell suffered from heavy periods and nosebleeds. Her . periods could last for 21 days and, as a result, she developed severe . anaemia, leaving her exhausted. Then, one morning in 2007, she . suffered a nosebleed so severe, she had to be rushed to hospital for a . blood transfusion. She had woken up to find her top drenched in blood. 'I'd had a nosebleed in the night, but this was no ordinary nosebleed; . it looked like a scene from a horror film,' says Helen, 42, a former NHS . administrator from Leeds. Usually, if Helen suffered nosebleeds . during the night as she slept on her back, the blood draining into her . throat would choke her, making her wake up in time. Scroll down for video . Helen Campbell from Leeds, West Yorkshire, who has blood clottiong disorder von Willebrand disease . 'This time, I'd . slept on my front. Normally, I'd lose about a third of a pint of blood; . that morning, it looked like I'd been bleeding for hours. The top . quarter of the bed was drenched in blood, which soaked the pillows, . bedding, mattress, even the carpet. 'I staggered to the bathroom, but . started feeling faint. Seconds later, I collapsed and passed out.' Helen had lost five pints of blood. doctors said if she'd stayed asleep . much longer she could have bled to death. Helen has von Willebrand . disease, the most common type of blood-clotting disorder. Similar to . haemophilia, it is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means . the blood doesn't clot. But, unlike haemophilia, which mainly affects . men, this also affects a significant number of women, and an estimated 1 . per cent of the population, around 650,000 Britons, have it. Those . affected are particularly at risk after surgery, childbirth or injury, . when they can bleed excessively. Symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding . gums, bruising easily and heavy periods. Women tend to suffer more due . to the bleeding during periods, which also raises risk of anaemia. Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means the blood doesn't clot . Up . to one in five women with heavy periods may have a blood-clotting . problem, and between 10 and 15 per cent of them will have von Willebrand . disease, says Michael Laffan, professor of haemostasis and thrombosis . at Imperial College London. 'Lots of women soldier on with heavy . periods, thinking flooding, passing clots and periods for weeks are . normal,' he says. 'This is frustrating, as treatments to reduce blood . flow are available. But a von Willebrand disease diagnosis will not . occur to most GPs, and awareness is even variable in gynaecology . clinics. 'Doctors tend to only think of haemophilia when it comes to . blood-clotting disorders, and that mainly affects men. Potentially . thousands of people, particularly women, could have this condition and . would benefit from diagnosis and treatment.' Liz Carroll, chief . executive of the Haemophilia Society, a charity for people with bleeding . disorders, says there may be tens of thousands of people with . undiagnosed, untreated von Willebrand disease: 'Some experts estimate . nine out of ten cases are undiagnosed.' There are three types of von . Willebrand disease. It is caused by deficiency in a blood protein called . von Willebrand factor (vWF). With types 1 and 2, patients have low . levels of the protein; this is not life-threatening, but can cause long, . heavy periods, bruising, bleeding gums and bleeding after injury or . surgery. Type 3, which Helen has, is most serious, as patients have . no vWF; left untreated, it can be fatal. Von Willebrand disease is . diagnosed with blood tests to measure vWF levels; more than one test is . needed as levels vary with stress and activity. Treatments for heavy . periods include the contraceptive pill, the Mirena coil (a contraceptive . device fitted inside the uterus which releases progesterone, a hormone . that thins the womb lining and reduces menstrual flow) and a drug, . tranexamic acid, which reduces blood flow by encouraging clotting. Another . option is a nasal spray of desmopressin, an artificial version of the . hormone vasopressin, which boosts the release of stored vWF. it can be . used to control bleeding in an emergency, or self-administered on the . heaviest days of a period. Other treatments include endometrial . ablation, where a layer of the womb lining is removed to reduce abnormal . bleeding, or drugs to induce a temporary menopause. Patients with . type 3 need injections of vWF; in severe cases, this is given as a . preventative treatment. Helen was diagnosed at two, when her adoptive . mother noticed she bruised easily and bled excessively.  'I bled into my . joints in childhood and was on crutches and in callipers from age six . to 12, as it was too painful to bear weight on my joints,' Helen says. 'It became a nightmare when my periods started at 13. They lasted 21 . days and I'd feel so faint and dizzy, I couldn't go to school. 'I . developed severe anaemia, which made me exhausted and affected my . concentration. I was prescribed tranexamic acid and, although it helped . with nosebleeds and gum bleeding, it didn't improve my periods or joint . bleeds.' At times, her anaemia has been so severe, she's been too . breathless to walk up stairs and had a heart murmur and palpitations, . where levels of haemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that . transports oxygen around the body) drop so low, the body is deprived of . oxygen, and heart and lungs must work harder. Helen can now self-inject blood-clotting products every 48 hours . Helen nearly died at . ages seven, 32 and 34 because of excessive blood loss during periods . and/or nosebleeds. Each time, she received blood transfusions and was . injected with blood-clotting products. 'There wasn't any preventative . treatment given then. Now, I can self-inject blood-clotting products . every 48 hours to reduce the severity of bleeds.' Helen also had an . endometrial ablation in 2011 which has improved her symptoms. Kelly . Ridley, 37, has type 2 and says even this can be debilitating. The . office manager, who lives in Wakefield with her husband and daughters, . says her life was ruled by heavy periods for more than 20 years. She was . diagnosed at seven when blood tests during a bout of measles detected a . clotting issue. 'My main symptoms were nosebleeds and bruising . easily,' she says. 'When my periods started they were heavy and lasted . three weeks. I tried many drug treatments through my teens and 20s, . including the Pill and tranexamic acid, but nothing helped.' Before . and after she gave birth, Kelly needed infusions of clotting factor so . she didn't bleed heavily after birth. Three years ago, she had an . endometrial ablation, but she still has nosebleeds and bruises easily. 'Even now, having a tooth out requires a five-day hospital stay, as I . need treatment with clotting factors. I can't take anti-inflammatory . painkillers, including ibuprofen and aspirin, as there is a risk these . drugs can cause bleeding in my stomach.' As Liz Carroll says, while . symptoms are not usually life-threatening, 'they can massively affect . quality of life. heavy periods can have a big impact: some women get . very tired and anaemic, others won't leave the house as they are scared . of leaks, affecting school and work'. 'Other type 1 and type 2 . patients, including men, may have no symptoms. but it's still important . to get a diagnosis so they can be treated with clotting factor . injections if they have a serious bleed.' Debra Pollard, lead nurse . in haemophilia at the Royal Free Hospital, London, says heavy periods . alone wouldn't warrant investigation for bleeding disorder. 'But if . you've had heavy periods from the first one, suffer nosebleeds, . prolonged bleeding from injuries or dental work, bleeding gums or bruise . easily, then being referred for investigation may be advisable, . particularly if family members have similar symptoms.' talkingred.org/bleeding-disorders .","Helen Campbell, 42, from Leeds, suffered from heavy bleeding for years .

"Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago . When . Annette Lewn's children were young, she longed to join in the chats . with other mothers at toddler group coffee mornings, but always felt . like an outsider. 'I desperately wanted to be part of the group, but I . never seemed to say the right thing and I'd get funny looks from . people,' says Annette, 42, a school cleaner who lives in Chippenham, . Wiltshire, with her son Ryan, 15, and daughter Rachel, 14. 'I just don't . pick up on social niceties at all,' she adds. Annette has often . been criticised for being rude or blunt, although she never intends to . be, and the criticism upsets her greatly. 'When I was a teenager I . remember a friend asking me what I thought of her new make-up. She . obviously thought she looked great, but I said she looked like she'd . upset a paint box all over her face. Everyone else just stared at me in . disbelief.' Annette had friends 'but found the reality of having to make conversation stressful, and I'd long to go home and be alone'. Meanwhile, teachers would scold her for not making eye contact. 'I . could mask my personality traits by copying the behaviour of others, . but I just didn't pick up the cues for what was appropriate; it required . huge effort,' recalls Annette. As well as her lack of social skills, Annette's hobbies set her apart. While most of her . friends plastered their walls with pop star posters, she was obsessed . with maps, and stuck her collection of 30 or so all around her bed. Then, . five years ago in her late 30s, Annette discovered the cause of her . quirky behaviour traits. She has Asperger's syndrome, sometimes referred . to as a 'mild' form of autism. Autism is a spectrum disorder . affecting how a person makes sense of the world, processes information . and relates to other people. At one end of the spectrum, some with . Asperger's can often hold down jobs, marry and - on the surface, at . least - live a normal life. But their symptoms can still cause a lot of . distress, with problems in relationships and at school and work. There . are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in Britain, according . to The National Autistic Society, with more being diagnosed. Asperger's . is much more common in men, although experts are beginning to wonder if . this is simply because the symptoms are harder to recognise in women. Annette Lewns, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, has also been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome . Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. For . years she'd thought her difficulties - she was nicknamed 'Susie Simple' at school - had been caused by complications at birth. She'd also . suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact, . making her feel 'different' and 'an outsider' throughout her childhood. In fact, these were signs of Asperger's. 'Many people with . Asperger's want to be sociable, but have difficulties making friends and . struggle to maintain them,' explains Dr Judith Gould, of the National . Autistic Society. 'They don't understand the unwritten social rules . and can appear aloof or behave inappropriately. This can make them . depressed and cause them to withdraw.' The condition is 'particularly . difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at . masking their symptoms than males, says Dr Gould. 'They know they are . different, but still want to fit in and make friends, and so will learn . how to ""act"" in social situations. Men can do this, too, but they don't . care as much about fitting in and don't tend to need to be as sociable . as women. 'Girls also tend to be more passive than boys with . Asperger's, who are usually more aggressive. Consequently, it's easier . to detect it in boys. 'The strain of trying to work out how to behave . and interact can make women anxious, and this can often be misdiagnosed . as depression or they will develop an eating disorder. They may obsess . about counting every calorie, for example, or how much exercise they can . do.' Developing obsessional interests is another common Asperger's trait. 'Girls . might, for instance, develop an obsession with a celebrity, a soap . opera, horses or Barbie dolls,' says Dr Gould. 'What will stand out, . though, is the intensity of that interest or the rituals of how their . collections will be displayed. Perfectionism is another common trait. And a love of strict routines.'What causes it is not clear, though . research using MRI brain scans has shown differences in specific areas . of the brains of children who have Asperger's, including the frontal . lobe which controls our ability to control and moderate our behaviour. The condition is 'more difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking symptoms . Asperger's . was formally recognised by the World Health Organisation as a distinct . condition only in 1994. Therefore, many adults, such as Susan Boyle and . Annette, are only just now getting a diagnosis. 'There are various . red flags that an experienced clinician will pick up on, such as a lack . of interest in people in childhood,' says Dr Gould. Most of those . with Asperger's have average or above-average intelligence. But . typically, girls with Asperger's will underachieve at school unless a . teacher nurtures them, says Dr Gould. 'They have intelligence, but not . social intelligence: they don't pick up on the whole picture. 'Many . will go on to struggle in a work situation because, although they can . focus on the job, they can't do the social chit-chat which can help them . fit in and get on.' After leaving school Annette worked at a care . home, and although she loved the routine, she found getting on with her . colleagues difficult. 'It baffled me - I just didn't know what I was . doing wrong,' she says. 'I knew I was different, but I just thought it . was my fault and that I wasn't the popular type.' In her 20s Annette met her husband Russell, a firefighter, now 44 (the couple have since separated). 'He carried me in social situations. I felt safe with him,' says Annette. 'I still struggled with female friendships, though.' Then, when their son Ryan was three-and-a-half years old, he was diagnosed with Asperger's.'Luckily, . I never had a problem bonding with the children,' says Annette. 'But . before Ryan's diagnosis, I had wondered if his behaviour was my fault. I . even went to parenting classes.' After their daughter Rachel's . diagnosis at the age of nine, Annette wondered if she herself had it, . too, as Rachel's behaviour was so similar to her own. 'I started . doing more research and took an online diagnosis test for Asperger's and . scored quite high,' says Annette. 'It was a wake-up call. 'My GP . said there was no point getting a diagnosis, but I knew through my . experience with my children that the right support can make a . difference. I was eventually diagnosed in 2011, but only after being . referred to a psychiatrist for depression by my GP. 'It was a great relief to finally find out why I'd always felt like an outsider.' Tom . Madders, head of campaigns at the National Autistic Society, says the . problem is that the condition is often not spotted. He adds: 'Only 63 of . 152 local authorities have a diagnostic pathway in place - a set route . for GPs to refer on to a specialist so people with suspected Asperger's . can be assessed.' Once the condition is diagnosed, the charity runs . courses on social skills, a befriending scheme as well as providing . information on employment and other training. Since Annette's . diagnosis, she has completed a maths qualification, taken a cognitive . behavioural therapy course to help with her anxiety and now works as a . volunteer mentor in a school. 'My confidence has improved and I can . finally explain to people why I might come across the way I do,' explains Annette. 'I'd love to work in education - and I think with . support I could study for qualifications. 'All we ""Aspies"" need is some extra help with our social skills.'

"Paediatrician Dr Nelly Ninis promised herself that if a vaccine against the meningitis B infection were discovered, she would have her children immunised. 'I've seen too many children die from this horrific disease or lose multiple limbs or suffer brain damage,' says Dr Ninis, 47, a consultant at the private Hospital of St  John and St Elizabeth in London. 'I consider myself a tough nut after nearly 25 years working as a doctor in children's infectious diseases, but I get so upset when I think about all the families who have been devastated by meningitis B. Paul Challis's daughter Ellie May, now nine, developed meningitis caused by meningococcal B at 16 months (both pictured) 'The scary thing is just how quickly it takes hold. In less than four hours of experiencing their first symptoms - which may just be a temperature, vomiting or a flu-like illness - they can be in multiple organ failure. In 24 hours, they can be dead.' Around 10 per cent of those who catch meningitis B die within 24 to 48 hours, even if they receive antibiotics. One in five is left with long-term problems, including limb amputation, hearing loss, learning disabilities and brain damage. Meningococcal B is a bacterium that causes the most common form of bacterial meningitis, meningitis B - an infection of the meninges, the protective membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This meningitis kills by causing intense pressure on the brain. If bacteria enter the bloodstream, they can also cause septicaemia, which can lead to shock and multiple organ failure. A new vaccine against the bacterium is available in the UK, but can only be obtained privately. This is because after spending a year deliberating, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - an independent body of experts which advises the Government - provisionally recommended last July that the jab should not be routinely given to all of the estimated 700,000 babies born in the UK each year. Instead, it said it should only be given to those with certain immuno-deficiencies, such as disorders of the spleen, or those on immune-suppressant drugs. So why would other babies not be offered protection? The experts deemed it was not cost effective. But Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, says: 'The UK's child mortality rates are among the highest in Europe and MenB contributes to this terrible fact.' The charity reckons the costs of caring for meningitis survivors with serious disability can be at least £3 million per child, once caring, loss of earnings and rehabilitation are considered. Meningitis B infections can affect all age groups, but children, and especially babies, are at risk due to their immature immune systems. No other infectious disease kills as many under-fives as bacterial meningitis and septicaemia and most cases are caused by meningococcal bacteria. Between 2006 and 2011, 247 adults and children died from meningitis caused by meningococcal B in England and Wales, and about 3,400 are affected by bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK. Around 10 per cent of people carry the bacterium harmlessly in their throat, but can pass it on to others. Sometimes outbreaks occur at universities because students live in close proximity. Paul took Ellie to A&E with a temperature he couldn't bring down, but was told she had a urine infection . Symptoms are varied and may be similar to flu in the early stages, so it can be difficult to diagnose. The vaccination costs around £75 a time privately - and children may need several. Babies aged two to five months need four injections, one to two months apart; those aged six months to two years need three; the over-twos need two. The vaccine committee is now reconsidering the evidence and will announce its ruling next month. Already, 118 paediatricians, nurses and scientists have written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pressing for the committee to reverse its decision. 'It is a cause for concern to us that after years of research, a vaccine which could prevent a significant proportion of cases of this dreadful disease might simply be shelved,' they wrote. Dr Ninis, who signed the letter, says the opportunity to introduce the vaccine is 'a historic moment'. 'The UK has had one of the highest rates of MenB in the world - scientists still don't know why this is, but we could be the first country in the world to eradicate it if we introduce routine vaccinations,' she says. 'The vaccine against meningococcal C (a different strain of meningococcal bacteria), . introduced in 1999, has been incredibly successful. But the majority of bacterial meningitis infections in the UK are caused by MenB.' One man who needs no convincing about the jab is Paul Challis, whose daughter Ellie May, now nine, developed meningitis caused by meningococcal B at 16 months. She lost both her hands and the lower part of both her legs. 'She developed a temperature and nothing we did would bring it down,' says Paul, 50, a former betting shop manager who lives with wife Lisa, 40, and their five other children in Little Clacton, Essex. 'I took her to A&E at midnight, a . few hours after she first developed the temperature, but was told she . had a urine infection and we were sent home. In the morning, though, she . was sick and as I lifted her top, I saw two tiny cherry red spots each . the size of a pen top. I drove her back to A&E, barged into triage . and showed the doctor the spots - by then there were 12. 'Within minutes, all hell broke loose - she had tubes everywhere and about ten doctors and nurses were swarming round her.' Four hours later, Ellie was rushed by ambulance to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and her heart stopped twice on the way. Ellie was in a coma for three weeks. 'Doctors explained her body had diverted blood to save her organs, causing a loss of supply to the extremities, and her hands and feet would have to be amputated,' says Paul. 'We wondered what quality of life she could have. Within weeks, though, she had started to move around on her bottom.' After standard prosthetic limbs proved uncomfortable, the family paid privately to have carbon blades made - she was the youngest recipient ever to have them. 'She is a fantastic kid and things have worked out better than we could have ever hoped - but obviously, given the choice, we would far rather she hadn't had this terrible disease. 'The jabs will cost hundreds of pounds privately and that is going to be too expensive for a lot of families - they should be available on the NHS to every child.' Paul says while Ellie is fantastic, given the choice, he would far rather she hadn't had this terrible disease . There is no doubt the vaccine committee has a difficult decision to make, says Dr Matthew Snape, consultant in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford, who helped conduct some trials for the vaccine. He says: 'The manufacturers claim the vaccine will be effective in preventing 75 to 88 per cent of MenB in the UK, but this is only based on lab tests. We won't know how effective it will be until we start using it on large numbers of people,' he says. 'The committee face a difficult decision because we don't have all the evidence - but we won't get it unless we introduce it.' The cost of introducing mass vaccination for babies, and a catch-up campaign for toddlers and 15- to 18-year-olds, are potentially huge. Dr Ninis paid privately for the jabs for her two youngest children, and her eldest, aged 13, will have hers soon. 'I had a recent case of a ten-month-old baby found dead in his cot by his sibling,' she says. 'He'd been examined thoroughly by his GP the night before and seemed OK. How many more parents need to wake up one morning and find their child dead before something is done?' meningitis.org .","A new vaccine against the bacterium is available in the UK, only privately .

He followed his doctors’ instructions carefully, believing that if he took the painkillers for long enough they would start working. But they didn’t. ‘The pain was particularly intense in my neck where I’d had lymph nodes removed — I assumed it was because they’d sliced through nerves. It was some of the worst pain I’d ever experienced and it was constant for many weeks.’ But he felt there was little to be done. ‘It didn’t occur to me to complain to my doctors as I was on the maximum dose and I just thought it reflected how ill I was, not that the drugs weren’t working. ‘At the time I was more concerned with staying alive, as the cancer was quite advanced and had spread to lymph nodes under my arms and in my neck,’ says Paul, who lives in Newbury, Berkshire, with his wife Kathy, 60, and daughter Lara, 21. Several weeks after the surgery Paul’s pain finally disappeared. But it was only six years later, while developing new genetic tests as part of his job, that he suddenly realised why the medication had not touched his pain. Paul, who has a PhD in molecular biology, was working with Professor Bob Smith, an expert in drug metabolism at Imperial College, London, who had identified differences in the way our bodies respond to drugs. Professor Smith had worked out that these differences may be linked to variations in genes controlling enzyme production. Enzymes are proteins, made in the liver, which control the speed of chemical reactions in our bodies. They help to break down drugs so the body can use them. Professor Smith found that gene variations can affect certain enzymes so that too much or too little of a chemical is produced. For example, an enzyme called CYP2D6 breaks down codeine into morphine to provide pain relief. Codeine, which is given for mild to moderate pain, is a cheap drug for GPs to prescribe and is widely used — in 2012 there were nearly 19 million NHS prescriptions for painkillers containing codeine, including co-codamol (codeine and paracetamol), the tenth most prescribed drug in the UK. Codeine is also an effective cough suppressant, used in many non-prescription cough medicines and cold remedies. The problem is that an estimated 7 to 10 per cent of the population have a gene variation which means they don’t make enough CYP2D6 to obtain pain relief from codeine. Up to six million Britons may be affected in this way, although most are unaware of it. Tests confirmed that Paul’s body can’t make enough of the enzyme. He explains: ‘If you don’t make enough CYP2D6 you can take as much codeine as you like but it won’t make a blind bit of difference. It’s as simple as that.’ Codeine is given for mild to moderate pain and is the tenth most prescribed drug in the UK . But that is not the only issue with this particular enzyme. There is another group of people who produce too much CYP2D6, so codeine is broken down too quickly in their bodies. This creates a fast ‘hit’ which then rapidly wears off, explains Dr Martin Johnson, a GP and pain specialist for the Royal College of General Practitioners. ‘These so-called rapid metabolisers experience a quick morphine hit when the drug is broken down. The effects of the dose then wear off too quickly, so they start clock-watching until their next dose. In some rare cases this fast-acting effect has caused respiratory depression (when breathing stops), particularly in children, and even deaths.’ This is why children recovering from surgery are now no longer given codeine-based pain relief, and why children’s cough medicines no longer contain the drug. Dr Johnson suggests that there may be even more fast metabolisers than non-metabolisers — and that put together they could amount to about 30 per cent of the population. ‘Patients often keep taking codeine in the vain hope that it will work eventually — but all they experience are the side-effects, such as constipation (it slows down gut movement in the intestine) and none of the pain-relieving benefits,’ says Dr Johnson. ‘They might return to their GP for a higher dose and still not get any relief. ‘Then there are all the people who buy over-the-counter codeine products, who also get no pain relief. ‘There could be huge numbers of people on medication that doesn’t work for them, or works too quickly to control pain effectively.’ Yet there are alternatives, including paracetamol, ibuprofen, diclofenac and other anti-inflammatories. Exercise can help with pain too — particularly for people with arthritis. Common issue: It is estimated that between seven and ten per cent of the population cannot break down codeine . Codeine is not the only drug metabolised by CYP2D6. There are some 25 others including the opioid painkiller tramadol, certain antidepressants known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which include Prozac and Zoloft, and antipsychotic drugs used to treat mental illness. Beta-blockers prescribed for high blood pressure and the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, taken by 13,000 women, also fall into this category. Dr Debenham says it’s a big issue. ‘If a woman is taking tamoxifen, as a side-effect she may experience hot flushes, and sometimes SSRIs are prescribed for these. Certain types of SSRI are also metabolised by the CYP2D6 enzyme, so the two drugs compete for the small amount of enzyme in the liver — this could mean that the cancer-suppressing action of tamoxifen doesn’t work as there is not enough CYP2D6 to metabolise the drugs.’ Jo Cumming, of the charity Arthritis . Care, says patients frequently ring its helpline in tears because . codeine is not working for them. ‘Many have simply not been told that it . doesn’t work for everyone, so they soldier on, believing that if they . keep taking it or just up their dose it will work eventually. Or they . stop taking it and don’t tell their doctor. ‘We encourage them to go back to their GP so they can be switched to something else.’ Dr . Roger Knaggs, associate professor of pharmacy at Nottingham University . and a spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says pharmacists . are usually aware of the CYP2D6 problem but it is less well known among . GPs. ‘We need greater awareness of the condition among patients as well as GPs,’ he says. Could the answer be to screen people for the genetic variation? Dr Johnson says more research is needed to investigate how widespread the problem is, but he believes genetic screening could potentially be beneficial. ‘It may be money well spent in cases where patients have a pain condition,’ he says. ‘Screening could determine how well other drugs work, too. It’s common sense to find out whether a drug is going to work for you at the beginning.’ In fact Dr Debenham is developing a gene test for CYP2D6 using both saliva and blood tests which can give results within 45 minutes — it could cost less than £50 and may be available within a year (currently CYP2D6 tests are only available privately from the U.S.). However, Dr Cathy Stannard, consultant in pain medicine at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, is less convinced about the benefits of routine screening. ‘People are shocked drugs don’t work for everyone but all drugs are metabolised differently. If you gave ten people the same drug you’d get a different response in each. The reasons are not just down to CYP2D6,’ she says. ‘If codeine was the only painkiller available, there would be more interest in screening people routinely for this enzyme problem.’ Indeed as Dr Knaggs points out, ‘even if you don’t have a problem with production of the CYP2D6 enzyme, codeine still might not work for you, as drug response in pain is such a complex process’. In the meantime, if codeine isn’t working for you, tell your doctor so he can prescribe another type of painkiller, advises Dr Johnson. www.arthritiscare.org.uk .

"Weekly attacks: Katie Fant experienced severe allergic reactions to mould . As the autumn damp sets in, the temptation is to stay inside and turn up the radiator. But if there's not enough ventilation, you could be creating the perfect environment for mould to grow. Mould can trigger breathing problems and may even, in rare cases, be life-threatening - as Katie Fant discovered. Last November, the 17-year-old was at school when she suddenly started struggling to breathe. 'I was sitting in class and my throat began to close up and then my tongue started to swell - I ran to the first aid room,' recalls Katie who lives in Bexley, Kent, with her mother Roberta, 43, a teacher, stepfather Gary, 40, a cab driver, and younger siblings, Rachel and Daniel. Within minutes, large itchy red hives - about an inch in diameter - had started to appear on her arms and chest. Luckily, a paramedic arrived within ten minutes and gave her an adrenaline injection; this calmed down her symptoms, but she was still rushed to hospital in an ambulance, where she was also given steroids. Katie had experienced an extreme anaphylactic reaction - a severe allergic reaction where the body's immune system goes into overdrive, releasing large amounts of histamine, a chemical that causes tissue to swell. This can lead to breathing problems and a drop in blood pressure. It can be fatal. After eight hours in hospital, Katie was well enough to go home. But the mystery was what caused the attack. Although she suffers from hay fever and oral allergy syndrome - where certain foods, in her case, fresh fruit, cause her mouth to tingle and lips to swell temporarily - there was nothing to suggest these were the problem. 'I hadn't eaten anything out of the ordinary,' recalls Katie. Her GP referred her to an allergy specialist, but there was a three-month wait. In the meantime she had at least one anaphylactic reaction every week, always at school. 'Scarily the symptoms developed more rapidly each time - I took antihistamines every day to prevent an attack and carried two EpiPens of adrenaline at all times, which I used. 'Although my symptoms would quickly die down, I was told to go to A&E each time in case there were problems when the adrenaline wore off. It was terrifying,' says Katie. She was also told to rest for at least a week after each attack. 'My attendance levels dropped to below 60 per cent. I was in my first year of A-levels and every class I missed set me back. It began to affect my grades. Mould allergy: The fungus, like the black variety found on window frames, thrives in damp, moist conditions . 'The school helped and teachers came to my home when I was off sick, but without knowing the trigger, there was little they could do.' She was advised to restrict her diet, so ate the same thing every day - mainly oat cereal and bread - but it made no difference. 'I became very anxious and quite depressed because home was about the only place I felt safe and I missed out on a lot of things. I don't think my friends believed it when I said I was allergic to school.' When Katie eventually saw an allergy specialist at Guy's Hospital, London, in January, tests revealed she had allergies to pollen, peanuts and sesame, but her strongest allergy was to mould - particularly cladosporium herbarum, a mould found on window frames, fridges and poorly ventilated buildings. The penny dropped. As Katie explains: 'My school building was old and quite damp and one class was in a temporary hut - it had condensation on the window sills and black mould on a wall. This was where I had the majority of attacks. 'After Mum knew about my mould allergy she opened all our windows regularly and bought a dehumidifier for my room. But I never had an attack at home, so obviously it was something at school setting me off.' Mould is a type of fungus - thousands of types are released at different times of the year, though autumn is the peak time for the release of the spores (the microscopic particles that allow it to spread). The spores can irritate skin, nasal and bronchial membranes, causing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness, itchy eyes, coughing, wheezing, and eczema. Up to 4 per cent of the population is thought to react to mould spores - with as many as one in ten people with allergies such as hay fever and eczema affected. Mould spores can also be dangerous for some asthmatics - around two-thirds of the more serious life-threatening asthma attacks are believed to be triggered by moulds, although anaphylactic reactions such as those Katie had (causing changes in blood pressure, for instance) are fortunately rare. Dr George Du Toit, consultant paediatric allergy specialist at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and the private Portland Hospital, says late autumn is the peak time for mould allergies due to the wet conditions and fallen leaves, and people spending more time indoors with windows shut, which leads to condensation forming. 'I don't think my friends believed it when I said I was allergic to school.' 'Mould thrives in damp, moist, tepid conditions, indoors and out. The black mould on window frames is an obvious type, but you'll also find mould in steamy kitchens and bathrooms, and barns where mouldy hay is stored, or musty sheds or garages,' says Dr Du Toit. 'If your house has damp, it is the ideal environment for mould to thrive. Patients are often puzzled about what is causing their allergic symptoms, as they don't tend to think of mould being a trigger.' Lyndsey McManus, deputy chief executive of Allergy UK, stresses that mould can grow in centrally heated, double-glazed homes as well as old damp houses and overcrowded flats: 'If the house isn't well ventilated, mould will flourish.' Certain mould species can also cause serious lung infections and damage. Aspergillus, for instance, colonises vegetable matter (especially wet or rotting) and can be found on farms where produce is stored, or in old buildings. The spores can trigger an allergic reaction (usually asthma) and, in rare cases, it can damage tissue in the lungs and affect breathing. Aspergillus can be a problem for people with serious pre-existing lung diseases, says consultant chest physician Dr Keith Prowse, who advises the British Lung Foundation. 'There's another condition called farmer's lung, where lungs are colonised by spores from mouldy hay. It can cause scarring of the lung, make patients breathless and even prove fatal,' he says. Irritation: Spores can cause symptoms such as nasal stuffiness, itchy eyes, coughing, wheezing, and eczema . Mould may also be linked to Parkinson's disease. A new U.S. study found a compound given off by mould reduced levels of the brain chemical dopamine, a process which causes Parkinson's symptoms, although more research is needed. As well as eliminating existing mould with anti-mould products, experts advise opening windows every day to release moist air, using dehumidifiers and fitting ventilation fans in kitchens and bathrooms. Avoid drying washing indoors, particularly on radiators, and keep pot plants to a minimum (topsoil can harbour mould). Dr Nicholas Osborne, a toxicologist, epidemiologist and senior research fellow at the University of Exeter's Medical School at the European Centre for Environmental Health, says: 'Mould thrives in any building where there's insufficient ventilation and condensation happens. 'Climate change experts say the weather in the UK will get wetter and warmer, and mould thrives in wet conditions and warm temperatures, so mould-related health problems will probably increase, too.' For mould-related allergies, prevention and treatment is with antihistamines, with oral steroids sometimes used to treat flare-ups. But in severe cases Dr Du Toit says the patient is exposed to an allergen in hospital conditions in progressively larger doses, so that the immune system eventually becomes desensitised and does not react. Katie Fant ended up changing schools to combat her attacks. Since doing this in September she's had just two attacks. 'I still worry about attacks though - I want to go to university to study law, but I'm nervous about moving away from home and having to live in an unknown environment. 'I want people to know just how serious mould allergies can be.' allergyuk.org .","Mould spores can cause nasal stuffiness, itchy eyes, coughing, eczema .

"Coeliac disease: It's an autoimmune condition triggered by the protein gluten, found in wheat . Sue Clark knew she needed help when her bloating problem became so bad her wedding ring had to be cut off. For nearly 30 years, she wore elasticated waistbands because her stomach bloated so much after meals. 'I could balloon a dress size in a few hours - it was embarrassing. People were forever asking if I was pregnant', recalls Sue, 50, who runs an insulation company with husband Dave, 52, and lives in Luton, Bedfordshire. 'I suffered numerous griping tummy pains and diarrhoea. The symptoms seemed to happen at any time.' She also felt drained and had no energy, and eventually she reached a stage where her finger joints started to swell up immediately after eating. Sue struggled for years to get a correct diagnosis and treatment. She first saw a doctor about her tummy pains aged eight, and was told she had a 'grumbling appendix' - chronic pain in the appendix. In her 20s - underweight at 8st 7lb (she's 5ft 10in tall) and constantly exhausted - she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and told to eat more fibre. But doing so made her symptoms worse. 'I could never be far from a loo and felt permanently exhausted,' recalls Sue. 'I went back to my GP a few times but was told I was suffering “stress”. 'From my late 20s I started gaining weight - 4st in all - until reaching 13st in my late 40s - despite eating child-sized portions.' Two years ago on holiday in France, Sue noticed her symptoms intensified when she had crusty bread, pastries and croissants. 'I was doubled up with cramps and diarrhoea. Later a friend suggested cutting out bread. I did and my symptoms improved. I also tried avoiding similar foods including pasta. 'It was trial and error, but I noticed my symptoms became milder, and seemed only to return when eating wheat. I started losing weight and had more energy.' Last year, Sue had blood tests and was found to be severely anaemic and deficient in vitamin B12 - both can be symptoms of coeliac disease, an autoimmune condition triggered by the protein gluten, found in wheat. Antibodies attack the gluten, mistaking it for a foreign body, and attack the villi - finger-like projections which line the small intestine and absorb food. This disrupts the absorption of nutrients and can result in malnutrition. Ballooning tummy: One of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity is bloating . One per cent of the UK population is estimated to have coeliac disease, often undiagnosed. Symptoms can include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, joint pain and swelling, rashes and fatigue. Eventually, Sue was referred to a gastroenterologist, who gave her a biopsy (to check for damage to the gut lining). He explained she needed to eat gluten again for two months before having blood tests to check for coeliac disease, as they measure antibodies to gluten - these markers will not be present if you are not eating gluten. Her symptoms flared again - yet her blood tests and biopsy were normal and Sue was told she did not have coeliac disease. But her doctor said she had a lesser-known but possibly more common condition, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Patients with it display gluten sensitivity symptoms including bloating, diarrhoea and tummy pain, but test negative for the disease despite symptoms disappearing on a gluten-free diet. However, these symptoms are caused by a different mechanism, although it's not clear what this is (the swelling of the fingers and toes is possibly linked to fluid leaking from swollen tissues). It is a controversial diagnosis: many doctors are sceptical about the existence of the condition because there's no diagnostic test or clear cause. But Dr Kamran Rostami, consultant gastroenterologist at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, says: 'I've seen many patients with coeliac-type symptoms including bloating, diarrhoea and fatigue, but their results were negative. Some said their symptoms improved on a gluten-free diet. It is becoming clear that there are patients with gluten sensitivity in whom neither allergic nor autoimmune mechanisms can be identified. 'It is estimated that, for every person with coeliac disease, there could be six or seven with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. 'It may therefore affect 6 to 10 per cent of the population, approximately four to seven million Britons, and the vast majority are unaware of it. 'Our diet has changed in the past ten to 20 years - we now eat more carbohydrates containing gluten than our ancestors, so our digestive systems could be finding it difficult to adapt.' It's thought some cases of IBS may, in fact, be non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. And the condition might help explain the prevalence of 'wheat intolerance', an often self-diagnosed condition commonly regarded as faddy eating. Dr Geoffrey Holmes, emeritus consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Derby Hospital, who wrote one of the first papers on the condition more than 30 years ago, says growing evidence shows non-coeliac gluten sensitivity exists, and that patients respond to a gluten-free diet despite testing negative for coeliac disease. '[Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity] is a controversial diagnosis: many . doctors are sceptical about the existence of the condition because . there's no diagnostic test or clear cause. 'Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is on the research agenda again - driven by the public. In the U.S., 20  per cent of people buy gluten-free food and a study in children in New Zealand found gluten avoidance was five times higher than diagnosed coeliac disease.' In 2010, Italian researchers found 24 of 120 patients with IBS experienced an improvement when avoiding wheat and dairy. In another study, published last year in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, 34 patients with IBS who controlled symptoms with a gluten-free diet, but tested negative for coeliac disease, were put on a diet containing gluten or a placebo. Those eating gluten experienced symptoms again. Professor David Sanders, a consultant gastroenterologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospital and chair of the charity Coeliac UK's Health Advisory Board, accepts studies have established patients with gluten sensitivity symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet. 'There is emerging evidence these patients may have a biological basis for their symptoms. But the jury's still out. 'Our problem is we don't know how NCGS is caused and how our immune system responds; we also haven't got a test for it. There's this mismatch between what doctors know and what the public are reporting.' He added that in a new survey of 1,000 people about to be published, 13 per cent reported symptoms after eating gluten. 'Clearly all these people don't have coeliac disease and most would test negative for it - but what they might have instead is NCGS or even a wheat allergy. 'What complicates matters is more recent studies suggest it might not just be the gluten in wheat which is the problem, but the husk, or sugars in the grain.' Professor Sanders stressed that patients suspecting a problem with gluten should not abstain from it without first seeing their GP and being tested for coeliac disease and wheat allergy. 'If both conditions have been eliminated it might be worth trying a gluten-free diet,' Dr Ray Shidrawi, consultant gastroenterologist at Homerton Hospital and the private Wellington Hospital. 'I've no doubt patients with these symptoms have something medically wrong despite testing negative for coeliac disease - some show me pictures of their bellies sticking out after eating bread.' Whatever the views of the scientific community, Sue Clark says her diagnosis has made a world of difference. 'I've lost 2st and am symptom-free if I avoid gluten. I've got my energy back and my tummy's no longer bloated. 'There must be others out there like me soldiering on - told they don't have coeliac disease - but it's still gluten that's to blame.'","Coeliac disease is a condition triggered by gluten, which is found in wheat .

"Life-changing: Taking vitamin D3 cured Vicky of her IBS symptoms . Vicky Grant was in a work meeting when once again she was gripped by painful stomach cramps. 'I didn't know whether to make a dash to the bathroom or just sit it out and hope it would pass,' recalls Vicky, 43, a medical librarian, who is divorced and lives in Sheffield. 'I was coping with up to seven bouts of diarrhoea a day and it was really taking its toll on me. 'I decided to risk it and stay put, but I was concentrating so hard on staying in control that everything being said in the meeting passed over my head. 'I felt bloated, tired and fatigued. My weight was below 7st (I'm 5ft 3in). I'd lost so much weight and looked terrible - I'm sure people thought I had anorexia. It was also making me depressed. 'I'd tried every drug, complementary therapy and diet under the sun, some things helped a little but nothing made my symptoms manageable. I was just so fed up with being ill all the time.' Vicky, then in her early 30s, had been struggling to cope with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) since the age of 13. IBS is the medical name for a collection of symptoms including abdominal pain and spasms, diarrhoea, constipation or an erratic bowel, bloating, and wind. Up to a third of the population is thought to have IBS at some point, with one in ten experiencing symptoms so severe they seek medical help - IBS accounts for a tenth of all visits to GPs. But the condition is notoriously tricky to diagnose and treat: IBS doesn't show up on X-rays, blood tests or scans. Doctors still don't know what causes it, and unlike other bowel diseases it does not physically damage the gut, yet patients suffer very real symptoms. Treatment is often a case of trial and error - options include drugs for diarrhoea or constipation, antidepressants, relaxation and psychological therapies, and dietary changes. But could vitamin D offer another option? After years of debilitating symptoms and failed treatments, this is what helped Vicky, and her experience has now led to a major new study looking at the nutrient's benefits. Vicky first 'plucked up the courage' to see her GP in her early 20s. 'He told me I did have IBS and that in my case it was due to stress and advised me to tackle the stress,' she says. 'I didn't think I was any more stressed than any of my friends and thought the stress I was under was at least partly due to coping with my IBS. I tried meditation, but it made no difference. 'Over the years my IBS left me feeling totally drained.' IBS: A collection of symptoms including abdominal pain and spasms, diarrhoea, constipation and wind . Then, in her early 30s Vicky was finally referred to a gastroenterologist after she broke down in tears at her GP's because she felt so depressed. 'I felt I just couldn't cope with my symptoms any more.' The consultant she saw suggested antidepressants for her depression and anxiety and explained these can have a calming effect on the gut, too. 'I carried on trying alternative remedies - aloe vera juice, herbal supplements, counselling, hypnotherapy and probiotics to name but a few - but nothing fixed it,' she says. Vicky's experience is far from unusual, according to Dr Nick Read, chairman of the IBS Network's medical advisory group. 'Trying successive treatments is fairly typical as there isn't any one definitive treatment and it's a matter of deciding what makes most sense and works best for you.' IBS is most common in women between the ages of 19 and 32. 'It tends to occur in the more sensitive individuals, who can find themselves overwhelmed with their busy lives,' says Dr Read. 'They tend to blame their diet, but symptoms of IBS often start or get worse after a significant change, such as a new job, a holiday, a breakdown of a relationship or the start of a new one, marriage, childbirth, or later, empty nesting, care for elderly parents, bereavement - the stuff of life,' he says, adding: 'Sometimes it follows an attack of food poisoning.' Such changes and stresses can make the bowel more sensitive to different foods, particularly fats and coffee as these cause the bowel to contract, and milk, wheat, and fruits and vegetables that cause gas. 'To understand IBS, think food and mood,' says Dr Read. Three years ago, Vicky took to the internet hoping to find a new treatment. She teaches medical students how to appraise medical journals and had read many papers in such publications about treatments for IBS, but says she 'also wanted to find out what patients were saying about what worked for them'. 'One thing that kept cropping up online was how high-dose  vitamin D supplements could help,' recalls Vicky. 'I read one blog then reports from patients on forums talking about this - it was generating a lot of interest.' Female sufferers: IBS is most common in women between the ages of 19 and 32 . Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin important for bone health, a healthy immune system, muscle growth and blood clotting. It is made by the body under the surface of the skin through exposure to sunlight. Small amounts are contained in dairy products, egg yolks, oily fish and fortified margarine. It's well known that people in the UK and other Northern countries have low levels of vitamin D in the winter months. Increasingly, research is linking a lack of vitamin D to a host of illnesses including inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, colorectal cancer and depression. Based on what she'd read, Vicky started a low daily dose of the nutrient (1,000 international units) - she took vitamin D2, a form which comes mainly from plants. But it had no effect. 'Then a work colleague who has multiple sclerosis mentioned that vitamin D3 from fish oils is closer to the type the body makes naturally and was more effective and should be taken at a higher dose,' says Vicky. 'So I switched to 4,000 international units a day of D3, which is a safe dose. Within days, my symptoms eased and progressively improved over the months. 'After years of symptoms, my diarrhoea, cramps, pain and bloating disappeared. I started to feel well, put on weight and my depression lifted. 'It was amazing. My symptoms would flare up again though, if I forgot to take it.' With the help of medical researchers she knew from her work at Sheffield University medical school, Vicky wrote up her experience as a case report for the British Medical Journal - she included anecdotal reports on vitamin D from blogs, which suggested it worked in 70 per cent of cases. The article generated a lot of interest. 'Lots of patients wanted to know more but I knew doctors wouldn't - quite rightly - recommend vitamin D unless it was backed up by clinical trial evidence,' says Vicky, who is now studying for a doctorate based on patient experiences of IBS. Now the university's oncology department is to run a randomised controlled trial of the treatment involving 100 IBS patients - half will take a high daily dose (3,000 international units) of vitamin D3, the other half a placebo, for three months. A possible cure for the symptoms of IBS? Vitamin D3 (from fish oils) is effective . 'Hopefully this will produce some hard evidence one way or the other,' says Vicky, who is a researcher on the trial (which will soon be recruiting patients). There's been an 'explosion' of research into the role of vitamin D in illnesses including cancer multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease, says Dr Bernard Corfe, head of Sheffield University's molecular gastroenterology research group. 'So it is not unreasonable to investigate whether it plays a role in IBS,' he adds. There are several ways vitamin D might work, including boosting the immune system and improving the gut's barrier. Dr Read says there is evidence some types of IBS involve a low level of inflammation in nerve endings in the gut. 'Inflammation around the gut's nerve cells may make the intestine more sensitive to food and stress,' he explains. 'We can't say vitamin D works as a treatment for IBS yet. Only a properly designed trial will establish whether it works or not.' Julian Walters, professor of gastroenterology at Imperial College, London, agrees the idea that vitamin D may play a role in IBS is 'plausible'. 'We shouldn't assume it will work,' he cautions. 'It could just be the power of placebo.' Visit theibsnetwork.org/ the-self-care-plan .","IBS is a collection of symptoms including abdominal pain and spasms .

"As she stepped out of her car onto the driveway, Beth Redpath felt her throat prickle with the warning signs of an allergic reaction. 'I started to flush bright red, and within a few minutes I felt like my throat was closing up and I was struggling to breathe,' recalls Beth, 28. 'Angry red weals began to appear on my arms and neck, and I started to panic.' She was suffering anaphylactic shock - a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction causing swelling of the throat and mouth, problems breathing and a dangerous drop in blood pressure. Essential accessory: Beth Redpath, 28, suffers from an allergy to latex that is so severe, she must wear a mask in public places to ensure she doesn't have a reaction . Luckily her mother was with her, and called 999 as well as injecting her with an EpiPen - a device containing adrenaline to counter the allergic reaction. 'But even after the injection, my blood pressure dropped so low that I passed out in the ambulance,' says Beth. 'My body was shutting down and only providing blood to my vital organs, such as my heart and lungs. It was terrifying. Mum thought that she was going to lose me.' Beth is one of an estimated 600,000 people in Britain with an allergy to latex - a natural substance obtained from rubber trees. It is used to make around 40,000 products, including car tyres, airbags, some medical gloves, condoms, balloons, paints and even tarmac - which can make it very difficult to avoid. Beth's attack was triggered by roadworks in her street: 'A telephone company had dug up the pavement without any notice and laid fresh tarmac. Particles of latex in the tarmac had become airborne and I'd inhaled them.' Allergies are caused by the immune system over-reacting to a normally harmless substance, in the mistaken belief that it is a foreign invader. This triggers the immune system to release the compound histamine, which causes symptoms such as itching and swelling. One of Beth's 27 anaphylactic shocks was triggered by the roadworks in her street . In extreme cases, allergic reactions can send the body into anaphylactic shock. Although most people with a latex allergy will have only an itchy skin rash reaction (known as a type 4 reaction), repeated exposure can make the allergy far worse, and in some cases it can progress to the most serious type of reaction - type 1. Symptoms start immediately after exposure and include hives, hayfever-type problems, wheezing and, in some cases, anaphylaxis. Worryingly, you can have a full-blown anaphylactic reaction without ever having experienced any symptoms previously. Beth's trip to hospital was just the latest of 27 emergency admissions she's had in the past 18 months - testament to how hard it is to avoid latex in everyday life. One attack occurred in a restaurant after Beth had been drinking champagne. She later discovered that latex was used as a binding agent in champagne corks ('it helps preserve the champagne, apparently'). 'I even had one attack in a hospital foyer as a breast cancer charity was handing out latex balloons,' says the marketing manager, who lives with her parents and son Jack, five, in Woking, Surrey. 'Now, if I go to a supermarket or shopping centre, I wear a particle filtration mask over my nose and mouth - like the ones people wore in Hong Kong at the height of the bird flu scare - just in case there is airborne latex from food prepared or packed by workers wearing latex gloves. 'It's the only way I can guarantee my safety in public places.' Latex allergy became a health problem in Britain and globally in the Eighties when medical workers started to wear latex gloves to prevent cross infection with the HIV/Aids virus. As well as being made of latex, the gloves used then contained powders that propelled the latex particles into the air, making them more easily inhaled. Although most NHS trusts now use latex-free medical products, there are still large numbers of the population who remain sensitised to latex, says Dr Gavin Spickett, consultant immunologist at Newcastle Royal Infirmary. 'We are seeing fewer new cases of latex allergy in the UK thanks to healthcare workers using latex-free gloves, but the problem certainly hasn't disappeared.' 'I've turned my home into a latex-free zone - it's the only place I feel totally safe.' One of the biggest threats comes from a seemingly innocuous item - party balloons. 'A major problem is the hazard of latex balloons used for promotional activities in shopping centres and restaurants,' adds Dr Spickett, who is chairman of the Latex Allergy Support Group's medical advisory panel. 'Most stretchy, rubbery balloons contain latex; foil balloons do not. 'And when paints and tarmac are freshly applied or stripped off, particles of latex can become airborne, so that it is another potential source of allergens. 'People just don't realise how dangerous a latex allergy can be. Even some medical staff confuse type 1 and type 4 allergies and tend to think latex allergy causes nothing more serious than an itchy rash - not realising that it could kill someone.' And those with latex allergies don't need even to come into close contact with the substance says Aleksandra Kinay, chair of the Latex Allergy Support Group. 'Just being in the same room as latex gloves can be enough to trigger an attack,' she warns. 'Some surgeons still prefer to wear latex gloves, and hospitals allow balloons on the premises, so there's no room for complacency.' Many latex allergy sufferers also develop a cross-reactivity to some fruits and vegetables, as they contain similar proteins, adds Jonathan Brostoff, professor emeritus of allergy at King's College, London, and a medical adviser to the Anaphylaxis Campaign. 'The body mistakes proteins in certain fruits and vegetables for the proteins in latex and mounts an allergic response,' says the professor. 'The main triggers are bananas, avocados, kiwis and chestnuts, but others can cause problems, too.' Latex allergies became a problem in Britain when medical workers in the Eighties started wearing latex gloves to prevent cross infection with the HIV/Aids virus . Beth Redpath started suffering itchy red rashes at 16 after using latex gloves in science lessons at school. 'At university, I studied biochemistry so often worked in a laboratory. It was difficult to avoid exposure to latex gloves and other equipment, such as latex caps on bottles. At 21, the allergy worsened and I had to give up my career in biochemistry.' Lesley Maitland, 47, a former bank worker who lives in Sunderland with her husband Scott and four children, had to take medical retirement because her employer could not guarantee her a safe work environment. 'Everything from elastic bands to hair lacquer in the toilets set me off,' she says. 'Even my trade union unwittingly triggered an attack by sending me a squeezy stress ball which contained latex. 'I've turned my home into a latex-free zone - it's the only place I feel totally safe.' Lesley is convinced she became sensitised to latex as a child living close to factories that made tyres and condoms in London's East End. 'Once, I even had an attack when a car braked sharply and burnt the rubber on its tyres in front of me. 'I don't want to sound like a killjoy, but latex balloons could be fatal if I encountered them in a confined space. It's a constant battle to persuade businesses to take this risk seriously. 'People don't realise that a latex allergy can be deadly and that latex is found everywhere.' lasg.org.uk; anaphylaxis.org.uk .","Over half a million Britons have an allergy to latex .

"Ebola victim: American finance consultant Patrick Sawyer, who died in Nigeria, with daughter Ava . British airports and airlines are on high alert to prevent the deadly Ebola virus from reaching this country. Passengers thought to have the virus will be barred from boarding flights heading to the UK – and will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival. They will then be quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. But because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net. Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms. One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst-ever outbreak. For the first time, the virus, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will arrive in Britain on an international flight. It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a ‘very serious threat’. But he sought to calm fears, saying it ‘most unlikely’ that Ebola could spread within the UK because of ‘frankly different’ standards of infection control here. Scroll down for video . Outbreak: Samaritan's Purse medical staff spray disinfectant on a person who died from Ebola in Foya, Liberia . He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: ‘We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking ‘precautionary measures’ but he was ‘very confident’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK. In other developments: . The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks. Explanation: A Samaritan's Purse medical staff worker demonstrates personal protective equipment to educate team members on the Ebola virus in Liberia . But international concern has been inflamed by the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos, Africa’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub. 'Precautionary measures': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured yesterday) is 'very confident' the NHS will be able to cope if Ebola arrived in the UK . Patrick Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease. British Airways flies daily to Lagos and also has regular flights to Freetown in Sierra Leone and Monrovia in Liberia. Staff at all airlines have the discretion to deny boarding. A BA spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority. ‘We will fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.’ Virgin Atlantic said its staff had been trained to spot symptoms, which range from flu-like fever and malaise initially, to vomiting, diarrhoea and, eventually, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Sufferers can experience convulsions and fall into a coma before dying from massive and irreparable damage to their internal organs. It was unclear last night to what extent the UK would follow the practice of some countries and track down and quarantine all passengers on a plane used by a suspected sufferer. But the tone of the latest official guidance suggested only those known to be in close physical proximity – five rows of seats surrounding the suspect – will be contacted for checks. Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, insisted that airline passengers had little to fear, as direct contact with bodily fluids is needed for the disease to spread. Huge problem: One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst-ever outbreak . But he admitted that ‘it is not impossible’ that someone who is infected could arrive in the UK before developing any symptoms. 'The UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here' Foreign Office . Heathrow Airport said it had a medical team on constant duty with the power to detain, isolate or send to hospital people with suspicious symptoms. Dr Derek Gatherer, a Lancaster University expert on disease spread, said: ‘There is no treatment – nothing you can do yourself. It’s in the lap of the gods if you’re lucky to be one of the few who survive.’ Dr Ben Neuman, a Reading University . virologist, said Ebola will come here eventually – but predicted it will . be caught and shut down by border staff. Taking no chances: Health workers in protective gear carry a victim of the Ebola outbreak in Lofa, Liberia . The Foreign Office sought to play down . the likelihood of an outbreak in the UK, saying the Government ‘is . confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with . anything if it were to arrive here’. 'There is no treatment – nothing you can do yourself. It’s in the lap of the gods if you’re lucky to be one of the few who survive' Dr Derek Gatherer, disease expert . It added: ‘We have experienced scientists and doctors – the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.’ Liberia has closed all its schools, quarantined a number of communities and placed all non-essential workers on compulsory leave as part of an action plan that will be enforced by security. Officials said hospitals were overwhelmed, an isolation unit in the capital Monrovia was over-run and patients were being treated in their homes. Information minister Lewis Brown said: ‘This is a major public health emergency.’ What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever. This makes the body’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak, causing catastrophic internal bleeding. Up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention. The virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Why is the Government suddenly worried? Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter Britain from Africa. The latest outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages. In Guinea, the epidemic has reached the capital, Conakry. What are the symptoms? Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ The incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks. Have there been any cases in Britain? No. But Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading who studies viruses such as Ebola, warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the UK. The most immediate danger is that the virus will enter Britain on an airline flight. One victim, American Patrick Sawyer, had symptoms of the virus in Liberia but was allowed to board multiple international flights. Vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, he flew from Liberia, stopped over in Ghana, changed planes in Togo and died in Nigeria. What is the connection with bush meat? Bush meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests. It is thought humans can contract Ebola from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees, fruit bats, forest antelopes and porcupines. There are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into Britain – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year, and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat, which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets. How contagious is it? It is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis, which can spread for considerable distances through the air. Dr Fletcher said: ‘Ebola does not spread through the air. To contract it, you must have contact with an infected person’s blood or other bodily fluids, so the real risk is to family members and care givers.’ Should I worry? ‘The risk of anyone in Britain contracting Ebola is very small,’ stresses Dr Tom Solomon, an expert in viral infection, who is the director of the newly established Health Protection Research Unit. He adds: ‘If the outbreak in Africa is not brought under control, then that would increase the risk to people here.’ What if I think I have been in contact with an infected person? Contact your GP immediately, although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from Africa rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries. If a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus, every other passenger on that flight will be contacted. How can the disease be treated? There is no cure for Ebola, although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs. Other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus. ‘Many people do survive,’ says Dr Fletcher. ‘Treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference. Loss of fluids is often a killer in Ebola cases. Up to half of patients can survive, if treated properly.’","Passengers thought to have virus to be barred from taking flights to UK .

"The amount of Crystal Meth being produced in the United States is declining as drug users turn to cheaper, purer imports from Mexico. Meth lab busts and seizures are down 40 percent or more in states that traditionally lead the country in the undesirable category, according to narcotics experts. Enforcement actions and stricter laws are partly responsible, but the meth now coming through Mexican cartel pipelines is so cheap and pure that it is supplanting meth made in homes or soda bottles inside cars. The cartels have even expanded their meth reach to rural areas and small towns. Decline: Meth lab busts and seizures similar to this in Gerald, Missouri, are down 40 percent or more in states that traditionally lead the country in the undesirable category, according to narcotics experts. 'The great news is that meth from Mexico doesn't explode, doesn't burn down your house and your neighbor's home, doesn't contaminate your property, doesn't kill children the way meth labs have done here in the U.S. for decades,' said Jason Grellner, the chief narcotics officer in Franklin County, Missouri. Meth lab seizures peaked nationally in 2004, when nearly 24,000 labs were seized. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported 11,573 seizures last year (the most recent available), up 363 from 2012. Grellner's county has often topped 100 meth lab seizures in a year, but have only had about a dozen this year. Statistics provided by the Missouri State Highway Patrol show 558 meth lab seizures occurred statewide for the first six months of 2014, putting Missouri on pace for 1,116. That would be a 34 percent drop from the 1,496 meth lab seizures in 2013, and only a little over half in 2012. The decline is more pronounced in other high-meth states. In Tennessee, lab seizures are down 40 percent this year, said Tommy Farmer, director of the Tennessee Meth and Pharmaceutical Task Force. Oklahoma had 160 meth lab seizures through September and is on pace for 213 — about half last year's seizure total, Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics spokesman Mark Woodward said. One only needs to go to the morgue to know that, despite fewer lab busts, the meth problem isn't going away. In Oklahoma, which tracks meth-related deaths, 167 died of meth overdoses last year — up from 140 in 2012 and 108 in 2011, Woodward said. Figures for 2014 weren't available. 'I don't think meth use has ever been higher in the state of Oklahoma,' he said. Action: Enforcement actions and stricter laws are partly responsible, according to narcotics experts. Here a St. Louis County police Officer Clayton Fair, left, arrests a man during a crackdown . The Mexican cartels have long controlled the market for illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Meth was trickier. For years, many U.S. users have chosen to make their own, first in homemade labs that often caught fire or ruined houses. The Drug Enforcement Administration's website lists thousands of homes contaminated by meth. When federal and state lawmakers began implementing laws limiting the sale of key meth ingredient pseudoephedrine in the mid-2000s, it became difficult to obtain enough for large batches. Users turned to 'one-pot' or 'shake-and-bake' methods — mixing a couple of cold pills with household chemicals such as lighter fluid or drain cleaner in a 2-liter soda bottle. Meanwhile, Mexican cartels have upped their meth-making, turning to an old recipe known as P2P that first appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. It uses the organic compound phenylacetone — banned in the U.S. but obtainable in Mexico, according to the DEA — rather than pseudoephedrine. Chemists in Mexico have refined the process to the point where the meth is both potent and cheap. The purity of Mexican meth increased from 39 percent in 2007 to essentially 100 percent today, said Jim Shroba, special agent in charge for the DEA's St. Louis office. The price over that same period has fallen sharply, from $290 per pure gram to around $100 per pure gram. Marijuana is by far the most seized drug in the United States, with DEA statistics showing 268,000 kilograms seized in 2013. That compares to 22,500 kilograms of cocaine, 3,990 kilograms of meth and 965 kilograms of heroin. Shroba and other experts say there are other reasons, too, why meth seizures are down. Two states — Oregon and Mississippi — now require a prescription to buy pills containing pseudoephedrine. And federal law requires strict monitoring and limits on pseudoephedrine purchases. Franklin County police officer counts pills containing pseudoephedrine during a raid of a suspected meth house in Gerald, Missouri . At first, the Mexican meth was aimed mainly at big cities and suburbs. Indiana's meth suppression commander Niki Crawford said it is increasingly showing up in her state's mid-sized cities — Evansville, Terre Haute and Kokomo. The imported drug has even reached rural areas. Woodward cited recent large-scale busts of distribution rings in communities like Lindsay (population 3,000) and Okmulgee (population 12,000). And Shroba said huge seizures of Mexican meth have occurred in rural areas of western Nebraska and Iowa. 'If they're smoking weed or doing heroin in small-town America, there's going to be a market for methamphetamine, too,' Shroba said. Woodward said the reduction in meth labs has 'wonderful collateral benefits,' meaning narcotics officers can turn attention to stopping trafficking. 'We all know that if we get a handle on meth labs, we will still have meth addicts who will work very hard to get their drug,' Crawford said. 'This is where the Mexican cartel meth will fill the void.'","Meth lab seizures are down 40 per cent in states associated with the trade .

"Why did the Duck cross the road? To hand out moving violation tickets apparently. On Halloween, police in Fort Lee, NJ used an undercover officer, dressed in a 6-foot-4 Donald Duck costume to bust 130 drivers for failing to yield to a pedestrian, according to WABC. On Oct. 31, as part of the Fort Lee Police Department's pedestrian decoy program, the officer, dressed in the costume, would step out into the crosswalk as if he were crossing the street. Quack: New Jersey's Fort Lee Police Department used an undercover cop dressed in a Donald Duck costume to bust more than 100 drivers for failing to yield to a pedestrian . Caught: When drivers failed to stop for the costumed cop, uniformed officers pulled them over farther down the road and gave them a moving violation ticket carrying a $230 fine as well as two points on their driver's license . When drivers failed to stop for the costumed cop, uniformed officers pulled them over farther down the road and gave them a moving violation ticket carrying a $230 fine as well as two points on their driver's license, WABC reports. 'Two years ago, we had 62 people struck,' Fort Lee police chief Keith Bendul told WABC. 'This year, we had 40, I'm glad to say. But zero is my ultimate goal.' WABC was present at the time the decoy program was held and reports that one driver honked his horn for the undercover cop to get out of the way and other times, drivers continued to drive through the crosswalk when the duck was in the street. Chief: Fort Lee police chief Keith Bendul said more than 60 people were struck last year as a result of drivers failing to yield to pedestrians . Crosswalk: During the decoy operation, one driver honked his horn for the undercover cop to get out of the way and other times, drivers continued to drive through the crosswalk when the duck was in the street . On the Department's Facebook page, it was made clear that the undercover officer was not crossing the street against a traffic light or pedestrian control sign. This effort by Fort Lee police may have led to the busts of more than one hundred drivers, but some drivers are saying they feel tricked by the Department's act. Karen Haigh, a River Edge resident who was ticketed, told WABC that she didn't know what the duck was trying to do. 'They told me that I was getting a ticket for not stopping for a duck,' she said. '...this duck kept going to the curb, off the curb, I thought it was a crazy guy on Halloween. 'It scared me. It was a huge duck.

Bendul said that using the undercover cop dressed as Donald Duck was for a good reason. 'When you see a pedestrian, child, adult or duck, stop,' Bendul said. 'Let them cross and proceed with your day.' Haigh says she plans to fight the $230 ticket because she didn't know what the costumed cop was trying to do and feels she was treated harshly.","New Jersey's Fort Lee Police Department used an undercover cop dressed in a Donald Duck costume to bust more than 100 drivers for failing to yield to a pedestrian .

"Thankful: Ali Stunt is a pancreatic cancer survivor who owes her life to a locum GP . Ali Stunt was bent double with crippling pains under her ribcage when she went to her GP. ‘I’d already been to the practice three times in as many weeks because it was so intense,’ recalls Ali, 47, a former geochemist who lives with her husband Phil, 49, a financial IT director, and their two sons, James, 19, and Nick, 16, in Haslemere, Surrey. ‘The pains had started in the centre of my back above my bra strap four weeks earlier. I couldn’t sit back in a chair or get comfortable in bed. ‘There was no lump sticking out as such, but it felt like I had a tennis ball in between my shoulder blades. The pain gradually moved round to my front under my rib cage and was much worse after I’d eaten. ‘I completely went off food and lost a stone in just a few weeks. I was also suffering from bouts of diarrhoea which I’d never had before. I was really worried.’ One of the regular GPs told her she had indigestion and prescribed the antacid Gaviscon. When the pain got worse and Ali went back a week later, she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and prescribed an anti-spasmodic drug. On her third visit, Ali told a third GP the pain had shifted from her back to under her ribcage. He said it was probably stomach irritation caused by the anti-inflammatory painkillers she’d been prescribed previously, and gave her codeine instead. ‘But this didn’t touch the pain,’ says Ali. ‘On my fourth visit, I saw a locum GP. She was a lot more thorough than the other doctors had been and asked me lots of detailed questions. She even phoned the local hospital’s A&E surgical specialist to get a second opinion. ‘I sensed the locum had a hunch it was something serious, as she urged me to go to A&E if the pain worsened.’ She went to A&E, but it was a Bank Holiday and no scans were being done. Ali was sent back to the GP. ‘I saw the same locum again and she looked very concerned and insisted I needed an urgent referral. She referred me to a pancreatic surgeon, which probably saved my life. Had I been sent to a different type of specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, it might have been too late.’ Young doctor: The locum GP who helped Ali Stunt solved her health problems despite her inexperience, and referred her to a specialist who saved her . Scans taken two days later by the specialist revealed a 5cm cancerous tumour in the middle of Ali’s pancreas. She had been just weeks away from being inoperable as the tumour was growing next to major blood vessels. ‘I’m alive five-and-a-half years later because a locum made the right call. My own GP admitted to me after my surgery that he’d never have picked up my cancer because I was young and otherwise healthy,’ says Ali. ‘You hear so many negative things about locums missing things — but I think the fact that I was seen by someone who was looking at me through a fresh pair of eyes, and who was perhaps more up-to-date in their knowledge, saved my life.’ Detailed questions: Mrs Stunt said that her own GP admitted after the surgery that he would never have picked up on the cancer because she was otherwise healthy . There are an estimated 15,000 GPs working as locums in the UK. They make up a quarter of the general practice workforce and see 36 million patients a year. A locum is a fully qualified doctor who provides temporary cover to fill a vacancy or cover sick leave, staff holidays or training commitments. Many newly qualified doctors work as locums to gain experience. There are also older doctors who want more flexibility and doctors from overseas, as well as retired doctors, who take up locum posts. ‘I’ve seen a jump in the number of GP partners leaving their regular practices mid-career to become locums, mostly from the sheer burden of extra paperwork and clinics they have to do,’ says Dr . Richard Fieldhouse, a GP locum and chief executive of the National Association of Sessional GPs. ‘Also, many more GPs these days are female. Working freelance as a locum can offer those with families a much better work-life balance.’ However, even though locums are trained to the same level as other doctors, many people are unwilling to see the ‘stand-in’. This is partly because locums tend to make the headlines only when things go wrong. For instance, German GP locum Dr Daniel Ubani was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2010 after being found guilty of serious clinical failings. One of his patients was given a fatal tenfold overdose of diamorphine. While the General Medical Council doesn’t collect figures about complaints against GP locums, experts say public perception is that numbers are high. ‘This idea that locums are somehow second-rate doctors is unfair,’ says Dr Fieldhouse. ‘I hear so much about patients wanting continuity of care — which is true — but with continuity can  sometimes come complacency. If a GP is seeing a patient repeatedly about a problem, it can sometimes be hard to spot what is wrong because the changes creep up over time. ‘A locum might walk in and spot it straight away. They may also find it easier to say difficult things such as the patient needs to lose weight or give up smoking.’ Dr Richard Vautry, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s General Practice Committee, agrees that sometimes seeing a different doctor, whether from within the practice or elsewhere, can be a good thing. Medical students: Mrs Stunt says she owes her life to a keen locum GP fresh out of studying . But he adds: ‘The patient doesn’t have the same relationship of trust with a locum that they have with their family doctors and if a consultation doesn’t go the way they were expecting, they can be more likely to make a complaint.’ Shehnaz Somjee, a surgeon and chair of the Locum Doctors’ Association, a professional body representing 4,000 locums, says stand-in doctors are often subject to more rigorous scrutiny than regular GPs. ‘Locums have to prove themselves in every job. When you start a new post, all the other staff eye your work through the microscope. If any slight mistake is made, it creates immediate alarm.’ Miss Somjee says a locum’s varied experience can stand them in good stead. ‘I know one locum who, because of his wide experience in different general practices, was able to spot an adverse drug reaction when the patient’s own doctor failed to do so.’ Like Ali, Catherine Jones, 28, a charity worker from London, also owes her life to a newly qualified doctor at a university practice. ‘I saw my family GP in Hampshire several times over a period of a year about a mole that had appeared in the middle of my back.

"As the G20 Leader's Summit looms nearer, both protests and security measures continue to be ramped-up in anticipation of next weekend's event. Up to 200 Indigenous activists from the Brisbane Aboriginal Sovereign Embassy (BASE) took part in a traditional welcoming ceremony at Musgrave Park in Brisbane's south on Sunday afternoon in preparation for their registered protest on Monday. The group prepared banners and posters for their November 9 demonstration which will be used to protest in favour of Indigenous rights and decolonisation. Scroll down for video . Indigenous activists from the Brisbane Aboriginal Sovereign Embassy (BASE) took part in a traditional welcoming ceremony at Musgrave Park in Brisbane's south on Sunday afternoon . The event, which involved up to 200 people, was a preparation for the groups protest for Indigenous rights and decolonisation on Monday . 'Today our kids are being removed at rates that dwarf the stolen generation, our people are imprisoned at five times that of blacks in apartheid South Africa, our people are still being murdered by police who get away unpunished, our young people have the world's highest suicide rate and our sacred lands and places are being destroyed and poisoned by mining. 'All this while the Australian Government and much of settler society refuse to face the fact that this continent has been stolen from First Nations,' Wayne Wharton, a BASE spokesperson said. The group's protest will come only a few days after 100 anti-poverty activists peacefully lined the Brisbane River on their deckchairs, dressed as accountants. The protesters, part of the anti-poverty group Micah Challenge, set up a mock tropical 'tax haven' in the central city to highlight the issue of multinational tax dodging which they claim robs $160 billion annually from developing countries. The group prepared banners and posters for their November 9 demonstration as G20 Summit leaders roll into the capital city . Security measures continue to be ramped up for the world summit, including road closures . As world leaders roll into Brisbane, it has been revealed that hundreds of surveillance cameras will be scanning the capital city for the next week. Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll says officers at the new G20 operations centre have already started watching the city around the clock. She says the cameras are watching Brisbane Airport, major roads, the CBD, South Bank and even hovering above in police helicopters. Ms Carroll said the state-of-the-art operations centre is 'the envy of all of our counterparts interstate'. 'It's unprecedented as to what footage we will have available to us,' she said. 'So obviously it puts (us) in good stead to ensure that, for instance, the motorcades are very, very safe.' Hundreds of surveillance cameras will be watching Brisbane Airport, major roads, the CBD, South Bank and even hovering above in police helicopters during the next week . The size of the world leaders' motorcades are also still being negotiated, but Ms Carroll said some were very long, which would be difficult to work with in the CBD. 'That's still in negotiation, and certainly from our point of view if it was smaller it would be easier to work with, but obviously that discussion happens with prime minister and cabinet initially and then with the Queensland Police Service,' she said. Dozens of police tactical commanders are based at the new operations centre, including those in charge of public order, special emergency response, motorcades, route security and bomb searches. Ms Carroll said hundreds of local, interstate and New Zealand police have also briefed on procedures over the weekend. BASE's protest will come only a few days after 100 anti-poverty activists peacefully lined the Brisbane River on their deckchairs, dressed as accountants . There is now believed to be about 6000 police, including 1500 from interstate and New Zealand, who will patrol the area until November 17. A large swathe of central Brisbane was declared a security zone on Saturday, creating a security buffer around areas like hotels where delegates will stay, as well as the convention centre where the summit will take place. Under the G20 (Safety and Security) Act, police will be granted the power to search people within the declared zone if they suspect them of having prohibited items such as firearms, knives and explosives, and even eggs, kites and glass jars.","The Brisbane Aboriginal Sovereign Embassy prepared for their G20 Summit protest for Aboriginal rights on Sunday .

"Sir Bob Geldof is preparing to release a new Band Aid single 30 years after Do They Know It’s Christmas? first topped the charts. The new charity track, Band Aid 30, is expected to feature boyband One Direction, none of whose members were born when the classic hit was released in 1984. Sir Bob, 60, and 61-year-old Scottish musician Midge Ure – who co-wrote the first Band Aid track – will announce the full details of the project tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Sir Bob Geldof, 60, and 61-year-old Scottish musician Midge Ure – who co-wrote the first Band Aid track - are preparing to release a new Band Aid single 30 years after Do They Know It’s Christmas? was first released . One Direction are expected to feature on the charity single which could raise funds for the Ebola crisis in Africa . Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran (left) and popstar Adele (right) are also rumoured to feature on the new track . Other stars rumoured to be involved are singers Adele, 26, Ed Sheeran, 23, Ben Howard, 27, Florence Welch, 28, and indie rock band Alt-J. Do They Know It’s Christmas?, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released. It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia. Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts. Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal . The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur. Florence Welch, 28, (left) and Ben Howard, 27, (right) are also among those expected to feature on the  single . Alt-J are also thought to be involved with the project, which comes 30 years after the original Band Aid single . Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit. Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were ‘patronising, false and out of date’. Its director Mark Curtis said at the time: ‘The song perpetuates the myth that Africa’s problems can somehow be blamed on lack of rainfall and failed harvests. ‘It conjures up an image of a continent inhabited entirely by starving children with flies on their faces sitting in the sunbaked bed of a dried up stream.’ Band Aid 20 (pictured), featuring the likes of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal, saw the re-release of Do They Know It's Christmas? to mark the 20th anniversary of the original in 1984 . It is thought Band Aid 30 will also be a recording of Do They Know It’s Christmas? and may help raise funds to fight the Ebola crisis in west Africa. Sir Bob recently revealed that reuniting with his band the Boomtown Rats had helped him cope with his grief after the death of his daughter Peaches from a heroin overdose in April. He said: ‘For those two hours I’m utterly, utterly lost in it. Somehow you’re allowed this other thing to come out and it is utterly cathartic, and so for two hours I forget it. I forget that stuff.’","Sir Bob Geldof, 60, and Midge Ure preparing to release new Band Aid Single .

"Bombers coach James Hird will continue his appeal against ASADA on Tuesday after arguing in court that the anti-doping unlawfully used the AFL to escape the limits of its own powers in probing the club's controversial supplements program. With his wife Tania, by his side in Melbourne's federal court on Monday, Hird is seeking to discredit ASADA's joint investigation with the AFL for a second time after a judge found the probe to be legal in September. Hird's barrister Peter Hanks QC said, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) had illegally recruited the AFL to force Essendon players to answer questions.

Bombers coach James Hird (pictured left) has the support of his wife Tania (pictured right) when he went to court Monday to appeal against the court's decision to uphold the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority's joint doping probe with the AFL . He told the full bench of the Federal Court there was no doubt ASADA could ask questions and request documents, but it had no powers to compel those being questioned to answer or deliver the documents. Essendon players and staff are forced to answer questions put to them by the AFL or face penalties under the contracts they sign with the league. 'The AFL's presence was plainly desired by ASADA in order to provide the compulsion,' Mr Hanks said. 'By having the AFL present the gate was opened to that disclosure. 'It's to circumvent, to walk around the limits on its power. 'It was very convenient and efficient but it was unlawful.' Tania Hird (pictured), wife of Essendon coach James Hird, walks out for the lunch break at the Federal Court in Melbourne, Monday . Jame Hird's (pictured left) barrister Peter Hanks QC (pictured right) said the appeal would focus squarely on what ASADA was empowered to do .

Wife Tania (pictured right) attends court to support her husband . Mr Hanks said ASADA ran the interviews, asking the bulk of the questions with the AFL 'topping and tailing' and asking its own questions at the end. He said the legislation governing ASADA at the time of the 2013 investigation entitled it to be 'assisted by and delegate to specific individuals' but those did not include a sporting body like the AFL. Justice John Middleton in September ruled that ASADA acted lawfully by conducting a joint investigation with the AFL into Essendon's 2012 supplements program. After that finding, ASADA issued show cause notices to 34 current and past Essendon players. The appeal continues.","Bombers coach James Hird is in federal court to appeal ASADA ruling over club's supplement program .

For the reception the bride changed into another Vera Wang creation featuring a drop-waist corset. Lara's gorgeous look was captured in photos snapped by Eliza Murphy, an ABC reporter who attended the wedding. A source told the New York Daily News that the bride had instructed her team to find a way to make her bandages blend with her Vera Wang gown. 'It's in the hands of her wedding planner, Jennifer Zabinski, and event designer, Preston Bailey,' an insider told Confidential.

'I think they're going to try and do something fun with the casts. She's been really cool about the whole thing.' Last week, Lara's future father-in-law Donald Trump told MailOnline that the wedding would go ahead as planned, despite the bride-to-be's injuries. 'Her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad. But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.' After announcing their engagement last July, the 30-year-old son of Donald Trump and his girlfriend, picked the Mar-a-Lago club which is where thirty-five-year-old Donald, Jr., the oldest Trump child, also chose for his wedding to model Vanessa Haydon in 2006. The married couple, who have been together for six years, began their wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday, followed by today's the black-tie ceremony, with a brunch on Sunday. Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara in July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York. It was reported that the couple had been on a walk with their miniature beagle, Charlie, when Eric presented his girlfriend with a dazzling ring from his sister Ivanka's fine jewelry collection. They then celebrated with champagne, which Eric, EVP of development and acquisitions at his father's company, had brought along for the occasion. Battered bride: Lara broke both of her wrists just weeks before the wedding, and walked down the aisle with casts on both arms . Mother-in-law: Ivana Trump (left with Lara and Lara's mother) hosted the bridal shower last month . When asked by OK! magazine about what they were most looking forward to on the big day, Yunaska laughed, 'Probably being done with wedding planning! 'We're looking very much forward to our honeymoon. We're going to go to Africa and then we're going to go to France.' According to Page Six, the couple's wedding website jokingly describes Eric as 'born into a relatively unknown New York family... Eric embraced his family's passion for Erector sets, Monopoly and Jenga, which ultimately led to a very successful career in construction and real estate.' The description continues: 'Bored with world domination, however, Eric soon realized that success isn't all it's cracked up to be without someone to love by your side.

Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan. After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts. She and Eric live together in New York City, where they regularly spend time with Eric's older sister Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner and their two young children Arabella and Joseph. Quiet moment: Lara posted a photo of her dog, who served as the ring bearer, and her future husband on Friday evening . Mommy and me: Ivanka enjoyed a day in the pool with her son the day before the wedding . The couple were married at Donald Trump's swanky Mar-a-Lago club. The 62,000 square-foot club, which was built in the 1920s by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriwether Post, is incredibly opulent and seated on a premiere piece of land in Palm Beach, Florida. According to the club's website, the Six-Star Diamond Award-holding club sits on 20 acres of manicured lawns and has 126 rooms. It was deemed a National Historic Landmark in 1972, a year before the heiress' death. Members are lavished with services from formal and casual dining to salons, spas, and a two-acre private beach. Its design mimics the Mediterranean villa style with elements of Moorish, Venetian, and Spanish influences. Mrs Post used two different architects – one to design the inside and the other to oversee the outside. Upon her death in 1973, she willed it to the U.S. government for use as a winter White House. But the U.S. government said it was too rich for their tastes, citing the annual $1million maintenance costs as the reason for declining, according to the Palm Beach Post. It was also too close to the Palm Beach airport. It was purchased by the Donald in 1985 for $10million. Mr Trump later renovated the mansion, adding a 20,000 square-foot ballroom, tennis and croquet courts, spa, and beach club. In 2012 bargain hunters looking to join what is arguably one of the country's most exclusive clubs were told the $200,000 initiation fee had bee slashed to $100,000 for membership privileges.

"A mother has vowed to help her transgender child get the treatment he needs after he has been refused a prescription for hormone blockers. Leo Waddell, 12,  from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was born as a girl called Lily but has lived as a boy since the age of five. At the age of 16, he intends to start taking testosterone and then have gender reassignment surgery at the age of 18. Unhappy: Leo and his mother Hayley appeared on This Morning to share their anguish at him being refused a prescription for hormone blockers . In the meantime, he wants to have hormone blockers to prevent the onset of puberty and the release of female hormones in his body. But his GP has refused to prescribe them because she is unsure of the long-term effects. Leo appeared on This Morning today with this mother, Hayley, 48, to talk about how upset he is about the decision. 'I didn't like it, I started to cry when she told me,' he said. He was born as a girl called Lily, right, but Leo has known he wants to live as a boy from the age of five . Presenter Phillip Schofield read a statement from Leo's GP that explained her decision. It read: 'I have no previous experience of . administering this specialist medication to young people. I have already . sought advice from my prescribing authority. 'Any clinical decision I . make always gives consideration to every aspect of the patient's . wellbeing. My priority is always infused with the welfare of the . patient.' 'What so many people don't understand is that I feel . it's far more dangerous for Leo to not have these hormone blockers' Hayley said she understood the doctor's position but as far as she is concerned, it is far better for Leo to have the blockers than not. She said: 'He . had all the tests and everything that said he's fine to have the . hormone blockers but it's down to the GP to prescribe them. She's not . happy enough, she doesn't know enough about the long term effects. But . this is research.' She added: 'What so many people don't understand is that I feel . it's far more dangerous for Leo to not have these hormone blockers. The things he has to go though, the emotions and the torment is slowly . bringing him down and down.' Explanation: Phillip Schofield read a statement from Leo's GP in which she said she said she had 'no previous experience of administering this specialist medication to young people' Leo gave an insight into his torment . when he appeared on This Morning earlier this year. He said then that he . would 'probably kill myself' if had to live as a girl. Hayley, . a hairdresser who also has three daughters, rejected the idea that Leo . shouldn't have the hormone blockers in case he later regrets his . decision. She said: 'I . think many people think that, maybe I did for some time in the early . days but that isn't going to happen, I know that 100 per cent, Leo needs . the blockers.' Hayley and Leo believe his teenage years will be much easier if he has the hormone blockers before he is then able to take testosterone. Not giving up: Hayley said they wiil keep visiting GPs until they find one who will prescribe the medication . She said: 'We . know someone grown up who has been through it who said he would have preferred never to have female hormones in his body before he started on . the testosterone.' The mother added that they will not give up and will keep trying to get the medication prescribed. 'All we can do is go around all the GPs and find someone who is sympathetic to trans children and is prepared to prescribe,' she said. Leo is one of Britain's youngest people with gender dysphoria, a . condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong . gender at birth. He and his family are being supported by a specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London. The trust announced in 2011 that their Gender Identity Development Service would work with University College London's Institute of Child Health on a research study looking at the effects of blocking sex hormones in early puberty in a carefully selected group of adolescents with Gender Identity Disorder.

"Murderer Craig Hudson won taxpayer funding for a High Court case in which he demanded the right to wear a woman's wig in prison . A murderer won taxpayer funding for a High Court case in which he demanded the right to wear a woman’s wig in jail. Craig Hudson – who is serving a life sentence for torturing and killing his wife – said he wanted to change sex and protested that without a female wig he would look like a ‘bald drag artiste’. The claim, paid for through legal aid, will result in a prison service review of the right of transgender prisoners to wear wigs and outsize women’s clothes. In a ruling revealed yesterday, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC accepted the argument of governors at maximum security Frankland prison, Durham, who told the court wigs are banned because prisoners can use them as a disguise in escape attempts. But the judge told prison officials: ‘Further work, I feel, needs to be done to see if the security risks may be mitigated.’ The judicial review brought by Hudson is understood to have cost taxpayers up to £10,000 in payments to a specialist firm of prison solicitors and a barrister. Taxpayers also funded a barrister and other lawyers to represent the Ministry of Justice, and the expense of running the court, resulting in total costs of up to £30,000. The case provoked a row at the Ministry of Justice, which runs the Legal Aid Agency, as Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is trying to cut legal aid waste and limit the number of spurious judicial review cases. Hudson’s claim went to the High Court despite concerns among medical experts and prison staff over his commitment to a sex change. The court heard that in prison he does not wear make-up or women’s clothing, even though he has the right to do so. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC accepted the argument of governors at Frankland prison, Durham, who told the court wigs are banned because prisoners can use them as a disguise in escape attempts . But he is now known officially as Kimberley Green and accused prison authorities of unlawful discrimination on transgender grounds. Hudson, 29, was a member of a ‘family from hell’ in Nottingham who imprisoned and tortured his 20-year-old wife, Rachel. Mrs Hudson died after two years of daily beatings and abuse. Her body was wrapped in a carpet and dumped. Her husband was one of five family members convicted of murder in December 2005. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 14 years, with concurrent sentences for attempts to pervert the course of justice. The High Court judge noted that the judge at Hudson’s murder trial said he ‘displayed a clear tendency to lie’. Hudson, 29, was a member of the 'family from hell' in Nottingham who imprisoned and tortured his 20-year-old wife, Rachel (pictured) In the latest ruling, Judge Richardson said Hudson was a prisoner ‘for whom the very highest regime of security is not needed, but for whom escape must be made very difficult’. ‘It is unclear whether the claimant has a diagnosis of [gender] dysphoria … A consultant psychiatrist at Charing Cross hospital regarded the claimant as a conundrum who appeared to be saying different things to different people,’ the judge said. Hudson complained that he was not given hormone treatment, prosthetic devices, hair removal products, separate gym changing and drug testing facilities, or access to wigs. But the judge ruled in the prison’s favour, saying: ‘To provide a wig in the prison context is simply providing a hostage to fortune – a plain security risk.’ But he added: ‘There may come a time in the future where the wig issue and the outsize clothing issue will not be so easily rebutted.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said legal aid ‘must be targeted at those most in need of a lawyer’ and that it is stopping prisoners receiving criminal legal aid unnecessarily. The Legal Aid Agency said cases had to meet ‘strict financial means and legal merits tests’.","Craig Hudson said he wanted to change sex and protested that without a female wig he would look like a 'bald drag artiste'

"Motorists who throw rubbish from their cars could face prosecution as part of moves to make littering as 'socially unacceptable as drink driving'. Government ministers want to clamp down on drivers who throw rubbish from their vehicles in a bid to lower the multi-million pound cost of picking up roadside waste. It is also part of moves to make it simpler for councils to impose fines on people who litter on the roads. Motorists who throw rubbish from their cars could face prosecution as part of moves to make littering as 'socially unacceptable as drink driving . Ministers want to push for a 'cultural change' over littering in Britain as it was revealed about 30 million tons are dropped a year leaving the country with a £1billion clean-up bill. The Sunday Telegraph says it has seen Government documents which state: 'We support the view that littering should be as socially unacceptable as drink driving.' The newspaper says that other measures under consideration include organising a 'clean up Britain day' funded by the Government. They also include fresh guidelines outlining powers local councils have to control littering as well as requirements for cigarette companies to provide finds for picking up discarded butts. The Sunday Telegraph quotes the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles as saying: 'There is a lot more we can do to clean up our streets by working with community groups and young people to encourage social responsibility and restoring a sense of local pride. Ministers want to push for a 'cultural change' over littering in Britain as it was revealed about 30 million tons are dropped a year leaving the country with a £1billion clean-up bill .

Outside London, enforcement officers are only permitted to fine motorists if they can prove exactly who threw litter from a vehicle, the newspaper reports. But it says powers passed earlier this year mean that if rubbish is seen being thrown from a car, van or lorry, the registered keeper can be fined. The Government is carrying out further studies as it looks to take its latest proposals forward.","Drivers could face prosecution for littering under new Government plans .

"Fear for his life: Edward Snowden has allegedly received death threats from  Pentagon and NSA officials . American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden fears for his life and needs stronger security, his Russian lawyer claimed on Tuesday. Explicit threats to kill him have been made anonymously by Pentagon and National Security Agency officials, alleged Anatoly Kucherena. ‘There are real threats to his life out there that actually do exist,’ he told Russian news channel Vesti. ‘These statements call for physical retribution against Edward Snowden.’ Snowden, 30, has taken refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering involving the monitoring of millions of phone calls and emails. There are recent U.S. claims that the former espionage contractor may have received Russian assistance before revealing his huge classified dossier in the name of transparency and openness. Kucherana was referring to an article last week on BuzzFeed entitled ‘American Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead’. It quoted a Pentagon official as saying: ‘I would love to put a bullet in his head.’ Another source described as a current NSA analyst said: ‘In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American, I personally would go and kill him myself.’ Snowden has been carefully guarded in Moscow since he received temporary asylum in August a move which outraged the U.S. and led to President Barack Obama snubbing a summit invitation from his opposite number Vladimir Putin, a former spy. ‘Edward is treating these as real threats,’ said the Russian lawyer. ‘Today, it might not be enough to have private guards. We must also think about how to safeguard his life and wellbeing.’ He challenged the U.S. government to name the officials who made the apparent threats. In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase security . ‘We think that the U.S. government must take note of such statements,’ said the lawyer. ‘The people who make extremist statements do so while wearing a mask -- they do not reveal their identities. ‘But we have specific publications that printed these interviews. We will ask for these people's masks to come off. We must know who this NSA officer is, who issues orders about ways to eliminate Edward Snowden.’ The blast came after the heads of congressional intelligence committees in Washington claimed on Sunday that Snowden could have been working in collusion with Russian secret services at the time he was gathering his treasure trove of classified data. Putin has specifically denied his agents worked with Snowden. ‘I don't think it was a gee-whiz luck event that he ended up in Moscow under the handling of the FSB,’ said Republican representative Mike Rogers.","Edward Snowden has received anonymous death threats, his lawyer says .

"The nurse who successfully fought an Ebola quarantine order is planning to leave a Maine town with her boyfriend and move out of state. Ted Wilbur says he and girlfriend Kaci Hickox will leave Fort Kent no earlier than Monday, the last day of the disease's 21-day incubation period. Wilbur withdrew Friday from the University of Maine campus in Fort Kent, where he was a senior nursing student. Hickox said they were exploring the idea of relocating and looking at a new college — and noted that it would probably be outside Maine. Scroll Down for Video . Ted Wilbur says he was barred from returning to his studies at the University of Maine at Fort Kent despite his girlfriend Kaci Hickox being declared 'not contagious' by state officials . 'We're going to try to get our lives back on track,' Wilbur said Friday night to the Portland Press Herald. A state judge sided with Hickox when she challenged an order to isolate her after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. The couple decided to leave after Hickox was told she could go where she pleased after a judge ruled in her favor in October, but her boyfriend was told to stay away from his studies. Ted Wilbur withdrew Friday from the University of Maine at Fort Kent, said Ray Phinney, associate dean of student life and development. He declined further comment. Leaving: Kaci Hickox and Ted Wilbur have announced that they will now leave their home in Maine and possibly the state after the Ebola quarantine controversy . Wilbur says he was forced to stay away from campus while his girlfriend was in the news amid attempts to quarantine her after she returned from treating Ebola patient in West Africa. But university officials contend he voluntarily agreed to stay off campus. ""I wish that his university had showed more leadership in all of this. I think they only fueled the flames of confusion and misinformation. That's been really disappointing for us,"" his girlfriend, Kaci Hickox, told The Associated Press. Hickox contended there was no need to isolate her. A state judge sided with her, saying she poses no health threat because she's showing no symptoms. On October 31 a Maine judge sided with her, rejecting the state's attempt to restrict her movement. In October, the judge said there's no need to restrict her movements because she's not showing symptoms of Ebola. In his ruling, LaVerdiere thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and wrote that 'people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational'. The state of Maine had gone to court to keep Hickox at home until her incubation period ended on November 10. Hickox, right, and Wilbur, take delivery of a pizza at their home in Fort Kent, Maine, in October before a judge ruled her incubation was unconstitutional . After the judge ruled against this, he thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up. The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote. 'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.' Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine. She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.","Kaci Hickox to leave Maine home after 21-day incubation period ends  Monday .

"Prime Minister David Cameron is set to announce a £15billion boost for more than 100 projects, which is expected to be completed by the end of the decade . David Cameron will today embrace what Margaret Thatcher called 'the great car economy' as he unveils plans for the biggest roadbuilding programme for almost half a century. The Prime Minister will announce a £15billion boost for more than 100 projects to be completed by the end of the decade, resulting in hundreds of miles of extra lanes on Britain's motorways and trunk roads. Schemes include finally putting the A303 into a tunnel past the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck, and widening the A1 north of Newcastle and trans-Pennine roads in the north of England. Mr Cameron's announcement echoes the 'roads for prosperity' scheme unveiled by Mrs Thatcher in 1989 to boost 'the great car economy', which promised the largest expansion of the roads network since the Romans. But many schemes were quietly abandoned in the mid-1990s after environmental protests and spending cuts. Addressing the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual conference in London today, Mr Cameron will say the Government is to set out the first-ever long term 'roads investment strategy' for the UK in Chancellor George Osborne's forthcoming autumn statement. The programme will improve the lives of commuters and support business and enterprise across the country, he will claim. The scheme will be 'the biggest, boldest and most far-reaching road improvement programme in four decades', Mr Cameron will say. 'This will be nothing less than a roads revolution – one which will lead to quicker journey times, more jobs, and businesses boosted.' The £15billion investment between 2015-16 and 2020-21 will be the biggest upgrade to our roads in a generation, officials say, and will take total spending on the network over the decade to £24billion. Scroll down for video . One of the schemes includes finally putting the A303 into a tunnel past the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck . • The A303 to the south-west . • The A1 north of Newcastle . • The A1 Newcastle-Gateshead western bypass . • Trans-Pennine roads in the north of England, . • The A47 in the east of England . • The A27 on the south coast . Unions claim the move is a precursor to its privatisation of the roads network, which has been valued at £111billion, and more tolls being charged. Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, which promotes improved public transport said the plans 'will trash protected areas and do nothing for the economy'. He added: 'It makes no sense to spend billions ploughing more lanes of traffic through our National Parks or desecrating irreplaceable historic sites like Stonehenge.' 'These schemes will make people more dependent than ever on their cars, place greater costs on the NHS, while failing to tackle problems like the massive backlog of pot holes blighting local roads.' AA president Edmund King said: 'Roads carry 90 oer cent of goods and people and are our biggest transport asset and so it makes perfect sense to upgrade them to help the UK economy by improving journey times for people and business. 'AA members have told us, in a new AA/Populus that the most important message they want conveyed to the Government is 'we pay too much motoring tax yet so little is spent on the roads'. Perhaps at long last road users are going to see more of their hard paid motoring taxes being reinvested in the road network'. Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: 'This is another pre-election con trick from David Cameron. This desperate so-called announcement of promised road improvements includes no additional money and people simply won't fall for it. 'When it comes to road investment, the truth is Cameron leaves us like a frustrated motorist trying to get through the rush hour - we're stuck going nowhere fast. 'Cameron should be judged on his record, not on a speech, and his record on road investment has been nothing but a chaotic series of u-turns. Cutting investment, then promising to restore it after 2015. Cancelling road schemes, like the A14, then reinstating them. And constantly failing to meet deadlines for the completion of improvements. 'Far from taking big decisions on transport, Cameron has dithered for five years on airport expansion and has been so slow to bring forward the HS2 Bill that it won't pass in this Parliament. 'We know Cameron's record on infrastructure is one of all talk and no delivery. Infrastructure output has fallen by nearly 20% since May 2010 and less than a third of projects in the Government's pipeline are actually classed as 'in construction'. 'The Tories should back Labour's plan for an independent infrastructure commission to end the dither and delay on the decisions we need to take for Britain's future.'","David Cameron to announce £15billion boost for 100 projects on UK roads .

"The sisters of the hiker who was immortalized by the film Into The Wild have said his journey was an escape from his traumatic childhood. Chris McCandless  left his California family home and set out across the American West and into Alaska. Four months after he reached Alaska in 1992, the 24-year-old's body was found by hunters in an abandoned bus, 30 miles away from the nearest town. It is believed he died of starvation, potentially after becoming ill from the seeds he was eating to survive. Many believe his story, that was the basis for the 2007 movie, was inspired by his love of nature. But according to ABC in a new memoir The Wild Truth written by his sister Carine, she reveals a troubled upbringing that involved his father beating his mother and getting two women pregnant at the same time. Scroll down for video . The Wild Truth: In a new memoir written by his sister Carine, she reveals a troubled upbringing that involved Chris McCandless' father beating his mother and getting two women pregnant at the same time . Family: Shelly McCandless (center left) Carine McCandless (center right) and Shawna McCandless (far right) talk with ABC's Bob Woodruff (far left) at the site where the body of Chris McCandless was found . Walt McCandless, Chris' father, started having children with Billie. However he was still having children with his first wife, Marcia, at the time. The former NASA rocket scientist was still married to Marcia and dividing his time between the two families - one with Billie, Chris, and Carine and another with Marcia and their six children, including Shelly and Shawna. Walt and Marcia divorced when Chris was four-years-old. Carine said her and Chris knew they had half-siblings and sometimes would spend time with them. The sisters say their father was controlling and domineering, with a very short temper that turned into angry, verbal outbursts and attacks on Marcia and Billie, with pushing and shoving. Shelly McCandless, who lived with Chris and Carine her senior year of high school, said 'There was a lot of choking and shoving.' Chris left his family home in California and set out across the American West and into Alaska . Carine McCandless said: 'We would hear raised voices, and it would get louder and louder, and Chris would usually come and grab me and get me outside of the house. 'We would hear my mom say, ""Kids, kids, Come look what your father is doing to me,"" and then he would scream right after, ""kids, get in here now, look what your mother is making me do"".' She then described how her father would throw her down on the bed and be choking her. In between each breath, she claims she would scream for help. When he let go, the pair's mother would run over and hug both of them, saying: 'I'm sorry, kids. But when I got pregnant with Chris, I got stuck with your Dad.' In one incident, Carine described how her father directed the violence at Chris. She told the station: 'Dad just hauled off and punched him right on the spin, and Chris just turned and looked to him and [had a] puff of disgust across his lips, and I saw this fear come across my father's face, and Chris just turned around and walked away.' Immortalized: Chris was played by Emile Hirsch (pictured) in the 2007 film that was directed by Sean Penn . ABC News obtained a copy of a restraining order Marcia filed in 1972 against Walt . She said that he had 'struck' her in the arm and face, that he 'threatened' her many times, occasions and that she 'feared for her safety.' In a statement to ABC News addressing Carine McCandless' book, Walt and Billie McCandless said: '[This] fictionalized writing has absolutely nothing to do with our beloved son, Chris, his journey or his character. 'This whole unfortunate event in Chris' life 22 years ago is about Chris and his dreams.' The last time the sisters saw Chris was when he was celebrating college graduation. He wrote a letter, that will be revealed in an upcoming PBS documentary about his life, explaining why he wanted to go. Carine does not believe that it was his intention to die.","Chris McCandless left his family home in California when he was 24 .

"Monty says that there is a wide range of alpine plants that can be successfully grown in most gardens . Alpine plants are something I've come to late in the day. I'd admired them for a long time and seen them growing in places as diverse as Tromso Botanical Garden in Norway, the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa and the Himalayas. Now I'm building a small collection that is just getting into its prime flowering period in my own garden here, bejewelling the dozen pots and troughs I have - and which I add to almost weekly. To describe a plant as an alpine refers to the conditions it naturally grows in rather than referring specifically to the Alps or even necessarily mountains. Botanically they are plants that grow between the tree line and unmelted snow. This tends to be on mountains but can be - and I have seen alpines growing magnificently there - at sea level, 300 miles inside the Arctic Circle. Many alpines have adapted to growing in the biting cold and wind by being small and ground-hugging, only throwing up flowers in the brief summer months. When plant material dies in these conditions it only decomposes very slowly and as a result the soil is usually very poor, so most alpines have evolved to be happiest in very stony or sandy soil with exceptionally good drainage. But there are alpine meadows and woods and consequentially a wide range of alpines that can be successfully grown in most gardens. Even if, like me, you have a garden whose soil is heavy clay, alpines can look their best in containers ranging from terracotta pots or pans to large stone troughs - which are ideal because they have a large surface area and because most alpines look good when set among a stony background. Q My rhododendrons have only flowered once in the past year when previously they have flowered twice. Why? The garden gets quite a lot of wind and only partial shade. Victor Snape, FlintshireA Given that rhodies hate wind, hot sun and dehydration you are lucky that they flower at all! All rhododendrons usually only flower once although occasionally they flower again in a mild autumn because they think spring has arrived early.Q How do I prune dwarf buddleias and should I repot them each year? John Rogers, Carmarthenshire . A Dwarf buddleias only need repotting  once every three years as long as the soil is free draining and the container is large enough for the roots to grow. They produce flowers on new shoots, so prune hard now and you will have flowers in late summer just when the butterflies, which love buddleias best, need them most.Q What will happen if I cut off the top of my variegated hornbeam tree? Mrs Hilary Montgomery, DorsetA Every tree has a leader, a particularly strong-growing shoot. Cut this and the shoots beneath it grow stronger and bush out until one replaces it and becomes the new leader. So your tree will bush out for a year or two and then go on growing up. I wonder if your 'variegated hornbeam' (there is no such thing) is in fact a variegated hawthorn maple - Acer crataegifolium 'Veitchii'? The other advantage of containers is that they can easily have their soil customised to exactly suit the plants growing in them. Because so many alpines are small, even tiny, growing them in pots suits them well and they can be moved so that they become a precious display when they are flowering and then set slightly to one side while they are hunkered down for winter. Of course, if you are very keen you can have a specialist alpine house, which is essentially an unheated greenhouse with a plunge bed, consisting of terracotta pots sunk into the soil to keep the roots cool, and extreme ventilation. This is important because although the plants need maximum sun and shelter from rain, they certainly do not need heat or moist air. To ensure good drainage for any alpine plant it is best to use at least 50 per cent horticultural grit mixed with peat-free potting compost. Leaf mould or composted bark mixed with grit and some loam also make a perfectly good growing medium for any alpine. For sinks or troughs, fill the bottom foot or so with hard core (broken bricks and stones) and mix the soil with grit. To test whether the drainage is sharp enough, make a heap of the soil mix, flattening the top and scooping out a hollow. Fill this with water. If the water immediately soaks into the pile then the mix is correct. If it makes even the smallest puddle then it needs more grit. Larger alpines can be grown in a rock garden - although these are increasingly unfashionable nowadays - or a dedicated raised bed filled with rubble and stone and topped with just an inch or two of topsoil mixed with the same volume of horticultural grit. Alpines may be small but most are tough. The key things to remember for any alpine is plenty of sunshine, poor soil with really good drainage and ideally some protection from too much winter rain.","Monty says that alpine plants can be grown easily in most gardens .
