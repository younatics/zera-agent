His family had already been decimated by the First World War when John Gordon Shallis appealed against being sent to the frontline. He'd lost three brothers to the conflict - which still ranks as among the deadliest in human history, resulting in 16 million deaths and 20 million wounded. Before the appeal was heard, a fourth had been killed. John Gordon Shallis's appeal for exemption from fighting in World War One was granted. He had already lost three brothers and was soon to have lost a fourth. His parents from Harlesden, also lost a son-in-law, and Shallis appealed on the grounds of domestic hardship. The chairman of the panel wrote they were 'of the opinion that the mother is entitled to the comfort she will obtain by the retention of this last son'. And so, given the exceptional personal circumstances, and Shallis's employment within the munitions industry, Shallis -  who died in 1975 - was granted an exemption. Today the details of how 8,000 men tried to avoid conscription in . the First World War, are released by the National Archives. They provide a unique and fascinating insight into the battles fought on the home front to avoid the bloody conflict. Harry George Ward was another one of thousands of men desperate to avoid a war. Describing himself as a foreign correspondent and book-keeping clerk, his argument - that he should not be sent to fight on conscientious grounds, because of his socialist beliefs - was bluntly rejected. The tribunal chairman allegedly stated . that, as a socialist, he couldn't possibly have a conscience so he could . not be regarded as a conscientious objector. The way Ward was dismissed was raised in Parliament by an MP and Ward, 20, from Ponders End, appealed. He lost this hearing too, but later appealed to the central tribunal. John Gordon Shallis lost four older brothers in the war and successfully appealed against conscription. His appeal is published online today by the National Archives. Another man, butcher Aden Stone, appealed on economic grounds . in order to look after his shop. An exemption was granted by the . tribunal - but it was only for one day, the shortest exemption granted by . the tribunal. The tribunal decided that Mr Stone had . deliberately brought out a local competitor in an attempt to increase . his business needs, and thus improve his chances of exemption. Frederick Lunkenheimer whose parents migrated to Britain . from Germany before 1914. He said his parents had fled Germany to escape military service and had been bought up to think that 'all warfare was wrong'. The 20-year-old, from Acton, said that the family's bakery and confectionery shop had been 'wrecked by the public owing to the bitter feeling against us being Germans'. He added: 'We were prevented from carrying on further business and grossly insulted in various ways.' He applied to be exempted as a conscientious objector but had his appeal dismissed. He went on to serve with the Middlesex Regiment, but in a labour battalion which did not leave Britain. The fascinating papers also reveal the attitudes of local people to those seen as trying to escape their patriotic duty. Harry Harris's shop was used in his appeal on economic grounds not to fight in World War One. His appeal was dismissed. An . anonymous letter to the tribunal, about Charles Rubens Busby, questions . why he is allowed to keep his butcher's shop and not serve, while . 'married men have had to shut up their shop and go'. Mr Busby is subsequently described as 'a proper rotter of a man' and a 'rotten shirker'. The writer of the letter had lost two sons in the war and was understandably aggrieved and heart-broken. Busby later served with the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force between 1917 and 1918. Samuel Harridge, a builder's labourer from Acton, tried resisting conscription on the grounds that he had a brother in the army and was looking after his sister and widowed mother. The tribunal accepted evidence from a local military representative that the family would suffer 'no serious hardship', should he serve, because the sister could 'leave school and get employment'. Thousands of papers from the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal, which heard appeals between 1916 and 1918, have been digitised as part of a series of events to mark the war's centenary. The documents - one of only two complete surviving collections of tribunal records - reveal men seeking exemption on medical, family or economic grounds as well as the relatively small proportion wishing not to fight on moral grounds as conscientious objectors. Rachael Corver studies records of the Central Military Service Tribunal and Middlesex Appeal Tribunal for World War One, released by the National Archives . The National Archives said the papers offered an insight into personal circumstances, including letters, medical certificates, statements and even religious pamphlets, as well as business information. Chris Barnes, records specialist at the National Archives, said: 'The conscription appeal records provide a different perspective of the First World War away from the battles, revealing the impact the war had on the home front. 'Digitising this collection opens up the records to allow people across the globe to discover the lesser-known stories of First World War for themselves.' Of the 11,307 separate appeals heard between 1916 and 1918, only 577 were conscientious objection cases, or just over 5%. Harry Harris was reported by a member of the public who had lost two sons in the war. Harry's appeal not to fight in World War One was subsequently dismissed. The majority of appeals were dismissed and many people did go on to see war service. The sensitive nature of the appeals against compulsory military service during and after the First World War has meant that only a small minority of the tribunal papers survive. In the years that followed the end of the war, the Government issued instructions to the local government boards that all tribunal material should be destroyed, except for the Middlesex Appeal records and a similar set for Lothian and Peebles in Scotland, which were to be kept as a benchmark for possible future use. John Gordon Shallis's appeal case has now been digitised in a series which contains 11,000 case papers from the Middlesex Appeal Tribunal which heard appeals between 1916 and 1918. A sample of records from the Central Tribunal was also kept. The Military Service Act of 1916 introduced compulsory conscription to Great Britain for the first time in modern history. Before this act, the armed forces were generally made up of volunteers. While conscientious objection was not specifically defined in the act of 1916, the government recognised those whose 'objection genuinely rests on religious or moral convictions'. Only a small number of conscientious objectors were exempted from service absolutely. Most were obliged to serve in non-combatant roles or faced courts martial. Britain abolished National Service in 1960. A Women's War Work booklet, published to highlight the roles that women were being employed to do, to substitute for men who could be freed to join the army, was published today . In 1921 the Ministry of Health decided that all papers relating to individual cases of exemption from National Service and tribunal minute books (except those of the Central Tribunal), should be destroyed. World War 1 began on July 28, 1914 and lasted until November 11, 1918. Differences in foreign policies were to blame, although the immediate cause was the assassination of Austriaâ€™s Archduke Ferdinand. The two main sides were the Allies, which included France, Great Britain and Russia; and Germany and Austria-Hungary. In total, 30 countries were involved in the conflict. Italy, once part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, fought on the side of the Allies. Soldiers fought largely in trenches during the war, and thousands suffered from stress, known as shell-shock. Over a million soldiers were killed in the infamous Battle of the Somme alone, including about 30,000 in just one day.","Details of how 8,000 men tried to avoid conscription are revealed online .

Carer Faye Gibson, 36, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, was jailed yesterday for fraud after admitting stealing money from elderly men she was working for . A carer who agreed to marry the 74-year-old she was looking after has been jailed after stealing the money he had saved to pay for his funeral. Drug addict Faye Gibson, 36, got engaged to vulnerable Alan Buck without his relatives knowing and then plundered his Post Office account, a court heard. The mother-of-one from Beverley, East Yorkshire, also stole money from another man she cared for, 96-year-old Eric Moran, after he had asked her to do some shopping for him. Yesterday Gibson was jailed at Hull Crown Court after admitting two charges of fraud by abusing her position of trust as a carer. The court was told that Mr Buck, who suffers from heart problems and lives in supervised housing, had employed Gibson for seven years to help him with domestic chores. Prosecutor Sobia Ahmed said: 'They formed a relationship and got engaged four years ago, although Mr Buck's family were not aware of it.' The court heard that Mr Buck trusted Gibson with his Post Office card, giving her access to his account in which he said he had £2,500 saved to cover his funeral expenses. But when he checked his account, he discovered the balance was just £4.  Gibson was arrested and Mr Buck's card found at her home, while her bank statements showed large cash deposits, the court heard. Ms Ahmed said Mr Buck's daughter said her father had now become suspicious of strangers since the theft, and forgot to take his medication. Gibson also stole money from her client Mr Moran, who has lived alone since the death of his wife two years ago and who suffers mobility problems. The prosecutor said Mr Moran had employed Gibson for eight years and often took him shopping to Morrisons. She said the elderly man noticed money was missing from his Halifax bank account and told police the only person who had access to his details was Gibson. Gibson admitted stealing £980 from Mr Buck and £3,900 from Mr Moran, though both men said more was missing from their accounts. Gibson was sentenced to three months in prison at Hull Crown Court, left, by Judge Michael Mettyear, right . Charlotte Baines, defending, said: 'She recognises this was despicable behaviour and regrets it. 'She . lapsed into heroin addiction, which she started when she was 21, . although these two men had no idea she was taking illicit substances.' Sentencing her to three months in prison, Judge Michael Mettyear told Gibson: 'A clear and consistent message needs to be sent out by the courts that people who care for the elderly and vulnerable and commit dishonesty against them will go to prison.' He said he had borne in mind her guilty plea and the age of her son, which had dramatically reduced the sentence he could have passed.","Faye Gibson, 36, agreed to marry Alan Buck, 74, before stealing his money .

Employees at Marston Aerospace in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, branded the gesture 'a kick in the teeth' and said it had been ill-timed. Just one day after managers announced they were making 60 workers redundant, bosses handed out free 2014 calendars to all staff. The calendar being handed out by Marston Aerospace, Wolverhampton just hours after they axed 60 jobs . The front cover of the calendar features a coastal sun-set under the words: 'A Bright Future for Our Company 2014 Calendar.' A caption on the calendar also reads: 'Explore your horizons.' One furious worker said: 'I saw all these calendars laid out for us and when I read what was on the front I felt like throwing them in the bin. 'We usually get them in December and had we had them then there wouldn't have been an issue but the day after we're told 60 people could be made redundant just feels like a kick in the teeth.' Another compared the move to Ricky Gervais' awkward character David Brent, famed for his insensitive comments.

Neil Skipper, 30, told his parents he would be back for tea before going to Putney station and falling in front of a high-speed train, an inquest heard . A man told his parents he was going out and would be back for dinner before falling in front of a high-speed train and fatally injuring himself. Neil Skipper, 30, had received an aggressive spam email before he wrote a note saying 'Sorry mum and dad' and left his home in Thornton Heath, south London, for the last time, an inquest heard. The business support officer for Croydon Council died from multiple injuries after he was hit by the train at Putney station, south west London, on June 1 last year. His parents became concerned when he didn’t return home, and searched his bedroom, finding the note by his computer. When they turned it on they found a rogue, threatening email he’d received from a spam address. The matter was being investigated further by police, the inquest heard, though contents of the email were not disclosed. Coroner Dr William Dolman reached an open verdict at Westminster Coroner’s Court after ruling out suicide. The inquest heard how Mr Skipper left home and travelled on the bus, train and tube before arriving at Putney station, where he stepped in front of a train.  He was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Skipper, a Fulham Football Club season ticket holder, had no history of mental illness and was an intelligent and logical thinker, it was reported. Station: Mr Skipper left his home in Thornton Heath and made his way to Putney in south west London . His GP, Dr Simon Ramsbotham, said he had obsessive interests in trains and dinosaurs which might point to Asperger syndrome. He said it would explain his drastic reaction to what he saw on his computer. Mr Skipper's father, Philip, said after the tragedy that his son would always be loved and always be missed. In a statement read to the court by Dr Dolman, he said: 'Neil was a clever person and after studying for a journalism degree he started working for Croydon Council in 2007 where he had many friends. 'He was family orientated, and was working with his granddad to write memoirs from his experiences in the war. 'He said he would be back in time for tea but he did not return.'

Simon Gamble is believed to have died one hour after he had been sent home from hospital with chest pains for a second time . A builder died just one hour after he had been sent home by doctors with chest pains after they diagnosed him with anxiety, it has been alleged. Simon Gamble, 46, is said to have been sent home twice from Clacton District Hospital, in Essex, in the 24 hours before his death. His mother Chrissie Westgate has now called for a review of the hospital's procedures following the death of her son, of St Osyth, Essex, who leaves two children, aged nine and seven. Mrs Westgate, of West Mersea, Essex, says her son's 'heart just stopped'. She said: 'It was horrendous. He had been to Clacton Hospital twice, the day before and the day he died, with pains in his chest. 'Both times he was sent away because they told him he was suffering from anxiety. 'He came out of hospital, went home on his own where within an hour, we think, he died. 'That's awful for us because if only he had phoned us. We might not have found him alive but you don't know. 'We intend to follow it up but can’t until we have the post-mortem examination report.' Mrs Westgate said her son, who died on January 2, was not an anxious person and did not have underlying heart problems. She said: 'The coroner phoned and said it was not a heart attack, she said his heart just stopped beating.' Mr Gamble, who was a keen musician, is said to have been sent home twice from Clacton District Hospital, in Essex, in the 24 hours before his death . Mrs Westgate said the post-mortem examination will be available in three weeks. She said: 'I wouldn’t dream of suing anyone or anything like that. 'But to send him home twice - why didn’t they send him to Colchester hospital? 'I wasn’t there and I don’t know what he said to them, but somebody should have sent him for further tests. Mrs Westgate said her son visited Clacton District Hospital (pictured) twice with chest pains . 'We are not the sort of people that are . going to start shouting and screaming, but we will voice our concerns by . writing a letter to say in the future we would like their procedure . taken seriously.' A spokesman for Anglian Community Enterprise said: 'We would like to offer our sincerest condolences to the family of Mr Gamble on their loss. Mr Gamble's mother Chrissie Westgate has now called for a review of the hospital's procedures . 'Patient confidentially regulations do not allow us to publicly discuss an individual patient’s condition and treatment. 'However, we will investigate the . circumstances of Mr Gamble’s visit to Clacton Hospital’s minor injuries . unit on January 2 and if his family wishes to contact us we will, . naturally, discuss with them any concerns they may have.' Mr Gamble, who was a keen musician, grew up in Mersea and went to school in Colchester. His nine-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter live with their mother in Cornwall. He also leaves his mother Mrs Westgate, father David Gamble and stepmother Valerie, who live in Colchester, and sister, Victoria. His passions were music and building. He played the guitar, banjo and trombone, which he also taught himself to play. Mrs Westgate said: 'He was a person who lived totally in the moment.  If he didn’t want to go to work one day, he wouldn’t, he would sit and play guitar. 'Riches didn’t interest him, he just loved life. A friend said to me, however long he lived, no-one was ever going to clip his wings.' Mrs Westgate said she had received about 160 sympathy cards. She said: 'Everybody knew him. We have never had so many people phone up and come round and offering condolences. I have been astounded by it, it is humbling.' About 500 people are expected to attend his funeral in West Mersea on Friday.","Mother alleges her son died an hour after he was sent home from hospital .

A British fox has broken a walking record after trekking 195 miles to find a new home. Wildlife experts tracked the adult urban fox, called Fleet, using a GPS unit fitted to a collar around his neck, and were updated on his location every 30 minutes. During the course of three weeks, Fleet travelled from Brighton, across Sussex, into Kent and ended in Rye, before the signal was lost - meaning the creature could still be on his journey. An adult fox, called Fleet, pictured, was fitted with a GPS tracker. He made the 195-mile journey over the course of three weeks in December. Researchers claim Fleet was hunting for a new home after his son, Fennec, forced him out. The GPS signal has been lost meaning the fox could still be going . A team from BBC Two’s Winterwatch fitted Fleet and FEnnec with night-vision cameras to catch them interacting. Footage revealed Fennec’s body language, with his low posture and ears, indicated he was now the alpha male. The . scientists also noticed Fleet was not at his best and concluded he was . suffering from lung worm. As Fleet was was no longer the leader in his . territory, experts believe he set off in search of a new home. Dr . Scott said: 'We don’t exactly know what happened but we think Fennec . pushed him out and that pressure caused him to leave and try to find . somewhere else.' Scientist Dr Dawn Scott led the research project after she discovered a father and son pair living at the end of a garden in Hove, Sussex. Fleet, who is believed to be three years old, was the dominant member until his son, dubbed Fennec, grew up and took control of the territory. Fleet left his home on 9 December before moving to a cemetery in Brighton. He then headed north out of the city and across the A27 towards Hassocks, Sussex. Fleet began to make his way back south, but appeared to change his mind and headed east. By Christmas, Fleet was tracked in Heathfield and then crossed the county’s border into Kent. He journeyed back into Sussex over . the the New Year and finished up in Rye having covered a distance of 195 . miles (315km) in just over three weeks - the previous record was just . 32 miles set in Wales. Fearing Fleet had been shot or hit by a car, Dr Scott and her team ventured to his last known location. 'We went to area where we last had a signal for him to see if he had been run over or injured,' said Dr Scott. Fleet left home on 9 December before moving to a cemetery in Brighton.

It . is the first known British bat to have crossed the North Sea and the . finding gives weight to claims that the bats may migrate in a similar . way to birds. 'We didn’t find anything so we assume he is still going. We had been tracking him since the autumn and the GPS systems can fail. 'Last time we had him he appeared to be heading back along the coast towards Hastings so I don’t think he was finished.' Dr . Scott said the results confirm foxes will move out to colonise other . areas when populations in urban areas reach their maximum densities. 'We know they travel to find new territory but we didn’t expect to see him go quite so far,' added Dr Scott. 'Especially as Fleet is an urban fox. He was born in Brighton and Hove and raised his young there. 'It’s incredible. The GPS tracker updated us on his location every 30 minutes. We kept thinking he was going to settle down but he kept going. 'The data from the study is really important to help us understand the behaviour of urban foxes and especially how they differ from the rural fox.' Early results last autumn showed the pair venturing a couple of roads in each direction for food, not uncommon behaviour for urban foxes. Initially, dominant Fleet ate first, but over the weeks the foxes’ behaviour shifted. A team from BBC Two's Winterwatch fitted Fleet, pictured, with a night-vision camera.

Professor David Needham and his younger brother Stuart have created DartSight, a finger ring 'sighter' designed to help darts lovers hit 180s and the bullseye more often. Stuart Needham shows off DartSight, a finger ring 'sighter' designed to help darts lovers hit 180s and the bullseye more often . The brothers created a small plastic loop which fits on the finger which helps darts players perfect their throw . And the Oldham man's design is sure to be a hit with darts enthusiasts as they train. The PHD Professor and director of the Centre for Single Particle Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, created the device because of his passion for darts. Prof Needham's business partner Stuart, also of Oldham, who teaches people to drive minibuses, said DartSight will improve players' accuracy. The 55-year-old grandad-of-one said: 'David has used his scientific skills to develop DartSight. DartSight is described as a: 'a serious attempt to help align your throw and develop a reliable and repeatable muscle memory for your action' It works by showing you what you should see with your dominant eye .

'We've sold around 350 and more distributors are wanting to come on board.' It is to be used only for practice and not for actual competing, as darts rules are so strict. DartSight is described as a: 'serious attempt to help align your throw and develop a reliable and repeatable muscle memory for your action.' It works by showing you what you should see with your dominant eye. When you line-up DartSight with your target, e.g., the bullseye, you can then throw your dart at the correct angle. Father-of-one David splits his time between universities in North Carolina and Odense in Denmark. The brothers are now working on a Greater Manchester Business Growth programme to develop future sales, marketing and product development strategies. Prof Needham's brother added: 'At its most fundamental level, success at darts is about accuracy and consistency. 'DartSight is a training aid, not a gimmick and our trials show it works. 'It helps you put your hand in the same place every time so you can get your eye, hand and arm co-ordinated together to keep a level of consistency. 'We are not targeting professionals to begin with. 'It is aimed at the general player, or semi-pro, and the person who wants to develop accuracy.' The product is available to buy at dartsight.com. Played in international tournaments and in pubs around the world, darts is believed to have begun in medieval times, when soldiers would practise throwing missiles for fun and to maintain their shooting skills. The rules begin with the law that a player shall throw darts from a standing position, excepting only in those circumstances when a physical disability, or physical injury requires a player to adopt a non-standing position. A throw must consist of a maximum of ‘three darts’, unless a leg, set, or match is completed in less than ‘three darts’. If a player ‘touches’ any dart, which is in the dartboard, during a throw, then that throw shall be deemed to have been completed. Any dart bouncing off, or falling out of, the dartboard, does not count, and shall not be re-thrown. The ‘Bull’ counts as ‘50’, and if ‘50’ is required to complete a leg, set, or match, then the ‘Bull’ shall count as a 'Double 25’. Players aim to reach target scores of 501, 601, 701, 1001 or similar.

They were very much in love, despite occasional differences, which they always overcame.' The .

Mr Tharoor's personal assistant Abhinav Kumar had previously told reporters there were no signs of foul play. He said: 'She was lying in bed. There were no signs of any foul play or any struggle. She had no sign of poisoning or anything'. Mrs Pushkar Tharoor appeared to detail an affair, but a statement later said the tweets were unauthorised and her marriage was a happy one . However, doctors have said the minister's wife suffered 'certain injuries' and an 'unnatural death'. Sudhir Gupta, head of forensics at the All India Institute of Medical .

'Since the investigating agency is now working on the case there are certain issues relating to the injuries that cannot be revealed now. But there were certain injuries on the body'. However, it is unclear who or what could have inflicted the injuries referred to, or whether they are believed to be the cause of death.

A 12-year-old has been stabbed in the hand and leg outside a Tesco Express store by three children trying to rob him. The boy was attacked outside Tesco Express in Whitehorse Road, Croydon, south London, shortly before 5pm on Monday after the trio went through his pockets. He was taken to hospital but his injuries are not classed as life-threatening or changing. It is the third knife attack involving young people in the area in recent weeks. The Tesco Express in Whitehorse Road, Croydon where the attack took place on a 12-year-old boy by three other children . Scotland Yard said three boys aged between 12 and 15 tried to rob the youngster outside the supermarket, and ran off towards St James’s Road after stabbing him. One of the trio was white, about 5ft 6in, with blond hair and blue eyes, and was wearing a black woolly hat, dark jacket and grey tracksuit bottoms. The other two are both black, one around 5ft 2in and the other about 4ft 11in. Detective Inspector Simon Harding said: 'It appears the suspects have attempted to rob the victim and then, after a brief altercation, the victim has then been stabbed twice. 'The description of one of the suspects is quite distinctive and I have no doubt that someone will know or recognise who this is. I would urge anyone with information to come forward. 'This is the third stabbing involving young people in Croydon over the past couple of weeks and, whilst they are all unrelated, it will understandably cause concern within the community.

A farmer’s wife died after her husband accidentally dropped a half-tonne steel bucket on her, an inquest heard. Arthur and Joy Turnbull were mending a fence when Mr Turnbull pressed the wrong button on an agricultral machine and inadvertently released its bucket. Mother-of-two Mrs Turnbull, 65, was holding a fence post upright when she was crushed underneath the falling bucket and fractured her spine. Crushed: Joy Turnbull died when her husband Arthur accidentally pressed the wrong button on his Manitou telehandler (similar to the one pictured) and released its half-tonne steel bucket, which then landed on his wife . The inquest into her death heard that as rescue crews arrived at the remote farm in Hooton Pagnell, near Doncaster, Mr Turnbull said: 'I’ve killed her, I’ve killed her.' Her husband desperately tried to free his wife before fire crews arrived but it took the combined strength of five men to roll the bucket off her. Mrs Turnbull died a week later in Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital after her brain had been starved of oxygen. The inquest in Doncaster heard the farmer is believed to have pressed the wrong button on a Manitou telehandler machine as it forced the post into the ground. Instead of pressing a button for moving the telescopic boom up and down he accidentally pressed the button next to it causing a quick release of the bucket. Accident: Mrs Turnbull had been helping her husband to mend a fence at their farm in Hooton Pagnell, near Doncaster . The tragedy happened on June 8 last . year after Mr Turnbull moved a new cow into a field only for it to fail . to settle and started charging around, breaking the fence. Mr Turnbull and his wife decided to repair the fence to stop the rest of the herd escaping. He had used the weight of the Manitou bucket to force two post into the ground and his wife was holding a third post upright. 'I had a clear view,' he told the inquest. 'I put the bucket seven or eight feet into the air and saw I needed to adjust it above the post. It happened so quickly. 'I must have pressed the quick-release . button which allowed it to fall to the ground. I can only assume when I . moved the bucket I pressed the wrong button.' Mr . Turnbull said the bucket had never fallen off the machine before, . although other farmers he had spoken to since had also reported . accidentally hitting the quick-release button. Tragedy: Mrs Turnbull died a week later in Sheffield's Northern General Hospital after her brain had been starved of oxygen . Health and Safety inspector Michael Raynor told the inquest it was possible the farmer had inadvertently released the locking pins and lowering the bucket onto the post caused it to detach. No defects were found on the machine and the inquest jury returned a conclusion of accidental death. After the inquest jury reached a verdict of accidental death, Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy said she would write to the Health and Safety Exective to raise her concerns about the machine’s control panel in the cab. The Manitous are commonly used on British farms. In a statement Mrs Turnbull’s’ family said: 'At the heart of what we all miss about Joy is her generosity of spirit. She was a loving wife, mum and gran and cheerfully invested everything she had into her relationships with her family and friends and did so without the need for reward. 'She was regarded as a joyful, optimistic and warm individual who was always delighted to lend a hand, lend a sympathetic ear, or a shoulder to cry on. 'It has been seven months since Joy left us. Those who knew her well still feel it very acutely.'","Joy Turnbull, 63, was mending a fence with husband Arthur at their farm .

A keen musician who said he wanted to kill himself to get revenge on his ex-girlfriend accidentally caused an explosion in his flat then drove to a field and committed suicide, an inquest has heard. Maurice Fletcher repeatedly told friends he was considering suicide after he became depressed over a break-up, and was later found dead in his car. In July last year, he inadvertently knocked over a flammable substance in his flat in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, then left the premises. The accident caused a spark, triggering a huge gas explosion which ripped through his home and three neighbouring flats and left two men with burn injuries. Depressed: Musician Maurice Fletcher killed himself after breaking up with his girlfriend, an inquest heard . Blast: A day before his death, Mr Fletcher had accidentally caused a gas explosion in his flat in Rochdale . Mr Fletcher, 57, was initially feared to be trapped in the wreckage, but was soon found to be unharmed away from the scene. However, he was found dead less than 24 hours later when a farmer checking his horses discovered him in his Ford Ka in a remote field. An autopsy found that he had died from carbon monoxide poisoning as it emerged that he had left a suicide note as well as a message admitting that he was responsible for the explosion. An inquest in Heywood was told that Mr Fletcher, who worked for the Inland Revenue and played cornet in the Stalybridge Brass Band, had been pining for his ex-girlfriend Pauline. Friend: Phil Cornell said that Mr Fletcher had often threatened to commit suicide . Close friend Phil Cornell said the lovesick man had suffered bouts of depression, including one so serious he had to be hospitalised. Mr Fletcher also threatened to commit suicide in order to 'take revenge' on his ex and 'have the last laugh' over her, his friend said. 'A previous boyfriend of Pauline's came back on the scene and she wanted to move on in her life but he didn't want to let go,' Mr Cornell told the hearing. 'He was hanging onto that relationship and it was becoming an obsession which got greater and greater, to the point where in my mind he was stalking her. 'In the last few weeks of that relationship the police were involved and asked him to stay clear. He would talk repeatedly about ending his life once he was on a downward spiral with Pauline. 'He would talk of not having anything to live for, he was not getting up in the morning and not wanting to be in crowded places. 'I came to the conclusion that one day he would, my feeling was that he would do something. I was constantly trying to encourage him to go back to the doctors - but I couldn't persuade him.' Mr Cornell said he last saw Mr Fletcher alive on July 29 - the day before the explosion. 'I met him in the pub and when I saw him I could tell he was upset,' he said. 'I just sat and listened. He was going over the same thing. Night after night he would tell me the history of his relationships. When I left he was very upset.' After he heard about the explosion the next day, he texted Mr Fletcher asking why he had not heard from him, but on July 31 police called him and told him his friend had died. Destruction: The blast destroyed half the house and left two men suffering from burn injuries . Collapse: Less than 24 hours after the accident, Mr Fletcher was found dead in a field by a farmer . Mr Fletcher's GP confirmed that he had ongoing depression and anxiety and had been referred to the mental health services on numerous occasions. In a statement, Mr Fletcher's mother Pauline said her son had been an 'outgoing person' and 'very sociable'. She said he enjoyed music and playing the cornet and going on holidays. She said she last spoke to her son the day before his death and he had appeared 'calm'. He ended the call telling her that he loved her and she had no concerns for his welfare. She added that she never knew him to threaten self-harm. Scene: Police cordoned off an area of housing close to where Mr Fletcher was found dead in July last year . Recording a verdict of suicide, assistant coroner Lisa Hasmi said: 'It was clear that he was suffering and was particularly troubled by the mental health issues but also the nature and extent of relationships - a number of them came to an end, more recently Pauline. 'He was clearly very anxious leading up to his death.' Following the gas explosion at Mr Fletcher's flat, one man suffered burns to his upper arms and shoulder and another was treated for a broken arm, burns to his body and smoke inhalation. Investigators said that the casualties were lucky to be alive after half of the building collapsed as well as its roof.

Legal battle: Terry Marley won a Supreme Court ruling today allowing him share of his adoptive parents' fortune . A man won a legal fight over a £70,000 inheritance today when the Supreme Court ruled that a will containing a 'clerical error' should be rectified. Terry Marley had lost challenges in the High Court and Court of Appeal. But five justices in the Supreme Court ruled in his favour today after a hearing in London. Judges heard that Mr Marley, now in his 50s, was taken in as a teenager by Alfred and Maureen Rawlings, and they treated him 'as their son' even though they were not related. They were told that Mr and Mrs Rawlings - who lived in Biggin Hill, Kent - had made wills in identical terms in 1999. Both agreed that Mr Marley should inherit after they had both died. But each had mistakenly signed the other’s will after an 'oversight' by a solicitor. Mrs Rawlings died in 2003 and the mistake came to light after Mr Rawlings died in 2006. The couple’s natural sons, Terry and Michael Rawlings, challenged the validity of their father’s will. They argued that the will was invalid and that their father had died intestate - therefore they should inherit. A court fight had started and a judge had ruled against Mr Marley - saying Mr Rawlings’ will did not comply with terms of the 1837 Wills Act and could not be rectified. The Court of Appeal had agreed. Victory: Five justices in the Supreme Court, pictured, today ruled a 'clerical error' which prevented Mr Marley from inheriting money from his adoptive parents should be corrected (Stock picture) But the Supreme Court disagreed - after analysing evidence at a hearing in December. One justice, Lord Neuberger - President of the Supreme Court - said the solicitor’s 'muddling' of the wills could legally be classified as a 'clerical error' and the mistake could be rectified. President of the Supreme Court, Lord Neuberger, pictured, said the solicitor's 'muddling' of the wills could legally be classified as a 'clerical error' A legal expert said the Supreme Court had taken a 'common-sense' approach and made an important decision. 'The Supreme Court has taken a common sense approach to interpreting wills in the same way commercial contracts have been treated for over 40 years,' said Matthew Duncan, head of private client practice at law firm Kingsley Napley. 'The law has traditionally been generous in finding ways to fix errors in contracts. The Supreme Court saw no reason why the same principles should not apply to wills.

TripAdvisor reviewers have been known for their searing put-downs about everything from dirty sheets to smelly showers. So the world's bed and breakfast owners could be forgiven for being a little envious of Bindon Bottom. The Dorset B&B has been named the best in the world by the site's users - after it gained 456 'excellent' reviews, just three 'very good' and not a single negative one. King of the king-size bed: Dorset's Bindon Bottom has been named the best bed and breakfast in the world by reviewers on the website TripAdvisor, with 456 'excellent' reviews and just three 'very good' Patriotic: Second placed was the All Seasons Guest House in Filey, North Yorkshire, which despite being in a terraced house got better reviews than a resort with a swimming pool in the Moroccan capital Marrakech . Grandeur: The 200-year-old Historic Oak Hill Inn in Natchez, Mississippi, was the best B&B not in Britain . Majestic: With its design it is unsurprising the Saxon Villa in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, came fourth . On the sweeping North Yorkshire coast, Saxon Villa gained 234 excellent reviews and just five 'very good' Fifth placed was the Baan Malinee Bed and Breakfast in Thailand - though it may cost a little more to get to . The Â£100-a-night home has been flooded with ecstatic reviewers on the website who say it is 'cosy and relaxing' and praising its 'hooting owls, sweeping hills and surging ocean'. The tiny number of reviews which missed the top slot came from one couple who missed breakfast by accident and another who wanted their room from 2.30pm instead of 4pm. Opened in the tranquil seaside village of West Lulworth three years ago by former IT worker Clive Orchard and his wife Lisa, the Victorian home is rumoured to have been designed by Thomas Hardy. The author of Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure based his novels in the fictional county of Wessex, which was based heavily on Dorset and its Jurassic Coast. One of his poems was set at Lulworth Cove, a stone's throw from the B&B. Understated: Linnet Hill in the Lake District town of Keswick came sixth, beating a coastal home in South Africa . Riad Alnadine, Marrakech, was seventh looking like a Moroccan palace - but reviewers preferred Britain . Stone: The Scottish architecture of Dumfries House Lodge, Cumnock, helped get it into eighth place . The couple, who have no background in the hotel trade, told the Independent their customers came from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand. Mrs Orchard added: 'The reviews rave about Clive's breakfast. He goes to a great deal of trouble to get the best local produce.' This year's top 10 in the website's Travellers' Choice awards was dominated by British B&Bs, with three of them alone in North Yorkshire. The sweeping beauty of the Lake District and forests of Scotland also feature in a list which includes venues from Morocco to Mississippi. For some, the world of British B&Bs once had a reputation for nosy landladies and limp breakfasts. But there has been a surge in popularity for stay-at-home tourism amid the recession, with families looking to cut back on their budgets. So while the hotel industry was once immortalised in comedies like Fawlty Towers, TV shows such as Four in a Bed now pitch B&B owners against each other to provide the best service. In all, TripAdvisor users put 15 of the top 25 B&Bs in the world in Britain. That is despite the others including a villa overlooking the crystal-clear waters of the Mediterranean in Greece and a Grand Designs-style glass-fronted home in Cape Town, South Africa. British venues also beat an Indian paradise in Jaipur - and a home in Thailand with its own outdoor swimming pool. Floral: In ninth place was the Millgate B&B in Masham, North Yorkshire, amid a surge in stay-at-home tourism . From the windswept west coast of Britain to the sun-baked west coast the United States, rounding off the top 10 was the Arbor Guest House in Napa, California.

Former U.S. government contractor and intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has denied  accusations that he worked in collaboration with the Russian government to leak documents about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, calling the theories 'absurd'. His denial came after the House Intelligence Committee chair, Rep. Mike Rogers, who is in charge of an ongoing investigations into Snowden's relationship with Russia, said: 'I believe there's a reason he . ended up in their hands, the ""loving arms"" of an FSB (Russian security) agent in Moscow. I don't think that's a coincidence.' In response to the allegations, Snowden . said: 'I clearly and unambiguously acted alone, with no assistance from . anyone, much less a government. 'It won't stick, because it's clearly . false, and the American people are smarter than politicians think they . are. This Russian spy push is absurd.' Snowden has denied the accusations of the House Intelligence Committee that he worked with the Russian security services to leak documents about U.S national security . In addition, a top member of the the House's Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Rachel McCaul, said: 'I personally believe that he was cultivated by a foreign power to do what he did. 'I can't give a definitive statement on that, but I've been given all the evidence I know Mike Rogers has access to. I don't think he was working alone.' Speaking in an interview with the New Yorker, Snowden pointed to the forty days he spent trapped in Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow after he fled the U.S., as evidence that he had worked alone. He said: 'Spies get treated better than that.' This is not the first allegation against Snowden claiming he is a spy. Last July he was accused of working for the Chinese, and has come out against the media for reporting the allegations both last year, and today. He said: 'If I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly to Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a Phoenix by now. The media has a major role to play in American society, and they're really abdicating their responsibility to hold power to account.' US President Barack Obama speaks about the National Security Agency (NSA) and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques in the US, reacting to leaks by former N.S.A contractor Edward Snowden . In the speech Obama said more could be done to protect the civil liberties of his citizens, and also pledged to end spying on friendly heads of state . The allegations have come only days after President Barack Obama spoke last Friday about the trimming the power of U.S. intelligence services, reacting to the leaks by Snowden. Speaking at the U.S. Department of Justice on January 17, he called for new privacy safeguards and said he had stopped the NSA spy taps on friendly world leaders. The president said he would be ending the NSA's hoarding of telephone ""metadata"", informaion that shows the detail and destination of calls, but not their content, agreeing with critics who said that the program could open the door to more intrusion. However, Obama has decided that he . will allow bulk phone data sweeps of the citizens living in the U.S. to . continue as an anti-terror tool. He said: 'I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk meta-data. Since Obama's long awaited speech, Snowden has had fears for his life according to his Russian lawyer. In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase security . Explicit threats to kill him were made anonymously by Pentagon and National Security Agency officials, alleged Anatoly Kucherena. In an interview with Russian news channel Vesti, he said: 'There are real threats to his life out there that actually do exist. ‘These statements call for physical retribution against Edward Snowden.’ Kucherana was referring to an article last week on BuzzFeed entitled ‘American Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead’. It quoted a Pentagon official as saying: ‘I would love to put a bullet in his head.’ Another source described as a current NSA analyst said: ‘In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American, I personally would go and kill him myself.’ Snowden in October 11, 2013 during a WikiLeaks press conference. WikiLeaks has been instrumental in aiding Snowden's leaks of information about confidential U.S spying programs . Snowden has been carefully guarded in Moscow since he received temporary asylum in August a move which outraged the U.S. and led to President Barack Obama snubbing a summit invitation from his opposite number Vladimir Putin, a former spy. The Russian Lawyer said: 'Edward is treating these as real threats.' ‘Today, it might not be enough to have private guards. We must also think about how to safeguard his life and wellbeing.’ ‘We think that the U.S. government must take note of such statements. ‘The people who make extremist statements do so while wearing a mask -- they do not reveal their identities.' ‘But we have specific publications that printed these interviews. We will ask for these people's masks to come off. We must know who this NSA officer is, who issues orders about ways to eliminate Edward Snowden.'

"PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:49 EST, 22 January 2014 . Chelsea's funds from the projected sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United are being earmarked for a striker. United have Edinson Cavani and Diego Costa in their sights but have been made aware that Chelsea are keen on Costa in particular while Radamel Falcao at Monaco is also still on the Stamford Bridge club's list. Jose Mourinho has watched Costa personally in recent months and his interest could be aided by the fact that he shares the same agent, with the prolific 25-year-old striker signed up to Jorge Mendes. A sale in January does look difficult though. Target man: Chelsea are keen on Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa and are set to move for him this summer . Young pretender: Sassuolo's Domenico Beradi, scorer of four goals against AC Milan, is a target for Chelsea and Manchester United . Read our 'In the Spotlight' feature on Domenico Berardi here . Another player United and Chelsea have had scouted recently is Juventus striker Domenico Berardi. The 19-year-old is on loan from Juventus at Sassuolo and grabbed headlines when he scored all four goals in the 4-3 win over AC Milan. It made him the first teenager since Silvio Piola in 1931 to score a hat-trick in Italy and the first player to score four goals against Milan in a single match. Chelsea's interest in Wayne Rooney is unlikely to bear fruit and rumblings at United are that the England forward is even leaning towards a change of heart about his future at Old Trafford - although there is still work to be done. The purchase of Mata would help lift most at the club, not least goalkeeper David de Gea, with talk in Spain that their big clubs are considering a summer approach for United's No 1. Presence: Atletico Madrid would like to make Thibault Courtois' loan deal from Chelsea permanent . Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, has said he is desperate to sign on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Asked if he would pay £23m for Courtois, Simeone replied: 'Definitely. For me, any price for Courtois would be cheap. He is a young guy who has a huge future ahead of him and is on course to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.' AC Milan are showing an interest in Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. The 27-year-old Dane with the famous father is continuing to impress and Leicester are wary of a big offer from Italy after scouts watched recent games. Manager Nigel Pearson has earmarked Wayne Hennessey as a potential replacement should Clarence Seedorf follow up with a bid. Milan had been keen on Newcastle's Tim Krul but he would cost around £15million. Leicester's Championship form has also attrcated offers from Fulham for defender Liam Moore and team-mate Jeffrey Schlupp. Remind you of anyone? Kasper Schmeichel (right), a target for Italian giants AC Milan pulls off a save much in the same style as dad Peter in his heyday (below) West Ham have shown an interest in AC Milan midfielder Antonio Nocerino in a move that could accelerate Michael Essien's departure to Italy from Chelsea. Manager Sam Allardyce is looking for a new midfielder with either Ravel Morrison or Mohamed Diame expected to join Fulham before the end of the month. Nocerino is available on loan even though he is an Italy international and played against England in Euro 2012. The 28-year-old has also been offered to West Bromwich Albion. Essien is hoping to be in Milan by the weekend with Clarence Seedorf assessing his new but ailing squad. The Ghana midfielder would be viewed as a ready-made replacement for Nocerino but, in terms of sharpness, West Ham would be getting the better deal. Hamming it up: AC Milan midfielder Antonio Nocerino (No 23) is wanted by West Ham . The Hammers are also among clubs to have been offered Marco Borriello from Roma. Former Manchester City midfielder Nigel de Jong is among those considered to be unhappy at the San Siro and that has prompted talk at Liverpool of a loan move with Brendan Rodgers mindful that Lucas Leiva will miss two months with his knee injury. Anfield head of recruitment Dave Fallows knows De Jong well from his time at City but the Reds are considering sticking with the midfield players they have instead. Liverpool are continuing negotiations with FC Basle over Mohamed Salah but face fierce competition with rival suitors making bigger offers. Atletico Madrid, Zenit St Petersburg and Bayer Leverkusen remain in the hunt but the player would prefer Merseyside if a price can be agreed. Resurrection: Valencia midfielder Sergio Canales could move to Everton to revive his career . Sergio Canales, the one time golden . boy of Spanish football, is looking for a loan move to England with . Everton among those clubs interested. The . 22-year-old Valencia midfielder was hot property as a teenager at . Racing Santander when he was courted by European giants such as Manchester United, Chelsea, . Arsenal and Real Madrid. He took the decision to stay in Spain and . joined Madrid to a huge fanfare. He was loaned out to Valencia in 2011 but his . career stalled after two cruciate injuries. He did, however, make a permanent move to the Mestalla. Now . he is fit and looking to get his career back on track. Real Sociedad . are keen to keep him in La Liga but he is interested in the Premier League. Everton . will be wary on taking risks though. They are awaiting further tests on . Lacina Traore's hamstring injury before ratifying his loan move from . Monaco. Everton's prime objective is to make sure they have cover for . Romelu Lukaku when they face Chelsea on February 22 as the Belgian - who is the Toffees' main centre forward - is . not allowed to face his parent club. The saga over Leeds United's takeover continues to twist and turn with Brian McDermott struggling to bring in new players and get his promotion push back on track. The interest of Cagliari president Massimo Cellino has prompted questions of whether the club will follow Watford's pattern and trigger a flow of Italian players to Elland Road should he put a successful bid in place. Sport Capital's proposed deal has stalled with the consortium and Gulf Finance House wrangling yesterday over completion of that takeover. It has affected player purchases as it has emerged that officials at the Bahraini bank blocked an attempt by Leeds to sign striker Ashley Barnes. He opted to join Burnley from Brighton despite Sport Capital’s members, among them Enterprise Insurance managing director Andrew Flowers, making funds available for a £500,000 transfer fee. Struggle: Brian McDermott is finding it difficult to bring players in and get Leeds' promotion push back on track . Leeds are considering a move for Swansea striker Leroy Lita but are on a five-game losing streak, which has seen them drop to 12th in the Championship. They played a behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley on Tuesday and won 3-0 with El-Hadji Diouf, who is free to leave, Matt Smith, and Luke Murphy scoring. Cagliari owner Cellino has not denied his interest in Leeds, however, he says he also used a visit to London to ask about Julio Cesar at QPR. The Brazil goalkeeper is also wanted by Sampdoria but his wages are a problem. Queens Park Rangers will be looking to kickstart talks over the transfer of Inter Milan's Ishak Belfodil later on Wednesday. Co-owners Parma have finally given the go-ahead for the transfer and the Algeria striker is ready to join on loan with the prospect of a permanent deal in the summer a possibility should all go well and QPR earn promotion. Heading for the Championship? Inter striker Ishak Belfodil (right), co-owned by Parma, could move to QPR . The 22-year-old, who is 6ft 3in tall, is keen to play more regularly to cement his place in Algeria's World Cup squad and go to the tournament sharp and in form. Parma's deliberations had threatened the deal with QPR looking elsewhere. Celtic manager Neil Lennon was among the crowd watching Charlton's FA Cup tie at Oxford United on Tuesday. The Celtic boss is in the market for a striker and a defender with Charlton's Michael Morrison one he has been linked to in the past. Yann Kermorgant scored two goals for Charlton in the 3-0 win.

Rhys Williams is covered from head to toe in agonising blisters, leaving him in too much pain to even be hugged by his parents. The brave eight-year-old, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, suffers from a severe skin condition called epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Rhys Williams, eight, has a genetic skin condition called epidermolysis bullosa. It causes his skin to blister and tear at the slightest touch and leaves his whole body covered in agonising open wounds . It is an excruciatingly painful condition which causes blistering and leads to open wounds. His condition is incurable and causes his skin and internal tissue to blister at the slightest knock or rub, leaving him with painful open wounds. The agony is so severe the youngster even had to take morphine to control the pain and it takes him three hours to have a bath. His mother, and full-time carer, Tanya Moores, 30, said: ‘I feel like the worst mum in the world when it comes to bath time - it’s utterly traumatising to see him screaming and writhing in pain. ‘And to know I can’t cuddle him better in case the friction tears his skin off is heart-breaking. ‘He had to take morphine at one stage to cope with pain but he’s such a little fighter that he refuses to take any painkillers these days. Occasionally he will have a standard paracetamol.’ Rhys' mother and carer, Tanya, is unable to hug him as this can make his skin break and cause him further pain . At times, Rhys' pain has been so bad he has had to take morphine and it takes him three hours to have a bath. He has a tube going into his stomach as he has to be tube-fed . As he gets older, Rhys is becoming increasingly fearful of going out as he worries that people will stare at him . Rhys has suffered with the condition since birth and has to be wrapped in bandages constantly. He is unable to play outside with friends, go on holidays, attend birthday parties and even go shopping in public with his mother, father Mark, 45, and sister Teegan, 18-months. He also has to be fed through a tube as eating solid food can cause his gullet to blister. Ms Moores said: ‘It’s getting to the stage where he’s too embarrassed to go out with me as grown adults just stare open-mouthed at him. ‘In the past he’s said, ‘Mummy please cover me, that woman’s staring’, and I lost my cool.

Rhys was recently also treated to a memorable day by kind-hearted fire fighters at Bolton Central Fire Station. Rhys was given his own fire safety gear after being made an honorary fire fighter for the day as he barked out orders to his colleagues and let loose with the hose. Station Manager Steve Parkinson said: ‘We wanted to give him a day to remember at the fire station and I know it was a complete surprise to him. ‘He had no idea and arrived with his mum in a blindfold, and when he took it off he was in front of the fire engine with White Watch lined up on parade and his little face lit up. ‘We made him an honorary fire fighter for the day and put him in charge.’ The family currently have to travel 200 miles to Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups, as well as receiving support from specialist EB charity DEBRA. Rhys recently heard about two other children who died of EB. As a result, he has drawn up a bucket list of things he wants to do during his life.

In people with EB, even the gentlest touch can cause painful blisters. There are three main types of EB - Rhys has dystrophic EB. This accounts for about 25 per cent of cases. Symptoms include blisters inside the mouth, thickened skin and nails, fingers and toes becoming joined together, blistering in the oesophagus, chewing and swallowing problems, vision problems and skin cancer. Symptoms are usually present from birth. EB occurs because of faulty genes inherited from one or both parents and affects about one in every 17,000 children in the UK. There is currently no cure - treatment aims to relieve symptoms. The outlook depends a lot on the severity and type of EB a child has. Dystrophic EB poses a risk to life if it results in the development of skin cancer.

'I ask you to ensure that humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it,' Pope Francis said in the message read at the opening ceremony by Cardinal Peter Turkson, president of the Pontifical Council for Peace and Justice. The Argentinian pope, who has identified strongly with the poor since his election last year and severely criticised capitalism, acknowledged that business had helped lift millions out of poverty, even if it had led to widespread social exclusion. 'The growth of equality demands something more than economic growth, even though it presupposes it. 'It demands first of all 'a transcendent vision of the person',' he said in the message. 'It also calls for decisions, mechanisms and processes directed to a better distribution of wealth, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality.' Rising income disparity and attendant social unrest were flagged as the biggest threat to the world in the WEF's annual 'Global Risks 2014' report last week. Inequality has been widening since the 1980s but the issue has risen up the agenda since the financial crisis that erupted in 2008.

A new generation of young pe, who lack jobs and hope of social improvement, is fuelling pent-up frustration, with a wave of protests from Thailand to Brazil. The richest 85 people in the world now have as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population, or some 3.5 billion people, according to a report from the charity Oxfam this week. Oxfam said there a need for some economic inequality to reward those with talent, skills and ambition but the current extreme situation was 'damaging and worrying'.","Message read to 2,500 participants at the annual World Economic Forum .

Horrifying: CCTV footage captures the shocking moment an attackers throws a hand grenade at a tent filled with protesters . A total of 28 people were injured in the grenade blast near Victory Mount in central Bangkok on Sunday . Escape: The man is then filmed fleeing the scene down an alleyway after the blast . The man, dressed in white trousers, a beige top and baseball cap with a bag draped over his shoulder, then flees in the opposite direction. He is then alleged to have fired shots at demonstrators who chased him, according to the Sunday morning herald. It comes as violent incidents across Bangkok reached crisis point - prompting the government to introduce a state of emergency which will continue for 60 days. The decree greatly expands the power of security forces to issue orders and search, arrest and detain people, with limited judicial and parliamentary oversight. The areas covered had already been placed under tougher-than-normal security under the country's Internal Security Act. Violence in the country has been escalating in recent months. Nine people have been killed and hundreds hurt in violence since the protests began in early November. But protesters escalated their tactics this month with a threat to 'shut down' the capital to prevent the government from functioning. Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra speaks to reporters following the declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok . Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said state of emergency order will remain in place for the next 60 days . Another grenade attack on a protest march last Friday killed one man and wounded dozens. No arrests have been made in either attack. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said the government, through a newly established Center for Maintaining Peace and Order, 'will take care of the situation according to international practices, which is something we have always said. Primarily, we have to use the principle of negotiation first'. Meanwhile protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban vowed to continue demonstrating and questioned whether the declaration was justified, saying the protesters had been peaceful. 'Whatever they warn us not to do, we will do,' he declared. 'We will march on the routes they ban ... If they order us not to rally, we will be here indefinitely. If they ask us not to use loudspeakers at night, we will just keep going 24 hours a day at every stage!' The protesters have been demanding Yingluck's resignation to make way for an appointed government to implement reforms to fight corruption. Yingluck called elections for February 2 but the protesters are insisting they not be held. The opposition Democrat Party, closely aligned with the protesters, is boycotting the polls. The announcement of the emergency decree said the elections would proceed as planned. Thai anti-government protesters hold signs calling for the Thai Prime Minister to step down during a rally at the victory monument intersection in Bangkok .

Supporters of the anti-government donate money to the ongoing protest groups in Bangkok . The protesters allege that Yingluck's government is carrying on the practices of Thaksin Shinawatra, her billionaire brother who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, by using the family fortune and state funds to influence voters and cement its power. Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006 after protests accused him of corruption and abuse of power. He fled into exile in 2008 to avoid a two-year prison sentence for a conflict of interest conviction. Deputy Prime Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul said 'the protesters have constantly violated the law, especially in closing down government offices and banks and harassment against civil servants to prevent them from working'. He added that Suthep's group 'had gone overboard, and attacks were carried out by ill-intentioned people, causing people to be injured and killed, affecting the country's stability'. Human Rights Watch criticized the emergency decree for allowing excessive use of power and possible human rights violations. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for the New York-based group, said the security situation had not become so bad that police could not perform their duties, and the decree could be seen as having been implemented for political rather than public safety reasons.

As many as 200,000 people have joined the biggest of the opposition protests in the past two months. The demonstrators are mainly middle class, and are generally backed by big business and the financial elite. They include a large contingent of people from southern Thailand, a stronghold of the Democrat Party. Thaksin and his political allies have easily won every national election since 2001, with Yingluck's Pheu Thai party winning a majority of lower house seats in 2011. Thaksin draws support from the lower and lower middle classes, mostly rural people who benefited from his populist policies. The last time the emergency decree was invoked in Bangkok was when pro-Thaksin 'Red Shirt' activists staged their own disruptive protests in the capital in 2010 against a Democrat-led government. Suthep was then deputy prime minister and headed the agency overseeing its application. At least 90 people, mostly protesters, died in violence which peaked when soldiers in combat gear swept demonstrators from the streets. Suthep has been charged with murder for his role in the crackdown. Peaceful protests: Thai anti-government protesters perform some early morning yoga during a rally at Victory Monument intersection . Vocal: A Thai anti-government protester chants slogans during a rally at Victory Monument intersection in Bangkok . There are fears the current protesters are trying to incite violence to prompt the military to intervene. The powerful army commander, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, has repeatedly said he does not want his forces drawn into the conflict, but has also refused to rule out the possibility of another coup. 'The military will support the government's working by providing our force as it is needed,' deputy army spokesman Col. Winthai Suvaree said on Tuesday night. The trigger for the latest protests was an ill-advised attempt late last year by ruling party lawmakers to push through a bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return from overseas exile. Since then, demonstrators have steadily escalated their pressure, attacking Yingluck's office at government house and the city's police headquarters for several days in December with slingshots and homemade rocket launchers, and periodically occupying the compounds of several government agencies. Even if the polls are held, Parliament may fail to achieve a quorum and be unable to convene because the protesters have blocked candidates' registrations in several provinces. It is also possible that the courts, which have consistently shown an anti-Thaksin bias, could stage a 'judicial coup' that would force Yingluck from office for alleged corruption or violations of the constitution.

Immigration Minister has come out fighting against claims that the navy was . responsible for burning the hands of asylum seekers who said they were forced . to hold on to parts of a hot boat engine. Minister Scott Morrison said he . would not tolerate the Australian navy being subjected to 'sledging' after . claims by Indonesian police that asylum seekers sent away from Australian . shores suffered burns. According to the Australian . Broadcasting Corporation, quoting Indonesian police sources, 10 asylum seekers . had to receive treatment after being escorted away from Australian waters - . seven of whom had 'severe burns' on their hands. An Australian frigate stands by as defence personell board an asylum seeker boat off of the coast of Christmas Island. Australia has had a recent bout of anti-asylum seeker policy . Asylum seekers react as they are evacuated, many of those seeking asylum in Australia are from middle-eastern countries like Iraq . The ABC said it had obtained vision . of the asylum seekers being medically assessed for burns from the hot engine . after they were returned to Indonesia. The burns claims, supported by . pictures of the hands of at least one asylum seeker, follows allegations by the . refugees two weeks ago that they were badly treated by the Australian navy. Now, according to the ABC, boat . passenger Merke Abdullah Ahmed, from Somalia, claimed that Australian navy . personnel punched some passengers and others were forced to hold onto the hot . metal. 'They physically harmed us,' the . broadcaster reported him as saying. 'Some of the passengers on board, they . tried to complain and speak about just their problems. 'They (navy personnel) just . punched...and you, know, fall down on the ground' Barges carry some of the mainly Iraqi boat people to shore on their arrival on Christmas Island October 10, 2001 after they were rescued from their sinking boat by Australian navy frigate HMAS Adelaide October . With relations between Australian . and Indonesia already strained after it was revealed that Australian naval . vessels had entered Indonesian waters on more than one occasion, Mr Morrison . said today that the injury claims were unsubstantiated. 'The Australian Government is not . going to put up with people sledging the Australian navy with unsubstantiated . claims,' he said. He added that people smugglers and . their clients 'have strong motivations for seeking to discredit the activities . of Australia's border protection operations in an attempt to undermine public . support for the Government's strong border policies. 'There has been no police . investigation in Indonesia. There has been nothing of that sort.' Australian Navy boats are being used accused of entering Indonesian waters in the transfer of asylum seekers . Acting Liberal Prime Minister Warren . Truss said later today that he was confident Defence Force personnel had acted . responsibly. 'I regret the fact that some asylum . seekers seem to have been injured, but who knows under what circumstances that . injury happened,' he told the ABC. The Indonesian government has not . yet announced whether it has accepted Australia's apology for its naval vessels . entering Indonesian waters without permisison, but it has sent four of its own . ships to patrol its sea borders to the south. A former Indonesian general who is . now a member of Indonesia's foreign affairs commission has rejected claims by . Australia that its ships had not intended entering Indonesian waters.

They quibble, joke and share knowing looks, finishing each other's thoughts and making snide comments - like many sisters. But a recent heated argument was unlike any other they've had, and it ended in a most surprising way. For months, 71-year-old Irma Myers-Santana and her younger sister, Anna Williamson, 69, had been debating who more urgently needed a lung transplant, each wanting the other to go first. Earlier this month, though, the sisters ended up in the same operating room, each getting one lung from the same donor in what doctors at Houston Methodist Hospital say is a first for their facility. 'It's never happened. ... We've transplanted siblings before, but years apart,' said Dr. Scott Scheinin, who did Myers-Santana's transplant. 'It's a little bit of serendipity.' Sisterly love: Irma Myers-Santana, left, and her sister Anna Williamson visit in Williamson's hospital room in Houston. Earlier this month the sisters ended up in the same operating room, each getting one lung from the same donor . Keeping it in the family: Anna Williamson, right, looks on as her daughter Kim Pappas, center, checks her Aunt Irma Myers-Santana's makeup before a video interview Tuesday in Houston . The sisters both became ill about 10 years ago with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a little-understood scarring of the lungs that often requires a transplant and kills more people than breast cancer every year, said Scheinin. Doctors, assisted by a computer program, look at blood type, height and severity of illness to match a donor and a transplant patient. The likelihood that Myers-Santana and Williamson would meet all three criteria at the same time was small, Scheinin said. The sisters' situation was further complicated because they insisted on a 'bloodless transplant.' They are Jehovah's Witnesses and do not believe in receiving blood transfusions. They live in California, but Houston Memorial is the only hospital in the country that does such transplants. 'The irony of this whole thing is that we're sisters, we're both Jehovah's Witnesses, we have the same blood type and we got (the lungs) from the same donor,' Williamson said, her eyes tearing up as she sat next to her sister, able for the first time in years to complete a sentence without coughing.

On the mend: The sisters both became ill about 10 years ago with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a little-understood scarring of the lungs that often requires a transplant . 'It's a miracle to have all those things lined up like that,' Williamson said. Until the transplant, Williamson coughed all day and had to be attached to an oxygen tank constantly. About a year ago, her doctor told her she needed a transplant. 'I couldn't talk; I couldn't laugh,' Williamson recalled. So, Williamson and her husband headed down to Houston 10 months ago. Within six months, Myers-Santana, who had a sudden, violent decline in her health and could barely breathe, joined Williamson, hoping she, too, would be a viable candidate for that type of transplant. Then the waiting began, with the sisters housed just 10 doors apart in a Houston RV park. On a few occasions, each woman was offered a lung, but they bickered over who should take it. Thankful: Anna Williamson, left, clowns around with her surgeon Dr. Matthias Loebe, second from left, as her sister Irma Myers-Santana, right, visits with her surgeon Dr. Scott Scheinin, second from right, in a hospital room in Houston . 'If we hadn't had the transplant when we did, she would be dead right now, dead,' Williamson said adamantly, her sister sitting beside her in the hospital room. Myers-Santana agrees with that, yet believed Williamson needed to have the first transplant. 'Her coughing just hurt to my core. You can't help someone that coughs like that,' Myers-Santana said. 'It's so hard to watch, and so I felt she needed it more than I did. 'I can live with a cough, but she can't live without oxygen, so I win,' Myers-Santana shot back, smiling at her sister. In the end, though, the individual lungs weren't a match. Now, less than two weeks after the surgery, Williamson has the right lung and Myers-Santana has the left. They have on makeup, their hair is done, and they joke with their doctors - extending an invitation to Santa Barbara for free manicures and pedicures at Williamson's salon. Their husbands and children linger in the background. Colorful balloons wishing them well float above. They can talk, joke and laugh without an oxygen tank. And they can breathe easy.","Irma Myers-Santana, 71, and Anna Williamson, 69, each received one lung from the same donor .

Trouble: Bess could face disciplinary action from the NFL and the Cleveland Browns for posting the photo to a social media website . Accompanying the photo, the 28-year-old Bess wrote the caption 'we da real dons!' Marijuana is on the NFL's list of banned substances, so Bess could potentially face consequences with his employer. In December, Bess again made headlines for sharing a photo on Instagram that appears to show him smoking marijuana. The date of that photo is unknown, but Bess promptly erased his entire Instagram account. 'Dons': In addition to the photo, Bess included the caption 'We da real dons!"" The Twitter photo Bess posted Thursday also has been erased from Bess' account. Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that he was open to the idea of removing marijuana from league's list of banned substances for players living in states where the drug is illegal. Additionally, 7-time Pro Bowler Lomas Brown last week said that he suspects roughly 50 percent of all active NFL players currently use marijuana even though it's on the league's list of banned substances. The vast majority, however, aren't dopey enough to post pictures of the drug on their social media accounts.

As a result, Brazil, who receives a jobseeker's allowance of £130 a fortnight and lives in a modern, taxpayer-funded flat, is unconcerned about the consequences. 'After me bills, I've got £50 a day [as a result of shoplifting],' he explains.'That's what I like to live on. 'You feel cheeky, and yeah, you get a bit of a buzz [from stealing], especially when you're doing it over and over again and you keep getting away with it.' Professional: Brazil (right) steals to order and says he likes to have £50 a day to live on after he's paid his bills . Notorious: Jade Underwood, 23, is banned from more than 80 shops in Stockport thanks to her stealing . Ban: Jade's CRASBO means she must travel to  towns outside of Stockport to steal . Like Brazil, Jade Underwood, 23, from Stockport, steals almost every day and also like Brazil, much of it is taken to order. Despite a CRASBO [Crime and Antisocial Behaviour Order] that has put more than 80 shops in Stockport off limits, Underwood continues to steal and travels to nearby towns where her face isn't known to shop owners. 'I'm not really arsed what people think . about me,' she says. 'I get most people going, ""oh look at her, little tramp's on a . CRASBO"". So what mate? 'There's . one [CRASBO notice] in McKay, one in Next and one in the back of Boots, or something,' she adds. 'I . didn't think it would go this bad. They're everywhere around Stockport. They've proper hotted me out. It's horrendous!' Business owners might loathe her, but for Underwood's cousin Sasha, her light-fingered relation is a godsend. 'I ain't paying £15 for a bottle of . make-up when I can get her to rob it for me,' says Sasha. 'She'll just pinch it from . Boots or something... 'You know her, f***ing thieving little cow! If . she's got something decent, I'll buy it off her like anyone else would. Give her three quid and a couple of fags and she's laughing, isn't she?' And Sasha isn't alone. 'Everyone likes a bargain, don't they?,' claims Brazil. 'We . just sell things for a third of the price. 'You go down the pub and . straight away, say there's 25-30 people in the pub, and basically, you . just lay whatever you've got out on a table and bam, it's gone in . seconds. 'People might see that . as wrong but the people who are buying it don't. They're happy. You're . doing a good deed, helping people out who are struggling. Prison: Jade is currently serving a 12 week sentence while Brazil has to wear an ankle tag for six months . 'If I didn't . have my tag on, I'd just carry on shoplifting and shoplifting and . shoplifting every other day.' According to Brazil's friend Pete, rising prices are to blame. 'Everybody wants to buy stuff that he . nicks, which is electrical products because they're that dear,' he reveals. '[People] . don't want to go out and spend £200 on an electric toothbrush, do they?' Despite the stealing habit that has seen him end up in court a shocking 30 times, Brazil says he does have some limits. 'I don't like burglars, people who go . robbing people's houses and stuff like that,' he rants.  'I think those people are . scumbags.' He pauses, before adding: 'People are probably calling me a scumbag right now but then, . you're entitled to your opinion. 'I got a grant from the government when I . got my flat, which is nice and generous of them, and I love what I've . got and I try to take care of it,' he continues.

The dream of a pint-sized pub big enough to fit in his back garden became reality for a homeowner when he converted his summerhouse into an opulent alehouse. Geoff Clark, 58, designed and built The Plum Tree Arms, in East Yorkshire from scratch with the help of his youngest son, Paul. As well becoming a focal point for the family’s social life and the envy of many landlords the petite pub is now vying for the honour of being named national shed of the year. Labour of love: Geoff Clark, 58 converted a summer house in his back garden into an opulent alehouse . Private publican: Entry to The Plum Tree Arms is strictly by invitation only, and the Clarks are keen to retain the privacy of their private pub, which is hidden from view at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac . A keen pub regular, retired electrical inspector Mr Clark is delighted that his labour of love has been recognised. Although entry to The Plum Tree Arms is strictly by invitation only, word has got out about his creation, with property expert Sarah Beeny and her husband Graham enjoying a couple of hours in its plush interior. And, according to Mr Clark, 58, the celebrity pair used it as the inspiration for a similar venture at Rise Hall, the Grade II-star listed building they recently restored near Skirlaugh, East Yorks. Social hub: Geoff Clark with his wife Rita - as well becoming a focal point for the family's social life and the envy of many landlords the petite pub is now vying for the honour of being named national shed of the year . Decoration: Mr Clark searched far and wide for the fittings and furniture, collecting pieces from friends and contacts in the trade and buying some pieces through online sales and auctions . Mr Clark, who believes he has created the 'traditional English pub', said: 'We wanted a summerhouse for my grand-daughter Ashleigh and Rita (wife) said ‘put a little bar in and we’ll have the Christening here’ and then it just snowballed.' He searched far and wide for the fittings and furniture, collecting pieces from friends and contacts in the trade and buying some pieces through online sales and auctions, although he says he does not want to think how much the whole project has cost. 'Everywhere I go I ask for little bits. And a lot of stuff I had in my loft. Petite pub: 'The 1910 cash register I bought on eBay and the Chesterfield chairs were off the internet. The mirror is from a pub in Rawcliffe and the bell is from the Bell Hotel in Driffield,' said Mr Clark . 'The 1910 cash register I bought on eBay and the Chesterfield chairs were off the internet. The mirror is from a pub in Rawcliffe and the bell is from the Bell Hotel in Driffield,' said Mr Clark. After the inaugural Christening, the bar has become the venue of choice for a select circle of friends and neighbours and is used for New Year’s Eve parties, fundraising events and for gatherings of Mr Clark’s former workmates. However, the Clarks are keen to retain the privacy of their private pub, which is hidden from view at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac. 'I don’t want any Tom, Dick or Harry wandering in because it’s private and not open to the public. I said don’t tell people exactly where we are because I don’t want somebody coming down the field,' said Mrs Clark. There are, nonetheless, a number of house rules. No one has yet been barred - although Mrs Clark has said some have come close 'a couple of times' - and it is a no-smoking establishment. And it is surprisingly well-stocked for its petite size, traditional cask ales are served - Mr Clark is a member of the Campaign for Real Ale - alongside a bevy of spirits, lager, cider, and at least 15 single malts. 'I think the keeping of inns is in my blood,' said Mr Clark.","Geoff Clark, 58, designed and built The Plum Tree Arms, in East Yorkshire from scratch with the help of his youngest son, Paul .

But these models are earning up to £20,000 a week posing for e-commerce sites - and the right girl can boost sales by as much as 800 per cent. The likes of Gemma Sanderson, Portia Okotcha, Jamie Gunns and Kirstie Bennett are yet to achieve the first-name-only recognition of Kate, Naomi and Cindy. But their quiet success and selling power is just as mighty - with UK online shopping sales estimated to have raked in £6.5billion and 14.3 per cent of all shoes and clothing sales this year. E-commerce model Gemma Sanderson was the first winner of Australia's Next Top Model and moved to London four years ago . Portia Okotcha says she receives a lot of 'funny and weird' messages from fans on social networking sites . The models are the face of shopping websites such as ASOS, Littlewoods and MyWardrobe.com, who have to encompass the girl-next-door look without taking a shopper's eye off the clothes, according to the Sunday Times Style magazine. Ruth Cozens, art director of MyWardrobe.com, told the magazine: 'They have to be more perfect than editorial models. Finding the perfect online product is a constant mission for most retailers. They have to be flawless.' One stylist told the magazine: 'If a dress doesn't sell on one girl, they will shoot it on another, and she can boost sales by as much as 800 per cent.' Sanderson, one of the industry's top earners, won Australia's Next Top Model in 2005 and is represented in the UK by Storm, the agency that discovered Kate Moss. She says she plans to 'set myself up for life' with her earnings. Okotcha is one of the e-commerce models who also walks in catwalk shows and does editorial shoots for magazines, pulling in 'box office' sized fees. Jamie Gunns, left, and Kirstie Bennett are familiar faces to ASOS shoppers . She also has 4,700 . Twitter followers and 2,700 on Instagram and says she was once followed for an hour by a . group of girls before they plucked up the courage to ask to have their . picture taken with her. Kirstie Bennett and Jamie Gunns are favoured by online retailer ASOS. Bennett, one of the highest earners in the e-comm world, says her 'Barbie' nickname is down to her versatility: 'I can be festival Barbie, grunge Barbie.' The girls working in e-commerce can command up to £3,500 a day - not quite as much as when Linda Evangelista said that she and her fellow supermodels wouldn't wake up for less than $10,000. But they earn their impressive fees with intensive sessions in photo studios on industrial estates where they will pose for thousands of pictures in a day in up to 30 looks for online catalogues and film 'catwalk' videos wearing the outfits. The e-comm girls don't have the fame of Kate Moss, left, and Naomi Campbell, but have tremendous earning power - pulling in up to £20,000 a week by posing for online retailers who love their girl-next-door looks .","Using the 'right' girl to wear an item can mean an 800 per cent boost in sales .

They show how toxins, including arsenic and cyanide, circulate around the body from the lungs to the heart and then the brain. They are part of a new stop-smoking campaign launched by Public Health England to highlight the damage done to smokers' bodies. Scroll down for video . Public Health England has launched a new stop-smoking film. It shows how smoke enters the lungs (pictured) where it causes serious damage . The Smokefree Health Harms campaign points out that inhaling dangerous chemicals in cigarettes damages major organs and increases the risk of stroke and dementia. The chemicals move through the heart, the lungs and into the bloodstream, finally damaging cells in the brain. The campaign film informs viewers: ‘Every time you smoke, blood that's thick and dirty with toxins circulates through your body in seconds increasing your chances of a heart attack or stroke. If you could see the damage, you'd stop.’ The film shows a man standing outside smoking. It then illustrates how the smoke he inhales enters his lungs before passing through his blood vessels into his heart and finally his brain. As the film pans through the body, it shows the organs being rapidly damaged. England's chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said: ‘We know about the serious effect smoking has on the heart and lungs but smokers need to be aware of how much potential damage is being done to the brain and other vital organs through toxins in cigarettes entering the blood. The film then shows how the blood moves from the lungs through the blood vessels (pictured) to the heart . ‘Smoking is the major cause of premature death, with one in two smokers dying prematurely from smoking-related diseases, and it is extremely worrying that people still underestimate the health harms associated with it. ‘However, it is not all doom and gloom for smokers looking to quit this New Year. Within five years of stopping smoking, your risk of stroke can be reduced to the same as a lifetime non-smoker.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being for Public Health England, said: ‘More than eight million people smoke in England. The film shows how the 'dirty' blood, which is filled with toxins, passes into the heart (pictured) from where it is then pumped to the brain . In the brain, the toxins are transported through small blood vessels until they penetrate all areas, increasing the risk of dementia and strokes . ‘With half of long-term smokers dying prematurely from a smoking-related disease, highlighting the unseen damaging effect smoking has on the body's major organs provides a real motivation for people to stop.’ Joe Korner, director of external affairs at Stroke Association, said: ‘Stroke is a major cause of death and adult disability in the UK and you are twice as likely to have a stroke if you smoke. 'The more you smoke, the more your risk increases.’ The campaign film informs viewers: 'Every time you smoke, blood that's thick and dirty with toxins circulates through your body in seconds increasing your chances of a heart attack or stroke. If you could see the damage, you'd stop.' Image shows toxins passing into the brain . Dr Gareth Hagger-Johnson, research associate at University College London (UCL), said: ‘Accelerated decline in cognitive reasoning and memory is more advanced in smokers, with one of our studies at UCL showing it to be nearly 38 per cent faster in persistent male smokers compared to non-smokers. ‘The decline in the brain's cognitive powers is naturally seen with ageing. 'However, there are a number of identifiable risk factors, including smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, which can be associated with an accelerated rate of decline.’","Public Health England has launched a new campaign film to encourage people to stop smoking - it shows the effects of cigarettes on the body .

Smooth operators: Richard and Adam Johnson in one of their YouTube videos released before their BGT breakthrough . It's a classic Britain’s Got Talent story. Two perfectly ordinary brothers with perfectly ordinary jobs – and a rather adorable nan – arrive on stage and belt out a stunning performance worthy of a professional duo. Trouble is, that’s exactly what ‘sandwich makers’ Richard and Adam Johnson are. Far from being amateurs, the brothers  have spent the past year performing at venues around the country and singing on P&O cruises. They even released an album after being talent-spotted by legendary record producer Gordon Lorenz, who compared them to his former protégée Charlotte Church and branded them the ‘Panini Pavarottis’. And while they do still help out at their parents’ sandwich business, which includes two franchises of high-street chain Subway, their mother admitted: ‘To be frank, sandwiches are not their passion.’ It’s the second time in days that the ITV talent show has been hit by a row over ‘fakery’. Last week Alice Fredenham was accused of faking her stage fright to endear herself to the judges. It is not clear whether tenor Richard, 22, and his 19-year-old baritone brother Adam told the show’s producers in advance  that they were more than just ‘sandwich makers’. During their performance on Saturday’s show the jumper-wearing brothers were at pains to emphasise their family roots and humble credentials. Their grandmother Lorna Slack, 70, joined them briefly on stage and couldn’t contain her pride. Interviewed beforehand, Richard explained: ‘We’ve been singing really for three years around the house, as you do. Anywhere and everywhere and really we always sing for Nan.’ Once they got on stage, judge Amanda Holden asked: ‘Have you got a day job?’ Richard replied: ‘Yes, we both work in sandwich shops, don’t we?’ Simon Cowell quipped: ‘So you’re classical sandwich makers. This I’m looking forward to.’ See video below... Humble: Richard and Adam Johnson said their day job was in a sandwich shop on Britain's Got Talent . Cruising to stardom: Despite claiming that they work in a sandwich shop, Adam and Richard Johnson have sung on cruise ships and are seen here on the show Cruising with the Stars . Rising stars: Adam and Richard Johnson have a website, have sung on cruise ships and were billed as 'The Johnson Brothers' when they appeared on Loose Women . The pair received a standing ovation for their performance of musical hit The Impossible Dream. But it later emerged the pair have spent more time polishing their act than they were willing to admit on television. In 2011 they were talent-spotted by Lorenz after they began singing at Temptations, a cafe owned by their parents Paul and Julie near their home in Holywell, North Wales. After that they spent a season performing at the New Theatre in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. They also appeared alongside Ken Dodd at Liverpool’s Empire Theatre and performed with singer Joe Longthorne. Grandmother Lorna Slack celebrates on Britain's Got talent after Richard and Adam's performance . Homely: The talented brothers on the reality show's stage . Last year they released their first album, which Ricky Tomlinson plugged during an appearance on Loose Women. They had impressed the comedian when they sang at his Liverpool cabaret club, The Green Room. Yesterday, Mrs Johnson, 49, told the Daily Mail: ‘They just want to sing and that’s what they’ve been concentrating on more and more. ‘But they’re not yet able to earn enough money from singing to quit the day job so they’re still involved [in the family business] … just. They last worked here two or three weeks ago for a couple of days.’ In stark contrast to their homely appearance on Saturday, YouTube videos of their cruise ship routine show the brothers as slick entertainers in sharp suits. Four months ago, Richard wrote on the site: ‘Adam and I are now a duo singing around the world, stay tuned!’ But they now seem less keen to boast about their professional experience. All references to their paid gigs have been removed from their official website. A Britain’s Got Talent spokesman said: ‘Richard and Adam both work in the family’s sandwich shops in Wales. Over the past few months they’ve worked part time as they have been pursuing their dream of making a living from singing with occasional work on cruise ships and other small gigs.’ A show source said that, on average, the brothers had worked for two weeks a month at their parents’ shops this year. They have worked on ten cruises since last August, and produced 1,000 copies of their self-made album to sell after those gigs. They sang with Ken Dodd three times, and were paid ‘a couple of hundred pounds per performance’, the source said.","The Johnson brothers have been performing on cruise ships for a year .

Controversy: Stephanie Banister appeared to think that Islam was a country when she was interviewed on Australian TV . An Australian election candidate has drawn comparisons to Sarah Palin after an embarrassing interview in which she displayed ignorance of basic facts about Islam. Stephanie Banister referred to Islam as a country, and confused the word 'halal' with 'haram' - which has the opposite meaning. She also claimed that Jews follow the teachings of Jesus, and was unable to name her two opponents for a parliamentary seat in Brisbane. Ms Banister, 27, is a trained welder who is contesting the House of Representatives seat of Rankin for the anti-immigrant One Nation party in next month's federal election. The mother of two rose to prominence when she was arrested for going into a supermarket and putting stickers saying 'halal food funds terrorism' on NestlÃ© products. However, in an interview with Channel Seven yesterday she made multiple errors about the most rudiment tenets of the religion. She said: 'I don't oppose Islam as a country, but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia.' Ms Banister then repeatedly referred to 'haram', which means 'sinful', when she apparently meant to say 'halal', which means the opposite and is commonly used to refer to the faith's laws about preparing food. 'Less than two per cent of Australians follow haram,' she told the interviewer. When asked if she opposed the Jewish laws of kosher, Ms Banister incorrectly replied: 'Jews aren't under haram. They have their own religion which follows Jesus Christ.' She added: 'They don't have a tax on it, they just have a certain way of making it, where haram has a tax on the food.' In fact, bodies which certify either kosher or halal food charge a fee for their services. Ms Banister was asked to name her opponents in the seat from the two mainstream parties, but admitted: 'I'm still learning all of the names of people in politics.' She continued: 'Everyone in the world has a lot to learn about day-to-day stuff and everything in life is just about learning.' Comparison: Some have compared Ms Banister to former U.S. vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin . The candidate later told Fairfax Media that she had meant to say 'Islamic countries', adding: 'Unfortunately, they've completely twisted all my words and made me out to be a stand-up criminal and a stupid moron.' Ms Banister is an extreme long-shot for the Rankin seat, which is a toss-up between Labor's Jim Chalmers and David Lin of the Liberals. She is currently facing a charge of 'contaminating or interfering with goods' over the supermarket incident, and will be disqualified from the September 7 election if she is convicted before then.","Stephanie Banister, 27, is running in Brisbane as anti-immigrant candidate .

A pair of newlyweds say they have proved how easy it is to get married on a budget – by celebrating their nuptials for £1. Georgina Porteous and Sid Innes organised their perfect day for family and friends, complete with rings, flowers, a cake and even a photographer to capture the occasion. They also hosted a reception with a picnic, drinks, jazz music and dancing at a romantic setting in the Scottish Highlands, all on their unbelievably low budget. Georgina and Sid Innes at their Inverness-shire home where they were married, wearing the clothes that they wore on their wedding day . But incredibly, apart from the £70 they had to pay by law for their marriage fees, their only expenditure was a pound on Georgina’s vintage wedding gown. The newlyweds were toasting their good fortune today after spending only a tiny fraction of the average £20,000 cost of a wedding in the UK. Georgina, 36, said: 'I don’t see the point in these massive weddings. It takes away from what marriage is truly about. The only expense the couple could not avoid was the statutory £70 for the fees required to marry, but everything else was donated or sourced for free . The couple exchanged wedding rings hand-crafted by Georgina using antlers she found in their garden . 'There is nothing to gain from spending a huge amount of money. The day is supposed to be about marrying the person you love and for us all that mattered was that we were becoming husband and wife. We didn’t want or need a big, fancy affair.' Georgina, an artist, met singer-songwriter Sid, 39, at an art fair in Glasgow in 2009 and immediately said ‘yes’ when he proposed in Berlin last year. The couple, who live near Inverness, started planning their big day but as they are both dedicated to recycling and self-sufficiency, they vowed to keep their nuptials as simple as possible. The only expense they could not avoid was the statutory £70 for the fees required to marry, but everything else was donated or sourced for free. Georgina said: 'From day one of the engagement we knew we wanted a small and cheap wedding, it was a natural thing for us because we are so invested in recycling and self-sustainability. We were really excited to plan it all. Georgina's mother Susanne, a church reader, conducted the ceremony in front of 70 guests in a run-down barn at their home . The £1 was spent on the wedding dress, a 1960s hand-made floor-length ivory wedding gown with embroidered sleeves, which Georgina purchased on the website freecycle . 'We have always been a bit alternative and arty so I enjoyed doing something a little different from everyone else’s weddings.' Wedding dress: £1, from freecycle.com . Groom's suit: M&S, years old . Rings: Hand-crafted from antlers found in garden . Service: Vicar performed it for free in return for whip-round in aid of local church . Photographer: Donated services in return for bride working for him as film editor . Cake: Earl Grey-infused sponge cakes made by bride's aunt . Food: Guests contributed a dish each . Music: Bride's father played jazz saxophone . Venue: Barn behind their cottage . Reception: A picnic on the grass outside . The wedding took place last night in a barn behind the couple’s idyllic cottage, which was decorated with solar lanterns, locally grown flowers and hay bales donated from farmers. Georgina looked stunning in a 1960s hand-made floor-length ivory wedding gown with embroidered sleeves. She found the dress the website freecycle, an online community where people can swap unwanted items, and it cost her a pound - their only expenditure on the day itself. Sid opted for a stylish tweed suit he had bought years ago from Marks and Spencer. Georgina’s mother Susanne, a church reader, conducted the ceremony in front of 70 guests. The couple exchanged wedding rings hand-crafted by Georgina using antlers she found in their garden. They were officially pronounced man and . wife by local reverend Peter Donald, who had offered his services for . free so the guests had a whip-round to make donations to the church. Georgina's aunt had baked a three-tier chocolate orange wedding cake infused with Lady Grey tea, with the couple's initials intertwined on top for decoration . An official wedding photographer was on hand to capture the occasion after Georgina, also a freelance film editor, offered to work for him in return. Each guest had been asked to bring food and drink, so they tucked into home-made quiches, sausage rolls, boiled potatoes, fresh bread and salad. The couple proved a wedding day to remember does not need to cost a fortune, spending a tiny fraction of the the average UK wedding . Georgina’s aunt had baked a three-tier chocolate orange wedding cake infused with Lady Grey tea, with the couple’s initials intertwined on top for decoration. After the wedding picnic, everyone partied the night away, as Georgina’s talented father, Harry, played some 1940s jazz on his saxophone. Georgina added: 'We had so much fun and it was exciting to see what dish everyone had brought. 'We all sat around after the ceremony and had a little picnic, it was great and all the food was gone by the end so we didn’t waste any of it. 'There was quite a relaxed atmosphere and everyone was chatting to one another, and then when it got later everyone was enjoying the music and joining in with all the dances. 'We had a ball. The day went beautifully. It was really family-focused and emotional. Lots of people said it was the best wedding they have ever been to.' But despite spending so little on their wedding, the couple intend to be more extravagant on their honeymoon as they will be spending a month in Berlin. Georgina said: 'Although we spent a small amount, we do plan to spend a little more on our honeymoon. 'We are going back to Berlin, where we got engaged. We love it and we have friends living there, so we will still be able to save some money.'","Georgina Porteous and Sid Innes spent just a pound on their wedding .

The service lasted more than an hour, and in a nearby overflow room, four coffins stood decorated with flowers, Deseret News reported. King's brother, Nigel McIntosh, described their family as close and one that enjoyed taking camping trips together as children. He recalled how his sister 'loved a night out,' and rebelled at school. 'She didn't like being told what to do,' he said with a laugh. McIntosh said in recent years she had become a 'very proud Nana,' regularly sharing pictures of her grandkids.

Archuleta said 'many other people in our community knew of these problems, and none of us dared to go to anybody.' She added that Kelly had told her she was unhappy and felt unsafe, but urged her friend not to tell anyone in case it affected chances of reconciliation, the Tribune reported. 'I wish I would have said something back then,' Archuleta said. 'I was afraid I would upset her.'

Two men who partied with missing Indiana college student Lauren Spierer the night she vanish have responded to her parents' lawsuit against them by claiming they are not responsible for her disappearance. The 20-year-old coed was last seen with Corey Rossman, Jay Rosenbaum and Mike Beth on June 3, 2011 near the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, where all four were students. The three men say she left them to walk back to her own apartment and was never seen again. However, Lauren's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer, claim the men are withholding information from detectives and know more about their daughter's case than they are willing to admit. Search: Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished two years and a half ago after a night out with friends. Her parents are now suing the two men who saw her before she went missing in a bid to find out the truth, they say . Desperate: Robert and Charlene Spierer said they do not believe the men have told everything they know . The Spierers filed a lawsuit in . federal court in June, arguing that Mr Rossman and Mr Rosenbaum - the . last two to see her alive - had a 'duty of care' to ensure their . daughter's safety. In . December, a judge threw out the suit against Mr Beth - agreeing with his . attorneys who said he could not be held liable simply because he was . with her when she was intoxicated the night she vanished. Attorneys for Mr Rossman and Mr Rosenbaum have responded. They deny that they know anything more about Spierer's disappearance than what they have already told police. And they say that they didn't have a 'duty of care' - or a responsibility to look after the intoxicated Spierer. The . Spierers are not suing Kilroy's Sports Bar, which is accused of . continuing the serve the intoxicated underage student and her friends. Barclay admitted that the move seemed extreme, but added to Fox News: 'Any parent in search of information about a missing child would use every resource available to them. 'Therefore, we intend to use the rights afforded by the civil justice system to obtain answers to questions that have gone unanswered for too long. We fully expect that those with relevant information will cooperate with this process.' In an interview last month, the couple said they did not believe the men were telling the truth about their daughter's last hours and they are uncertain if she even left their apartment, as they have said she did. The couple say they still believe . someone will eventually reveal what happened to her and that it would be . devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is . dead. Questions: Jay Rosenbaum, left, and Corey Rossman, right, saw Lauren Spierer the night she vanished . The Spierers have maintained since . soon after Lauren vanished in the early hours of June 3, 2011, in . downtown Bloomington that several of the people who were with her that . night haven't fully cooperated with police. 'There's . a sense that someday, some week things will change for us. That someone . will have the strength, the crisis of conscience to come forward,' Robert Spierer has told The Herald-Times. Lauren . went to Rosenbaum's apartment with a friend on the night she vanished. She then left with Rossman and went to a bar - even though she was not . old enough to drink. At . 2.27am, she was caught on camera leaving the bar with Rossman to her . apartment. But once there, he got into an altercation with another . student who punched him. Minutes . later, Lauren and Rossman left the complex and walked through an . alleyway to his apartment. At one point, he was seen carrying Spierer, . who appeared drunk. Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the . last known image of Lauren, who was seen incapacitated . When . they arrived at the apartment, Mike Beth helped Rossman to his bed and . then walked her to Rosenbaum's apartment down the hallway. He . said he tried to convince her to sleep on his couch, but she refused . and he watched from his balcony as she walked home alone. It should have taken her just six minutes to return home, but she has not been seen since. The three young men have previously said that the Spierers are harassing . them for information about their daughter's whereabouts. 'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we'd . done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re . doing is hurting my career,' said Corey Rossman. Desperate search: Charlene Spierer, left, has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter Lauren . 'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star. Rossman told the paper that he has had . to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the . Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the . young men. 'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper. 'The . private investigators have never spoken to Corey.

Attorneys representing the husband of a pregnant, brain-dead Texas woman being kept on life support despite his protests is carrying a fetus that is 'distinctly abnormal' after being deprived of oxygen for an unknown period of time. Marlise Munoz remains hooked up to machines in a Fort Worth hospital, while her husband and the hospital are locked in a court battle about whether to retain life support. The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. The case has gotten the attention of groups on either side of the abortion debate, as anti-abortion groups argue Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born. Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness . Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, . in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be . taken to save the life of the fetus . Erick Munoz said his wife, a fellow paramedic, was clear with him before he found her unconscious on November 26: If she ever fell into this kind of condition, pull life support. But John Peter Smith Hospital says it's bound by state law that prohibits the withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient, although several experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital is misapplying the law. Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, issued a statement Wednesday describing the condition of the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation. King and Janicek based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital. 'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.' The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem. Normal heartbeat: Doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term . Happier times: Above, Erick Munoz holds their 1-year-old son Mateo. HIs attorneys are now saying that the fetus is deformed . 'Quite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,' the attorneys said. Spokeswomen for the hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, declined to comment Wednesday. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. Munoz's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return Marlise Munoz's body to her family. Several experts have said the Texas Advance Directives Act doesn't apply in this case because Marlise Munoz, having suffered brain death, is legally and medically dead — a key argument in Erick Munoz's lawsuit. Munoz previously told the AP he wasn't confident about the health of the fetus. His wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in November, possibly from a blood clot. A 2010 article in the journal BMC Medicine found 30 cases of brain-dead pregnant women over about 30 years. Of 19 reported results, the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them — all of whom developed normally, according to the journal. I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders . 'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:07 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:01 EST, 19 July 2013 . Mexico is about to see its first openly gay mayor after a singer who owns a gay bar was elected in a rural area of the country. The election of Benjamin Medrano has been hailed as a significant victory for gay rights in Mexico, where homosexuals often feel oppressed due to the conservative Catholic culture. His victory in the city of Fresnillo came despite a smear campaign against him in which his political rivals apparently criticised him to voters 'as if being gay were a crime'. The city is located in Zacatecas state in central Mexico, a largely rural region famous for a macho culture where men wear cowboy hats and boots, and a state plagued by shootouts between drug gangs. Champion: Benjamin Medrano has become Mexico's first openly gay mayor after being elected in Fresnillo . Mr Medrano, 47, described his constituency as 'very machisto', adding that the area is 'full of tough country people, who don't necessarily have much information on what's happening elsewhere, and have even less of an automatic sympathy with their gay mayor.' However, despite his openness about his sexuality, the new mayor insisted: 'It's not like I'm going to paint city hall pink.' Gay people in Mexico rarely face official persecution, as homosexuality has been legal in the country since the 19th century, and there are a number of laws banning anti-gay discrimination. However, 95 per cent of Mexican gays feel oppressed by others, according to a recent survey, as the strong Catholic influence on society means many people regard homosexuality as immoral. While a number of Mexican politicians have been rumoured to be gay, none has ever come out, making Mr Medrano the most senior openly gay official ever to have been elected. He won his victory by campaigning over public safety, aiming to clamp down on the gang turf war in Fresnillo which has led to bodies being found hacked to bits, decapitated or with their throats slashed. Tough: The area where Mr Medrano will hold office is remote and plagued with violence . The city of 230,000 is at the centre of fierce fighting between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel because it sits on some of northern Mexico's main trafficking routes. Mr Medrano insisted he is 'not at risk' because he has no ties to any of the cartels, but admitted: 'Of course, I have the same fear that anybody who lives in Fresnillo has.' He said that he had become accepted in the rough region thanks to his fame as a singer - one area where homosexuality is widely accepted - and his two decades running a gay bar. The new mayor has been seen at gay rights marches in the past, and said he is 'very proud to be the first openly gay mayor in this country' - adding that other gay politicans should be unafraid to be open about their sexuality. Mr Medrano is a Roman Catholic, and is reluctant to contradict the teaching of the church. 'I wish the church had a different view, but I cannot go against doctrine,' he said. 'I respect my church, and I don't want to dig any deeper beyond what's permitted and what is appropriate.' 'I'm not in favour of gay marriage, I don't share that view, because we are still a very small town - in short, we're not prepared, in my view. Not yet, anyway, because we have strong roots in our religion, and in our customs.' Gay rights campaigner Alejandro Brito, director of Letra S, said that Mr Medrano's election was likely to be a breakthrough for the movement in Mexico, adding that the only gay politicians to hold office previously were chosen by political parties rather than directly by voters. 'This shows that our human rights system is providing some protection,' he said. 'Because, even though there is no public majority in favor of electing gay politicians, he knows that the legal framework will protect him. 'It is now more risky for a political rival to be openly homophobic than it is to be a homosexual candidate.'","Benjamin Medrano, 47, will take office as mayor of violence-plagued Fresnillo .

The Maryland mother accused of stabbing to death two of her children during an attempted exorcism was the leader of an unsanctioned church group called the 'Demon Assassins,' it was revealed this week. One-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister, Zyana, were found dead in their beds at their home in Germantown last Friday. Their mother, Zakieya Avery, 28 and another woman Monifa Sanford, 21, who had been staying with the family, have been charged with their murder and the attempted murder of the victims' older brother and sister. Prosecutors said that a day before the killings, Avery had been scheduled to perform an exorcism ritual on a friend named Troy, but he never showed up at her home. Scroll down for videos . Horrific: Norell Harris, 1 right, and his 2-year-old sister Zyana Harris, front left, were found dead in a disturbing, blood-splattered crime scene. Their older siblings, pictured, were rushed to hospital and survived . Avery, a recently divorced mother of four plagued with financial problems, claimed to be a commander of the four-person 'Demon Assassins' cabal she had started while worshiping at a Germantown church, with Sanford acting as her 'sergeant.' The pair would later tell police they had taken part in exorcisms in the past, but the spiritual cleansings never featured knives or bloodshed, the Washington Post reported. Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy offered new details on the ritualistic killing Tuesday, saying that Avery and her accomplice became convinced that the children were possessed by demons. According to investigators, Avery tried to snap the neck of her 1-year-old son, then choked him and finally stabbed him with Sanford's help. Convinced that the demon jumped into Avery's 2-year-old daughter Zyana next, the two women allegedly stabbed her to death as well before turning on her two siblings, ages 5 and 8, who suffered injuries in the attack.

Concerns: A neighbour of the family called 911 to report a child left inside a car outside the home for 45 minutes the night before it is believed they were killed in an exorcism ritual . When interviewed later by police, the two . suspects described how they saw the children’s eyes darken . and a black cloud hovering over one of the kids. ‘Both . defendants alleged that the demon leapt from the body of the last child . into Ms. Avery and then attacked Ms. Sanford,’ McCarthy said during . Avery and Sanford's first court appearance Tuesday. Avery then bathed the dead children and wrapped them in blankets so they would be clean when they saw God, according to police. McCarthy . added that Avery had been involuntarily committed to a mental . institution in the past and that Sanford told officials she had tried to . take her own life on two separate occasions. A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Zakieya Avery with her four children. Police discovered the discovered the two younger siblings dead and their their five-year-old and eight-year-old siblings suffering from stab wounds . According to Montgomery County Police Captain Marcus Jones, Avery told detectives she 'thought the devil was in the kids.' 'That's . sort of the thing she centered it around as to why she had to conduct . an exorcism,' he said. 'She just thought that there were evil spirits . within the kids.' Avery was arrested when authorities say she tried to flee from a . townhouse near the vehicle. Police found the two children dead inside . the home, and their siblings and Sanford were taken to the hospital with . injuries. Police said Sanford was arrested Saturday after being released from the hospital. Arrest: Zakieya Avery is being held without bond charged with the murder and the attempted murder of her children . The . tragedy unfolded at around 9.30am Friday when police officers . responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they . came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people, four of them . children under the age of 10. The two youngest children were pronounced dead at the scene. The children's grandmother Ida Johnson, 90, told of her shock, describing the two young victims as the 'sweetest things'. She said: 'I . will cherish those memories forever,' she told MailOnline. 'Their lives . were cut short and they had no say so whatsoever. It doesn't make . sense.' Mrs Johnson said the children's father, her grandson, Martin Luther Harris Jr. has traveled to . the Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. to be with his . surviving son and daughter who were both listed in stable condition . Sunday. Johnson said she didn't know if Avery had a history of violence or when the woman's relationship with Harris deteriorated. 'I don't know what was going on between the family, all I know is they were sweet kids,' she said. The . great-grandmother added: 'It's heartbreaking. Something should be done . about who did it. But at the same time, it's not going to bring the . children back. I just hope they get (what they deserve).' Avery's stepgrandmother, Sylvia Wade, told The Washington Post that Avery was 'humble and meek' and said she loved her children. 'I . don't know what triggered it,' she said. 'She wasn't herself. When a . person is not of themselves, they are not responsible for what they are . doing. They are in another zone.' Tragedy: Zakieya Latrice Avery, 28 (for right), has been charged in the stabbing deaths of two of her kids, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old (pictured left and right) Startling change: Police arrested Monifa Denise Sanford, 21 (pictured at her arrest at right and earlier at left) Saturday following her release from a hospital and charged her with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder . The other woman charged in the killings, Monifa Sanford, made similar . statements about evil spirits during questioning, police said. The two . women had been living together at the house in recent months. Jones said the women are believed to have met each other at a church, which he identified as Exousia Ministries in Germantown. According to Jones, while worshiping at the church, Avery was part of a dance troupe and started calling herself a demon assassin, but the moniker did not raise any concerns because she never talked about violence. ‘She was basically saying that her job — as of lover of Christ — was that she was going to keep demons away from her,’ Jones said. ‘That was part of her and Ms. Sanford’s goal.’ Jones added that when Darryl Joyce, senior pastor at Exousia Ministries, was asked about Avery’s ‘Demon Assassins’ group, the clergyman described it as ‘a little bit eccentric, a little bit over the top.’ Joyce has since issued a statement to the station MyFox DC saying the women were no longer members of his congregation at the time of the killing. Both . women were being held without bond on charges of first-degree murder . and attempted first-degree murder. During questioning, Jones noted that Avery acknowledged that what she did was bad, but allegedly did not sow the 'out-and-out remorse' one would expect to see in a parent accused of killing her child. Sinister ritual: Norell Harris, a 1-year-old boy (second left), and Zyana Harris, a 2-year-old girl (third left), were found dead in Germantown, Maryland, Friday, while their older siblings (pictured) suffered multiple stab wounds during what was described as an exorcism . Grisly sight: Police who went into a home in Germantown on Friday morning encountered a 'very bloody scene' and discovered two children dead, and two other children and a woman injured . Horrific detail: According to reports, the children may have been sleeping in their rooms when they were stabbed . 'Cases like this are heartbreaking' said Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims along with the 911 operators, police officers, evidence technicians, and fire and EMS personnel that responded,' according to the station WUSA9. According to her Facebook page, Avery lives with her family in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and works as a pharmacy technician. Most recently, she wished happy New Year to her family on January 2.

Anthony Weiner braved the winter cold with his young son this week after the disgraced Congressman confirmed that he and wife Huma Abedin had visited a broker to find a new place to live. The former New York mayoral hopeful was spotted on Tuesday outside his Park Avenue home leading his two-year-old Jordan to their car as the snow fell. Weiner and his political advisor wife have been living in the apartment, estimated at $12,000-per-month in rent since he resigned, amid a sexting scandal in 2011. However it seems that the rent in one of New York City's most expensive neighborhood's has now become too steep. Anthony Weiner with his son Jordan in front of their home on Park Avenue in Manhattan on Tuesday after it was confirmed that the family were looking for a cheaper place to live . Weiner carries his son to the car in the freezing cold weather earlier this week after he tweeted about visiting a 'no class broker' Weiner with his son Jordan, out the front of their building on Park Avenue as it emerged that he and wife Human Abedin were moving out of their $12,000-a-month home . The Flatiron apartment was being rented . to them by Democratic donor Jack Rosen, who is close with Bill Clinton, . the former president who officiated Weiner and Abedin's nuptials. Now the Weiners are looking to move to a . slightly cheaper apartment but are . staying in the neighborhood. The couple have been looking at a three-bedroom, . two-and-a-half bath apartment in a doorman building on East 23rd Street. CitiHabitats realtor Brian Morgan showed the couple an $8,000-per-month apartment in the modern building. 'He . didn’t talk much; she was very nice. She was in control. She was asking . all the questions and was way more vocal,' Mr Morgan told The Post this week. Weiner confirmed that he was apartment hunting by blasting the real estate company in a tweet for . not only allowing their broker to publicly speak about their working . relationship but to publicize it on their Twitter account. Weiner put down the CitiHabitats as having 'no class brokers' and name-checked the realtor. He wrote: 'If no class brokers are your thing, here ya go MT @CitiHabitats: Guess who checked out our agent Brian Morgan's listing.' Inevitable: Weiner blasted CitiHabitats on Twitter after the broker spoke to a tabloid about what apartment the couple were considering . Park Avenue digs: Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner have been living on Park Avenue South ever since he sold his Queens co-op during the 2011 sexting scandal that required him to resign from office . The new building that they are looking at is only a few blocks further east than their current apartment. It comes as little surprise that the family would like to stay in the area: Anthony's brother Jason owns L&W Oyster Bar and Almond, two restaurants in the neighborhood. The couple married in June 2010 and . their home base was the apartment he owned in Forest Hills, which fell . in his congressional district in Queens. Shortly . after he resigned in 2011- meaning that he no longer had to live in the . district that he once represented- the couple sold his co-op apartment . and moved to one of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods. Daddy duty: Weiner has been regularly spotted with his son in the area around their apartment, taking now two-year-old Jordan to the grocery store and the playground in Union Square . Before the scandal, Abedin was best known in political circles for being Hillary Clinton's top aide and she has worked with the former Secretary of State for decades. Weiner has said in previous interviews that he gave his wife full reign to pick their new apartment amid the controversy he put them both through. They have been seen walking around the neighborhood by MailOnline, with Weiner shopping in the local grocery store and bringing their now two-year-old son Jordan to the playground in nearby Union Square. Modern look: The couple are now reportedly looking at an apartment in this building on 23rd Street, which is only a few blocks east of the apartment they have called home for the past two years . For a while, they hoped that they would be calling Gracey Mansion home, as Weiner attempted to re-enter the public sphere by running for mayor. But his candidacy went down in flames when more dirty sexts and emails were released by a young woman who had a virtual relationship with the married man after he had already resigned from office. Ms Abedin is still working for Mrs Clinton and is considered to be one of the closest ‘gate keepers’ to the likely Democratic presidential candidate. Weiner has made a guest appearance on the new Amazon political comedy Alpha House and is restarting some of the consulting work that he had been doing in the time between his resignation and his failed mayoral bid.","Weiner and wife Huma Abedin looking at other 3-bedroom apartments in Manhattan's Flatiron and Gramercy Park neighborhoods .

The American Psychological Association has refused to punish one of its members for assisting in the torture of a 9/11 terrorist suspect at Guantanamo Bay. Leaked documents show that Dr John Leso, now a retired US Army reserves, instructed prison staff on ways to obtain intelligence from detainees including Mohammed al-Qahtani, the twentieth 9/11 hijacking suspect. The methods were so severe even Pentagon officials called them 'torture'. Methods included forcibly hydrating Qahtani though IVs and then not letting him use the bathroom. They also subjected him to loud music, made him bark like a dog and deprived him of sleeping saying he can go to bed 'when he tells the truth'. But in an APA letter obtained by the Guardian . from December 31, they decided they 'cannot proceed with formal charges . in this matter. Consequently the complaint against Dr Leso has been . closed'. Fact: Leaked documents prove that Dr John Leso aided in the torture of a suspected terrorist at Guantanamo Bay . The APA doesn't deny that Dr Leso took part in the torture, but says his actions didn't meet the burden of 'direct unethical conduct' since he was a noted critic of the military's intelligence gathering approach. Leso and colleague Major Paul Burney were the authors of an interrogation handbook of sorts - a memorandum called 'Counter-Resistance Strategies which advised on how to best get information from prisoners. 'All aspects of the [detention] environment should enhance capture shock, dislocate expectation, and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible,' one section read. Exonerated: But the American Psychological Association ruled last month that they will not carry out charges against Leso, one of their members. On the left, Mohammed al-Qahtani, the terrorist suspect he helped torture. On the right, a detainee being interrogated at Abu Ghraib . But Leso and Burney distanced themselves from the document during a Senate panel in 2007, saying they were' not comfortable with the memo they were asked to produce'. Prior to that, just a month before logs show he aided in the interrogation of Qahtani, Leso was in a Guantanamo meeting in which he said that detainee abuse may not prove fruitful. 'Force is risky, and may be ineffective due to the detainees' frame of reference,' he said in October 2002. 'They are used to seeing much more barbaric treatment.' These occasions of noted discomfort are what the APA are using to defend their move in exonerating Leso. 'Available evidence in the public domain also includes that, in the face of pressure from the highest levels of the Bush administration which strongly supported ‘enhanced’ interrogation tactics, the respondent sought consultation and argued against such approaches and in favor of rapport-building approach,' wrote Lindsay Childress-Beatty, the deputy director of the APA’s ethics office, in the December 31 letter. The APA's decision has not been popular among other psychologists who believe this breaks their 'do no harm' rule. Trudy Bond is the Ohio psychologist who complained about Leso's work at Guantanamo to the APA and said their decision sends the message that 'psychologists are free to violate our ethical code, perhaps, in certain situations'.","Dr John Leso consulted on the interrogation methods at Guantanamo Bay .

Thousands of opponents of abortion received a glowing endorsement from the Pope via twitter when they turned out for the 'March for Life' to protest legalised abortion on the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic Roe v Wade decision. Tweeting from his official account (@Pontifex) Pope Francis gave support for the demonstrators of the event who had turned out in freezing temperatures to march on Capitol Hill. The Pope's tweet read: 'I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable.' Anti-abortion demonstrators gather on the snow covered National Mall in Washington yesterday . Pro-choice activist and intern of Feminist Majority Foundation Jade Reindl holds a sign as marchers of the annual March for Life arrive in front of the U.S. Supreme Court . Braving sub-zero temperatures, marchers with the Crow Wing Chapter of Minnesota 'Citizens Concerned For Life' walk in Brainerd, Minnesota . Francis, who has emphasised a broader focus on poverty beyond divisive issues, sent his support for the annual event, which takes place in January every year and attracts many Catholic high school and College students from across the U.S. This year, the march began on the National Mall with a rally, followed by protesters then walking along Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court, flanked by police officers protecting their right to free speech. Founded by Nellie Gray in 1974, the March for Life consists of a series of events and prayer vigils leading up to a rally, before a march on the National Mall in protest of the 1973 Supreme Court declaration that abortion is a constitutional right. Protesters on the march on Capitol Hill, flanked and escorted by police . Anti-abortion protesters face off with pro-abortion supporters during the March for Life on Capitol Hill . The anti-abortion protesters received a response from the President, who said he supported the 1973 Roe V Wade decision to make the choice of abortion constitutional . Pro-choice activists hold signs marching with the support of Pope Francis, who showed his support via Twitter . Roe V Wade was the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalised abortion within the first two months of pregnancy. Before it, state laws regulated abortions, forcing women to take dangerous, often illegal measures to get an abortion. In Texas in 1969, Norma McCorvey (later given the alias Jane Roe) was single and pregnant, and wanted to have an abortion. But under state laws, she was unable to have abortions except in the cases of incest or rape, so she claimed she was raped to get an abortion. This was thrown out. McCorvey sued for the right to an abortion. After a legal battle, the district court ruled that Texas laws infringed on Ninth and Fourteenth amendments of the constitution (right to privacy and citizens’ rights). Eventually her case landed in the supreme court, where they ruled that ‘the right to privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy’. The event has attracted serious media attention each year since it began, bringing with it big-name speakers, such as former president George W. Bush. This year, the theme of the march was 'Adoption: A Noble Decision', espousing the benefits of giving a child up for adoption as an alternative to abortion. Protesters came from Georgia, Missouri and Pennsylvania, with youngsters coming from schools and colleges in Chigaco and Cleveland, among others. Protests were heavily documented on Twitter, with many members of the march holding signs that read '#TeamLife' to spread their message. While there were mostly cheers and upbeat chants, the crowd booed when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia issued a statement that said there had been an expansion of abortion coverage during the nation's health care overhaul. President Barack Obama also issued a statement, saying the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision is a chance to 'recommit ourselves to the decision's guiding principle: that every woman should be able to make her own choices about her body and her health.' The annual anti-abortion rally, was expected to draw tens of thousands of activists into the freezing cold Washington D.C. weather . Anti-abortion demonstrators carry a statue of the Virgin Mary . Demonstrators bow their heads in prayer in front of the U.S. Supreme Court . The snow and freezing temperatures weren't a deterrent for the thousands of protesters that showed up for the rally . Beverly Miller, 39, of Mankato, Minnesota, made her first trip to join the march with her son Joseph, 15, and youth from their church. Her local diocese rented buses and drove 20 hours to the nation's capital to join the event. She said: 'When we get together in a group like this and we see that there's hundreds of thousands of other people like us, it gives us strength and courage and hope that we aren't alone. If we stand together, we really can make a difference.' Two expectant mothers had sonograms before the Kansas Senate Public Health Committee, in an event that was called a 'science education' by some and a 'political stunt' by others, on the same day the 'March for Life' anti-abortion protests took place in Washington D.C. One of the expectant mothers, Amanda Kennedy, 20, agreed to be sonogrammed in the  Committee in Topeka to give committee members a demonstration of what happens in the womb. Kennedy, an anti-abortion activist, who is 12 weeks pregnant, said: 'It is a little bit of a political statement, but it was important because it is something I believe in.' Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook, the committee's chairwoman, said: 'I thought it would be a great way to give committee members a science education on life within the womb.' In opposition, Elise Higgins, of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said: 'A committee room is not an appropriate place for medical procedure to happen. It's also not a place for medical procedures to be legislated.' The procedure was performed on two women by a sonographer from the Wyandotte Pregnancy Clinic, a crisis pregnancy centre that offers free sonograms and counselling to women who weighing whether to have an abortion.

According to court documents, MacLaughlin called Playfair, who is six years her junior, and told him that she was on her way to Kennewick some 500 miles away from her hometown. During the call, the jealous 25-year-old journalist also allegedly told Playfair that 'he would be dead by the end of the night.'

U.S. birth rates have been on a steady decline since the onset of the ‘Great recession.’ Newly released data shows births fell 10 per cent from 2008 to 2011, down to well under 4million births after hitting an all-time high of 4.3million births in 2007. A steep decline in teen pregnancies is also believed to be causing the fall. ‘In 2011, there were 3.8 million live births in hospitals, which was 436,000 less or a decrease of 10.3 percent compared to 2008,’ the Agency for Health Research and Quality said in a report. Falling: Births dropped from an all-time high of 4.3million in 2007 to just 3.8million in 2011 . Births have dropped 400,000 after hitting an all-time high of 4.3million in 2007, statistics show.One of the contributing factors is the drop in teen pregnancies. Teen birth rates have been dropping steadily for the past 20 years, and hit a new historic low in 2011, the government said. The rate hit only 31.3 births per 1,000, dropping from 34.2 the prior year and almost halving the 1991 peak of 61.8. The teen birth rate has dropped 25 per cent since 2007 and 49 per cent since 1991. MTV’s ’16 and Pregnant’ has been widely credited with helping to curb teen pregnancies. Less newborn: Births have fallen 10 per cent since 2008 . A recent study found the controversial television show ‘led to a 5.7 percent reduction in teen births in the 18 months following its introduction.’ The show also ‘led to more searches and tweets regarding birth control and abortion’ among the teen set, the study found. ‘This accounts for around one-third of the overall decline in teen births in the United States during that period,’ the study concluded. Birth rates have fallen one or two per cent across most demographics, but women over 35 have remained steady, according to the government. This was attributed to more financial stability and the urgency to have a child while they are still able.","U.S. births hit an all-time high of 4.3million in 2007 .

Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden who exposed the NSA practices . A government taskforce that reviewed the National Security Agency's surveillance programme for four months is urging President Barack Obama to shut down the agency's bulk collection of phone data and purge its massive inventory of millions of Americans' calling records. The recommendation from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to abandon the NSA's phone surveillance was even more sweeping than a similar proposal from another panel of experts. That panel, the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, advised Obama in December to restrict phone surveillance to limited court-ordered sweeps. The oversight board's new 234-page report - a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press - contained several strong dissents from two members of the five-member board - former national security lawyers from the Bush administration who recommended that the government retain its broad phone surveillance authority. The board disclosed key parts of its report to Mr Obama earlier this month before he unveiled his plans during a speech last week to the nation. In that speech, the President said the bulk phone collection program would continue for the time being. He directed the Justice Department and intelligence officials to find ways to end the government's control over the phone data. And he narrowed the NSA's bulk collection by insisting on close supervision by a secret federal intelligence court and reducing the wide chain of calls that the NSA may track. Phone companies have said they do not want to take responsibility for overseeing the data under standards set by the NSA. Barack Obama speaking about the National Security Agency and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques at the U.S. department of justice in Washington on January 17, 2014 . President Barack Obama shakes hands as he leaves the East Room of the White House this week. A government taskforce that reviewed the National Security Agency's surveillance programme for four months is him to shut down the agency's bulk collection of phone data . Warning that the NSA's massive daily intake of calling records 'raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties,' a three-member majority of the oversight board said the government should end the surveillance program and 'purge the database of telephone records that have been collected and stored during the program's operation.' The board said the NSA should instead seek records directly from phone service providers using 'existing legal authorities.' The NSA's surveillance programs and other operations began coming to light last year - and drawing intense criticism - after revelations fueled by an estimated 1.7 million documents taken by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden and handed over to several journalists around the world. Most controversial has been the NSA's collection of data on Americans' telephone calls and Internet messages. The NSA says it does not listen in on the phone calls or read the Internet messages without specific court orders on a case-by-case basis as it tracks potential terrorist plots. Along with its call for ending bulk phone surveillance, the oversight board report outlined 11 other recommendations on surveillance policy, calling for more government transparency and other reforms aimed at bolstering civil liberties and privacy protections. The board called for special attorneys to provide independent views in some proceedings before the secret spy court - as opposed to Obama's plan for a panel of experts that would participate at times. The board also urged the administration to provide the public with clear explanations of the legal authority behind any surveillance affecting Americans. In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase security . Legal opinions and documents 'describing the government's legal analysis should be made public so there can be a free and open debate regarding the law's scope,' the board said. Both the Bush and Obama administrations have been criticized by civil liberties advocates and by tech industry officials for failing to provide clear public explanations of the decision-making behind their surveillance policies. 'Purge the database . of telephone records that have been collected and stored during the . program's operation' Three-member majority of the oversight board . While the oversight board found consensus in some of its recommendations for transparency, its members were sharply divided when it came to the surveillance programs and their judicial oversight. Two members, former Bush administration Justice Department lawyers Rachel Brand and Elisebeth Collins Cook, defended the bulk phone sweeps and said they were too valuable to shut down. 'I am concerned about the detrimental effect this superfluous second-guessing can have on our national security agencies and their staff,' said Brand, who as a Justice lawyer defended USA Patriot Act legislation that provided the NSA with its authority to make the bulk phone collections. But the oversight board's three other members - executive director David Medine, former federal judge Patricia Wald and civil liberties advocate James Dempsey - held firm for broad changes. 'When the government collects all of a person's telephone records, storing them for five years in a government database that is subjected to high-speed digital searching and analysis, the privacy implications go far beyond what can be revealed by the metadata of a single telephone call,' the majority wrote. The oversight board was created in 2005, urged by the independent commission on the 9/11 attacks as a key organizational reform needed to balance counterterrorism policy with civil liberties concerns. The board functioned fitfully for several years, often short on members because of Congress' inaction. It finally won legislative approval last year for all five members and staff and took on its study of the NSA programs at the urging on Obama and congressional leaders. The rival Review Group urged Obama to consider expanding the oversight board's purview to include all intelligence operations. As part of that change, the Review Group also wants the oversight board's name changed to the Civil Liberties and Privacy Protection Board. Medine has balked at that change, worried the group will become known as the CLPP board.","Government taskforce reviewed surveillance programme for four months .

But Osvaldo was upset by a robust challenge and the pair became embroiled in an ugly confrontation that led to the forward attacking Fonte. The escalation of the row between the pair was described as brutal, and Southampton’s players, as well as manager Mauricio Pochettino, were stunned by its savage nature. An emergency meeting of executives at St Mary’s decided to suspend Osvaldo for two weeks as they consider his future. The incident took place just a week after executive chairman Nicolas Cortese quit the club and was replaced by owner Katharina Liebherr. Despite claims it is business as usual, sources at the club cannot recall an incident as violent as this before. Cortese ran a disciplined ship, but his departure has created uncertainy. A spokesman said: ‘Southampton Football Club have today suspended striker Dani Osvaldo for two weeks following an incident at the club’s Staplewood training ground. ‘The club have taken swift and proper action for what we consider a breach of the conduct expected of our players.’ The Saint's a sinner: Osvaldo (left) was involved in an altercation with Jose Fonte .

Many in the Southampton squad want Pochettino to ditch Osvaldo following his attack on Fonte. Some fear Osvaldo, who is said to be not the most popular among his team-mates, will have a detrimental effect on team spirit. Osvaldo, 28, who has struggled to adapt to the Premier League, was signed from Roma in the summer for £15million. He was fined and suspended by Roma after he reportedly punched Erik Lamela, now at Tottenham, in 2011. He has already been fined £40,000 and banned for three games by the FA for his part in the chaotic scenes during Southampton’s 1-1 draw at Newcastle last month. Pochettino could look to sell him five months after his club record arrival. England striker Rickie Lambert, a target for West Ham, will now stay at St Mary’s given the doubts over Osvaldo’s future. Osvaldo was not available to comment on Thursday night . Back in 2013, Manchester City’s hugely talented, but often unpredictable striker, Mario Balotelli, came to blows with then-manager Roberto Mancini. The 22-year-old was ordered off the field for a late lunge on teammate Scott Sinclair during training. When he steadfastedly refused to leave, the City boss shoved him towards the touchline and attempted to physically drag him from the field – resulting in a scuffle, which needed the intervention of two coaching staff to bring to an end. Andy Carroll broke fellow Geordie Steven Taylor’s jaw in a fight at the Newcastle training ground, after he found out that his ex-girlfriend had been sending text messages to Taylor. Although Carroll got his comeuppance, as he was out for a spell with a hand injury, Taylor came off worse, missing the rest of the season. Notorious troublemaker Joey Barton attacked teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training session at Manchester City’s Carrington ground. Dabo claimed he was hit several times and was left ‘disfigured’ from the attack, whilst Barton was arrested and later pleaded guilty to a charge of assault. This fight was the final straw for Barton’s City career and he was swiftly sold to Newcastle. Despite this bust-up not happening on the training pitch, it deserves a special mention. Leicester teammates Dennis Wise and Callum Davidson got into an argument over a game of cards at the team hotel during pre-season training in 2002. The war of words escalated into a full on punch-up, which resulted in Wise breaking Davidson’s nose and jaw. Unsurprisingly, Wise later got the sack. A routine training game descended into chaos at West Ham when John Hartson kicked teammate Eyal Berkovic in the face. The dramatic act – caught on camera by a fan - occurred after Berko reacted angrily to the Wales striker’s attempt to simply help the Israel international back to his feet, after he had brought him down in a challenge. Berkovic was hospitalised and unable to eat for two days.","Dani Osvaldo hit with two-week ban after 'brutal' training-ground incident .

With an average cost of Â£5,000 for a breast implant operation in Britain, it's perhaps unsurprising that 43 per cent of people say they would travel abroad to have cosmetic surgery. But the risks associated with surgery abroad can be huge, as Claire Hawker, a 29-year-old beauty therapist from Reading, discovered. Hoping to get a bargain boob job, she travelled to Prague in the Czech Republic in 2009 but was left implants that became so badly infected that part of her own breast tissue was eaten away. Agony: Claire Hawker, 29, from Reading, was left in excruciating pain after a budget boob job went wrong . 'Flying to Prague, I was very confident and happy about the surgery I was going to have,' she explains. But her confidence didn't last long. On arriving at the clinic, she found that the surgeon could barely speak English and offered only a minimal consultation. 'He just said, ""What size would you like to go?"", and I said a couple of sizes bigger and I'd like an uplift. So he drew the lines and said, ""See you in an hour"". 'I did have doubts but I just wanted nice breasts and I thought it would all be fine.' But when Ms Hawker woke up from the operation, she found herself in excruciating pain. Nevertheless, a few days after surgery, she flew home - without raising the issue with her surgeon. 'I definitely felt something wasn't right . when I got on the plane,' she adds. By the time she reached home, the pain had become extreme and disaster was about to strike. Falling out: According to Claire's mother Jan, it appeared as if the infected implants were falling out . Operation: Since the botched boob job, Claire has had to have six different operations to repair her bust . 'I got them out [to show friends and family] and they all were saying, . ""Oh wow, they're so nice"" and then suddenly, this stuff started leaking . out of my left boob.' 'She pulled her top up and I'm not a . surgeon, but I'm 99 per cent sure the implants were falling out,' adds Ms Hawker's mother, Jan Coker. 'They . were green, awful, heartbreaking. I'd never seen anything so ugly.' Horrified, Mrs Coker rushed her daughter straight to hospital where she saw a plastic surgeon who immediately decided to remove the implants. With infections raging through both breasts, it took another four operations before her breasts began to heal and another two months before the wounds sealed up. 'The surgeon said, ""You could have died if you'd just ignored it,""' adds Ms Hawker. '[Afterwards], my boobs looked ugly and I just thought my whole body looked ugly... I hated it.' Beautiful: Czech capital Prague is the perfect spot for a holiday but apparently not for boob jobs . 'The moral of this story, really, is that I would caution people about going abroad to have boob jobs,' comments leading plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Dr Nick Percival. 'Most people . who go abroad know nothing about the person doing the operation and . that's very dangerous. So you might be saving money but you might have . to spend a lot more in the long run.' For Ms Hawker, the consequences of her budget boob job included uneven breasts, with the left smaller than the right after the infection ate away her breast tissue. The bungled operation also left her Â£4,000 out-of-pocket and facing the prospect of another two operations, one to even up her breasts and another to reduce the scarring. Four years on and several operations later, Ms Hawker is almost healed and insists she won't make the same mistake again. With one last operation to go, she adds: 'This is the last bit now... It's just been a roller coaster!' One that she, happily, will soon be able to get off. Claire Hawker appears on Botched Up Bodies, tomorrow night at 10pm on Channel 5 .","Claire Hawker, 29, from Reading, had a boob job in Prague in 2009 .

While out in his back yard, Alaska resident George Pierce stumbled on the remains of unusual visitor - a garter snake . Mr Pierce, from Kasilof, found the frozen, 1.5ft-long reptile out in the snow while feeding his dogs last Saturday. He was understandably baffled at how a slightly venomous snake that's normally found in much warmer climes could be so far north. George Pierce, of Kasilof, Alaska, holds the remains of a common garter snake he found in his yard . Mr Pierce said: 'It's an odd thing to find here especially this time of year. Like it fell out of the sky. Not something you see every day.' The find, however, is not as far-fetched in Alaska as some might think, Alaska Fish and Game Wildlife biologist Jeff Selinger told the Anchorage Daily News. The common garter snake is the only species of snake found in Alaska, he said. It can be found as far up as northern Canada, he said, and as far south as South America. No snakes have been recorded living in the wild in the Kenai Peninsula, according to Selinger. But he added that it doesn't mean people can't have them as indoor pets. One of two pet stores in the central peninsula went out of business last March. The only other pet store in the area is a Petco, which does not have any garter snakes in stock, according to a worker there. Pierce lives a block away from Tustemena Elementary School, the Anchorage Daily News reported. He wondered if the snake escaped from a classroom show-and-tell. Or maybe it arrived through transport from outside the state. Garter snakes in the a much sunnier part of the world . No pet snakes have been reported missing from the nearby school, according to principal Doug Hayman. Another possibility is that the snake arrived in Alaska by cargo ship, Selinger said. The snakes live off frogs and insects, he said. 'It is not out of the question one could survive here, but our harsh climate makes it difficult in the winter,' he said. The above-average temperatures in the area might have been warm enough for the snake to survive outside, but Pierce said the reptile might have been run over by his snow blower, based on a nick on the end of its tail.","Alaska resident George Pierce stumbled on it while walking his dogs .

Perhaps not, but scientists have proved what Claude Monet was doing at 4.53pm on February 5, 1883. The great French Impressionist was standing on a rocky beach in Normandy, looking at the sunset. A five-strong team of astronomers looked at the painting The Cliff, Éretat, Sunset, and used the position of the dark red setting sun to work out exactly when Monet took his inspiration. An exact science: A team of astronomers has decided Monet took the inspiration for this painting at 4.53pm on February 5, 1883. They studied the position of the setting sun compared to the needle of rock . Hard work: The team from Texas State University, including Professor Donald Olson, right, used postcard-sized copies of Monet's paintings to work out where on the Normandy beach he was standing . Art-lovers: From left, researchers Ava Pope, Laura Bright, Don Olson and Hannah Reynolds travelled to France . The work was one of three painted by Monet during a three-week stay in 1883, but the only one containing the disc of the sun. Physics professor Donald Olson, from Texas State University, said this was the crucial detail which allowed his five-strong team to date the work. He said: 'The canvas shows the orange disk of the Sun sinking toward the horizon near a spectacular line of cliffs. 'We . like to use astronomy to show students how science can solve real-world . puzzles. 'We asked, ""Could we use the dramatic rocks in . the landscape and the position of the setting sun to determine where and . when, specifically, Monet created this beautiful masterpiece?""' To start with, the researchers paced up and down the French beach to decide where Monet had stood when he took in the view. A fine art: The unusual rock formations meant the scientists could work out where Monet had stood. In this photo, they worked out the exact location of the painting known as Porte D'Amont . Iconic: This painting, The Manneporte, took in the famous Manneporte stone arch in the cliffs . They had been told where the artist was said to have stood, but they quickly realised art historians had got it wrong. Instead, using postcard-sized copies of his paintings for reference, they figured out Monet had been standing 425 yards away on a rocky beach under an overhanging cliff. Then they had to work out the date and time. They knew Monet had visited the area in winter 1883, so they used planetarium software to compare the modern sky to that of the 19th Century. With the crescent moon for reference, they discovered the sun must have set along the path depicted in the painting on February 5. Just to be sure, they checked two days on either side by combing through the artist's letters. On February 3 he was working on a different beach; on February 4 he was entertaining his brother; on February 6 the tides did not match the painting and on February 7 it was raining. Natural beauty: Monet was inspired by the cliffs and later returned to paint them in this work from 1886 . Seen by many as the greatest Impressionist, Monet showed his world in rough, wild brush strokes . Lastly, the researchers worked out what time the work was painted. They compared sunset charts to the needle-like Aiguille rock, calculating exactly when the sun would have passed the formation. Mr Olson added: 'We were going out there at low . water - it's just safer that way. 'Ava, [one of the researchers], . is accustomed to difficult hiking terrain, and she said that the . beaches near Étretat had the most difficult footing she'd ever been on . in her life. It's really tough. 'And as you get farther out, . it gets worse, because it’s slippery, with the rocks covered with . seaweed that’s still wet from the previous high tide. 'Monet went out there with all . of his painting equipment. Walking in Monet's footsteps: The team stand on the same spot where he took his inspiration . 'We . were able to determine the month, day, hour and precise . minute, accurate to plus or minus one minute, when Monet was inspired by . that beautiful scene. 'Monet observed this sunset on February 5, 1883 at 4.53pm local mean time.' The extraordinary discovery was made possible because the sun follows a slightly different path on each day of the year, because of the changing seasons. In winter it follows a short, shallow arc across the sky but in summer it rises further to the east, lifts higher in the sky and sets further to the west. The findings have been published in the latest issue of Sky & Telescope magazine by Mr Olson, a veteran of 'forensic astronomy' who has studied works by Edvard Munch, J.M.W. Turner and Vincent van Gogh.","The Cliff, Éretat, Sunset was painted during a trip to Normandy, France .

A tearful Crystal Vrooman opened up about the tragic Monday morning inferno, explaining that Tyler Doohan died trying to save his grandfather, who was his 'best friend.' The pair were found together on a bed in the back room of the charred Penfield, New york mobile home. Authorities said it appeared the child was trying to lift the elderly man off the bed when he was overcome by smoke and flames. Scroll down for video . Best friend: A tearful Crystal Vrooman, pictured, said her son, Tyler Doonhan, died trying to save his grandfather, who was his 'best friend' 'All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe, how scared he must have been, Vrooman told WHAM. She added: 'I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone.' The boy, from East Rochester, was staying with relatives in the nearby town of Penfield overnight on Sunday. Vrooman recalled hugging her son goodbye before the sleepover, and he had a big smile on his face. But after 4 a.m. Monday, Tyler noticed a fire had broken out in the narrow trailer when his 4-year-old cousin's blanket set alight. Vrooman told the station that, after waking five of his relatives and ensuring they got out safely, Tyler broke away from his aunt and ran back inside the burning trailer. Smile: Vrooman recalled hugging her son, pictured, goodbye before the sleepover with his grandfather, and he had a big smile on his face . 'He just ran to the back steps and my sister followed him and tried to stop him,' said Vrooman. The boy's grandfather, Stephen Smith, was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer said. 'By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer,' said Ebmeyer. 'Unfortunately they both succumbed to heat and smoke.' Vrooman said her sister initially had Tyler's hand when he stepped into the trailer. 'I guess he let go of her and tried to get to my dad. She opened the window and he wasn't there anymore. She started feeling around through the smoke,' she said, crying. 'It was his best friend, and he just tried to save him.' Ebmeyer said the trailer had no working smoke detector. Deadly inferno: An electrical fire engulfed Louis Beach's single-wide mobile home in the town of Penfield as nine people slept inside Sunday night . Fearless: Officials say Tyler (left) roused five of his relatives, and then ran back into the burning trailer to rescue his grandfather, pictured . He said that with so many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to survive. There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, he said. Another relative was killed in the fire along with several pets - including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters, Ebmeyer said. An . online fundraising campaign on YouCaring.com had raised more than . $46,900 as of Wednesday night for Tyler's funeral and his family. Earlier Wednesday, Cpl. John . Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said nine people were in . the single-wide mobile home when the electrical fire started around 4.45 . a.m. Monday. Fatalities: The raging blaze killed Doohan, his grandfather and amputee uncle, who were unable to flee in time . Horrific find: Tyler's body was found in the rare of the scorched home, just feet away from the bedridden family member he was trying to rescue . The Democrat and Chronicle reported . that Tyler asked his mother if he could stay with his grandfather at 39 . Fondiller Avenue because he knew he was off from school Monday for . Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, said his young nephew heard Smith calling for help inside the house and rushed in to get him. 'The . kid has got more guts than I know of,' Breyette said. 'I mean to run . back in there and go through what he went through to try to save him, . what can you say for the kid? He was a great kid.' The . child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a . few feet away from the bed of his disabled grandfather, who also . perished. The boy's relatives who managed to flee from the trailer were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital. Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher. 'He saved those other people,' he said. Safe haven: Neighbors say Louis Beach was in the habit of letting relatives who didn't have a place to live stay in his home . Makeshift memorial: Tyler's friends and members of the community have been leaving teddy bears, flowers and other tokens in honor of the brave fourth-grader . Neighbors at the trailer park said the . reason the mobile home was overcrowded with people Sunday night was . because he often welcomed down-on-their-luck relatives who needed a . place to stay. Those . who knew the family described Tyler as a rambunctious boy who liked . playing kickball and tag with other children in the area. According to his education records, the child had been in and out of several different schools over the past few years. He was currently enrolled as a fourth-grader in the East Rochester Central School District, where officials called the boy a hero this week.

Wound: Peal spent two days in the hospital recovering from a punctured lung. He posted a picture of his injury on Facebook . On his Facebook page, Peal wrote that he and his brother split a fifth of whiskey and that the bottle was already half finished by the time they arrived. When they finished that, all three men moved on to 40-ounce bottles of Mickey's Fine Malt Liquor. Apparently it was unusual for the friends to be drinking that combination of liquor. 'I normally drink Pabst,' Peal said. 'Cody doesn't drink that much.' That's when things started to get hazy. Peal remembers his brother falling asleep at one point and then going out to have a cigarette. Locked out: Clarkson allegedly locked Peal out of the apartment after stabbing him, and a neighbor had to call an ambulance for the young man . He doesn't remember the fight he got into with Clarkson but he thinks it was about noise. 'I guess I was being loud,' he said. 'And I guess Cody came downstairs with the knife and tried to shut me up.' Arrested: The men were so drunk the night of the stabbing that it took police six days to conduct their investigation and charge Clarkson with fourth-degree assault . Peal says he doesn't remember being stabbed, and only realized he was injured when he looked down and saw that his shorts were soaked with blood. That was around 3am. He didn't have his cellphone on him and Clarkson apparently locked him out of the apartment. He got help when the downstairs neighbor came out to tell him to be quiet and he told her to call an ambulance. Peal blacked out and the next thing he remembers in waking up in the ambulance. He spent the next two days in the hospital recovering from a punctured lung. That day, Peal posted on his Facebook page that he was 'In the hospital cause my so called friend Cody stabbed me in the chest and pierced my right lung'. He also shared a picture of his wound, writing: 'There's my staples. It's going to be a fancy scar with that hardware on it.' At first, Clarkson told police that he stabbed Peal in self-defense but after conducting an investigation, he was charged with fourth-degree assault. Clarkson was booked at the Washington County Jail and released soon after. He is due in court on January 30 for an arraignment. In his interview with the Oregonian, Peal said he's not ready to make peace with Clarkson. 'I'm not going to forgive anyone who's going to stab me over an argument, he said. 'That's no friend. I can't trust him.' See below for video . KPTV - FOX 12 .","Cody Clarkson, 18, confessed to stabbing his friend Teddy Peal, 21, during an interview with reporters outside his house after the attack .

Monty Python star Terry Jones has secretly married the Swedish lover he left his wife of 42 years for. Jones, 71, revealed yesterday that he tied the knot a year ago with dancer Anna Soderstrom, 30, in a ceremony attended by just five people. The couple met when she asked him to autograph a book soon after she arrived in England in 2002 to study modern languages at Hertford College, Oxford. Tied the knot: Monty Python star Terry Jones revealed that he married his Swedish girlfriend Anna Soderstrom, 41 years his junior, last year . He divorced his wife, Alison  Telfer, . last year, although he said he found the split ‘very hard’ and insists . he still loves the former biochemist. Jones, . who has a four-year-old daughter, Siri, with his new wife, said: ‘We . married last year. The divorce came through – sadly – so we got married. Low key: Jones (centre) and his bride had just five wedding guests, deciding not to ask Monty Python members John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin (right to left) ‘We kept it secret. We wanted to keep it quiet from the Press.’ Fan turned lover: Jones met Soderstrom at a book signing in Oxford when she was in her early twenties . To . keep it low key, the couple did not invite their families or the other . Pythons, he said, adding: ‘It was a very small wedding – only my . daughter and the next-door neighbours came.’ They . were married by a registrar at Highgate Literary and  Scientific . Institution near their home in North London. But he said that now he was . in his seventies, they would not be having more children, adding: ‘Anna . is cool about it – she doesn’t really want to. We think Siri is . enough.’ The Welshman . revealed that a thief raided their hotel room during their honeymoon in . Paris and stole Soderstrom’s wallet containing cards and cash. He said: . ‘We went to Paris and we got burgled in our hotel suite. We had to move . hotels. ‘There was somebody . in the room when we came back from dinner. 'Anna said she saw a hand . disappearing through the toilet door so they must have been in the room . as we went back in. 'And they must have hidden in the loo. ‘The . other hotel we moved into upped our room because they said, “We don’t . want you to think all hotels are going to be burgled”.’ Jones, . who once said his hobby was sex, reportedly had an open marriage with . Telfer, with whom he has two adult children. But his affair with a . Swedish beauty 41 years his junior proved too much for his ex-wife. Spice up their love life: About a year into their relationship Soderstrom was photographed belly-dancing, saying that she joined a university Middle Eastern dance society because Jones enjoyed sex games and role play . First wife: Jones divorced his wife of 42 years Alison Telfer (pictured together) after having an affair with Soderstrom . No more children: Jones (pictured in 1979 film Life of Brian) has a four-year-old daughter with Soderstrom . Around . a year after meeting Soderstrom, she was photographed with a . belly-dancing troupe in Oxford, having joined the university’s Middle . Eastern Dance Society, apparently because Jones enjoys role play and . wanted to spice up their love life. Anna’s . father Torbjorn Soderstrom, who is a surgeon, supports the . relationship. He said: ‘I’ve never been against it in any sort of way. ‘I’m . very fond of Terry. I’ve been a Monty Python fan since I was a kid. 'I . have no opinion on the age difference. Relationships are not about . that.’ Jones and Anna are . said to be excited about his recently-announced stage reunion with . fellow Pythons Michael Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Terry Gilliam. Jones . said that although it was billed as a one-off, it could lead to a . series of reunions for the Flying  Circus team, with another five . already rumoured. He added: ‘There’s an indefinable air that we might do more shows.’ Making a comeback: The Monty Python stars Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Carol Cleveland, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese (left to right) announced that they are reuniting for a one-off show . Dad's a fan: Soderstrom's father Torbjorn Soderstrom said that he is 'very fond' of Jones (far right during his Monty Python days) and a fan of the comedy show .","Jones married Anna Soderstrom last year at a London registry office .

Dr Michael Nixon, president and chairman of the NHS Alliance, has said certain patients should be kept out of hospital as long as possible . Hospitals are dangerous places and only the most serious cases should be treated there, GPs warned last night. In an extraordinary attack on standards of care, the leaders of Britain’s family doctors have called for a shift in the way the NHS is run to avoid a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The NHS Alliance, which represents GPs and other primary care staff, says many medical conditions could be better treated at patients’ homes. Dr Michael Dixon, president and chairman of the alliance, said: ‘Hospitals can be dangerous, particularly for older patients and those with long-conditions. There is a risk of infection and nutrition is complicated for those who cannot feed themselves. ‘We should aim to keep them out of hospital for as long as possible. ‘We need to work towards the point when acute hospital admissions should be regarded as a failure rather than a default position.’ Tens of thousands of vulnerable and elderly patients should be treated in the community, the doctors say, where they will be more safe than in hospital. The appeal follows the public inquiry into hundreds of avoidable deaths at Stafford Hospital. In the appeal, sent to The Times newspaper, the GP, along with his colleague Dr Chris Drinkwater, also said the alliance will submit a five-point plan today to the NHS Commissioning Board - the new body responsible for the health service and whose chief executive is Sir David Nicholson. Meanwhile, the health expert appointed to instil a culture of ‘zero harm’ in the NHS has said the health service can only be restored if there is a new culture that tolerates not a ‘single injury’. Professor Don Berwick, a former adviser to US president Barack Obama, says all staff should aspire to provide the ‘safest health care in the world’. ‘Assuring patient safety and high quality care is never automatic,’ he said. 'It requires the constant attention of leaders and continual support to the workforce.’ He added that he is committed to taking ‘serious and profound’ action to improve safety and that ‘there is no reason why English health care cannot aspire to be and become the safest health care in the world.’ Dr Nixon, along with his colleague Dr Chris Drinkwater, said the alliance will submit a five-point plan to the NHS Commissioning Board - the new body responsible for the health service and whose chief executive is Sir David Nicholson (pictured) The alliance has said tens of thousands of vulnerable and elderly patients should be treated in the community where they will be more safe than in hospital (file picture)","NHS Alliance chairman calls for shift in way health service is run .

"By . Bernard O'shea . PUBLISHED: . 01:50 EST, 23 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:26 EST, 23 January 2014 . Rising star: Eugenie Bouchard poses at an event during Wimbledon last year . Meet the new golden girl of tennis. Nineteen-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard has shot to stardom following her stunning performances at this year’s Australian Open tournament, and those in the know say the gifted blonde teenager has the potential to be the face of tennis for years to come. In just her fourth Grand Slam tournament, Bouchard, the 30th seed and 2012 junior Wimbledon winner, swept all before her before going down in the semi-finals. She now has her own dedicated band of supporters – known as the Genie Army – and marketers are jostling with one another to secure lucrative sponsorship deals. Her agent, Sam Duvall, has no doubts as to how far she can go – he is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world. 'She's got the personality, she's got the game, she's got the looks,' Duvall says. 'She speaks two languages [French and English] and the crossover appeal is great. Aussie fans love her, French fans love her… she is very rare, let’s put it that way.' Duvall told The Age that, in marketing terms, Bouchard had the potential to outdo glamour girl Maria Sharapova, the world’s richest sportswomen last year with earnings of $US29 million, according to Forbes magazine. Bouchard, he says, 'is the total package'. Bouchard was born on February 25, 1994, in Montreal, Canada, where she still resides. According to her profile on the Women’s Tennis Association website and her own website, she has three siblings, including a twin sister; and the family lives on the same street as former Canadian Prime Minister Brian. Her favourite singers are Justin Bieber and Jay-Z. She lists her interests as shopping, reading and swimming. Bouchard is close friends with British player Laura Robson and the pair often attend parties together. For all her popularity, Duvall stresses that Bouchard has to keep level-headed and let her tennis do the talking. 'She's one that understands that the better she plays tennis, the more money and the more marketable and the more famous she's going to be. But it's all centred around the tennis,' he says, noting that Sharapova had already won four Grand Slam titles. The last thing they want is for Bouchard to end up like 1990s icon Anna Kournikova, who was top of the marketing stakes back then but was often ridiculed because she never actually won a WTA title. Scroll down for video . On the circuit: Bouchard (left) in fancy dress with close friend British tennis player Laura Robson . Champion in the making: Though Bouchard was knocked out of the Australian Open in the semis, she is seen as a future star of the game . But already the marketers have been convinced by Bouchard’s potential. Word from her camp is that watch companies and global banks, among others, are bidding to secure marketing deals, joining the likes of Nike, her main sponsor. The fans, too, are voting their approval. The Genie Army – who are usually decked out in the red and white colours of the Canadian flag - are a visible entity in the stands when she plays, and since the tournament began barely two weeks ago she has garnered another 80,000 'likes' on her official Facebook page. Bouchard’s success at The Australian Open this year is in total contrast with last year, when she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. In 2011 and 2012, when she played in the women’s junior tournaments, she reached the semi-finals. Before the start of the 2014 tournament, she had risen to number 31 on the WTA rankings, but following her win over 14th seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in the quarter-finals, she is destined to enter the top 20 for the first time. Bouchard was bidding to become just the fourth teenager to appear in a women's Grand Slam final in the past nine years, but she fell to the fourth seed Li Na of China 2-6, 4-6 in their semi-final today. Nevertheless, the world has been put on notice: she is now a force to be reckoned with. Perks of the job: Bouchard poses with a wombat at the players' cafe in Melbourne during the Open (left) and sits at the helm of a boat on this picture posted on her Twitter account (right) Potential: The teenager is photographed with Maria Sharapova, who has made millions in sponsporship deals.

The man that Matthew McConaughey plays in Dallas Buyers Club is portrayed as a heterosexual, homophobic electrician – but he has been described variously as bisexual and even gay by those who knew him in real life. The Oscar-nominated movie tells the courageous story of Ron Woodroof, who was diagnosed with Aids in 1986 and given just six months to live, but who survived several years more after taking banned medication that he smuggled into the U.S. He set up a ‘buyers club’ in his home city of Dallas, which enabled others diagnosed with the same disease to buy medication that would help them live that bit longer, too. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Straight talking: Some who knew Ron Woodroof (left) say that he was bisexual in real life and certainly not the homophobic man he's portrayed as by Matthew McConaughey (right) in Dallas Buyers Club . He was a drug user and had many girlfriends – leaving his family unclear exactly how he contracted HIV. But the way that Woodroof, who died in 1992, is portrayed in the film as a straight man has shocked many that knew him. Woodroof’s doctor, Dr Steven Pounders, told Slate magazine: ‘I never witnessed any homophobia in the time I knew him from 1988 through his death in 1992. He fit right in the gay environment without problems. Brenda, his ex-wife, stated that he was bisexual.’ His nurse Penny Krispin told The Sunday Times that Ron was one of her ‘gay patients’ and added: ‘I never knew anyone who thought Ron was straight.’ Meanwhile, Dallas Life reporter Bill Minutaglio interviewed Woodroof and concluded that ‘he was not homophobic’. Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof in a scene from Dallas Buyers Club, which was for an Academy Award for best picture . The depiction of Woodroof as a homophobic straight man appears to have come from a series of  interviews the film’s screen-writer Craig Borten conducted with him. Borten’s press agent told Slate that during three days of chats Woodroof made multiple homophobic comments, introduced the writer to a woman he said was his girlfriend and talked graphically about anal sex with women. Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for Best Picture in 2014's Oscars and Texan-born McConaughey received his first Best Actor nod for his portrayal of Woodroof. He endured extreme dieting to make his appearance as realistic as possible. 'I’ve got a pretty full tank of energy when it comes to what we did in this film,' he told The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of his nomination. 'I’ve got a lot of stories to share. It excites me to share the story each time I talk about it. There’s always a fresh subject.

Robert De Niro has purposefully kept his private life out of the public eye for decades but now he has broken that trend by revealing all in a new documentary about his artist father. The new HBO documentary that premiered at Sundance Film Festival reveals that the reason why the legendary actor’s father left his mother when the boy was only 3-years-old was because he realized that he was gay. De Niro, who was named after his father Robert De Niro Sr, narrates much of the film and reads directly from his father’s personal journals wherein he grapples with his sexuality in a less accepting time. Son and father: Robert De Niro has produced a documentary about his father Robert De Niro Sr (right, seen together before his 1993 death) Out in the open: De Niro, seen with producing partner Jane Rosenthal (left) at Sundance on Sunday, said that he first wanted to do the film just for his family but then decided his father's artistic career was worth sharing . The two-time Academy Award winner said his father, who died in 1993 from prostate cancer, may never have resolved the issues that he had with God as he came to grips with the realization that he was gay. Robert De Niro Sr. reportedly had an amicable split from his wife, and remained a constant presence in his son’s life as they all continued living in New York City. 'I did this for him,' De Niro told the audience at the premiere in Utah on Sunday. 'I wanted my younger kids- who were born after he died- to know what their grandfather did. I even kept his painting studio intact so they could see it.' Artists: While his father (seen left, in an undated photo), who realized later in life that he was homosexual, was a painter, Robert (right) chose acting as his form of expression . Sign of the times: The elder Mr De Niro was a figurist painter, as his son is seen standing next to one the many works of art on display in international museums . De Niro has six children, four of whom were born after their grandfather died in 1993- including one who was born in 2011 via surrogate. The actor's two children from his first marriage to Diahanne Abbott- his eldest son, Raphael, and her daughter from a previous relationship that De Niro adopted- both met their grandfather. De Niro Sr. became known in some New York circles in the 1950s and 1960s for his influential work in the abstract expressionist movement. He went on to hold chaired professorships and has works displayed as part of the permanent collections at renowned museums like the Hirschorn, the Brooklyn Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art, but he never quite achieved the same level of celebrity as some of his contemporaries like Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollack. Though the documentary clearly comes two decades after his death, his son was eventually convinced that it is more than just a family story. Family affair: De Niro, seen here at the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in 2009, said that he wanted to make the film for his children who did not get a chance to meet his father (seen with three of his six children and his wife Grace Hightower) 'Originally, Bob wanted to make the film . just for his family. But then we realized it tells the story not just of . Robert De Niro's Sr.'s work- which is amazing- but the entire art world . of the time,' director Perri Peltz told The Hollywood Reporter. While Robert Sr.'s works emerged during post World War II, when abstract expressionism became popular, his style was not described in the same way. It was often considered figurist, depicting still life 'in simple set-ups with no pretension,' as described in the half-hour documentary. Paternal bond: Bradley Cooper, who has called De Niro one of his most meaningful mentors, made a low-key entrance as he slipped in to watch the premiere of the documentary at Sundance (seen together at the SAG Awards) He became increasingly disconnected from the abstract expressionist movement, inspired more by early 20th century French artists like Henri Matisse. 'He was very clear about what he thought was art and what he liked, and yet at the same time he was generous. People can appreciate things, it doesn't matter if the aesthetic can be different from yours,' De Niro told Reuters at the film's premiere. 'He didn't feel that certain things art-wise were art. It was another thing that wasn't enough for him, and his own style as you see was always the same. It varied some but not a lot.’ Though the father-son duo were close, there was a shift as De Niro's acting career took off since hist his father felt somewhat resentful that his own work had never been recognized by a bigger audience. For De Niro, the documentary, scheduled . to air on HBO this summer, serves as an homage to his father, whose . paintings are still shown in galleries around the world, and also as a . memory for his own children. 'I realized how important it is for . children to appreciate certain things (their parents) want to share with . them,' an emotional De Niro says in the film. De Niro founded the TriBeCa Film Festival in his hometown of New York City but he wanted to bring the documentary to Sundance to make sure the spotlight was fully on the works and memory of his father. 'We were really thrilled that it was chosen for Sundance because it separates from having it at Tribeca and we see Bob's father's works on its own in a different setting than you would in New York,' producer Jane Rosenthal said.","Robert De Niro produced and narrated a new documentary about his artist father who left his mother when he was only 3-years-old .

The long-awaited North American premier of Lars Von Trier’s unrated film Nymphomaniac came unexpectedly on Tuesday night in a secret Sundance Film Festival. Nearly 300 attendees packed into the Egyptian Theater in Park City, Utah despite having no clue they were about to watch the much hyped and sex-filled movie, which features actor Shia LaBeouf and has been likened to soft core pornography. While the film had viewers entranced for much of its two-hour run time, it also elicited at least one bout of unintended laughter. Scroll down for video [WARNING: GRAPHIC] . NSFW surprise! Lars Von Trier's much hyped Nymphomaniac had its North American debut in a surprise screening at the Sundance Film Festival on Tuesday . Good and bad: The controversial Danish cinema stalwart was not in attendance because he won't fly in planes and has never been to the U.S. Had he been there, he would have seen an audience entranced, but one that also laughed at moments that weren't necessarily supposed to be funny . Von Trier has a history of pushing the shock factor envelope and Nymphomaniac is no exception. Whether or not they’d heard the rumors that Tuesday’s secret screening would feature the NSFW film, viewers sat through two hours of what reviewers elsewhere in the world have described as constant nudity and explicit acts that somehow amount to an 'utterly fascinating', 'intellectual' and 'philosophically rigorous' film. Intellectual except, perhaps, for a poorly timed or overly dramatic line uttered by Stellan Skarsgard that compared the LaBeouf character’s first sexual encounter with the Joe, the film’s heroine, to the Fibonacci sequence. ‘This is what made people laugh,’ writes Steven Zeitchik of the LA Times. But the film ‘has an unexpectedly straightforward and surprisingly (if not always intentionally) comedic undertone.’ Otherwise, most in attendance agree that shock and awe are two words that aptly describe the accidental audience. Those attendees, however, did not include director Von Trier or any of the other cast members. Von Trier’s excuse is that he has a lifelong and widely reported fear of flying and has never been to the United States. Audiences were coaxed into Park City's Egyptian Theatre with no knowledge of what movie they'd been shown . As for Charlotte Gainsbourg, Uma . Thurman, Christian Slater and the rest, it remains unclear why they . shied away from the premier. The film follows the story of Joe, who retells the story of her life to an older bachelor after she is found beaten in an alleyway. LaBeouf plays Jerome, a slightly creepy womaniser, who has his eye on Stacy Martin, who plays the younger Joe. The first half of the film, which opens in the U.S. on March 21, is apparently much less explicit than the second. Surprisingly unsexy: Shia LaBeouf plays one of the hundreds of sexual partners of sex addict Joe, played by newcomer Stacy Martin . ‘LaBeouf actually keeps his clothes on most of the time (the teaser to ‘Vol. 2’ suggests otherwise) and is somewhat curiously seen by Joe as some kind of romantic ideal,’ Zeitchik writes. Nymphomanic Part 1 opened in France, Spain, Brazil and Eastern European back in December. The second half—for which LaBeouf evidently had to send photos of his male anatomy prior to being cast—opens April 18. Explicit: The film revolves around heroine Joe, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin at different ages, and largery focuses on her sexual emploits . ¿LaBeouf actually keeps his clothes on most of the time (the teaser to ¿Vol. 2¿ suggests otherwise) and is somewhat curiously seen by Joe as some kind of romantic ideal,¿ says the LA Times' Steven Zeitchik .","Volume I of the long anticipated Lars Von Trier film starring Shia LaBeouf had its North American unveiling in Park City, Utah on Tuesday night .
At least one dramatic line in the film received snickers from the high brow audience, but the 280 attendees sat 'enraptured' though the 2-hour .
The film remains unrated due to explicit sex scenes and also stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Jamie Bell and Uma Thurman and Christian Slater ."

Bill Gates has conquered the worlds of technology and philanthropy but now he has tried his hand at creating a viral video. The billionaire activist appeared on Jimmy Fallon's late night show to enlist the host's help in spreading the message of his latest analysis on the state of charitable giving by trying to get viewers to go onto his website. With the help of shutter shades, funny wigs and some auto-tuning, Gates got his message across. Scroll down for video . Helping out: Jimmy Fallon, whose show is known for their viral videos, paired up with Bill Gates to get the word out about his new essay on the myths hurting charitable giving . Strike a pose: Gates is seen wearing various wigs and using props to help entice viewers to visit GatesLetter.com . On the lead up to the annual conference featuring some of the world's wealthiest corporate giants, the Microsoft founder released a memo dispeling 'three myths' that he claims are holding back developing countries- that poverty is an endless cycle, foreign aid is a waste and saving lives leads to overpopulation. In the essay, which has its own dedicated website, he writes: 'I am optimistic enough about this that I am willing to make a prediction: by 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world. (I mean by our current definition of poor.) 'Almost all countries will be what we now call lower-middle income or richer.' Gates . said around 70 per cent of countries will have a higher per-person . income by 2035 than China does now.  Nine out of ten countries will be . above today's average income levels in India in two decades time, the . tech mogul also claims. Hot ending: The video concludes with Bill-as-a-chicken breathing fire at the screen . All for the cause: Gates took a Brady Bunch-approach to spreading the word about his site . However he admits that some countries . will be held back by war and politics, citing North Korea as an example. Geography will also hinder certain nations like the landlocked states . of central Africa. Despite his optimistic take on the world, Gates admits that inequality will exist in every region. The tycoon bases his theory on statistical data which shows that in 1960, income per person in the U.S. was roughly $15,000. By comparison, 50 years ago the average income in Brazil was $1,982, China $928 and Botswana $383. Today, . China's income per person has increase by eightfold and India's has . quadrupled; Brazil's has gone up five times and Botswana has seen an . incredible 30-fold increase in earnings. Bill Gates uses global infant mortality rates to show the vast improvements in the lives of people in developing countries . The wealthy disparity has decreased in the past 50 years, seeing more than a billion people rise from extreme poverty . The Gates report points out that although the percentage of very poor people has dropped by more than half since 1990, there is still one billion people existing in extreme poverty. With a lot of work still to do, Gates nevertheless says that there are improvements for people across the world which are undeniable. He writes: 'There is a class of nations in the middle that barely existed 50 years ago, and it includes more than half of the world’s population.' Bill Gates has donated $28 billion to the . Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which funds projects across the . world in agriculture, education and health. The foundation is committed to improving the lives of people in Third World countries.

A mystery that has eluded the family of a Minnesota cancer victim for nearly 20 years is on its way to being solved thanks to internet sleuths. On Monday Janna Holm posted images of two index cards, covered in a seemingly unbreakable code, that her grandmother, Dorothy Holm, had written just weeks before her death in 1996. Less than 15 minutes later the code was on its way to being solved after a web user spotted a possible method to the madness of jumbled letters. Mystery: The back of one of the index cards appears to be the first letters of each word of the Lord's Prayer . Final thoughts: Dorothy Holm wrote the coded index cards before her death in 1996 . When she posted pictures of two of the index cards on Metafilter, Ms Holm, who works at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, explained her grandmother had lost her ability to speak when she wrote them. Ms Holm said the family had been trying to find meaning in the jumble of letters that covered 20 index cards ever since her grandmother died from a brain tumor. 'My cousins and I were between 8-10 years . old at the time, and believed she was leaving us a code. We puzzled over . them for a few months trying substitution ciphers, and didn't get . anywhere,' she wrote. The family's best guess had been that the letters were perhaps lyrics to songs, but shortly after images of the cards were circulated online, a user known as harperpitt suggested they were prayers. After suggesting a sequence of triple As on the card could represent 'Amen Amen Amen', harperpitt and another user, jessamyn, cracked part of the code, pointing out that the letters matched the Lord's Prayer. 'Holy cow! 14 minutes to solve the . back of the card that has been bugging my family for 20 years! That is . amazing!' Ms Holm wrote. Once . the theory behind the letters was revealed, web sleuths set about . cracking other parts of the index card, which showed what appeared to be . a personal prayer. 'It was kind of relieving to have an answer, even if we don’t know what every single word says,' Ms Holm said. 'It’s . nice to know that they were prayers, and kind of gave some insight into . what she was thinking and what she was focused on in her last couple . weeks.' Solved: Janna Holm says the cards had puzzled her family for years . Comfort: Janna says it was relieving to know what had been on her grandmother's mind . She added that her grandmother hated being in the spotlight 'so she would totally hate all of this [attention],' but Ms Holms told Mashable that she was grateful the mystery had been solved. The family had almost forgotten about the cards until Ms Holms's father found one of them again, sparking the curiosity of what they had meant. Ms Holms was just 11 when her grandmother died. Dorothy Holms, who lived in Shakopee, was diagnosed with lung cancer that formed a brain tumor. The kindly grandmother, who was married to a Second World War submariner, 'never flew in a plane and never drove a car (scared of both), and hated having her photo taken,' she remembered. But she was always ready with a stash of coloring books and crayons for when her grandchildren visited,' Ms Holm said. In her final weeks, Dorothy Holm wrote line after line of capital letters on about 20 index cards, sparking her the curiosity of her grandchildren. Ms Holm said that she, her brother and two cousins - ranging in age from 8 to 12 - spent a few months trying to figure out what the letters stood for, but failed. The associate director at Johns Hopkins has offered more details about her family, and gave their initials, in the hope that a message for them may be contained in the prayer. Hidden message: Janna Holm posted this picture of one of her grandmother's index cards online to see if anyone could break the code . 'As for first initials, my family's show up in one string (TVJE is my parents, myself and my brother), but no one else seems to. Her husband's initial was L, but he goes by a nickname starting with B,' she wrote. 'Her children are G, T and J. Her daughter G is unmarried with no children. Her son T is married to V and has J & E as children. And her daughter J is married to M and has L & E as children.' A large portion of the card has been solved, but code-breakers are still needed to complete the puzzle.

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development officials are probing the use of $4.7 million of hurricane rebuilding funds on the self-congratulatory tourism ads. Christie is already under fire in his home state following revelations that at least four of his aides and political appointees were involved in a scheme to manipulate traffic patterns leading to the massive George Washington Bridge in order to bring gridlock to a New Jersey town as punishment to its mayor, who refused to back Christie's re-election.

Thursday for his administration's role in the scandal and fired two . long-time confidantes, while insisting that he had no involvement in the . plot and no knowledge of it ahead of time. Two other officials linked . to the saga resigned in December. Nearly $5 million in Superstorm Sandy rebuilding funds paid for the 'Stronger Than The Storm' media campaign, which included brief cameos by Christie and members of his family. At least another $25 million was spent on buying air time for the campaign. [related . Federal . investigators are trying to determine if laws were broken when a . politically connected advertising firm won the contract to produce the . ads, despite proposing a budget more than $2 million more than the next . highest bidder – whose scripts did not include the Christie family. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, an Obama appointee, presides over the agency investigating the Sandy recovery grant -- but he praised Christie's ads at the time they weer first broadcast . East Rutherford, N.J.-based MWW and a subcontractor billed the state $4.7 million to run this year’s campaign. Another firm offered to do it for $2.5 million. The governor's administration determined how to parcel out the federal dollars once they reached the state capital. Christie critics in both major parties have complained, including one Democratic rival who has the ear of the Obama administration.] . New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone asked HUD's inspector general in August to examine look into how Christie chose to spend the marketing money the federal agency approved. Pallone told CNN that the IG's preliminary review found enough evidence to mount a more thorough, months-long investigation into whether federal dollars were misused. A HUD official confirmed that the preliminary investigation took place, but wouldn't discuss its findings with MailOnline. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, however, defended the ads during a November 2013 hearing on Capitol Hill. The Daily Caller reported that Donovan called his agency's Community Development Block Grant 'a very flexible program.' The ads, he said, were 'clearly within the legal boundaries of what Congress has determined the program can be used for.' Christie also attracted slings and arrows from Sen. Rand Paul in November. The gang's all here: Mary Pat Christie, the first lady of New Jersey, made a cameo in one of the ads under investigation . The series of ads cost $4.7 million in labor costs and cost-overruns from a politically connected New Jersey firm and its subcontractors, but another company bid $2.5 million . Federal investigators at the Department of Housing and Urban Development want to know if Christie can be held responsible for wasting hurricane relief dollars that could have been spent elsewhere in his state . U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, asked HUD in Washington to look into the legality of using federal disaster relief funds for a Christie promotion stunt instead of rebuilding homes destroyed by Sandy . Apology accepted: Fort Lee, New Jersey Mayor Mark Sokolich was targeted for political retribution with a plot to slow bridge-bound traffic in his town to a crawl . The Kentucky Republican carped to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan in a Senate hearing that the campaign funded 'ads that included somebody running for political office. I'm thinking there might be a conflict of interest there. That's a real problem. ... when people are trying to do good and trying to use the taxpayer's money wisely, they're offended to see our money spent on political ads. That's just offensive.' Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who hopes to be the GOP presidential nominee two years from now, slammed Christie over the ads last year . At the time, the Center for Public Integrity's top watchdog, Bill Buzenberg, told USA Today that Christie's two-second cameos in the TV ads were no big deal. 'I can't say it's unethical,' Buzenberg said, 'because it's not unusual for a governor to be involved in a tourism campaign. When you drive into a state, you see the welcome signs with the governor's picture. The pictures are usually bigger in an election year.' The George Washington Bridge scandal, dubbed 'Bridgegate' – although 'Tollgate' might be more apropos – is threatening to derail Christie's future political career at a time when he's considering whether to run for president in 2016. The Deputy Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, Democrat John Wisniewski, predicted on Sunday that 'if it becomes known that the governor was involved and he knew about it and he knew about the cover-up, and he was approving the actions taken by his senior staff, that raises serious questions that the assembly ought to look at.' 'And that ought to be considered in light of what our responsibility is. The Assembly has the ability to do articles of impeachment.' The latest trouble for Christie comes on top of the George Washington Bridge scandal, which already threatens to derail any hope he has of claiming the presidency in 2016 .","$4.7 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development paid for a post-Sandy ad campaign touting New Jersey's recovery .

A Florida jury in the mail and immigration fraud trial of a Brazilian-born former professional race car driver could end up seeing much more of the defendant than they probably bargained for. If 43-year-old Rogerio Scotton - who is acting as his own attorney - gets his way, jurors will be forced to watch sex tapes he made with his wife. Scotton has introduced the X-rated evidence as proof that his relationship with his Cuban-born wife - who is now an American citizen - isn't a sham marriage for immigration purposes. 'Porn star': Rogerio Scotton wants jurors to watch sex tapes he filmed with his wife to prove it wasn't a sham marriage . Scotton, who lived in Boca Raton before his March 2012 arrest, has been charged with 27 counts of mail fraud and two counts of lying to immigration authorities. Authorities say Scotton was behind a multimillion-dollar mail-fraud ring that scammed shipping companies like FedEx, UPS and DHL by creating fake accounts that fraudulently billed retail giants like Target, WalMart and Apple for millions of dollars. According to his indictment, Scotton's online business sold electronics to customers in Brazil. Authorities say he used the phony accounts to ship purchases overseas. Scam: Scotton is accused of stealing millions of dollars from companies like Target and WalMart . Scotton is only now representing himself after having falling outs with six defense attorneys who previously represented him. He maintains that he is innocent of all the charges filed against him and feels that showing photographs and videos of he and his wife engaged in what U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenbaum described as 'some very intimate acts' will prove that the relationship is legit. After Scotton asked to play the videos for the jury, Rosenbaum scheduled a hearing to determine whether it would be legally appropriate to show the videos to a jury. Rosenbaum told Scotton that she isn't going to just 'play that stuff in front of the jury and see what's on there' without first viewing it herself, according to Sunsentinal.com. 'I don't think that it would be fair to your wife,' Rosenbaum told Scotton, emphasizing that she needs to make sure that he gets a fair trial without violating his wife's privacy unnecessarily. Fool as a client: Scotton is representing himself at trial after falling outs with six defense attorneys . 'Why is the privacy of my wife important at this point?' Scotton asked the judge. 'I'm facing jail time.''[Let's] see if we can figure out a less intrusive way to prove the same thing,"" Rosenbaum responded. Rosenbaum ordered Scotton - who has been in police custody for more than 22 months - to turn the videos and photographs over to prosecutors to see if they could come to a diplomatic understanding in regards to his relationship with his wife without playing sex tapes featuring her. Scotton, who once competed in the Miami Grand Prix and other NASCAR events, maintains that he has not committed any crimes.","Rogerio Scotton is accused of stealing millions of dollars from companies like Target and WalMart .

The number of married couples with children has reached a record low, census data suggests . The number of married couples with children has reached a record low, official figures show. There are around four million such families, census data for the whole of the UK shows. That is 15.2 per cent of families, or 300,000 fewer than a decade ago. It is also 600,000 fewer than Office for National Statistics estimates. The news comes at a time of increasing concern over instability within families and the impact on children of family break-up. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is conducting a review of family stability which will gather information on how families are changing, which types of family are most at risk of failing, and what the state can do to keep them together. Pro-marriage groups have told the inquiry the Coalition’s efforts to shore up marriage – including a tax break worth up to £200 a year to lower income married couples – are too little and may be too late. The figures, gathered in the spring 2011 census and published yesterday, also show the number of people who live by themselves is at its highest recorded level. There were 4,017,793 households of married couples with children under 16, or under 18 if they were still in school or college. That number has fallen by more than 300,000 since the 2001 census, when there were 4,323,069 married couples with dependent children. That is despite rapid population growth in the intervening years, with the number of people living in Britain rising by 3.7million, partly as a result of immigration. The most recent census found there were 1,053,397 homes of cohabiting couples with children, and 1,895,833 homes with one  parent and children, adding up to nearly three million households. The ONS Labour Force Survey, which takes a smaller sample of homes to generate annual estimates of how households are made up, said there were around 4,610,000 married couples with children last year – higher by 600,000 than the census. ONS officials said it was difficult to . compare the figures and that census results may be lower because they do . not account for families who share homes. Experts consider married families the most stable - and say cohabiting couples are three times more likely to break up than married people . Critics fear a lack of advantages for married couples and tax and benefit losses for those who share homes are discouraging married families. Eight million people live on their own, the most ever recorded, census data shows. Nearly a third of homes, 31 per cent, have a single occupant. Some 8.1million people lived alone at the time of the census in 2011. Analysts said one reason was a trend for couples not to live together. More than a million couples live apart, and experts suggested some are motivated by a system of tax and benefits that rewards single claimants while penalising couples and married people. In 2001, 7.4million people lived alone, just over 30 per cent of households. Researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘It is genuinely shocking that the benefits system continues to carry disincentives to people to live together as couples and families.’ Some analyses have shown that a couple could be £100 a week better off by choosing to live in two homes. Experts consider married families the most stable, with cohabiting couples breaking up three times more quickly than married people. Harry Benson, of think-tank the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘There is a couple penalty on all partners who share a home. It can cost parents with one child up to £7,100 per year in lost tax credits the moment they move into together. ‘So the Government is incentivising couples not to commit.’ He said the Government spends huge amounts on problems tied to family breakdown, including juvenile delinquency and truancy. He added: ‘The effects of family instability in early years are felt  decades later. Nearly half of  teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are not living with both of their parents.’ The census also showed Britain is an increasingly integrated society. Nearly one in eight households contain people who are from different ethnic backgrounds. While 88 per cent of homes, or 16.1million, are made up people of the same race and culture, some 2.3million, 12 per cent, are mixed.","About 15.2 per cent of families consist of a married couple with children .

It now stocks Jane Asher baking equipment, Duchy Originals tea, nail varnish, and National Trust bird seed. Bargain hunt: A record number of middle class shoppers flocked through the doors of Poundland over Christmas in a bid to cut rising household bills . It is the latest discounter to see a flood of well-heeled bargain hunters gracing its aisles as data shows that as many as 50.1per cent of British households shop at discounters Aldi or Lidl. In the past, middle class shoppers had turned their noses up on the rising tide of budget chains, but changed their minds in these more straitened economic times, attracted by a raft of award winning products. But the firm said there had been a ‘further broadening appeal of Poundland’s offer’ with the ‘AB demographic’ – the highest earning categories of people – now representing 22per cent of its customer base. This helped drive record festive trading with sales up 12.4per cent to £348.8million in the 13 weeks to 31 December 2013 compared to the same period last year. Success: Sales were up 12.4per cent to £348.8million in the 13 weeks to 31 December 2013 compared to the same period last year . Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘This is a high for us. There has been a shift in shopping behaviour generally. Over the past five years the economic challenge has meant customers have become accustomed to shopping for value. ‘Now there is a very positive feeling in a discounter when you save money rather than any stigma. It bodes well for the good times - when shoppers have confidence they tend to spend a little more.’ McCarthy said the business has been stocking more premium products including healthy nuts, hair accessories and a nail bar. It has also sold gold buggy battery chargers in the past and its own lable milk chocolate. In November Poundland opened its 500th store, in Birmingham and the business now trades from 517 Poundland and Dealz stores.

A mother-to-be was diagnosed with terminal cancer just a few weeks after discovering she was pregnant. Emma Grandison, 31, was delighted when she was told she was expecting her first child with her husband, Ian, last June. But the couple's joy soon turned to heartbreak after Mrs Grandison was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer. Emma Grandison (pictured with her husband, Ian, and baby Erin) was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer just weeks after learning she was pregnant with her first child . Ms Grandison, from Preston, was told that without chemotherapy her life expectancy was as little as six months. She was left with no choice but to risk starting chemotherapy while she was pregnant, and baby Erin was delivered 15 weeks early on November 5 - she weighed just 1lb 10oz. Erin is still in the neonatal unit at the Royal Preston Hospital 80 days after she was born but is making good progress - her due date was actually February 16 this year. Her mother has vowed to fight the disease. She said: ‘I have my bad days, but I always look for the golden nugget in every day. There is always something that makes me smile. ‘Today is a good day, I am not in pain, my medication is working, I've started a brand new drug. They are doing everything to keep me going. A scan revealed she had bowel cancer which had spread to her liver and was now not cureable . Mr and Mrs Grandison became engaged shortly after her diagnosis and they were married three weeks later . ‘I have always loved a challenge, I just see this as a challenge. ‘I have always surprised myself by what I can do. This is a curve ball that I would never have expected to happen to me but it is happening. ‘You can either sit in the corner and cry or get on with it. I've got a baby, a new husband, a new home, what is there not to fight for?’ She added: ‘Becoming a wife, mother and dealing with my diagnosis in such a short space of time has been very surreal. ‘Marrying Ian was the most perfect day and becoming a mother I wouldn't change in the world, the added challenge of cancer is unfortunate but it's one bad thing in my life off-setted by all the other amazing things I have going on. Erin was born 15 weeks early weighing just 1lb 10oz and three months later is still in hospital . Mrs Grandison was initially told she has six months to live without chemotherapy or two years with it . ‘Why focus on the one bad thing? Someone has to beat the odds, why can't it be me? I have everything to live for and fight for. ‘I was originally told I wouldn't survive Christmas without chemo, with chemo two years. ‘These are just numbers to me. I think having a positive attitude and a glass half full attitude can only benefit me and those amazing people around me. ‘Doctors tell me they don't know where I get my strength from, that's easy: my rock that is my husband, and my own little inspirational fighter, my daughter Erin. ‘I've got my fight, she's got hers... like I said, I have everything to live for.’ Mrs Grandison said: 'I have my bad days, but I always look for the golden nugget in every day. There is always something that makes me smile' Mrs Grandison, who works in health and safety, started to suffer pains in her side in early pregnancy. She went to see her doctor who ordered a scan as he thought she might have gallstones. Shockingly, the scan revealed her liver was riddled with tumours. She was diagnosed with bowel cancer which had spread to her liver and become terminal. She said: ‘I had been getting a pain in my side. Normally I wouldn't go to the doctors, I would just have a stiff upper lip, but because I was pregnant I was a bit more mindful. ‘On doing a scan (for gallstones) they found loads of tumours in my liver. It was bowel cancer primarily but my liver was riddled. ‘I couldn't comprehend it at the time. It didn't feel real. I felt like I was in a soap.’ Erin is still in hospital but she is gaining strength and it is hoped she will soon be able to go home . Mr Grandison proposed to Emma shortly after her diagnosis last year and three weeks later they were married in a ceremony organised by close friends. The pair had always planned to get married but Mrs Grandison's diagnosis meant that plan was brought forward. Mrs Grandison is currently having chemotherapy once every two weeks and she says the one thing that really scares her is not seeing her daughter grow up. She describes her husband, 31, who she has been with for three and a half years, as her pillar of strength. She said: ‘He is my rock.’ A group of 22 of the couple’s friends are currently raising money for Cancer Research UK by not drinking alcohol throughout January. So far they have raised more than £5,000. To help them raise funds visit their Just Giving page.","Emma Grandison developed a pain in her side when she was pregnant .

The recovery is bearing fruit for ordinary families, David Cameron said last night, as official analysis showed wages rose faster than inflation for 90 per cent of people last year. The Prime Minister said there was positive economic news on both employment and take-home pay. Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney reassured mortgage-holders that there is no immediate need to increase interest rates. Government analysis of Office for National Statistics data found working families’ pay rose a third faster than inflation in the year to April 2013. The bottom half of earners did best, with take-home pay rising three-quarters faster than the CPI rate of inflation. The bottom 90 per cent saw take-home pay rise faster than inflation, but for the richest 10 per cent, it fell in real terms. The analysis is likely to attract charges of complacency from Labour, who say vulnerable families are disproportionately hit by rising energy bills and high food prices. Ministers argue low interest rates and an increase in the amount that can be earned tax-free, to £10,000, have helped to shield working people. The tax-free allowance rose from £8,105 in 2012-13 to £9,440 in 2013-14, taking 1.2million earners out of income tax. It is due to rise to £10,000 in April. The Prime Minister, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said there were signs living standards were finally improving. He said: ‘We saw this week the largest increase in employment in one quarter since records began – 1.3million more people in work than when I became Prime Minister. 'Not only have we got more jobs but we’re also cutting taxes, so we are seeing some positive signs in terms of take-home pay. But it’s going to take time and we need to be patient.’ Mr Cameron said the UK must deal with ‘problems that we had before the recovery’ such as the deficit and the banking system. He said that Britain must ‘rebalance our economy and make sure it’s a recovery for all, north and south, for manufacturing as well as services, to make  sure the poorest people in our country benefit’. Bank of England governor Mark Carney reassured mortgage-holders that there is no immediate need to increase interest rates . Mr Carney, also in Davos, told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘Inflation’s back on target – 300,000 jobs, private sector, created in the last quarter measured. ‘One of the strongest-growing, at the moment, economies in the advanced world. It feels pretty good from where I sit.’ He said the case for an interest rate rise would be examined in next month’s inflation report.On Wednesday, the jobless rate fell to 7.1 per cent, close to Mr Carney’s 7 per cent target for a rise. But he said he would look at the whole labour market, not one indicator, and any rise would be ‘very gradual’. The base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Business and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘As a consequence of the Great Recession, people who work hard have been made poorer. ‘That’s why, as part of our long-term economic plan, we are cutting taxes for hardworking people . . . Last year, our tax cuts meant people’s take-home pay rose faster than prices.’","Prime Minister said there was positive economic news on both employment and take-home pay .

Sheryl Sandberg now has even more reason to keep leaning in after a record Facebook closing stock price took the 44-year-old's fortune past the billion dollar mark. The Menlo Park, California-based company's stock surged Tuesday before closing at $58.51. As COO, Sandberg owns 12.3 million shares, 4.7 million stock options as well as other stock awards. Thanks to her investment prowess, shrewd business sense and with the help of her million-selling book Lean In, Sandberg is now part of a rarefied club of billionaire women across the globe. Billionaire: Sheryl Sandberg officially became a billionaire on Tuesday when shares of the social media company hit a record $58.51 . Sandberg's stock shares alone were worth about $720 million as the market closed Tuesday. According to Forbes, there were just 138 total billionaires on Earth last year among 1,426 all told. Even among the world's richest women, Sandberg's achievement is a rare one. Only 24 of the billionaire women on the Forbes list are self-made. Her age is also significant. At 44, she can now count herself among the world's youngest female billionaires. In addition to the $300 million in Facebook stock Bloomberg reports she's sold since the company's initial public offering in May 2012, she was that year's highest paid woman with earnings of $26.2 million. Record breaking: A chart of the Facebook stock price shows it rise from disastrous beginnings in May 2012 to Tuesday's record close at $58.51 . Accomplished author: While her Facebook stock was enough to put her over the billion dollar mark on Tuesday, she'd already given herself a healthy nudge since publishing the best-selling Lean In last year . She became a feminist darling last year with the publication of her book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, the million or so of which she sold could hardly have hurt her on the road to a billion. Though Sandberg clearly works hard and has children to raise with husband David Goldberg, she still finds time to splurge on the finer things in life. In August, MailOnline exclusively revealed the newly minted billionaire's new $11 million Silicon Valley home. Family woman: Sandberg shot to notoriety after publishing the bestselling Lean In last year, which urges women to embrace working life and family life . Her 9,210 square foot home features a living roof similar to the one planned for the social media giant's new building. Solar panels adorn the roof - which has a grass area- and much of the building is hidden underground in a huge basement. Designed by San Francisco firm Dumican Mosey Architects, the basement houses a wine room, gym, movie theater, office and guest bedroom. The exterior is cramped into space but a basketball court and hoop sits alongside the structure, presumably for her two young children, a boy, seven and girl, five.

Complete with sparkling lights spelling out the house number, the property has several parking places and a large garage at the front. Bedrooms on the second floor have large windows which face onto the leafy road that is one of Menlo Park’s most exclusive addresses.

Mr Redding, who was also an amateur musician and talented guitar player, disappeared beneath the water when he was half way across. His worried friends called 999 and his body found was found by a police diver the following morning. Devastated work colleagues told a coroner how they had been out drinking in Henley-on-Thames, after 11pm on July 26 last year. Mr Redding, who was described as a 'loveable rogue' by his heartbroken mother following his death, worked at an Audi car branch in Reading, Berkshire. He and a dozen work mates had gone to the The Angel on the Bridge public house in Henley and drank several pints of strong lager, before going to eat a curry and consume more drinks - including a bottle of champagne - at the Spice Merchant restaurant in the town. The group returned to The Angel on the Bridge, where they ordered more beers and a round of Tequila shots before the bet was made while they were in the riverside pub’s beer garden. 'We were outside for a while when the topic of conversation came up about how much it would cost for someone to swim across the river,' said Audi salesman Lee Allum in a statement read out at Oxford Coroner’s Court today. The Audi car sales executive died after he stripped down to his boxer shorts and tried to swim across the fast-moving River Thames . He said: 'About £200 was put on the table for a bit of fun. I’m not exactly sure how much money was on the table but it was taken back quite quickly. 'Peter is a very determined person. When he gets something in his head, he doesn’t let it go.' Mr Allum said Mr Redding 'walked off' and someone told him they had seen him undressing on the bridge before entering the water. He went to the bridge and got out his mobile phone to film his co-worker taking on the challenge and said: 'I could see Peter was half-way across. I moved along the bridge to get a better place. Peter Redding was celebrating a successful week of sales at the pub before he died . 'I could see Peter. I got my mobile phone out and started to record Peter. He seemed to still be swimming but he was getting nowhere. 'He looked like he was struggling. I called out to him but there was no response.' Mr Redding soon disappeared from view and his colleagues began to worry for his safety, Mr Allum said. 'Another person had come to the top of the bridge and said, ""Lee, there’s no sign of Peter.' Another colleague, Ross Ford, told the coroner: 'When we were looking into the river, I couldn’t see him. I called the emergency services. 'I couldn’t see anything. The river was clam and I couldn’t see any ripples or anything.' Mr Redding’s body was found by police diver PC Mark Rodham shortly after 9am the following morning. The inquest was attended by Mr Redding’s mother Teresa Beddis, aged 62 years who had the grim duty of identifying her son’s body. A pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination on Mr Redding’s body concluded he had drowned. Also at the hearing was Mr Redding’s long-term girlfriend Rachel Weyl, aged 45 years. He treated her daughter Abbey, aged nine years, as one of his own. Miss Weyl sobbed as Oxfordshire assistant coroner Nicholas Graham recorded an accidental death verdict. The coroner said: 'This was simply an accident. It was an unintended consequence of his actions. It does not imply any liability to anybody. 'I’m satisfied on the evidence that on the night of July 26, Mr Redding had consumed alcohol with his friends, and drowned when he attempted to swim across the Thames.' Speaking after the hearding his mother, Mrs Beddis said: 'Peter’s death was a tragedy but he lived his life to the full and has left us with some wonderful friends and memories.' At his funeral in August, his mother paid tribute to her son as a ‘loveable rogue' and that he had made her 'very proud.' He had a disabled brother David, who died aged when he was aged six years. He also left behind his sister Cara Redding, aged 26 years. Mr Redding got his first guitar aged eight years old and played in a number of bands in Reading, Berks. He had held a donor card since he was 16 and his retinas and heart valves were used in transplant operations for babies and children. Speaking at his funeral, Mrs Beddis said: 'He will go on as part of someone else’s life and for that I’m grateful. The boy who left at 17 turned into a man who made me very proud.' She also told how he relished the opportunity to play a big role in bringing up Miss Weyl’s nine-year-old daughter Abbey. 'He loved Rachel and told me on many occasions how happy he was,' she said.

Aspirational: Iain Duncan Smith said Conservatives should be less 'hateful' when speaking to voters . Iain Duncan Smith has said that the Tories need to stop their 'finger-wagging' and be more positive about what they stand for. The Work and Pensions Secretary went on to say he agreed with Treasury minister Nicky Morgan who has argued that the Conservatives should be less ‘hateful’ and more ‘aspirational’ when speaking to voters. And he insisted his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor, but prompting a ‘positive life change’. Mr Duncan Smith even likened his zeal for overhauling welfare to the crusade to end slavery, comparing himself with the great abolitionist William Wilberforce and the Victorian social reformer, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. He said reforming the benefits system was ‘part of our party’s historic mission. ‘Shaftesbury and Wilberforce were people who faced a massive problem, a social problem, and saw only the need to change it, and embarked on that change against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age, and the results you can see were massive and transformational,’ he said. Like them, Mr Duncan Smith added, he wanted to ‘put hope back where it has gone, to give  people from chaotic lives security through hard work, helping families improve the quality of their own lives’. He backed comments earlier this week by Mrs Morgan that the Conservatives needed to change their ‘language and tone’. She told a think-tank that Tories too often say that, 'we’re anti this, we’re anti-that, we don’t like them, we don’t want them here'. The Loughborough MP added: 'If we talk about what we hate all the time, we’re not talking about what we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well in setting up businesses or making our schools the best. 'We never say actually we are on the side of these people, we want this to happen and we think this  is great.' Mission: Iain Duncan Smith insists his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor, such as those featured on Channel 4's Benefits Street (pictured), but were instead designed to prompt 'positive life changes' Asked if he agreed, Mr Duncan Smith told Radio 4’s The World at One: 'Yes, absolutely. The last thing that politicians and others should do is to be judgmental. 'I’m in favour of talking about what we believe will improve life, not always finger-wagging.' In a speech to the Centre for Social Justice, a think-tank he set up in opposition, Mr Duncan Smith said people should stop disapproving of benefit claimants – 'our fellow citizens' – and instead blame politicians for  creating a system that consigned them to the 'twilight world' of state dependency. 'Casual disapproval of those on benefits is also too easy,' he added. 'It does us as politicians well to remember that it was generations of politicians that created this welfare system that now traps them.' He later said his speech had been trying to emphasise that  people had been 'locked away' from 'productive life' by the benefits system. The number of workless households had fallen by 18 per cent under the Coalition, while there were fewer people who were economically inactive than in the last two decades, he added. Labour's work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: 'This is no time for self-congratulatory speeches from Iain Duncan Smith. His time would be better spent getting a grip of his lamentable policies and the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money he is needlessly wasting.' TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms have led to elderly and disabled people being kicked out of their homes for failing to pay the hated bedroom tax, while dying cancer sufferers have faced benefit sanctions for not finding work. 'To compare this Government-directed cruelty to the abolition of slavery is frankly offensive'","Work and Pensions Secretary said Conservatives should be less 'hateful'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:22 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:02 EST, 22 January 2014 . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's recent spate of scandals are troublesome enough to get in the way of his mission as chairman of the powerful Republican Governors Association, former Virginia attorney general and losing 2013 gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday. The RGA controls a $150 million purse collected to help Republicans win governor's races. Christie has the group's reins for a one-year term. Cuccinelli referred to Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal and claims that his administration used Hurricane Sandy relief dollars as political leverage, telling CNN that it 'makes sense' for him to step down. 'I think just from the perspective of – setting aside this as an issue in other races, it makes sense for him to step aside in that role,' Cuccinelli said. 'He does not serve the goals of that . organization by staying as chairman. And that doesn’t mean any of the . charges, political or otherwise, are substantive or not. It doesn’t . matter. Perception is reality.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ken Cuccinelli came up short in his bid to be Virginia's governor, and now he's lashing out at Chris Christie, saying the scandal-plagued New Jersey pol should resign his chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association . Christie began his second term as New Jersey's chief executive on a snowbound Tuesday, while new questions swirl around his fitness to lead the GOP's group tasked with electing more Republican governors . Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli in a squeaker. He was U.S. President Bill Clinton's fundraising leader in the 1990s . Cuccinelli lost his bid to be Virginia's governor by less than 67,000 votes after closing a 10 per cent gap in the race's last weeks, bringing insiders to carp that the election was winnable but underfunded. The RGA spent $8 million helping Cuccinelli, but choked off ad-buy dollars down the stretch. Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the state's new governor, spent heavily on TV ads in the closing weeks of the contest. On election night, Republicans carped at Christie for pulling out of Virginia while the RGA continued to lavish $1.7 million more to cement Christie's landslide win. 'I heard from one Republican source who said, ""Where was Chris Christie?""' reported NBC's Chuck Todd from a McAuliffe's victory party. 'Apparently some senior conservative Republicans reached out to Christie and asked him to come down to Virginia and campaign for Cuccinelli and Christie said no. ... A lot of Cuccinelli supporters are a little bit bitter right now looking at the result, thinking, ""What if?""' CROSSFIRE: Cuccinelli took the bait when liberal commentator Van Jones asked if Christie should be bounced from the RGA . Christie (center-left) is beginning his second term in Trenton, N.J. while scandals and new investigations surround him, including an accusation that he ordered his lieutenant governor to use Superstorm Sandy federal relief dollars as bargaining chips so a commercial development would go forward . Ken Cuccinelli's camp believed that Christie could have won the race for them if he had shown up in person to campaign in Virginia -- and that the RGA torpedoed them by stopping the flow of money in the race's crucial final weeks . A bitter Cuccinelli reminded CNN's audience on Tuesday that the fallout from Christie's 'Bridgegate' is just beginning to settle. 'Frankly, I think this is still relatively new and he may well step down' from the RGA,' he said. 'I have no idea what his thinking is on that. And he may get some counsel from some other governors along those lines.' Chris Christie took over the Republican Governors Association chairmanship after the 2013 election, but Cuccinelli blames him for not showing up in person to campaign in Virginia . The RGA itself did not respond to a request for comment. But long-time Christie adviser Mike DuHaime told the Associated Press that Cuccinelli's comments were 'disappointing, given the RGA was by far the largest single donor to his losing campaign, giving more than $8 million — a significant portion of which was raised by Gov. Christie.' The embattled New Jersey Governor is already using his position in the RGA as a platform to raise money for Republicans in states that will be critical to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Christie is expected to announce a run for president by the middle of next year. In the early days of the bridge scandal, centered on Christie aides who allegedly arranged for a traffic jam leading to the George Washington Bridge as revenge against a Democratic mayor in nearby Fort Lee, N.J., the RGA issued a strong statement of support for its leader. 'Governor Christie apologized to the people of New Jersey, the people of Fort Lee and to the members of the New Jersey legislature.' the group said. 'He made it clear that members of his team exhibited unacceptable conduct and a complete lack of respect for both the role of government and the people he is trusted to serve. He believes that when mistakes are made, you own up to them. That’s what leadership is about.'","Losing candidate for Virginia governor wants Christie gone from the organization that shut off the money spigot in his political race .
Ken Cuccinelli lost by a narrow margin to Bill Clinton's former fundraising chief despite closing a huge gap in the final weeks .
But Chris Christie declined to spend time campaigning for 'Cooch,' even though his own New jersey race was a cakewalk .
And the Republican Governors Association, some Virginia GOP insiders think, abandoned them when victory was within reach .
Now Cuccinelli claims Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal will drag down other governors, meaning he should step down as the RGA's chairman ."

A couple have been left devastated after they lost both their baby son and daughter to the same rare heart condition within 18 months of each other. Natasha Halkett was distraught when she lost her first child to the heart defect - which occurs in fewer than one in every 10,000 births. The 21-year-old then suffered a miscarriage before having her second child, David Junior - only for him to die of the same condition just over a fortnight later. Grief: Natasha Halkett lost her first child Layla (pictured) to a rare heart condition - and his brother 18 months later . Loss: Miss Halkett then suffered a miscarriage before having her second child, David (pictured) - only for him to die of the same condition just over a fortnight later . Both babies suffered from a condition called truncus arteriosus type II, a congenital heart defect which requires open heart surgery in infancy for the child to stand any chance of surviving. Miss Halkett and partner David Clark, 45 of Dunfermline, Fife, twice faced the heartbreaking decision to switch off the babies' life support after surgery failed. Doctors picked up on the first child's condition at Natasha's 20-week-scan, discovering she had a hole in her heart. Just two days after Layla was born in July 2012 the couple received the devastating news that their daughter would not pull through. They were told all doctors could do was make her comfortable and try to prolong her life as much as they could. Battle: Ms Halkett and partner David. Both of their children were suffering from truncus arteriosus type II, a congenital heart defect . Truncus arteriosus type II means a child is born with abnormal development of the blood vessels which emerge from the heart. The . child will initially suffer from heart failure, which manifest as rapid . breathing, poor feeding and failure to gain weight and grow properly. Damage of the blood vessels of the lung leads to less blood flow which eventually causes death. Natasha made the heart wrenching decision to turn off the bypass machine that was keeping their four-month-old alive. 'After Layla passed away they just said it could be a one off, so I thought we should try for another child,"" Natasha added. 'But then I had my son and he ends up with the same condition. 'We were so shocked when we got told this as we were told he was a healthy wee boy. 'It was just the same nightmare again. It has been really tough. 'They said he was fine but he had the same condition as his sister, I would like to make all parents aware that the scans don't pick up everything.' The couple were relieved that initial scans revealed no heart problems with their son David Junior. However after his birth hospital doctors suspected he may have a heart murmur. Further tests confirmed he was suffering from the same rare heart defect as his late sister, he required an operation but complications arose. Surgeons discovered that the two-week-old's heart was not strong enough for him to pull through and he died on 21st December.

The brother of a super-fit charity swimmer today told how he watched his sister collapse just one mile from the French coast as she attempted to achieve her childhood dream of crossing the English Channel. Susan Taylor lost consciousness in front of her horrified husband, Stephen, and paramedic brother David Wright, who were both travelling alongside the 34-year-old in a support boat. She was pulled from the water and airlifted to hospital in Boulogne, but declared dead on arrival. Tragedy: Susan Taylor, 34, collapsed and died just one mile from the French coast while attempting to swim the English Channel for charity . In a statement read out at her inquest in Loughborough, her brother told how the former accountant, who had . quit work to train for the gruelling challenge, set off from Dover at . 2am on July 14 last year, with 'nothing untoward' happening in the first . few hours of the swim. Mr Wright said: 'She had been sick several times during the . swim, but that did not seem unusual and was not a cause for concern. 'But towards the end she seemed to be having difficulty maintaining her stroke rate and was showing signs of fatigue. 'She . kept going and Susan continued to try to swim but had to stop again and . was sick. I told her to get out of the water if she wanted to. 'She made no effort to move towards the ladder and lay and lay on her back, appearing unconscious. 'She then rolled onto her front and was lying face down motionless.' Mrs Taylor, pictured on her Channel swim, was pulled from the water and airlifted to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival . Mrs Taylor was lifted from the water by a . member of her support team, who leapt into the sea to help, while the . boat's pilot radioed for assistance. But Mr Wright said she wasn't breathing, and 'immediate medical procedures were commenced'. A French lifeguard boat arrived within . nine minutes, and Mrs Taylor, who was swimming to raise money for . Diabetes UK and Rainbows children's Hospice in Loughborough, was then . winched aboard a helicopter before being flown to hospital. But tragically, medics were unable to save her. Mrs Taylor's brother David Wright told an inquest how she started to have difficulty maintaining her stroke rate and was sick several times before she collapsed . The inquest into Mrs Taylor's death . heard 'nothing could have been done' to save her life. The hearing was . told she died of 'acute cardio-respiratory collapse caused by prolonged . open sea swimming'. Coroner Trevor Kirkman said: 'It is likely there is only a very short period when anything could have been done, and in any event Susan received very prompt attention from medical professionals. 'She appeared physically very fit, and all the information indicated she was well-prepared. The outcome could not have been predicted and the pathologist is of the view that all that could be done was done.' Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Mr Kirkman added: 'She was very nearly there and sadly, tragically, she collapsed. 'I understand she was undertaking the swim not for personal glory, although I have to say it is an achievement not many of us would ever even be able to contemplate. 'She was undertaking it for her love of other people, and desire to help other people. I'm told she was a kind and caring person, very involved in charity work, and she probably achieved more in her life than any of us could hope to achieve. 'It is tragic that her attempt that was so very nearly successful should end in this awful way.' Turning to Mrs Taylor's parents, Arthur and Joyce Wright, and brother, who attended the inquest, Mr Kirkman said: 'All that she has done is not lost, and you all have good memories of her, I am quite certain. As a family you should be very proud of her.' Mrs Taylor, pictured with husband Stephen, has even quit her job so she could train for the 21-mile swim . After the hearing, her brother Mr Wright . said: 'As a result of the inquest verdict, we can now have closure on . what happened to Susan. 'She was a wonderful person and was . dedicated to helping those less fortunate than herself. It was a great . comfort that Susan died attempting to accomplish her childhood ambition . in aid of two worthy causes.' Mrs Taylor's husband, a 43-year-old electrician, did not attend the inquest. His wife, of Barwell, Leicestershire, had spent 18 months preparing for the swim, even quitting her job so she could train full time in swimming pools and lakes near her home in sessions lasting up to eight hours. In the weeks leading up to the attempt, she wrote in a blog how it was her childhood dream to swim the channel. After her death, donations poured in to the charities she was swimming for, and as of tonight she had raised almost £82,000 on her Virgin Money Giving website for Rainbows children's hospice. Donations poured in to the charities Mrs Taylor was swimming for and nearly £82,00 has been raised on her Virgin Money Giving website . Before setting off, she wrote on the site how the challenge was 'tougher than Everest'. Mrs Taylor added: 'Less than 1,000 people have completed the 21-mile cross-Channel swim, whereas over 3,000 have conquered the world's tallest mountain. Only one in ten people who train for the channel actually complete it. 'The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with over 600 tankers and 200 ferries crossing it every day. Other problems include debris, jellyfish, currents and tides.

Tragedy: Tim Marcellino, 22, was found dead in his bedroom while studying at Manchester University . A talented writer hanged himself in his student flat after he 'fell to pieces' when illness forced him to drop out of university, an inquest heard. Tim Marcellino, 22, was found dead in his bedroom by his father while studying English literature at Manchester University. He was discovered beside an open laptop, with a lengthy suicide not displayed on the screen. Using a computer programme, he made sure it would not upload to Facebook until after his death. Despite his creative talents, he had failed to make the second . term of his degree course twice, even after lecturers had given him the chance to start again. It also emerged he previously tried to kill himself with a drug overdose, referring to it as a 'dry run'. He attended one of Britain’s top private schools, came from a loving and supportive family and achieved straight A grades at A-levels. But an inquest in Manchester heard he had suffered from depression for years and found it difficult to cope. Tim’s mother Kate Wood, a finance manager for Barclays Bank, told the hearing: 'He didn’t want to carry on and all the time he was feeling distressed even with friends or family. 'He was sleeping badly and he couldn’t eat, had no appetite and he was falling to pieces. 'When he did fall asleep he dreamt he was dead and he wished he was dead.' Tim attended the 370-year-old George . Heriot’s school where fees cost £10,300 a year and where ex-pupils . included actors Alastair Sim and Roy Kinnear and BBC newsreader Gavin . Esler. He was born whilst his parents were still studying at Keele University. They split up when he was a young boy and, after they got married to other partners, he moved to Edinburgh with his mother. After being accepted at Manchester University, where his father Stuart Thompson was living, Tim’s condition deteriorated and he attended lectures less frequently. He had to start first year twice while his GP referred him for counselling. Treatment: Tim had suffered with depression for years and was prescribed anti-depressants . Tim was prescribed anti-depressants and was later referred for psychotherapy. Mrs Wood said: 'He struggled when he got to university. It got to a point where he couldn’t cope and he came home. 'He was having help from medical professionals but he wasn’t very good at managing his money and that didn’t help. His dad would try and help him sort out his affairs. 'In late 2012 he sent me a text which was disturbing. I pointed out he didn’t have any money and told him to get a job and told him he needed to pull himself out of this. 'But he texted back and explained that there was nothing that could help him find the will for a job and to find a purpose. 'I spoke to his father after that text and he went to see him. He phoned that night very upset because he found out Tim had tried to kill himself. 'Tim’s counsellor wanted to refer him for psychiatric help but when I spoke to Tim he flatly refused and said he wouldn’t do it and would pretend he was OK.' Mrs Wood’s last contact with her son was on the phone a few days before his death on March 25 last year. Prospect: Tim was studying ay Manchester University where lecturers noticed that he was a talented writer . She added: 'He said he didn’t want to travel, have a wife, have a job - nothing. He said he was fed up and said he couldn’t do this for everybody else. 'Stuart tried really hard to get him to go back to his house but Tim just wanted to be in the house he shared with his friends. That’s where he felt happiest.' Tim’s father Stuart Thompson said: 'I didn’t think taking him to hospital was a feasible thing. I didn’t think he would present in a way that would give any particular cause for concern. Resources are stretched and he wouldn’t have appeared at that time as someone who needed urgent help.' Tim’s counsellor Sam Beaumont said: 'He had a series of difficulties in personal relationships throughout his life. He presented with low self esteem and a general lack of meaning and purpose. 'He often had greater sense of regard for other people than himself. He needed to start to value himself. He always offered reassurance he would never act on his suicidal thoughts. He always said his family was a strong protective factor.' Complex problems: Tim failed to start the second term of his degree twice, despite lecturers giving him the opportunity to start again . Recording a suicide verdict Coroner Nigel Meadows told Tim’s parents: 'He clearly had expressed thoughts about wishing to end his life and had already tried something once which is sometimes described as a dry run. 'If it was no longer tolerable to be alive then there has to be a recognition he is entitled to make a choice. It’s quite clear you did all sorts of things to help him and you couldn’t have done any more. 'It’s always sad when a young person loses their life particularly at their own hands but that’s never something you can resolve.' In an obituary written at the time of his death, writer Mike Wolfe said: 'Tim was clearly talented and achieved As in everything.

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 10:55 EST, 23 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:30 EST, 23 January 2014 . Price hike: Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro raised tariffs by an average of 8.2 per cent . Energy giant SSE today revealed it was on course to pump up profits to £1.54billion this year and increase payouts to shareholders - two months after announcing a sharp hike in tariffs. The announcement is likely to spark fresh anger following Labour calls for a cap on household gas and electricity bills as incomes continue to be squeezed. SSE, which trades as Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, raised tariffs by an average of 8.2 per cent from November, blaming Government green levies as well as rising network costs and wholesale energy prices. Bills will be cut by 3.5 per cent for all of the group’s nine million residential customers from March 24 after the group passed on savings from the Government’s green levy shake-up but it still means an overall above-inflation rise for hard-pressed households. In a trading update, SSE’s chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said that despite the ‘difficult business environment’, it was encouraging that the group was on course to deliver more profits and cash for shareholders. It said its full-year dividend would be up by 3 per cent and its adjusted profit before tax for the year ending on March 31 was likely to rise in line with market expectations to £1.54 billion - an increase of 8.8 per cent on 2012/13. This was despite the number of electricity and gas customer accounts in Britain and Ireland falling from 9.47million to 9.22million, while average consumption of electricity in Britain fell by 4.3 per cent and gas by 9.5 per cent - when comparing the nine months to the end of December 2013 to 2012. Compared: SSE blamed its price rise on green levies as well as rising network costs and wholesale energy prices. This graph shows by how much all the major UK energy suppliers have recently increased prises . Ease the pressure: The Consumer Futures watchdog called for SSE to bring forward its planned price cut . SSE also said there was uncertainty over the future of its investment programme, with the prospects for new power generation assets in Britain ‘not encouraging’. It has argued it needs to make money to fund such projects. The group said the failure of two offshore wind farm projects it had a stake in to be chosen for a Government investment short-list was disappointing and that it was reviewing its offshore portfolio. Response: Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said energy companies 'think they can get away with treating their customers poorly' This added to uncertainty about its investment programme in the five years from 2015, which SSE said was likely to be lower than the £1.5billion - £1.7billion range invested annually since 2010. The group’s statement also addressed the question of Scottish independence, saying that while it did not have a view on the matter, it reiterated that the uncertainty over the future ‘increased legislative and regulatory risk’. Meanwhile, the company said it restored electricity supplies to 130,000 homes following storms and flooding before Christmas. Mr Phillips-Davies said: ‘Despite what is clearly a difficult business environment, the overall performance of the company has been solid in 2013/14 and the efforts of employees, shown recently in the response to the Christmas week storms, have been excellent. ‘It is encouraging that SSE is on course to deliver real growth in the dividend and increases in adjusted earnings per share and adjusted profit before tax.’ Mr Phillips-Davies said the Government’s decision last month to remove some of the costs of its green policies from energy bills was ‘an important step in the right direction’. But he said more needed to be done ‘to shift the full cost burden of environmental and social policies from the energy bill to the taxpayer’. SSE said a shake-up at the top of the company hierarchy will see its management board replaced by a slimmed-down six-strong executive committee. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: ‘Yet again we see an energy company increasing its profits and payouts to shareholders on the back of spiralling bills for hard-pressed consumers. ‘The reason the energy companies think they can get away with treating their customers so poorly is because they know (Prime Minister) David Cameron will never stand up to them.’ Stock: The three-year high of the SSE share price was 1,679 on May 21, 2013, and it closed yesterday at 1,137 . The Consumer Futures watchdog called for SSE to bring forward its planned price cut to ease pressure on households. 'The increase in SSE profits contrasts with declining affordability' Richard Hall, Consumer Futures . Richard Hall, director of strategic infrastructure, said: ‘The increase in SSE profits contrasts with declining affordability. ‘The sector is riding out tough economic times better than its customers are, so there’s a pressing need to help the latter. 'It should offer their customers respite by bringing forward its price cut to an earlier date.’ *Based on a medium energy user on a standard dual fuel tariff, paying on receipt of bill, with bill sizes averaged across all regions.

Anger: Alison Huggan, 49, took Middlesbrough Council to a tribunal after they asked her to pay the spare room subsidy for her twin sons . A mother of two British soldiers has overturned a decision by her council who said she would have to pay 'bedroom tax' while her sons lived in barracks. Alison Huggan, 49, from Coulby Newham in Middlesbrough, was told she . was liable to pay a spare room subsidy, because the local authority said her twin sons' home was on their base. Anas is a member of the Yorkshire Regiment First Battalion while Aaron is in the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The row broke out after the council said . that Ms Huggan would be liable to pay £25 a week for her sons' rooms, . despite the Government announcing last March that families with children in the armed forces would be exempt. But Ms Huggan disagreed and, threatened by the prospect of losing £1,000 a year, took the council to tribunal. She won her case along with a refund of around £700, a decision which could open the floodgates to other military families affected by the reforms. Ms Huggan said: 'It was overwhelming seeing the decision in writing although I was very confident going in.' Miss Huggan, who started fighting against the scheme in November 2012, said: 'We challenged the Government and we were overwhelmed in April when they said the armed forces were exempt. 'But then I hit another brick wall. 'In my head it was morally wrong. I couldn't believe that the Government would announce that the armed forces would be exempt when in effect they were not. 'When I read the amendment myself it was as plain as the nose on my face that we should be exempt.' Despite winning her case, Ms Huggan has now chosen to move into a smaller home as Anas has just got married. Twin soldiers: Her son Aaron is in the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and Anas is a member of the Yorkshire Regiment First Battalion . Victory: The mother of the two soldiers took her case to a tribunal and won. She was also handed a £700 refund . The Teesside University criminology graduate said: 'I'm happy I've won. I am moving to a smaller property but I wanted to carry this through. 'It was not just about me but other families too.' Mrs Huggan is one of the tens of thousands of tenants wrongly hit by the reforms. She confronted the Prime Minister with her plight in February last year and Labour leader Ed Miliband said the first decision was 'unfair'. Tragic case: The parents of Becky Bell (pictured) were told they would have to pay more than £600 a year to keep her room untouched after she died of cancer in January 2012 . In April 2013 the so-called 'bedroom tax' was introduced, reducing the amount of housing benefits people can receive if they have a spare room. It saw social housing tenants with an extra room docked an average of £14 a week in benefits. Around 660,000 lost some of their housing benefit from the change, which the Government said would save £465million a year. Under the guidelines two children under 16 of same gender are expected to share while two children under 10 expected to share regardless of their gender. Foster carers are allowed an additional room so long as they have fostered a child. The rules also state the adult children in the Armed Forces should be treated as continuing to live at home when deployed on operations. The charge was aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need. It impacted separated parents who shared the care of their children and parents whose children visit but are not part of the household. The reforms have tipped nearly one in three affected council tenants into rent arrears and many have faced eviction because they cannot afford to pay. Since the reform was introduced in, 50,000 households in 114 local council areas can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation. Government rules decree a child aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender. Last year, the parents of a young cancer victim were told they would have to pay more than £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom when charges for under-occupied homes came into force. The ashes of seven-year-old Becky Bell were been kept in her bedroom at the family home in Hartlepool, which was left exactly as it was . when she lost her battle with brain cancer in January 2012.","Alison Huggan, 49, told by council she would have to pay £25 a week .

The BBC has decided to move the long-serving  editor of Newsbeat, its youth news service, after complaints he bullied staff. The allegations involving Rod McKenzie stretch over two decades. He is accused of having favourites in his team and to have ‘frozen out’ those he did not like. It is also claimed that he shouted at some employees in front of other staff.

Tens of thousands of children in England are still being taught in failing secondary schools, according to official figures today. Around 117,000 children are languishing in schools that do not reach Government exam targets. League tables show that fewer than four in 10 pupils - in around 150 state schools - get at least five GCSEs at grade C or higher, including English and maths. Pupils at England’s worst performing schools are leaving with average grades of D or E in their final exams. A total of 261 state schools in England registered average GCSE grades no higher than a C- last summer, it emerged. Scroll down for video . The number of failing schools in England has dropped by quarter of a million in four years . For the first time, the Department for . Education published new data showing pupils’ performance in their . best eight subjects. The figures – an average grade achieved in . GCSEs sat last summer – will become the Government’s standard measure of . school performance in the future.It emerged that the average pupil scored a good C grade – marked as a C+ in the tables – in the 2013 exams. There are still 117,000 children in failing schools in England, according to the latest official figures . The latest data also shows a worrying number of girls and boys not getting two A grades and a B in subjects favoured, and often required, by Russell Group universities, considered among the best institutions in the UK. At around 420 schools and colleges, no A-level student scored at least two A grades and a B in these subjects. Figures also show that 84,000 children – almost half – who were considered among the brightest pupils at the age of 11 failed to go on to gain good GCSEs in all five EBacc subjects aged 16. The Department for Education warned that schools below the standard expected, and with a history of under-performance, ‘face being taken over by a sponsor with a track record of improving weak schools’. Praise: Education Secretary Michael Gove said that the figures were 'a credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers' This effectively means being closed or converted into independent academies under new leadership as part of a Coalition plan to raise standards. This year’s top school for GCSEs was Colyton Grammar School in Devon. The co-educational school gained the best results in the country for the second year running. It entered 120 pupils for GCSEs and equivalent exams with all gaining at least five qualifications at grade C or higher. The most improved school in England was St Thomas More Catholic School in north London. Its GCSE results have risen from less than a third (31%) of pupils reaching the target of five or more A*-C grades , including English and maths, in 2010 to more than nine in 10 (91%) achieving this benchmark in 2013 - a 60% improvement. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were proof that Coalition reforms were starting to produce great effects. He said improvements had been made despite the imposition of tougher exam targets for schools and a drive to push more pupils onto rigorous academic disciplines that will 'help them find a good job or go on to university'. In all, more than a third of pupils took GCSEs in so-called 'English Baccalaureate' subjects – English, maths, science, foreign languages and history or geography – last summer compared with less than a quarter 12 months earlier. But the data also fuelled fears that large numbers of pupils are still consigned to a substandard education. To gain the EBacc, pupils must score at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language. A DfE analysis of the data found that this year, 202,000 pupils were entered for the EBacc, compared with 130,000 in 2012. In 735 secondaries, more than half of pupils were entered for the EBacc, and in 237 secondaries more than 50 per cent of students achieved the EBacc. Rise: More secondary school pupils than ever are taking the English Baccalaureate, figures released today also revealed . Mr Gove said that the figures were 'a credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers'. 'Thanks to their efforts, the number of children taught in under-performing schools has fallen by almost 250,000 since 2010,' he said. 'This progress has been achieved at the same time as our EBacc has ensured many more young people are taking the core subjects which will most help them find a good job or go on to university.' Simon Burgess, director of the Centre for Market and Public Organisation and professor of economics at University of Bristol said: 'Performance tables are an important part of the school accountability system in England. 'Our research has shown that league tables play an important role in school standards.'","League tables identify 150 failing state schools .

Hundreds of thousands of offences may not have been documented because police fiddled the figures. Constabularies in England and Wales yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year. But in the Kent force – where figures have been ‘cleaned up’ after a period of manipulation – recorded crime rose by 8 per cent. Picture of Britain: Crime has dropped to the lowest level since 1981 but there are mounting concerns that police have been 'fiddling' figures for years . On the rise: One area where crimes appear to be rising is sexual offences, with experts saying the Jimmy Savile scandal and the 'Yewtree effect' has caused a surge in reports . If the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported. In Kent, violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half. Drug . offences were up by 14 per cent, public order offences by 16 per cent . and other ‘miscellaneous’ crimes by a third. It is thought much of the . increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques. The . figures suggest crime figures will rise in other areas with thorough . checking. Last week, the UK . Statistics Authority stripped police crime figures of their stamp of . approval. The watchdog told MPs there had been no proper audit for five . years. Accusation: Shadow Policing Minister Jack Dromey says the public are losing faith and confidence in crime stats . However ministers, . who have trumpeted sharp falls in crime in recent years, pointed to . falls in the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is based on . interviews with 40,000 members of the public. It . shows crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level . since records began in 1981. The survey is traditionally seen as a more . reliable barometer of crime levels over time. It . showed sharp falls in violence – by 13 per cent – and snatch thefts. Crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 . per cent, to its lowest level in a decade. Norman . Baker, Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister, said: ‘England and . Wales are safer than they have been for decades with crime now at its . lowest level since the survey began in 1981. ‘The . Government has made clear that recorded crime statistics must be as . robust as possible and we have a strong record on reinforcing their . independence and accountability.’ Despite . an overall fall in recorded crime, police figures showed a 4 per cent . increase in shoplifting and a 7 per cent increase in pickpocketing and . snatch thefts. Reports of . fraud – including card theft, online fraud and email scams – rocketed 34 . per cent, to 200,000. This is thought to be due in part to improved . recording techniques. Recent . rises in sex offences continued. They were up by 17 per cent, including . a sharp increase in sex attacks on under-13s. These increases have been . linked to the so-called ‘Savile effect’ as historic victims are . encouraged to come forward. James . Patrick, a whistleblower and Metropolitan Police constable, told MPs . last year that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had . become ‘an engrained part of policing culture’. Ministers have ordered a full review of figures across the country, to be carried out by the police watchdog. In . June last year, following an official review, Kent Chief Constable Ian . Learmonth admitted there had been a ‘distortion of activity’ by officers . trying to meet crime targets. This . week a senior analyst at the Office for National Statistics suggested . some officers were recording offences only if they thought there was . enough evidence to lay a charge.

The former England and Liverpool striker punched and kicked the 46-year-old Swedish TV presenter in the head 15 years ago during a brutal attack in a Paris bar. This morning Mr Collymore, 42, now a radio pundit, quit Twitter after he started a campaign against online abuse having received a barrage of death threats and racist taunts himself. 'If he's so against death threats, why did he say he'd 'f****** kill' me? It's a disgrace,' Ms Jonsson told The Sun. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Row: Ulrika Jonsson has called her ex Stan Collymore a 'vile hypocrite' for complaining about abuse when he beat her up in 1998 . Attack: Ulrika says Stan was a 'malicious bully' when they were together, and she was punched and kicked in the head by him before he sliced up her clothes . The then couple had been together 18 months when Collymore said he was taunted by hundreds of Scottish fans as he went into a bar during the 1998 World Cup in France. When . he got in, he saw Ulrika wearing a Scotland shirt, pulling pints behind . the bar and warned her anyone could jump over the bar at her. After flying into a rage he dragged her to floor and kicked her three times in the head before he was dragged away. Ms Jonsson said the 'malicious bully' then went back to their hotel room and sliced up her clothes and belongings. 'Now he's the poster boy against threats online. It's beyond ironic,' she said today. 'Everyone deserves a second chance but I've lost count of the chances Stan has had. He was a textbook abuser'. Responding today Mr Collymore said: 'There are people using a 15-year-old story to say well actually you did this now in 2014, not 1998, you do not deserve to speak out out about someone writing 'I'm going to turn up to your house and murder you"". 'When I'm trying to talk about safeguards for everybody and live within the laws is to protect people, not me'. 'A 15-year-old story is in the past. It bears no relevance to me today'. Accusations: Ms Jonsson, who broke up with the footballer on the day after the attack, said today: 'I've lost count of the chances Stan has had. He was a textbook abuser' Collymore's . potentially glittering career was always dogged by reports of him being . thrown out of bars, being banned from games and his attack on Ulrika. He was once caught dogging - but he has never been . implicated in a crime.

Emerging from a lake, a giant amphibious drone gingerly picks its way over Russia’s Rzhevka military training ground. This huge drone is the latest in a menagerie of automated robots to be developed worldwide, adding to what some have described as the creation of ground-based robotic armies. Its appearance comes as large organisations, such as Google and Amazon, invest in drone technology, with some experts claiming the it could lead to a full on robotics war by 2020. Scroll down for video... Russia is reportedly developing weaponised ground drones, including some big amphibious models such as the ones shown here . Air-based drones have been under development in Russia for some time, with reports last year that the country had been developing a new 20-tonne attack unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These latest images, however, provide a glimpse into Russia's future capabilities in ground-based drones. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country is aware of the potential of unmanned vehicles, but does not intend to use them the way other countries do. ‘Today they [drones] are used more and more widely in the world. We won't do it the way other countries do,’ said President Putin in November last year. ‘This is not a game, this is not a computer game, these are serious combat systems, both shock and reconnaissance versions, and it is absolutely clear that they have good prospects. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country is aware of the potential of unmanned vehicles, but does not intend to use them the way other countries do. Pictured here is a drone at the Rzhevka military training ground in Russia . The country is reportedly developing a variety of ground-based drones including smaller six-wheeled models such as the one shown here . Last year, Google's chief Eric Schmidt warned drone technology proves a serious danger to global security. Mr Schmidt said that the technology for armed unmanned planes will soon pass into the hands of terrorists posing huge security concerns across the globe. He also said that ever expanding drone technology is making smaller and cheaper models, including nano-drones, which could be used by nosy neighbors spying on each other in a dispute. 'I'm not going to pass judgement on whether armies should exist, but I would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to  fight war to every single human being,' he said. In December, Google acquired robotic firm Boston Dynamics. The firm, bought for an unspecified figure, is the eighth robotics company snapped up by Google in recent years. The Russian government is also in talks to establish an organisation that will develop and produce unmanned aircraft systems, according to the Voice of Russia. It’s not just Russia who increased invested in drone technology. Boston Dynamics, which made the Big Dog machine, was recently acquired by the internet giant Google. The firm, bought for an unspecified figure, is the eighth robotics company snapped up by Google in recent years and is unlikely to be the last. Three of Google’s recent acquisitions make robotic arms, used for lifting heavy weights and unloading trucks. Another, Maku, makes androids that have eyelids, workable fingers and ears that move and flex, while another makes hi-tech cameras that were used to film recent Hollywood hit Gravity. So what is Google, better known for running an online search engine, doing amassing a vast wealth of robotic experts and patents? When asked whether the company is building an army of domestic servant robots, a press officer for Google in the UK laughed, before adding they didn’t know.

A man who allegedly posed as not one, but two rock guitar legends, in order to dupe hospitals where he ran up expensive medical bills, has failed to turn up in court. Phillip Michael Schaeffer, 54, from Monticello in Minnesota, allegedly conned staff at Dixie Regional Medical Center in December 2011 into believing that he was Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson, 60. When handed a $23,000 bill by the hospital, which once treated John Wayne, he said that his ‘agent’, Phil Michaels, would take care of it, according to police. Scroll down for video . Unlikely lookalikey: Minnesota-native Schaeffer allegedly attempted to fool hospital staff into believing he was British prog rocker Dave Gilmour, right . It’s claimed that he ran the same scam at the same hospital during two visits in November 2012 and February 2013 – but pretended to be 67-year-old Pink Floyd singer-guitarist David Gilmour. When presented with a $49,000 bill he allegedly told staff that his agent Michaels would deal with it again, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Then, on April 20 2013 he allegedly pulled the same con at St. Cloud Hospital in Minnesota. He told staff that he didn't have health insurance. Phillip Michael Schaeffer also allegedly scammed a hospital by telling them he was Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson . He was treated and released, but not before he signed an autograph as David Gilmour for an employee’s son. But not everyone at the hospital was fooled by the Monticello man’s alleged impression of the Cambridge-born prog rocker. That suspicion led to the hospital flagging his patient chart in case he returned, hospital spokeswoman Jeanine Nistler told the St. Cloud Times. The next day there was still discussion among security staff and so the hospital’s security supervisor reviewed security camera shots of Schaeffer entering the hospital and compared them to pictures of the singer/guitarist famed for songs including Comfortably Numb and Another Brick In The Wall. He quickly established that the man wasn’t who he claimed to be. When Schaeffer returned to the hospital four days later, he presented information that he claimed showed he had health insurance from Lloyd’s of London. He also told staff that Pink Floyd was on tour in Canada and that he stopped in St. Cloud during a break to get medical treatment. A security supervisor told a St. Cloud police officer who happened to be at the hospital that the man and he confronted Schaeffer, who admitted that he has been lying. The man was taken to Stearns County Jail on a possible charge of theft by swindle, but released the next day while police gathered evidence to present to the county attorney’s office for possible charges. He was charged in July 2013 with two second-degree felony counts of communications fraud but didn’t make Tuesday’s trial at the 5th District Court because he’s currently jailed in New Mexico for unknown reasons, according to reports.","Phillip Schaeffer, 54, from Minnesota, has been charged with fraud .

We use many methods - from calories to carb-counting to point-recording - to work out which food is best for us. But now scientists have discovered that a dieter's best friend may be right in front of their nose. Researchers believe that we can use our sense of smell to detect fat in foods. U.S. researchers think their discovery could help people learn to regulate their diets and to include less fat in the future. Scientists at the Monell Centre, Philadelphia, said that as smell is almost always detected before taste, their study identifies one of the first sensory qualities that signals whether a food contains fat. Innovative methods using scents to make low-fat foods more palatable could someday aid public health efforts to reduce dietary fat intake. ‘The human sense of smell is far better at guiding us through our everyday lives than we give it credit for,’ said senior author Dr Johan Lundström, a cognitive neuroscientist at Monell. ‘That we have the ability to detect and discriminate minute differences in the fat content of our food suggests that this ability must have had considerable evolutionary importance,’ he added. As the most calorically dense nutrient, fat has been a desired energy source across much of human evolution and experts think it would have been advantageous for humans to be able to detect sources of fat in food. Sweet taste is thought to signal a source of carbohydrate energy. Scientists know humans use sensory cues to detect fat, but they do not know exactly which senses contribute to this ability. The researchers reasoned that fat detection using smell has the advantage of identifying food sources from a distance. While previous research had determined that humans could use odours to detect high levels of pure fat in the form of fatty acids, it was not known whether it was possible to detect fat in food. As the most calorically dense nutrient, fat has been a desired energy source across much of human evolution and experts think it would have been advantageous for humans to be able to detect sources of fat in food . Humans use our sense of smell to detect fat in foods. The ability could have 'considerable evolutionary significance,' the researchers said. People from different cultures were able to detect different amounts of fat in milk samples. There was no relation between a person's weight and the ability to discriminate fat. Scientists will now try to identify the odour molecules that allow people to detect different levels of fat. Fat molecules are not airborne so they are unlikely to be sensed simply by sniffing. Sophisticated chemical analyses is needed to work out why humans have the ability to detect fat using our noses. In their experiment, researchers set out to see if people could detect and differentiate the amount of fat in milk. They asked healthy participants to smell milk containing an amount of fat that might be encountered in a typical milk product: either 0.125 per cent, (skimmed) 1.4 per cent (semi-skimmed or reduced fat) or 2.7 per cent fat (normal milk – although full fat is usually classified as 3.25 to 3.5 per cent fat). The milk samples were presented to blindfolded subjects in three vials. Two of the vials contained milk with the same fat content, while the third contained milk with a different fat concentration. The subjects' task was to smell the three vials and identify which of the samples was different and the experiment was conducted three times using different sets of subjects. The first used average weight people from the Philadelphia area, the second was conducted in ‘a different cultural setting’ in the Wageningen area of the Netherlands and the third study, also conducted in Philadelphia, examined fat detection both in normal weight and overweight subjects. In their experiment, researchers set out to see if people could detect and differentiate the amount of fat in milk. They asked healthy participants to smell milk containing an amount of fat that might be encountered in a typical skimmed, semi-skimmed and full fat products (stock image) In all three experiments, participants could use their sense of smell to discriminate different levels of fat in the milk, according to the study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE. This ability did not differ in the two cultures tested, even though people in the Netherlands on average consume more milk on a daily basis than Americans. There also was no relation between weight status and the ability to discriminate fat. Dr Sanne Boesveldt, lead author of the study and a sensory neuroscientist at the centre, said: ‘We now need to identify the odour molecules that allow people to detect and differentiate levels of fat. ‘Fat molecules typically are not airborne, meaning that they are unlikely to be sensed by sniffing food samples. ‘We will need sophisticated chemical analyses to sniff out the signal.’ Innovative methods using scents to make low-fat foods more palatable could someday aid public health efforts to reduce dietary fat intake, according to the scientists .","Researchers from Monell Centre, Philadelphia, found that people used their sense of smell to discriminate between different levels of fat in milk .

After Billy’s growth was found to be benign, dermatologists inspected a mark on Mrs Testro’s neck which had been irritating her for three months. Shock: Marie Testro initially took her son Billy to the family GP about a spot on his hairline. This was found to be harmless but she was diagnosed with skin cancer at the same time . Tests confirmed she was suffering from a rodent ulcer, otherwise known as basal cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. Mrs Testro, who works in accounting, said: 'The dermatologist had finished explaining that Billy’s spot was harmless and then asked whether there was any history of skin cancer in my family. 'I said, ""no, but there is this strange mark on my neck"". 'The lump had been on my neck for six months and had been itching and bleeding for about three months. But it wasn’t incredibly painful and I hadn’t thought a great deal about it. 'The dermatologist took one look at it and asked me to go back and see my GP urgently. The GP took a sample of the tissue and discovered it was cancer. 'Billy was with me in the examination room when he told me what he’d found, and my first thought was how he would react to the news. Chance: After Billy's growth was found to be benign, dermatologists inspected a mark on Mrs Testro's neck which had been irritating her for three months . More than with 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas are diagnosed each year. Cases of this form of cancer, which is treatable by surgery, have risen by 80 per cent in  a decade. It is the most common form of skin cancer but the least dangerous - but must still be taken seriously. Basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads and can easily be treated and cured when discovered early. But the surgery can be potentially disfiguring, especially the cancer has grown for a while. 'He was just 13 at the time and cancer is such a strong word. I was shocked. It was almost as if my life was flashing before my eyes.' The cancerous lump was removed a week after it was discovered. Mrs Testro, of Derby, said: 'Taking Billy to the doctor’s surgery turned out to be a very good idea. If it had been left for any longer, it could have spread. 'Cancer’s not something you want to leave to get any worse, and if it had gone unexamined for very much longer, my health could have been at serious risk.' She believes the cancer could have been caused by a heat-conducting silver chain which she wore around her neck. She said: 'I had used sunbed in the past but never excessively - perhaps on the odd occasion for a couple of weeks before heading out to a holiday in the sun. On holiday I always tried to be careful using sunscreen because I hated to burn. 'I used to wear a thick silver chain . which heated up quite considerably when I was using a hair-drier, or . even when I was over the oven cooking. 'I suspect the heat damaged my skin cells on that part of my neck over time, leading to the development of cancer.' Tests confirmed she was suffering from basal cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. Image on the left shows the scar left on Marie's neck after the skin cancer was removed . Since discovering the skin cancer in the summer of 2007, Mrs Testro has battled breast cancer which required a full mastectomy on her left side in the spring of 2011, and bouts of chemotherapy and radiotherapy between 2012 and 2013. She is currently in remission and is being supported in her recovery by her partner Jason, 43, and Billy. The skin cancer, which doctors have told her was unrelated to the development of breast cancer, has not reoccured. She said the skin cancer shock, and her following struggle with breast cancer, has prompted a change of habits and a refreshed outlook on life. She said: 'I don’t tend to go on holiday . to places where it’s hot and, if I do, I don’t go on the sunbed . beforehand and make sure I don’t go in the sun to the degree I did. I’m a . lot more cautious than I ever was before. Marie with her partner Jason. She believes the cancer could have been caused by a heat-conducting silver chain which she wore around her neck . 'I got rid of the chain that became hot - it’s in the jewellery box now, never to be worn again, and when I do wear a lighter gold chain now, I keep it tucked in to my shirt. 'I’ve spoken about my experiences with cancer, and how I’ve handled them, with other people. A friend of mine has the BRCA gene and she is soon going for a double mastectomy - it’s a relief for her to be able to talk to me, because I’ve been through it. “The most frequent questions are - ‘what happens next? If I need a breast reconstruction, what will I look like after the surgery?’ I’m happy to show people my reconstruction, which is encouraging for them. “People ask me how I’ve managed to stay so strong. Experiencing cancer puts things in perspective - if you’re diagnosed you can’t get worked up about little things, like breaking a nail. 'It feels nice to be able to share that perspective with people.'","Marie Testro, 43, was worried about a spot on her son Billy's hairline .

A grandmother has written an open letter to a burglar who ransacked her home on the eve of her 18-year-old grandson's funeral. Dorothy Iris Mayer, 79, was left heartbroken by the raid at her home which took place as she was preparing to bury her grandson Christopher Vaughan, 18, who drowned in a tragic accident. She said she 'could have cried' when she came home from a hospital appointment to find thieves had broken into her home and taken jewellery including her wedding ring and her late husband's wedding ring. Dorothy Iris Mayer has written an open letter to the thief who ransacked her home on the day before her grandson's funeral . Mrs Mayer was left heartbroken when she returned to find her home had been broken into . However she decided to type an open letter to the thieves who ransacked her home in Fairwater, Cardiff, which police have now released in a bid to bring those responsible to justice. The grandmother-of-four wrote: 'I would like to say thank you for robbing me in the daytime, (maybe saving me from having a beating) I was going to my 18-year-old grandson's funeral in Birmingham on Saturday as he drowned in Weymouth Harbour... 'Pity you didn’t wait one more day, you would have had the house to yourself. And maybe left it as you found it, clean and tidy, not like a tip. 'You obviously went with your muddy boots straight to the bedrooms where you left muddy prints all over my cream carpets. Even the goods you threw on the floor, you walked over without any concern.' Later in the letter she writes: 'I do hope you make a mistake and get caught.' Mrs Mayer said she wrote the letter to let whoever broke into her home know what she thought of them and their actions.

Mrs Mayer said she wrote the letter to let whoever broke into her home know what she thought of them and their actions. She said: 'I didn’t want to turn up at the funeral crying about the robbery. 'I thought I’m going to sit there and write a letter to whoever it is and talk to him like a mother would. 'I wasn’t going to let him get to me, I just wanted to tell him what I thought of him and what he had done. The break-in took place the day before the funeral of Mrs Mayer's 18-year-old grandson Christopher Vaughan . 'I don’t mean any damage but there has got to be a reason and they’ve got to be stopped. 'People just can’t be robbed all the time. It’s not fair that we can’t leave our homes and be content and happy without worrying about locking this and locking that. 'It’s a horrible way to live, going around robbing people - that’s no life. My grandson would have made something of his life, not like these thieves.' Mrs Mayer said she has had a lot of tragedy in her life but she would not let the criminal get to her. She survived her home being bombed in 1944, an attack which left her mother dead and her sister seriously injured. Her husband died four years ago after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer’s - which she described as a living hell - but she has never lost her love of life. The mother-of-two, known among her friends for her 'wicked sense of humour', even wished the burglar well. At the end of her letter she said: 'If it is stealing to pay for drugs you need help before it kills you. 'I would like to suggest you are made to go cold turkey and clean up your way of life.' She released the letter and the pictures of the damage to her home and the empty jewellery boxes to the police after the theft on Friday. Officers are now hunting for the thief.

The victim has shown tremendous bravery and we are appealing for information that will help us make an arrest.

An embarrassed Nigel Farage was today forced to disown the whole of his party’s 2010 manifesto, after being hit with a host of bizarre proposals he knew nothing about. The UK Independence Party promised to improve Britain by painting trains in traditional colours, deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers. Despite standing on the manifesto as a candidate in the 2010 election, Mr Farage insisted it was nothing to do with him and 'none of it stands today'. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage floundered on live TV as he was grilled about the party's 2010 general election manifesto . Pressure: Mr Farage insisted none of the manifesto still stands and the party was still working on new policies . During a car crash live TV interview, Mr Farage was challenged about a raft of policies which formed the Ukip pitch in 2010. He had briefly stood aside as leader at the time to concentrate on trying to get elected to the Commons. The Ukip leader was also given a verbal battering by high-flying . financial analyst Louise Cooper who shouted ‘shame on you’ for saying . women in the City should be paid less. Mr Farage, a usually-confident TV performer, appeared to struggle when asked if Ukip now has any official policies at all. Some of the more eye-catching policies in Ukip's 2010 manifesto include: . It included plans for a flat tax . regardless of income, and their much-criticised economic plans which . include cutting taxes by £90billion but increasing spending by . £30billion. Mr Farage claimed the latter was not ‘nonsense’ although conceded it was ‘ambitious’. His party are also apparently reviewing their plans to restrict the number of foreigners on British football teams, which it believes is behind their ‘lack of success’; banning the burqa, axing the Ministry of Defence, imposing ‘proper dress’ in theatres, hotels and restaurants, and investigating alleged discrimination against white people at the BBC. He told BBC2’s Daily Politics that he did not defend the 2010 manifesto saying he did not put it together. He has been party leader since 2006 but stepped for a while in September 2009 to run - unsuccessfully - for a seat in Buckingham at the 2010 election. However he said all policies were under review pending the party’s new manifesto for 2015, to be published after the European elections in May. He claimed it would be ‘similar in flavour’, but the only policies he would commit to yesterday were bringing back grammar schools and leaving the EU. Mr Farage floundered as he was asked about the party’s proposal to scrap Trident, saying he was not sure the suggestion had come from. When told it was on the Ukip website, he said: ‘When it comes to websites, I’m not the expert.’ He also claimed not to know about a compulsory dress code for taxi drivers and proposal to repaint trains. ‘Look, under the last leadership and in the 2010 election we managed to present a manifesto that was 486 pages long’, he said. ‘So you can quote me all sorts of bits of it that I will not know. That’s why I’ve said none of it stands today and we will launch it all after the European elections.’ The faltering performance came after the . Ukip leader, who worked in a brokerage firm before entering politics, . caused outrage this week by saying women who have children are less . valuable to their employers when they return to work. He claimed the City was no longer sexist . as in the past, but said women who leave their client base to take ‘two . or three years off’ to have a baby, put themselves at a disadvantage. Mr Farage was appearing on BBC 2's Daily Politics determined to talk about topics other than Europe and immigration . Today he was confronted by Miss Cooper, a markets analyst at City brokers BGC partners and former equities broker at Goldman Sachs, who said that Mr Farage’s argument was ‘laughable’ and he was ‘talking out of his bottom’. She said: ‘For all the working mothers . out there who are battling day-to-day in the City, and elsewhere, who . are discriminated against, who are paid less than their male colleagues, . who are looked over for promotion, I say on behalf of them ‘shame on . you’. ‘And I say double . shame on you because you have daughters. What kind of example are you . setting to your daughters by saying what you said? What you are saying . us laughable. You are talking out of your bottom.’Miss Cooper became known as the face of . the financial crisis for her TV analysis of the European economic . downturn in 2011. She accused Mr Farage of factual inaccuracy as women . can only take a maximum of 12 months maternity leave, not three years. She took four months off when she had her child. Financial analyst Louise Cooper took Mr Farage to task for saying women who take time off to have children are 'worth less' to big City firms . The Ukip leader claimed when he worked in finanace he never took more than a week’s holiday because he could not leave his clients. He said employees in that field had to be ‘more hardnosed’ than in other careers and few women were able to cope with ‘a family and a big job’ of that sort. But Miss Cooper hit back saying that many City firms poach employees from their rivals and are prepared to wait up to 18 months for them to start after they finish ‘gardening leave’. This is standard in City jobs so employees do not use inside knowledge they have gained to their advantage.","Ukip leader under pressure over whether the party has any policies .

U.S. and Chinese scientists have found the tobacco ringspot pathogen, which attacks tobacco plants and soybeans, is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies. They say it is the first evidence that honeybees exposed to infected pollen can become infected too. U.S. and Chinese scientists have found the tobacco ringspot pathogen, which attacks tobacco plants and soybeans, is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies (pictured) The use of pesticides, loss of habitat and climate change has previously been blamed for the shrinking of honeybee populations. ‘The results of our study provide the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen can also be infected and that the infection becomes widespread in their bodies,’ the study's lead author, Ji Lian Li of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, said. The virus was also found in varroa mites – a beehive pest described as a ‘vampire parasite’ that is also believed to weaken colonies by transmitting disease while feeding on their blood. The researchers made their discovery after screening bees for frequent and rare viruses. Tobacco Ringspot Virus (illustrated) is not the only virus now known to attack honeybee colonies but it is the first evidence that honeybees exposed to infected pollen can become infected too . Around five per cent of known plant viruses are pollen-transmitted and are therefore potential sources of host-jumping viruses, they explained in their paper, which was published in the journal mBio. These viruses tend to be particularly dangerous because they lack a genetic function that edits out errors in replicated genomes so that they can generate a flood of variant copies with different infective properties. High replication rates mean viruses appear to work together to determine the suffering of their hosts. ‘The viruses are a likely source of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases,’ the researchers said. The virus was also found in Varroa mites - a beehive pest described as a 'vampire parasite' that is also believed to weaken colonies by transmitting disease while feeding on their blood. This mite has been magnified many times and is clinging to hairs on a bees's leg . Tobacco Ringspot Virus (TRSV) is not the only virus now known to attack honeybee colonies. When the researchers investigated bee colonies classified as strong or weak, TRSV and other viruses were more common in the weak colonies than they were in the strong ones. They said that bee populations with high levels of multiple viral infections began failing in late autumn and perished before February. In contrast, those in colonies with fewer viral assaults survived the entire cold winter months. ‘The increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses is associated with a gradual decline of host populations and supports the view that viral infections have a significant negative impact on colony survival,’ the researchers said. Honeybee populations are declining sharply . There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim. Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production. Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’ The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years. Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination.","U.S. and Chinese scientists have found the tobacco ringspot virus is increasingly prevalent in declining honeybee colonies .

A grieving mother today described her ‘pain, sadness and heartbreak’ after her former husband was jailed for killing their 11-year-old daughter. Simon Thompson, 52, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire to 20 years in prison after he admitted killing his daughter Rebecca following a day trip to London Zoo. He strangled the youngster - who was just about to start secondary school - and her body was found the next day in June last year by her mother Mary Thompson at her home in Bushey, near Watford. Jailed: Simon Thompson (left), 52, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire to 20 years in prison today after he admitted killing his daughter Rebecca (right) following a day trip to London Zoo . Thompson pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. It is thought that after killing his daughter he tried to take his own life by driving at high speed into a roundabout. Mrs Thompson said today: ‘Rebecca and I were so very close and enjoyed a wonderful relationship. Her father killed her in such cruel circumstances leaving me to find her dead. 'This has left me totally destroyed and devastated. Rebecca was such a loving and caring child who adored animals and being with people. I miss her so much, my life has become so empty without her. ‘I had made plans for a new life with Rebecca but we had no chance to give that a try. It seems her controlling and manipulative bully of a father could not stand the thought of us moving on and being happy.’ She added: ‘Now I face a life-time of loneliness and only memories without my darling girl. The grief that fills me is hard to explain, it is like I have been forced to step out of one life into another which is full of pain, sadness and heartbreak. ‘Like many young girls Rebecca liked fashion and music but now we will never go shopping together again or meet up with local friends for a coffee and a chat. I have no feeling towards my ex-husband and regard him with the contempt that he deserves.’ Jane Bickerstaff QC, prosecuting, told the court that Thompson and his wife had been married since 1998 but by June 21 last year, they had effectively been estranged for five years. Mrs Thompson had bought his share of the property but he stayed on as a lodger and they slept in separate rooms - her in one and him and Rebecca in another. 'Wonderful relationship': Rebecca (pictured) was 'a loving and caring child', her mother Mary Thompson said . His wife then met and formed a relationship with Colin Macdonald, who she had introduced Rebecca to on holiday in Tenerife and who she had told her husband was ‘more than a friend’. ‘She wanted the situation to end and the defendant had been given noticed to leave by June 1 and find somewhere else to live,’ said Miss Bickerstaff, adding that Thompson had failed to comply. ‘She gave him a final notice to leave by July 1. The date of Rebecca’s death was approximately a week before this deadline. ‘The defendant was facing the impending . prospect that he would no longer be living in the same house as his . daughter, let alone the same room.’ 'Her father killed her in such cruel circumstances leaving me to find her dead. This has left me totally destroyed and devastated' Mary Thompson, mother . On June 21, Thompson called his daughter’s school and lied that she had been sick overnight. He then got a taxi to take them from their home to London Zoo, in Regents Park. Meanwhile Mrs Thompson had gone to a course in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, from where she was to head to see her new partner for the weekend. The prosecutor said: ‘The defendant and Rebecca were collected by taxi and driven back, arriving about 6pm. ‘In the period between 6.07pm and 11.30pm the defendant had taken Rebecca’s dressing gown cord from her dressing gown on the back of the door and strangled her to death with it. ‘There were no defensive injuries and it is likely that strangulation was done in her sleep.’ She added: ‘The Crown submits a sleeping child in the adult’s care is among the most vulnerable of victims.’ Visit: Thompson admitted killing his daughter Rebecca following a day trip to London Zoo (file picture) The court heard Thompson was seen on his driveway by a neighbour, who thought it unusual as the defendant was normally in bed by 8.30pm. Thompson then got into his Volkswagen Golf, towards the A41, where he was seen driving towards a roundabout at what one witness estimated as 100mph. The force of the impact propelled the engine out of the car and left the defendant with serious leg injuries, but alive. He was taken to hospital in London while police officers went to his home but found it locked and nobody answering. They tried to contact Mrs Thompson and left messages and the following morning, on June 22, she received them and tried, through hospital staff, to find out what had happened to her daughter. Thompson, who was believed to be unemployed and not known to have any friends, claimed she was fine and with his colleagues. Mrs Thompson went to the hospital to confront him directly and it was only after repeated denials that he finally confessed Rebecca was at home. The worried mother then had her worst fears realised, discovering her only child’s lifeless body. She told Mr Macdonald: ‘She’s cold. She’s cold. She’s dead. Call an ambulance.’ The little girl still had the cord around her neck. Psychiatric experts concluded that . Thompson had Asperger’s syndrome and depression and that his actions . occurred because of a combination of circumstances which were unlikely . to be repeated. Bernard Richmond QC, defending, said his client did not consider himself worthy of sympathy. He . said the killing had resulted from Thompson’s ‘abnormal thinking’, . adding: ‘Within the warped reasoning going on on that day, this was seen . as an act of mercy.’ Sentencing: St Albans Crown Court (pictured) was told Thompson did not consider himself worthy of sympathy . The defendant’s situation would only become worse as he received treatment for his condition, he said. ‘The enormity and sheer horror of that will grow and will continue to haunt him. That is a very real punishment. This has been a tragedy not undertaken by a man either evil or angry.’ Judge Stephen Gullick told Thompson: ‘This was a deliberate and considered act by you which involved the taking of a life of another human being. ‘Rebecca was your own daughter. She was . entitled to expect that you would protect and care for her and not take . her life while she was asleep. 'Rebecca had her whole life ahead of her and her chance for a future has been taken away by someone who was supposed to keep her safe' Detective Inspector John Arthur, Hertfordshire Constabulary . ‘She was tucked up in bed in a place regarded by her as her home, in her mind a very safe place indeed. A breach of trust could not have been more gross.’ Thompson, appearing via a videolink from Bedford Prison, where he has been held in the hospital wing because of his leg injuries, showed little emotion during the hearing. Hertfordshire Constabulary’s Detective Inspector John Arthur, who led the investigation, said: ‘Simon Thompson has been professionally identified as a man who had psychiatric issues at the time. ‘However his actions last summer were callous when he killed his daughter, his only child, leaving her mother distraught. There are no words of comfort in cases such as these. 'Rebecca had her whole life ahead of her and her chance for a future has been taken away by someone who was supposed to keep her safe and protect her from the dangers in this world. ‘On behalf of my team can I thank Rebecca’s mother and friends for the dignity and courage they have shown during what has been a very difficult time for them and hope that with time they can rebuild their lives.’","Simon Thompson, 52, killed daughter Rebecca after London Zoo day trip .

A Lib Dem cabinet minister has dismissed groping claims against Lord Rennard as a ‘scandal without the sex’. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael is also under fire after warning the party must stop ‘washing its dirty linen in public’. One alleged victim of Lord Rennard condemned the remarks, insisting the ‘smears have to stop’ as the crisis engulfing Nick Clegg’s leadership showed no sign of abating. Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael (left) warned the party against washing its dirty linen in public and called mediation to end the legal stand-off with Lord Rennard . Lord Rennard has begun legal action against the Lib Dems after his party membership was suspended because he refused to bow to Mr Clegg’s call to apologise for his behaviour. An internal inquiry found that four women had made ‘credible’ allegations against the peer, but there was a less than 50 per cent chance they would pass the burden of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. In response, the alleged victims also refused to rule out legal action against the peer, who as the party’s chief executive led the Lib Dems to a string of by-election wins. To add to the Lib Dems’ woes, the party last night finally suspended the membership of MP Mike Hancock, more than three years after a vulnerable constituent first complained about him. As chief executive from 2003 to 2009, Lord Rennard was one of the most powerful figures in the Liberal Democrats. In charge of almost every area of policy, he masterminded a string of by-election wins which built the number of MPs in the Commons. But after he stood down citing ill-health, rumours emerged about his behaviour towards female activists. Four women are known to have made complaints about his behaviour. All of them have described inappropriate touching and advances. Bridget . Harris, a former special adviser to Nick Clegg, said the peer behaved . in a sexually inappropriate manner towards her over a cup of coffee at a . party conference in Swansea in 2003. Lord Rennard was ‘touching my legs and my knees and he did it two or three times’, she said. Miss Harris said he invited her to his room and was ‘clearly not noticing  the signals’. Another unnamed alleged victim, a party candidate, was at an event with other Lib Dems when a friend suggested taking a photo. She said Lord Rennard, who was standing next to her, ‘shoved his hand down the back of my dress’. Alison Smith, a former activist, said Lord . Rennard allegedly sat between her and a friend at his house and then started moving his . hands ‘down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business . being’. Susan . Gaszczak, a senior Liberal Democrat who chairs the party’s conferences, . also alleged she had been inappropriately touched. A report by Alistair Webster QC last weekfound that four women had made ‘credible’ allegations against the peer, but there was a less than 50 per cent . chance they would pass the burden of proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. However, he recommended Lord Rennard apologise to 'distress' his behaviour caused. Lord Rennard refused, so the party suspended him while it investigates whether he has brought the party into disrepute. The peer denies any wrongdoing and is threatening to sue . the Lib Dems for suspending his membership after refusing to say sorry . to the women. Incredibly, Mr Clegg acted only after an independent report by a QC, who found prima facie evidence that the 67-year-old MP was guilty of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’, was leaked online. As the Lib Dems’ reputation becomes increasingly damaged, Mr Carmichael appeared to suggest the party should deal with the Rennard scandal behind closed doors. He told reporters: ‘I think that it is not good for any political party to be seen to be washing its dirty linen in public. Sadly it is happening here.’ Asked how he would characterise the ‘situation’, he said: ‘I would say scandal without the sex.’ Mr Carmichael, a former Lib Dem chief whip promoted to Scottish Secretary in October, called for mediation between Lord Rennard and his accusers to resolved the legal stand-off. He said: ‘We are in a situation where you have effectively got two camps and at a time when you are seeing the economy turning a corner, economic growth taking hold, I think there is a frustration amongst the party activists that we are not able to talk about that because we are talking so much about our own internal matters. ‘What I am quite keen to see is that there is a some sort of mediation set up that will allow both parties to find a way through this because clearly we have got something that now needs an early resolution and the only way I see achieving that is to have some third party involvement in mediation.’ However Alison Smith, who has accused Lord Rennard of groping her, hit back: ‘The linen needs to be washed one way or another, especially when the threat to women is ongoing.’ She stressed that mediation is the best way forward but only if the right preconditions are in place. ‘The smears have to stop and mediation needs to be done by specialists in these sensitive issues,’ she wrote on Twitter. Miss Smith, a former activist, claims that she and a friend were once invited back to the Lord Rennard’s house after dinner in central London. Lord Rennard allegedly sat between the two women and then started moving his hands ‘down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business being’. He then told them not to go home and that there were no taxis. The women discovered that he had locked the front door and he apparently opened it only when they insisted they wanted to go home. Lord Rennard has always denied behaving inappropriately. Mr Clegg yesterday admitted his handling . of the claims against Lord Rennard last year was ‘not ideal’ as he . vowed not to back down in calling for an apology from the Lib Dem peer. The . Deputy Prime Minister also conceded that ‘alarm bells did not go off’ within the party when the allegations were first made several years ago. Admission: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the party's handling of the crisis was 'not ideal' Mr Clegg insisted he would not drop his demand for an apology. He . told LBC 97.3: ‘Let me really be open with you, I actually think the . way that we handled it last year wasn’t great, wasn’t ideal. ‘Much . more seriously than that, looking much further back, it is quite clear . that when the women were first caused this distress, many, many years . ago…the Party did not react, the alarm bells did not go off, and there . weren’t procedures, and that’s what I’ve apologised to them in person, . and publically.’ Mr Clegg said he had to demand that Lord Rennard says sorry - even if only for causing ‘inadvertent’ distress to women. Alistair Carmichael was appointed Scottish Secretary to lead the charge against independence . Alistair Carmichael is not a household name, but is incredibly influential in Team Clegg. When . the coalition was formed in 2010 he became the party's chief whip - an . enforcer ion the shadows to keep Lib Dem MPs in line when the going got . tough. It is the whip's job to know the ambitions and darkest secrets and keep them out of the public eye. In October's reshuffle he was appointed Scottish Secretary, to take the fight to Alex Salmond ahead of the independence referendum. Mr . Carmichael, who admits his personality can be 'volatile', is seen as a . sharp, witty, blunt-speaking figure able to take on Mr Salmond.

Troublemakers arrested for being drunk and disorderly could be sent on a course to boost their self-esteem - at taxpayers’ expense. Under the scheme, offenders can be arrested up to five times and still escape court proceedings provided they attend a one-day session designed to help them reflect on their self image. The course will be launched next month in York, reportedly a flagship measure in the local council's effort to curb the city’s growing binge drinking culture. Self image: As part of the taxpayer-funded course, those arrested for being drunk and disorderly in York will be encouraged to reflect on their behaviour in an effort to boost their self-esteem (file image) Council bosses say rather than just focus on booze the 18-month pilot scheme will encourage the troublemakers to reflect on their 'behaviour and self-image'. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'This is a farcical waste of taxpayers’ money...Those who go out, get tanked up and then disrupt the peace should be dealt with by the police, not sent on a self-image course.' He added: 'Politicians should focus on easing the burden on ordinary, responsible drinkers rather than mollycoddling those causing trouble.' A council report says: 'The project will be aimed at York residents who have been arrested for public order and drunkenness offences (maximum of 5 offences).' 'Those who are alcohol dependent, who have mental health issues or are prolific offenders, will be excluded... The individual will be bailed for 14 days and then given the option to attend a day long course, in which case the bail will be cancelled,' it added. 'If the option of the course is not taken up, then the person will be charged for the offence,' the report went on. The course will be provided by Lifeline and will encourage people to reflect on their behaviour and self-image, rather than purely alcohol issues. As part of the scheme, students at York University will be given tips on sensible drinking due to concerns about the number of drunken freshers clogging up York Hospital's A&E department (pictured) Previous studies have shown that the impact of the course lasts for about a year, after which participants typically go back to offending. The report say once 12 months have passed, text message alerts (written by themselves on the course) after this time to keep up motivation,' the report adds.

Sham marriage scams are a massive loophole in Britain’s border controls and provide a ‘golden ticket’ for anyone wanting to stay in the country, a report has warned. Most commonly, the marriages are between ‘awayday brides’ from Eastern Europe who come over for a few days to marry and then return to their home countries. Their fake husbands are mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria. It is estimated that between 3,000 and 10,000 fake weddings a year are taking place. Undetected: A suspect is taken into custody during a UK Borders Agency raids into sham marriages . The report by John Vine, the chief inspector of Home Office watchdog Borders and Immigration, said: ‘Many register offices refer few, if any, cases of suspected sham marriage to the Home Office, despite the fact that they have a statutory duty to do so. This means that a significant number of sham marriages may be going undetected.’ One member of staff told inspectors that sham marriage was a ‘massive loophole in the immigration rules at the moment’. Such was the lack of concern at being caught, many fraudsters still turned up for a marriage even when uniformed immigration officials were in the register office building. Another loophole is the Church of England, whose clergymen are not required by law to report suspicious weddings. One senior Home Office manager said in the report that getting residency through sham marriage was akin to a ‘golden ticket’. Loophole: A huge number of sham marriages are going undetected, despite a statutory duty for registry officers to report them to the Home Office . Borders and Immigration inspector . Carol-Ann Sweeney told the Mail: ‘There are large, diverse cities in the . Midlands and elsewhere where there are none or very low levels of . reporting.’ She added: ‘It is much more difficult to deal with them once . they have been married.’ Anyone . who enters a bogus relationship successfully can use it to stay in . Britain for five years and eventually obtain citizenship. Mr Vine called for beefed up enforcement teams and more efforts to encourage reporting. A . Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is already taking action to . crack down on those who abuse the marriage system to cheat our . immigration system. And we are determined to do more. Problem: An enforcement operation at Brent register office, north west London, found arrests were made for sham marriages nearly every day . If a sham marriage goes through undetected, the couple gain British residency for five years and can then apply for a permanent residency . ‘Registrars . have a duty to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office and . we are working more closely with the General Register Office to increase . awareness. ‘The . Immigration Bill will introduce new measures to give our officers and . registrars more time to investigate, prosecute and remove those . attempting to stage sham marriages.’ Gerard .

'A few years ago I walked up to my dad and thanked him for molesting me,' Jessop, 43, said this week. 'I didn't thank him because I enjoyed it. I thanked him because I look back on everything I've been through, and I decided that I was going to wrap it around me and embrace every memory, every act, all of it, and build myself out of those ashes.'

Break away: Flora Jessop, 43, left the Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - 'one of the most dangerous polygamist cults in America' - at 16. She is the star of new TLC series Escaping the Prophet . She added in the interview with Huffington Post: 'Because I figure, everything I've gone through has enabled me to understand the children I fight for everyday.' Her father didn't respond and when she sees him now, while visiting her nieces and nephews, he immediately leaves the room. Brandon Jeffs, Warren Jeffs' nephew, also stars in the reality show and spoke out about the molestation he suffered at the hands of his uncle when he was just five. Years of painful physical and emotional abuse followed, he said. He said he first started to question the ways of the church at age 12 when he went to the grocery store with one of his mothers and was helped by a clerk named Nancy. He said he realized she was not a devil, as the cult claimed people in the outside world were. She also made him realize that women were equals not inferior to men.

Brandon Jeffs, who was being groomed to be a 'god' and take up the leadership reigns from his older male relatives, managed to flee at age 15. Jessop said she knew she was different from the other girls within the cult from an early age. 'You're raised inside the FLDS as a girl to believe your responsibility is to have one baby per year to build your husband's kingdom because he is going to be a god,' she explained. 'All of my sisters would sit around an talk about how they wanted to have 30 babies and I swore I was never having more than two children because in my child mind I could grab one under each arm and run. 'If I had three babies I would have to stand there and take the abuse they dolled out and I wasn't willing to jeopardize my children.' Interestingly, despite the abuse she . suffered at the hands of her father, she said she didn't come out of the . experience despising men. 'I . went through the sexual abuse by my father all of that but I didn't . come out of this hating men, I came out it hating women and it took me . 16 years to trust my first female after leaving the cult,' Jessop told . Huffington Post. She said this was because the men - the gods - leave the house because they can't stand the sound of babies crying. Seized: Temple of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints at the Yearning For Zion ranch in Eldorado, Texas. The compound has been seized by the state of Texas after underage girls were abused there . 'The women are the enforcers. When you take all these women and you place them together and they share one man... the brutality on each other and each other's children is insanity. So you learn to hate women.' She said she did the TV show because she wanted to spread the word of the atrocities she faced and hundreds of children continue to face daily. 'I wanted this show to come out because I wanted to reach victims everywhere,' she said. In TLC's series Escaping the Prophet, she works with law enforcement and inside informants to assist runaways as they cut ties with the cult led by the infamous Jeffs - 'a world of unquestioned authority, arranged marriage, and little contact to the outside world.' The series, which will be in six one-hour parts, sees her helping different members as they face the possible dangers of leaving the cult, such as being shunned by their families and pursued by leaders of the cult.","Flora Jessop is one of the stars of TLC's new reality TV show 'Escaping the Prophet'

Links: The four horses are believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer Barney Curley . Bookmakers were estimated to have lost millions in just a few hours yesterday after four heavily-backed horses won at races across the country. One bookie has estimated the losses could be as high as £15million, but other industry estimates have suggested about £2million could have been lost. Each of the horses were believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer Barney Curley. Bookmakers had been on red-alert from early morning after latching on to the well-backed quartet, all of which were returning from lengthy absences and struck at Lingfield, Catterick and Kempton. A Paddy Powers spokesman told The Mirror the Irish bookmaker believed the industry could have lost £15m. But David Williams, of Ladbrokes, said: 'It was a bad day at the office, nothing more and nothing less. 'We dodged most of the early morning frenzy but you can’t stop moving trains and we got caught up in some of it as the day panned out. 'Suggestions of a multi-million pound bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we’re not going to lunge for the violins just yet. 'Our decision not to price the Kempton races up until as late as possible helped protect us from the worst of it and we certainly weren’t exposed to any of the overnight business where most of the fancy prices were snapped up. 'We are satisfied that the systems we . have in place at our end are sufficient to protect us as best we can . from circumstances like today. 'Ultimately we have a responsibility to keep on top of the rumours and trade accordingly, which we managed to do.' Well backed: Seven Summits - ridden by Craig Nichol - wins over the jumps at Catterick on Wednesday . Coral’s David Stevens said: 'Although we avoided laying some of the larger prices overnight, we did see a number of multiple bets featuring these four horses both online and in shops, and throughout the day this number increased as word of the gamble that was taking place gathered momentum. 'Victory for all four horses has cost us a six-figure payout, and based on our losses we would estimate the industry has been hit for something in the region of £2million, which although still costly, is perhaps lower than some claims.' Rory Jiwani for Stan James said: 'We . had one punter who took £100k out of us before we slashed the odds. So . it was a bad day, but not horrific by any stretch.' Bet365 . priced up the races early, and any punter who got on with a £1 . accumulator bet at the reported prices relating to the four particular . horses linked to Curley could have expected to pick up around £13,000, . although not all firms marked up the races in the morning or overnight. Curley could not be contacted by Press Association Sport. The . first horse to win was Eye Of The Tiger at Lingfield, who went off at . Evens favourite having been at 20-1 the previous evening. Strong runner: Low Key, ridden by Liam Keniry, wins the Handicap Stakes at Kempton . He had not run for 481 days and had not beaten a horse on his last four runs. He was previously trained by Curley but is now in the care of Dan Donovan, who trains at a Curley-owned stable in Newmarket. Mr . Donovan, who denied any knowledge of the bets placed on Eye of The . Tiger, said: 'We have had him seven months and have had problems with . him but he is a genuine horse.' 'Suggestions of a multi-million pound . bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we’re not going to lunge for . the violins just yet' - David Williams, of Ladbrokes . The Lingfield stewards held an inquiry into the apparent improvement in form of Eye Of The Tiger. Officials heard from Mr Donovan, who stated that the horse had been in his care for seven months having previously been trained by Curley and its absence from the track was due to back problems and a near fore tendon injury. Having heard his evidence, and received comments from the handicapper, the explanation was noted and Eye Of The Tiger was ordered to be routine tested. Like Eye Of The Tiger, the Sophie Leech-trained Seven Summits was a former Curley inmate and won its race at Catterick. The 9-4 favourite, which had been off the track since finishing third in a novice event at Fontwell in June, won by a length and a half under jockey Paul Moloney. Ms Leech’s husband, Christian, told Racing UK: 'He’s bandaged in exercise and when he’s in his stables and we just have to mind him very carefully, that’s why he’s got so few miles on the clock. 'I didn’t (have any money on). Someone just said that (there had been a gamble). He was 7-2, 4-1 in the paper anyway and Tony Carroll’s was very well fancied and that was a non-runner, so I’m not sure about that. I don’t know.' Mr Donovan also trained the third leg of the accumulator, Indus Valley, who was sent off at 4-6 favourite on his first run for 700 days. He had also been available at 20-1 the night before the race. Mr Donovan said: 'He only just scrapped into this race with his mark of 45 and I ran him here last year and he pulled way too hard. He has always shown ability but we were lucky the second just turned it in.' He was also interviewed by the Kempton stewards, stating that Indus Valley had been trained on his own following a year’s break, as he was known to be a hard puller in his previous races, and was better suited by being dropped back to six furlongs. The explanation was noted and the gelding ordered to be routine tested. The gamble was completed by John Butler-trained Low Key at Kempton who was returned the 7-4 on favourite on his first start since finishing seventh of seven over two miles at Southwell last February. Quizzed by the stewards, Mr Butler stated that Low Key had been gelded since its last run and had benefited from the drop in class. His evidence was noted and the horse routine tested. William Hill said it saw trickles of money for some of the runners on Tuesday night, coupled with new accounts opening and various permutations attempted across the group of runners, but estimated only a £200,000 group-wide pay-out. British Horseracing Authority spokesman Robin Mounsey said: 'We were aware of, and have been monitoring, the situation today. In the cases of those horses who have shown an improvement in form an inquiry was held by the stipendiary stewards and all horses were routine tested. 'It is BHA policy not to comment on specific investigations or speculation surrounding potential investigations, however an investigation would only occur if there is any evidence of Rules being breached.'

"By . Laura Kemp . PUBLISHED: . 16:38 EST, 22 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:15 EST, 23 January 2014 . After spending just 30 minutes at my desk, I'm already rosy-cheeked and glowing. Not from the joy of settling down to get some work done on my latest novel, but because I'm using the very latest fitness import from the U.S. as I type. Treadmill desks - a small treadmill you plonk under your existing desk, or a table with an inbuilt one - have gone down such a storm with big corporations like Google and Facebook that they are now making their way over here. Set at about 2mph (the pace of a slow walk) they burn up to 150 calories an hour while not distracting you from your work. Their soaring popularity is thanks to growing research that says sitting down all day is killing us. Just last week a study found that middle-aged women who are inactive for 11 hours a day are 12 per cent more likely to die prematurely and nearly 30 per cent more at risk from heart disease. Scroll down for video . Walk while you work: Laura tests out the Office Fitness desk . Sitting affects the body in a number of negative ways. For a start, your calorie-burning rate plunges by a third to around one calorie a minute, and you produce fewer of the enzymes that affect how fat is stored and sugar processed, leading to weight gain. High blood pressure, some cancers, diabetes and even depression have all been linked to sedentary lifestyles. And thanks to computers, TVs, laptops and cars, the average person now spends 12 hours a day sitting down. Add seven hours of being horizontal while we sleep, and that leaves very little time for being upright. So could these radical new work stations be the answer? As a 39-year-old, work-from-home mum who struggles to find time to go to the gym - or even leave the house - I jump at the chance to try the Office Fitness desk (£899). I'm 5ft 4ins and 9st 7lbs so I could do with shifting a few pounds, and sitting leaves me feeling lethargic and bloated. My enthusiasm dims somewhat after two fiddly, expletive-ridden hours of assembling the thing in my lounge. But once I've stepped on to the treadmill, which stands under a height-adjustable desk in place of a chair, my excitement began to build. Job training: Standing up for three hours a day, five days a week, will burn 750 extra calories, which over a year equates to running ten marathons . Like mothers the world over, I'm used to juggling several tasks at once, but work and exercise is a new one for me. With a '3-2-1', the monitor provided a countdown and I was off on a 2 mph stroll. Admittedly that's very slow, but any faster and it would be impossible to tap away on the keyboard at the same time, and I would probably fall off the treadmill from the effort of coordinating brain and legs. It takes me about 15 minutes to get used to the motion, and each time I lose my balance, I have to hold on to the desk and spend a few minutes correcting my mistakes from hitting the wrong keys. It's a lot like learning to drive - trying to move your feet independently of your hands. There is also the problem of dizziness when you step off the treadmill, but that is short-lived. However, that night, I slept far better, found it easier to get up in the morning and felt far calmer during the day. Hard labour . The treadmill was invented in 1818 as a 'human hamster wheel' to punish prisoners . By day three, that initial vertigo had been replaced by a feeling of real achievement as I dismounted, knowing I'd woven some exercise into my busy day without much effort or disruption. In fact, I'd walked a total of 15 miles without even realising it. When you've got the hang of it, you don’t forget you're walking on a treadmill, but it feels totally normal. It's only when a child or husband walks in laughing at the sight of you that you realise you do look a little ridiculous. It's a small price to pay, however, for being able to burn off biscuits tone muscles, improve posture and boost metabolism. The statistics are impressive: standing up for three hours a day, five days a week, will burn 750 extra calories, which over a year equates to running ten marathons. Apparently there are benefits to your mind and productivity, too. Working at a standing desk can apparently increase your output by 10 per cent because your mind is more focused when your body is upright. Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin were all advocates, albeit without any treadmill device underneath. I certainly found my work rate increasing - when I would have taken a break if I'd been sitting at a desk, I felt so caught up in the rhythm of the treadmill that I carried on. The noisy whirr of the belt slid into the background after a while, and I was able to immerse myself in my writing. But since you're advised to spend no more than two to three hours a day on the treadmill because of the risk of repetitive strain injury, I eventually had to step off. Our writer soon got the hang of working and walking but the equipment is bulky to keep in a house . My apparatus is just one of the many products exploding on to the market after the American Medical Association recommended businesses offered their employees alternatives to sitting. Now there are standing and bike desks, Swiss ball chairs and even table-tennis meeting tables. Google is one company in California's Silicon Valley that offers its staff alternatives to seats. Facebook is another, with design recruiter Greg Hoy telling the Wall Street Journal that workers' energy levels soared when they used standing desks, and his own 3pm energy slump had long gone. But it's likely we'll have to wait a while for most British bosses to see standing at work as anything other than a gimmick. The ultimate test is whether I'd I buy one of these gadgets myself. If I was lucky enough to live in a mansion, the answer would be yes, because size is definitely the issue. The desk I tried was super-heavy and 1.8m long. It needs a permanent home, preferably in a spare room-cum-office, and its beech finish won't be to everyone's taste. But having it in the house does encourage other family members to use it and improve their fitness, too. I even caught my six-year-old son, Paddy, having a go while playing on the iPad. Once the novelty had worn off though, he wasn't at all pleased that his 'football pitch' - otherwise known as the lounge - had disappeared under this unwieldy contraption. A quick word of advice for anyone taking the plunge - remember to tell anyone who phones you that you're on a treadmill in case they think they've caught you in a marital tryst. And if you're going to drink coffee, invest in a tightly lidded mug.

Five years ago, he had to give up work because he suffers from fibromyalgia syndrome, a condition which causes debilitating pain and extreme tiredness. But he's fired up by his love of cars and satisfies his passion by designing and adapting motorbikes for disabled people. 'I have mobility issues,' said Nick. 'I also get chronic fatigue.

'I can make anything out of metal,' he said. 'I really enjoy it. I'm adapting this different trike as a favour for my friend who can't reach the pedals with his false leg.' Since serving in Ireland and Germany as a radio control sector commander – full corporal – with the 2nd Armoured Division – he has also designed and built petrol go-karts for children and all-terrain vehicles. In June he hopes to ride to Scotland to raise money for the National Association of Bikers with Disabilities (NABD), which provides training and grants advice to disabled riders to get them back on their bikes. Through NABD's network of national bike clubs and local radio stations, he plans to raise funds through donation and by selling passenger rides on his trike. 'I plan to do 50 miles per day,' he said. 'As long as I don't overdo it and take my medication I should be fine.' Nick will drive his vehicle from Land's End to John O'Groats. The General Lee is the Dodge Charger driven by the Duke cousins Bo and Luke in the television series The Dukes of Hazzard. It is known for its signature horn, its chases and stunts - especially its long and high jumps - and for having its doors welded shut, leaving the Dukes to climb in and out through the windows.

This is a) because he is at that age, and b) because he is a huge fan of Miranda Hart, who is always making jokes about her bosoms - or the ‘Mir-udders’, as her on-screen mother Patricia Hodge calls them. His favourite is the one about the 'bosom clap'. That's when your bosoms are so large and pendulous they make a clapping sound when you turn over in bed. 'Has that ever happened to you?' he asked, sniggering. That's the thanks I get for all those endless hours of breastfeeding. Sarah admits there are times when you will want to work your cleavage - so don't neglect it in your beauty regime . I don't imagine that the Downton Abbey actress Michelle Dockery suffers from the breast clap; nevertheless, her frontage was not much enhanced by the plunging neckline she wore at the Screen Actors Guild Awards earlier this week. It was one of those dresses that, had it worked, would have broken the prim Lady Mary typecasting once and for all (perhaps that’s why she chose it). Except she didn't quite carry it off. The problem with very low cut dresses like that is they are designed either for very small, very neat breasts or for the kind of fake ones more commonly on show in Hollywood. And since Miss Dockery has neither, the result was simply an ill-fitting outfit and an actress who looked rather uncomfortable. Still, it got her noticed. Taking the plunge: Michelle Dockery wore a revealing dress to the Screen Actors Guild Awards . Whatever shape and size frontage you happen to possess, there are times when you're going to want to work it. And although the general (mostly male) consensus seems to be that bigger is better, the reality is that a shapely frontage is not only harder to dress than a more demure one; it also requires a good deal more maintenance. The key thing is to treat your cleavage as you would your face. The skin on your chest is very delicate, and as we age and things start to slide south, it's one of the first places to start going a bit crinkly. It's also an area that gets a fair amount of UV exposure, even if you are not directly sunbathing. Use an illuminator to give the cleavage some glow . There are, of course, plenty of bust creams around, many of which make some frankly outrageous claims. But unless you are tackling a specific breast problem, such as stretch marks, for day-to-day use apply your normal face cream, plus a good suncream. For evenings and special occasions, you might want to add a little lustre. I find that mixing a bit of my trusty Nars Orgasm Illuminator (I know, sorry, but I didn't name it) with any old body cream gives a lovely subtle glow, just enough to make the skin look dewy, but not so much that you look like a glitterball. Alternatively, you can invest in a bottle of Nuxe Dry Oil Golden Shimmer (£21, marksandspencer.com), which is also wonderful on bare legs. One of the least flattering things is a long cleavage, the sort of thing that looks like you might be able to park a small bicycle in it. This is fairly easy to remedy: you just need to choose your bra carefully. The secret is to make sure the bit in the middle sits snugly on your sternum; if it doesn't, it's either the wrong size or the wrong shape for your breasts. Also, choose a full cup style rather than a cutaway. Until relatively recently, bras like this only came in nun-like nylon. Lately, though, even the more matronly among us have been able to prettify our underwear drawers. Panache (from bravissimo.com) is an especially good range, and incredibly hard-wearing; while Playtex's Flower Lace range expertly combines functionality with flirtatiousness. Pink lady: Gwen Stefani . I don't know about you, but this is the time of year when I need to make a really superhuman effort not to lose the will to live. It’s dark, it’s cold and it  feels like it’s been January for ever. Time for a change. Sadly, the Seychelles isn't on the cards any time soon. So I shall just have to settle for sunshine in make-up form:  the spring/summer collections. Nothing like a bit of June jollity to liven up a dreary January. This year, it's even more fun because, basically, it's all about pink. But not anaemic pastels or sparkly fairy pink. Grown-up pink. Strong, vibrant shades that pack a punch; racy roses and febrile fuchsias. It's one of those trends that looks great on the models; but how do you translate it into everyday use? First stop, Bobbi Brown. Season after season, Brown somehow manages to distil the catwalks into something we can all use. This time it's Illuminating Powder in Antigua (£27), a fine dusting of versatile colour (eyes, cheeks, face) as soft as baby's breath, that makes tired winter skin bloom like a spring rose. CRUSH... Cover FX CC Cream (£32, Harvey Nichols). Treats, corrects and protects skin. No gluten, mineral oil, fragrance, parabens or talc — so it won’t irritate. FAIL... Selfies, belfies - and now beaufies. That's when celebrities such as P. Diddy share pictures of themselves in pampering mode, above. TMI (Too Much Instagram), guys. YSL's super luxurious Flower Crush . Palette (£42.50) is more of a shimmery, sandy desert pink, ideal for . very fair skins that don’t need a lot of colour or if you like that . glossy Studio 54 look. For lips, Estee Lauder’s Colour Envy Sculpting Lipsticks (£24) come in three great pinks of increasing intensity: Powerful, Infamous and Dominant, all fortified with plumping ingredients. Pop star Gwen Stefani is queen of the bright lip, and her new polish collection for OPI is hot to trot. Hey Babe (£11) is the pink to have, a fluorescent fuchsia definitely not for shrinking violets. Lastly, don't be afraid to wear pink on your eyes: it's surprisingly flattering, and can make you look wide awake and wonderfully fresh. Bourgeois's Little Round Pots are some of the best quality eyeshadows around for the money - just £6.99 from boots.com. Rose Macaron is the one to get: good enough to eat.","Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery recently wore dress with plunging neckline .

Experts have become the first people to board the Costa Concordia cruise liner since it sank off the coast of Isola del Giglio, Italy, in an attempt to investigate whether there are more facts about the ship's sinking left to be discovered. The team of investigators is to do a full sweep of the ship in order to see if there is any information about its sinking that isn't contained in the prosecutor's case against its captain. Any information found could potentially add to the defence of Captain Francesco Shettino, who has been under intense scrutiny since the ship sank on January 13, 2012, killing 32 people. The stricken Costa Concordia cruise ship remains in the water in Isola del Giglio, Italy, over two years after it was shipwrecked on the coast . The investigators climb from boat to boat. Precautions have to be made to ensure the safety of the investigators as they travel through the wreckage . A great deal of the ship is rusting away, as it has been sitting off of the coast for over two years. A large part of the ship was under the ocean for a long period of time, as shown by the damage to its balconies. One of the key areas of interest is the ship's backup generator, which failed when the ship first wrecked. Experts, judges and lawyers walk along one of the decks of the ill-fated Costa Concordia as they embark on the inspection mission . Flood lights illuminate the decks of the Costa Concordia as preparations are made for the group of technical experts and judges to make the inspection . Today the team examined the the bridge and lifts in the ship, investigating whether there were any factors present at the time of the shipwreck, beyond human error, that could have contributed to it sinking. Next month the experts are planning to examine the cruise liner's emergency generator. A judge granted the request for the onboard evaluation to collect evidence sought by Schettino's defence, as well as evidence required by a consumer group representing victims of the shipwreck. Shettino is currently the only person who has been put on trial, but his defence, among others, claim that Costa Crociere SpA, the ships owner, bear some of the responsibility. The team of inspectors are strapped to the decks with rows and rows of guide lines, keeping them safe in the wrecked hulk, which since its sinking has become riddled with rust . Part of the team circulate around the ship, preparing to board the hulking wreckage of the Costa Concordia for the first time since it sank . The stricken Costa Concordia cruise ship remains in the water on in a picture taken yesterday in Isola del Giglio, Italy. The former captain of the ship is currently the only person on trial since the ship sank. As a part of their sweep, experts are examining the lifts of the Costa Concordia first, but it is only a small part of their entire investigation . The cost for the towing and salvaging operation for the giant wreck is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions, providing a lucrative contract for the company that eventually gets the offer . A week ago the waters around the Costa Concordia were full of coats containing the relatives of victims of the wreck, who joined together at the behest of the authorities to hold a vigil in remembrance . The captain is currently standing trial in the Tuscan town of Grosseto, having been charged with multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship. The experts will be the first to explore the ship since it was wrecked over two years ago, only a week after survivors and relatives of victims held a vigil on January 13 in remembrance. The 114,000-ton ship was finally removed from the rocks last September in the most expensive salvage operation of its kind, and currently stands on 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms that are being used to keep it stable. Soon, the vessel will be towed away and dismantled, an operation thought to cost £496 million by the time it is removed. Earlier this month it was revealed a British port is in the running to dismantle the ship. Able Seaton Port on Teeside, near Hartlepool, has been asked to submit a proposal for the vast demolition project, which is expected to take 200 people two years to complete. It estimated value of the contract is more than €300 million. Earlier this month there were rumours that a British company stood a good chance of netting the contract for salvaging the wreck, as they were asked to prepare and present a proposition to the authorities for the specifications of their potential operation . This trip by experts and legal officials is the first of many which hopes to gain evidence, if any, of circumstances beyond human error that might have led to the shipwreck . The wreck of the Costa Concordia does not sit that far off the coast, which has made it a target for people wishing to salvage it illegally. This has meant that authorities have had to keep an eye on it . The 114,000-ton ship currently stands on 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms that are being used to keep the ship stable so that it can be safely boarded and explored by the legal and engineering experts .","Engineers and legal experts will inspect the Costa Concordia to look for cause for the shipwreck beyond human error .

Ms Burton, from Lancing in Sussex, changed shifts to make sure she was on duty at Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, when Louise Whitmore gave birth to her baby boy.

Thrilled: Caroline Burton (right) celebrates with Louise Whitmore (left) and baby Zachary after her win . 11 months earlier, Ms Burton had stayed beyond her shift to comfort Louise, 43, and her husband Marc, during the birth of their stillborn daughter. Ms Burton then volunteered to be with the Whitmore family for the birth of Zachary - despite not being on shift and having to arrange extra childcare for her own son. Mrs Whitmore said: 'For my son's birth, Caroline volunteered to be with us from the beginning of my induction despite not being on shift. 'She dealt with practical issues which caused me great anxiety and cared for my husband too and really took time to understand me and my family.

The grocery store manager walked 45 minutes to his car and drove another 30 minutes to the hospital - doctors couldn’t believe his story. Mr Hauge, 31, told NBC Montana the snake had no rattle to warn him, something he called a ‘freak coincidence.’ Strong willed: Jason Hauge walked almost an hour, only to drive 30 minutes to a local hospital after being bitten by a rattlesnake . ‘[The snake] happened to be coming out of the tall grass to sun himself right there on that little island,’ Hauge told the station. ‘I mean, I would have seen him had he been curled up and ready to spring at me – but he wasn't.’ Realizing time was of the essence, Hauge started making his way back to his car, almost an hour away on-foot. The bite didn’t hurt, but the venom soon started taking its toll. ‘I could see it started bleeding, it felt like someone was shoving a soldering iron into the side of leg,’ Hauge said. Painful: 'It felt like someone was shoving a hot sodlering iron into my leg,' Hauge said . Explaining to the station that he’s lived in Montana long enough to know the effects of rattlesnakes, Hauge said he kept telling himself ‘okay, I need to get to the hospital.’ The remote wilderness of Montana doesn’t have reliable cell phone coverage, forcing Hauge to walk 45 minutes to his car before driving another half hour to a local hospital, astonishing doctors. ‘They were pretty amazed, I guess, that I had walked and that I was still standing,’ said Hauge.

About 20 per cent of the snake's bites are lethal if untreated, according to the University of Adelaide. Though Hauge won’t stop enjoying the outdoors, he told the station he might not hit the river anytime soon. ‘I don't think I will do much differently.

A Chinese man has been executed for keeping six women in a dungeon as sex slaves and killing two of them, state media reported. The official Xinhua news agency said that Li Hao had been convicted of murder, rape, illegal detention, organized prostitution and making pornography for profit in 2012. The 35-year-old, from Henan province, was sentenced to death in March 2012 for keeping the women in his grim tiny cellar and for his role in the murder of two of them . The local government clerk had built a dungeon in his basement where he forced the women to work as prostitutes. Police were quoted as saying that Li coerced them to kill two others who had been forced to work as sex slaves alongside them. The death penalty had been approved by the Supreme People's Court, Xinhua said, after a higher court upheld the sentence handed down by the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court in November 2012. Li was executed 'according to law' after meeting relatives in a detention house in Luoyang, Henan province, a statement issued by the Supreme People's Court said, according to Xinhua. Three of the women he held were given leniency for their role in the two murders. One received three years and the two others were put on probation. Eventually, one of the women managed to escape and she went to the police. An investigation revealed that Li created the basement in 2009 and held the women for between two to 21 months. During their incarceration he repeatedly raped them, forced them to have sex with other men for money and made them perform in pornographic web shows. Before they were tricked into going to Li's dungeon, the women had all worked at nightclubs and karaoke bars. Scroll down for video .

A Mexican national was executed on Wednesday night in Texas for killing a Houston police officer, despite pleas and diplomatic pressure from the Mexican government and the U.S. State Department to halt the punishment. Edgar Tamayo, 46, received a lethal injection for the January 1994 fatal shooting of Officer Guy Gaddis, 24. Asked by a warden if he had a final statement, he mumbled 'no' and shook his head. As the lethal dose of pentobarbital began taking effect, he took a few breaths and then made one slightly audible snore before all movement stopped. Scroll down for video . Edgar Tamayo, 46, was executed on Wednesday night in Texas for killing Houston police officer Guy Gaddis in 1994 . He was pronounced dead 17 minutes after the drug was administered, at 9:32 p.m. CST. Tamayo . never looked toward Gaddis' mother, two brothers and two other . relatives who watched through a window. He selected no witnesses of his . own. Several dozen police . officers and supporters of the slain patrolman revvied their motorcycles . outside the prison before witnesses were let inside the death chamber. The . execution, the first this year in the nation's most active death . penalty state, came after the U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal . courts rejected last-day appeals and Texas officials spurned arguments . that Tamayo's case was tainted because he wasn't informed, under an . international agreement, that he could get legal help from the Mexican . consulate after his arrest for the officer's slaying. Tamayo's weeping cousin Edelmira Arias was amongst a group of his relatives who gather at his parents  home in Miacatlan, Mexico, while he was being executed in Texas . Attorneys had also argued unsuccessfully that Tamayo was mentally impaired, making him ineligible for execution, and that the state's clemency procedures were unfair. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Tuesday had rejected Tamayo's request for clemency. 'It doesn't matter where you're from,' Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said. 'If you commit a despicable crime like this in Texas, you are subject to our state laws, including a fair trial by jury and the ultimate penalty.' Gaddis, who had been on the force for two years, was driving Tamayo and another man from a robbery scene when evidence showed the officer was shot three times in the head and neck with a pistol Tamayo had concealed in his pants. The car crashed, and Tamayo fled on foot but was captured a few blocks away, still in handcuffs, carrying the robbery victim's watch and wearing the victim's necklace. Mexican officials and Tamayo's attorneys contend he was protected under a provision of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Protestors calling for a stay of execution gathered to sing and chant outside the prison unit where Edgar Tamayo was executed in Huntsville, Texas on Wednesday night . Legal assistance guaranteed under that treaty could have uncovered evidence to contest the capital murder charge or provide evidence to keep Tamayo off death row, they said. Records show the consulate became involved or aware of the case just as his trial was to begin. Secretary of State John Kerry previously asked Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to delay Tamayo's punishment, saying it 'could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries.' The State Department repeated that stance on Wednesday. But Abbott's office and the Harris County district attorney opposed any delays. At least two other inmates in circumstances similar to Tamayo's were executed in Texas in recent years. The family of slain Houston Police officer Guy Gaddis enters the prison unit to witness the execution of  Edgar Tamayo in Huntsville, Texas, on Wednesday night . The Mexican government said in a statement this week it 'strongly opposed' the execution and said failure to review Tamayo's case and reconsider his sentence would be 'a clear violation by the United States of its international obligations.' Tamayo was in the U.S. illegally and had a criminal record in California, where he had served time for robbery and was paroled, according to prison records. He was among more than four dozen Mexican nationals awaiting execution in the U.S. when the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled in 2004 they hadn't been advised properly of their consular rights.

'Treat patients like people': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will outline plans for just one doctor to take charge of each patient in hospital . NHS patients should be treated as people rather than a collection of body parts, Jeremy Hunt will tell doctors today. The Health Secretary warns that hospital care has become a series of ‘brief encounters’ with staff and calls for the end of ‘ping pong’ referrals that leaves patients feeling ‘like parcels’. He will today announce plans for a single doctor to take charge of each patient from the minute they are admitted to the second they are discharged. Calling for a ‘culture change’ in the NHS, Mr Hunt will say: ‘That means reasserting a simple truth: every patient is a person. ‘A person with a name. A  person with a family. Not just a body harbouring a pathology; not a diagnostic puzzle; not a four-hour target or an 18-week problem; not a cost pressure – and most certainly not a “bed-blocker”.’ Mr Hunt will say he has seen countless examples where care has simply concentrated on ‘a part of the body where things had gone wrong’. The Mail revealed last month that the NHS will once again write the name of the doctor responsible for each patient above their bed. Mr Hunt will use a speech at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospital in London today to go further, saying that ‘whole-stay doctors’ should take charge of a patient’s entire period in hospital – rather than pass them from one consultant to another. The Health Secretary will cite evidence from the US which found that doing so leads to lower rates of readmission and fewer cases of heart failure and pneumonia. He will also call for doctors to draw up fresh plans to reduce the number of ward transfers. Evidence shows that for elderly patients, every change of ward lengthens the average stay in that ward by more than a day. 'Ping pong' referrals: Mr Hunt wants to end the practice of passing patients from one consultant to another . ‘The basic principle should be care being organised around where the patient is, not patients organised around where the care is,’ he will say. ‘I want to see proper, seamless discharge handovers from named consultants to named GPs with direct communication between both parties that ensures care is never interrupted.’ A Royal College of Physicians survey found that nearly a quarter of consultants rated their hospital’s ability to deliver continuity of care as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. Mr Hunt will call for hospitals to rethink doctors’ rotas and indicate that the Government will challenge EU working time edicts to improve 24-hour care and weekend cover. U.S. studies have found that having 'whole-stay doctors' who oversea patients from the moment they are admitted to when they are discharged lowers rates of readmission and heart failure . He will say: ‘One doctor told me that hospital care today has become a series of brief encounters. Another said there has been a loss of long-term relationships because the way rotas worked meant you often never saw the same patient twice. Someone else spoke of a ping pong of referrals.’ The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges has been asked to develop guidance on how to implement the changes by March. Professor Norman Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, welcomed a more ‘streamlined and compassionate’ approach to care. He added: ‘We have to end the situation where patients are shuttled from one member of staff to another with no one individual taking responsibility for ensuring they receive the right treatment at the right time and in the right place.’","Jeremy Hunt says hospital care is now just a series of 'brief encounters' with staff - leaving patients feeling 'like parcels'

IOC President Thomas Bach met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff . and said he feels 'very confident' in the preparations for the 2016 . Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. But . Bach acknowledged once again that Brazil has no time to lose and must . speed up work for the first Olympics in South America. Rio's . preparations have been plagued by delays, the late approval of an . operating budget and concerns about water pollution in Olympic venues . for sailing, canoeing, rowing, and distance swimming. IOC members have talked openly about their worries and have constantly urged Rio organizers to move faster. 'We are very confident,' Bach said . after talks with Rousseff in Brasilia.

Bach is making his first visit to Brazil since being elected president of the International Olympic Committee in September. 'I came here in full confidence that these Olympic Games will be exciting and brilliant Olympic Games,' Bach said. An airplane descends above the polluted shoreline of Guanabara Bay outside Antnio Carlos Jobim International Airport . RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL - JANUARY 21:  Debris sits along the polluted waters of Guanabara Bay outside Antnio Carlos Jobim International Airport . The iconic bay will be the site of sailing events during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . Although Rio's Olympic bid included the promise to clean up the filthy bay, industrial and human pollution still remain a major problem . 'After . this meeting I can inform you that my confidence is even stronger now . because I'm really greatly impressed by the strong commitment of the . president to these games and by the leadership she's showing.' The German was upbeat after meeting with Rousseff and said the Olympics would make Rio an even better city. 'I'm sure that after these Olympic Games the people of Rio and the people of Brazil will say - like for instance the people of Barcelona or the people of Munich - there is a Rio de Janeiro before the Olympic Games, and there is an even better city - if in Rio de Janeiro's case that is possible - there is an even better city after the Olympic Games.' After a long delay, Rio organizers are expected in the next few days to announce an operating budget. The original bid document listed the operating budget at $2.8 billion. Bid cities usually underestimate the costs, and observers expect the Rio operating budget to grow. The operating budget is to run the games themselves. About $11 billion more in public and private money will be spent on games-related projects, costs reflected in a separate capital budget. 'I can assure you this will be a very reasonable operational budget,' Bach said. 'The organizing committee is working very hard to respect the budget limitations and to make it really reasonable.' Disagreements over the budget have gone on for months, with national, state and local governments debating who pays what. This is also an election year with Rousseff facing voters in October. Public spending on the World Cup and Olympics has become sensitive since protests last year during the Confederations Cup. Many Brazilians ask why billions are spent on two mega sports events when the country lacks good schools and hospitals. Rio's chief operating officer, Leo Gryner, said in August that $700 million in public money would be needed to balance the operating budget. Since then, chief executive officer Sidney Levy, who took over a year ago, said the $700 million would not be needed with some new income expected from local sponsorships.","Guanabara Bay is one of the iconic sights of Rio de Janeiro .

But walking through the marble entrance hall, past limestone-lined suites and up the original stone staircase, it is hard to imagine that One Cornwall Terrace has ever been home to anyone short of cash. On the market for £100 million, the property is the world’s most expensive terraced house. Situated on the edge of Regent’s Park in Central London, it boasts seven bedrooms, 11 reception rooms, nine bathrooms, a private gym and a garage with number-plate recognition that can accommodate two limousines. Outdoor opulence: One Cornwall Terrace's grand, sweeping staircases certainly give the garden, which occupies half an  acre, the appearance of an extravagant ballroom. The garden is also set below street level, making the space completely private . The Grade I listed building, whose lights are controlled by an iPad, also has a heated indoor swimming pool – set in Portland stone – complete with spa, sauna and his-and-hers changing rooms. The dining room, which has been restored to its former Regency glory, seats 16, while there are two kitchens in an Upstairs, Downstairs-style arrangement. The family kitchen has lantern-style windows, a Portland stone floor and heated window seats. The industrial-sized below-stairs kitchen, where most meals will be prepared, also includes a ‘wine cave’ and cold room. Staff at the neoclassical house, which estate agent Savills describes as ‘one of the most important private residences in London’, have a suite of rooms next to the kitchen. Set in half an acre, the Italianate gardens are below street level and completely private. Thanks to two sweeping staircases, the dramatically lit yard and gardens have the appearance of an external ballroom. Designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton, the construction of the whole of Cornwall Terrace was supervised by John Nash, who designed Buckingham Palace. It was named after King George IV, whose titles included the Duke of Cornwall. Royal connection: Work on the imposing neoclassical front was supervised by John Nash, who designed Buckingham Palace.

One squatter, known only as Katherine, recalled a man brewing beer in the kitchen. ‘Cornwall Terrace was a glamorous break from the dingy squats I was used to,’ she said. ‘There was a lot of people wandering in and out high all the time.’ After the squatters were evicted in the autumn of 1975, Cornwall Terrace was converted into the headquarters of property company British Land. In recent years, the house has changed hands several times. In 2002, it was registered to telecoms millionaire Charles Wigoder.

The Liberian footballer hailed as an inspiration and true patriot has died, penniless, homeless, suffering from a long battle with drugs and alcoholism. George Sacko - known as the Wizard - had entranced his country with his football skills and captaincy. But despite his illustrious career the footballing great, 75, died in a New Jersey hospital on September 17 almost anonymously. Friends and family were not aware of his death for nearly a month afterwards, as the shelter where he was staying did not have accurate records of his stay. A sad end: George Sacko, aka 'Wizard' has passed away in Newark . Soccer days: George Sacko (far left) was a Liberian legend in the 1960s and captain of his team . The midfielder learned to play the game kicking footballs barefoot in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, before serving as captain for Lone Star, the country's national team in the 1960s. Mr Sacko, one of seven children, was hailed as the 'glue' in the team and attracted a diverse audience different ethnic groups and political persuasions, news website NJ.com reported. 'Sacko was very, very important to our . national pride, because he brought us together,' Benedict Wisseh, another Lone Star player, told the website. 'He made us forget our differences.' In his playing career Liberia never qualified for the World Cup, but as captain he led the team to its first victory, a 2-0 result over the Ivory Coast in 1960. A national hero: The midfielder for Lone Star was the darling of his country . Remembering a legend: A friend holds up a jersey with George Sacko's name and number . Yet a debilitating knee injury in 1962 dashed his glittering career and his skills would never be the same afterwards. He received an offer from the New York Generals in 1968, but the deal never went through as the team folded shortly after Mr Sacko's arrival. In 1971, Mr Sacko moved to Brooklyn permanently to live with his brothers. The Wizard: Sacko was an inspirational football captain . His wife June had already been living in the New York borough for several months with their two sons and June’s daughter. She said that even during his heyday as a famous football player, Mr Sacko remained grounded. ‘He was very calm, thoughtful,’ she told NJ.com. He held a good job at a custom metals company in Harrison, New Jersey, which allowed the family to live comfortably. She said that while he always remained a devoted father, ‘the love went away for me.’ She eventually moved back to New York while Mr Sacko stayed in New Jersey, continuing his job at the metals plant until it closed its doors permanently in the 1980s. After that, Mr Sacko began a downward spiral, drinking in excess and using heroin, his brother Garretson told NJ.com. After a fire forced him out of a friend’s apartment, he began living in a cramped, dingy room subsidised by public assistance. He was forced out of the Carlton Hotel after he refused to meet with authorities and in the end, spent his time wandering around Newark’s streets. Memorial: A sign commemorates George Sacko's professional achievements . He spent his nights sleeping at Newark Penn Station - about eight miles outside of New York City. His family encouraged him to come back to Rhode Island where they now lived, but he refused. Family and friends weren’t aware of his passing for nearly a month. 'Something happened in my brother's life. He just didn't care anymore. He was not crazy, but he gave up on life.' -Garretson Sacko . According to the death certificate, the once-brilliant footballer died of natural causes. His lungs were acutely diseased, it said. It also indicated that his upper gastrointestinal tract had started to bleed about a month before his death. In May of this year, the Liberian community honoured the former football player’s 75th birthday at a local Newark restaurant. Last public event: The Liberian government held a luncheon for the 75-year-old player last May. The event flier said Mr Sacko was in good health . While the flier for the occasion boasted that Mr Sacko was ‘in excellent health,’ his brother Garretson said that his brother told him that day that he was sick. ‘Pray for me,’ he said. In September, Mr Sacko made $50 by helping move furniture. It was that money, his brother said, that funded his final purchase - a fatal dose of heroin. ‘He just didn’t care anymore,’ Garretson told the website. ‘He was not crazy, but he gave up on life.’","George Sacko, captain of the Liberian football team in the 1960s, died homeless on the streets of Newark .

"By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 19:15 EST, 18 November 2011 . Much ado about nothing? The Vatican claims Williams Shakespeare was Catholic . The Vatican has reignited the debate over whether playwright William Shakespeare was Catholic by insisting there was 'little doubt he was'. Historians have been in two minds over Shakespeare's faith with splits between whether he was a Roman Catholic or a Protestant and the argument has surfaced again with the release of blockbuster film Anonymous. The political thriller stars Rafe Spall and Rhys Ifans and is set against the backdrop of 16th Century England and controversially claims that Britain's most prolific playwright was in fact a fraud and cover for the then Earl of Oxford. Questions have also long surrounded . his religion and there is little direct evidence of his faith, although . he is buried in the Protestant church of Holy Trinity in Stratford Upon . Avon, historians say there is some evidence that he was secretly . Catholic. However the Vatican's official . newspaper L'Osservatore Romano in an article headlined: 'More Catholic . than anonymous' insisted that although 'Shakespeare's identity was the . matter of debate his religious faith was not.' L'Osservatore - which last week . published an article praising new film Tintin - added that in its belief . Shakespeare 'convincingly adhered to the Catholic faith,' pinning its . argument on the fact that in his famous play Hamlet he spoke of . purgatory. According to the Roman Catholic faith purgatory is the place souls go to after death and is between Heaven and Hell and where they are purified - the belief, as L'Osservatore notes is not shared with the Church of England and would have been evident in 'Elizabeth's violently anti-Catholic England'. The newspaper went on: 'Shakespeare's identity will long be the subject of morbid curiosity but there can be little doubt over his faith,' adding that although he was 'a member of that Protestant society proudly and cruelly defended by Queen Elizabeth the reality was very different'. Laurence Olivier in a 1948 production of Hamlet. References to . purgatory within the play convinced the Vatican that . Shakespeare must have been Catholic . L'Osservatore also picked up on a comment made by the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, earlier this year at the Hay on Wye book festival in which he said: 'William Shakespeare in all probability was Catholic.' In 1559, five years before Shakespeare was born, England finally severed its links with the Catholic church and everyone was forced to accept the Church of England or face the ultimate punishment - although some historians have claimed that Shakespeare's parents secretly maintained their faith. His school teachers were also Catholic and he is said to have married his wife Anne Hathaway in a secret Catholic ceremony while other historians point to his ridiculing of the Pope in his play The Life and Death of King John describing him as an 'unworthy and ridiculous Italian priest'. Shakespeare grew up after the start of the Protestant reformation, at a time of fierce persecution of Catholics in England. In 1530 - 34 years before the birth of Shakespeare - King Henry VIII quarreled with the Pope, who refused to give Henry the divorce he wanted for political reasons. In 1534 Henry established the Church of England as the official state church, nominally Protestant, with the monarch as head - 'defender of the faith'. England turned against Catholicism. Religious statues and stained glass windows were removed, shrines and saints' relics destroyed and cathedrals, abbeys and monasteries were stripped of their valuables. Massacres of Protestants in France in 1572, the Spanish Armada in 1588 and the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 confirmed the popular belief in England that Catholics and the Pope would bring tyranny. Others point to Sonnet 124 that Shakespeare wrote, in which he referred to the 'fools of time, which die for goodness and who have lived for crime' as referring to Jesuit Catholics who were executed for treason between 1594 and 95. There is evidence which shows he was baptised in the Church of England church of Holy Trinity in Stratford Upon Avon where he was buried in 1616 and his grave is visited by more than 200,000 tourists every year. In a complete reversal some historians have even suggested that Shakespeare was possibly an atheist and to add an element of Dan Brown to the argument in 2009 three mysterious signatures were discovered at the Venerable English College in Rome which has been a training college for Catholic priests for centuries. Kept under lock and key for security reasons they read 'Arthurus Stratfordus Wigomniensis 1585' and 'Gulielmus Clerkue Starfordiensis 1589' which according to then vice rector Father Andrew Headon could be read as 'King Arthur's compatriot from the Stratford in the diocese of Worcester' and 'William the clerk from Stratford.' A third signature from 1587 reads 'Shfordus Cestriensis' which he said could stand for 'Shakespeare from the Stratford in the diocese of Chester,' and all three are dates during the so called wilderness years of the playwright from 1585 to 1592. As several of his plays are set in Italy there is a belief among many that he visited the country then during that seven year period and may even have stayed in the college in Rome which was also a safe haven for Catholics fleeing persecution in Elizabethan England. Today, Stanley Wells, one of Britain's most authoritative experts on Shakespeare and chairman of the Shakespeare's Birthplace Trust in Stratford Upon Avon, was not immediately available for comment.",Reference to purgatory in Hamlet the clinching factor .

Using remotely operated deep-sea vehicles, the MBARI team led by Dr Lonny Lundsten collected two harp sponges and recorded video footage of ten more, sci-news.com reported. The first speciments they discovered had only two vanes, but subsequent dives revealed examples with up to six vanes radiating from the creature's centre. The sponges barbed hooks covering their branching limbs to snare tiny crustaceans before enveloping the creatures in a thin membrane and slowly digesting it. The scientists who made the discovery believe that the harp sponge - which lives on the ocean floor at depths of between 10,800 â€“ 11,500 feet - has evolved its distinctive candelabra-like structure to increase the surface area it exposes to the ocean currents to catch its prey. Sponges typically feed by straining bacteria and bits of organic material from seawater filtering through their bodies, and its less than 20 years since scientists first discovered some species that were carnivores. 'C. lyra is an extraordinary example of the kind of adaptations that animals must make in order to survive in such a hostile environment,' the MBARI team reported in the journal Invertebrate Biology.","Chondrocladia lyra lives at depths of 11,000ft of the coast of California .

A mystery investor has bought a disused London Underground tube station from the Ministry of Defence for £50million. Brompton Road station, on the old Piccadilly line near Harrods, opened in 1906 but closed in 1934 due to lack of passengers. During the Second World War the tube station housed Winston Churchill's anti-aircraft operations HQ and Hitler's right-hand man Rudolf Hess was reportedly interrogated there. The disused London Underground Brompton Road Station contains a drill hall, garages, offices and mess as well as underground rooms, staircases and tunnels . Landmark: The building features the oxblood-red tiled facade and semi-circular windows typical of architect Leslie Green's style . The MoD bought the station in 1938 for £22,000 to use as a training facility but have now sold it as part of cost-cutting measures. It was snapped up by a mystery Ukrainian billionaire for the eye-watering sum of £50million after a fierce bidding war. The new owner outbid members of the Qatari Royal Family to snap up the 28,000sq ft real estate - and announced plans to turn the building into a series of luxury apartments. But not everybody is happy that the old station is to be turned into new flats. Ghost station: The historic 28,000 sq ft building was sold off by the MoD as part of a cost cutting exercise . Spooky: The passages where commuters would have made their way to platforms in the early 20th century remain today . Leslie Green: Brompton Road was one of a number of Tube stations designed by the English architect, who favoured the Arts and Crafts style . Remains: Switch gear used during the building's days as an Underground station still remain today . Ajit Chambers, of the Old London Underground Company, said: 'We have lost a big piece of our heritage to foreign investors.' Brompton Road Tube opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR) on the Piccadilly Line, positioned between Knightsbridge and South Kensington. The building was designed by English architect Leslie Green and features his distinctive oxblood-red tiled facade and semi-circular first floor windows. New life: 'Boris bikes' are seen lined up outside the Leslie Green-designed station in Knightsbridge as it looks today . Historic links: The former Underground station and WWII command centre could be transformed into flats . Distinctive: The green interior tiles remain inside the Leslie Green-designed station today . Eerie: A bricked off tunnel deep beneath the ground at the old Brompton Road Tube station . Varied past: The building is currently occupied by the London University Air Squadron, the London University Royal Naval Unit, and 46F Squadron Air Training Corps . Danger: Brompton Road ceased to be used as a tube station in 1934 . On the market: The MoD is hoping the former Tube station will fetch an eight figure sum when it is marketed by agents Jones Lang LaSalle in September . Safety measures: A metal fire escape at the old Underground station on London's Brompton Road . London's hidden network: Warning notices hang inside Brompton Road station in central London . Warnings: Everything at track and platform level at Brompton Road remains in the ownership of Transport for London, which has no involvement in the sale of the building . War years: The Royal Artillery ran its anti-aircraft operations room from Brompton Road during the Second World War . Located at the junction of Brompton Road and Cottage Place, the station was convenient for the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Brompton Oratory, but still saw little traffic. It was permanently closed in 1934 after it was finally deemed to be too close to the neighbouring stations to be economically viable. The station was taken over by the War Office to be used as a command centre for the defence of London. It was from here that the gun batteries dotted around London were coordinated as they tried to shoot down enemy planes during World War Two. There are understood to be 32 ghost . stations across London's underground network, abandoned over the years . as lines were diverted or the number of passengers passing through . dwindled. Like Brompton . Road, many of the stations have links to the Second World War. Down . Street - last used as a station in May 1932, became an air raid shelter . after the war broke out, and Aldwych was used by thousands of Londoners . during the Blitz. The . empty station in Westminster has been used as a location for films . including Atonement, V for Vendetta, Superman 4 and 28 Weeks Later. Other . abandoned stations still remain at City Road, which was on the Northern . Line until it closed its doors in 1922, Marlborough Road, which was on . the Metropolitan Line, and South Kentish Town, which closed in 1924. York . Road closed in 1932 because it was under-used, while North End is . unique in that it is a closed Tube station that never actually opened. Intended . to be the deepest station on the underground network, work on North End . stopped in 1906 because it was not deemed financially viable. Churchill is believed to have visited the command centre to watch over the command of the battle against the Luftwaffe. It was vacated by the War Office in the 1950s but seventy years on the Ministry of Defence still owns it to a depth of about 60ft underground. The MoD's jurisdiction ends at a locked gate and beyond this Tube trains still run on the Piccadilly Line. But evidence of the Royal Artillery's operations centre remains in remarkable condition. Maps of London still hang from the walls of the war room. The station retains period features including a distinctive brown and green tiling pattern and electrical switch gear. Brompton Road isn't the only 'ghost station' in London. Aldwych, initially called Strand, is one of the most famous. It opened in 1907 but its financial viability was perennially in doubt and, after running a peak hours service only for many years, the station closed for good in 1994. Down Street, near Hyde Park, which closed in 1932, was used as an air raid shelter by Winston Churchill. A bath installed in 1939 has been dubbed “Churchill’s bath”. The British Museum once had its own Tube station on the Central Line. It opened in 1900 but has not been used by the general public since 1933. Holborn station is a few hundred yards away. Not viable: The station was conveniently located for Brompton Oratory (pictured), but did not see a lot of traffic through its doors . Attractions: Brompton Road was also close to the Victoria & Albert Museum (pictured), and Harrods, but was closed permanently as a station in 1934 because it was too close to neighbouring Tube stops . War effort: Developers keen to capitalise on the station's links to Churchill have previously expressed an interest in transforming it into a tourist attraction .

Credit card spending: Charles Saatchi, 70, arrives at Isleworth Crown Court where he will tomorrow give evidence against his two former PAs who are accused of spending £685,000 . Evidence: Charles Saatchi is ushered into the court by security as he makes his way past press photographers this afternoon . Appearance: Mr Saatchi is seen arriving at Isleworth Crown Court where he will tomorrow give evidence against Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo . Departure: Charles Saatchi leaves the court this afternoon after being discharged by the judge. He will now give evidence tomorrow . Court hearing: Mr Saatchi gets into a taxi outside Isleworth Crown Court this afternoon after being sent home for the day just half an hour after he arrived . 'Trivial': Mr Saatchi's accountant said he did not tell the millionaire about the credit card spending earlier because he considered it a 'trivial' matter . When they were confronted about the spending, it is alleged that Elisabetta, 41, complained that they were 'being treated worse than Filipino slaves'. Rahul . Gajjar, finance director for Mr Saatchi, told Isleworth Crown Court that at first . the pair were open and apologetic about spending an average of £76,000 per month on the cards. But . he said that after he wrote them each a letter outlining how they would pay off their debt which they were expected to sign, they . became 'agitated'. 'Lisa (Elisabetta) was against the proposal and I remember a reference to ""We're being . treated worse than Filipino slaves"",' Mr Gajjar, 44, told jurors. Mr . Gajjar said Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson, who divorced earlier this year, . agreed that the sisters should continue working for them when the . alleged offences came to light early last year. He . told jurors that the sisters, who earned a combined £53,000 per year, would be able to continue on their current salaries. However, Francesca would be expected to pay back £1,000 a month, and . Elisabetta £250. 'Slavery': Finance director Rahul Gajjar told Isleworth Crown Court yesterday that Elisabetta Grillo, 41, complained that she was being treated worse than Filipino slaves during conversations with her about credit card spending . Accused: Elisabetta Grillo (left) and her sister Francesca arrive at Isleworth Crown Court today where the jury has heard they spent £685,000 on company credit cards . They would also be able to live . rent-free at a flat owned by Ms Lawson in Battersea, central London, the . court heard. But Mr Gajjar said the defendants reacted angrily to this. 'They were absolutely in disagreement,' he said. 'They felt it tied them to the company for the rest of their lives.' Anthony Metzer QC, defending Elisabetta, told the court it was common practice for other personal assistants to spend thousands on luxury goods for themselves. Miss Lawson's other PAs - Anzelle Wasserman, Zoe Wales, . and Alice Binks - all used the credit cards to fund the purchases. Mr Metzer said they notched up bills running into the thousands at Annabel's, a private members club popular with the Royal family. They also spent money on Christian Louboutin shoes, wedding parties, and sprees at Babington House. Allegations: Nigella Lawson, 53, is set to give evidence against her two former personal assistants later in the trial . He said: 'The position about all the other personal assistants is precisely the same in relation to the type of expenditure they incurred as to the other PAs in this case.' Jurors were told that other personal assistants were not investigated. Mr Metzer insisted that Elisabetta and her sister believed they were allowed to spend the cash. He said: 'Unbeknown to you they believed that they were authorised to incur this personal expenditure, and suddenly you were saying they were not.' Glamour: Soho House Hotel in New York where Francesca allegedly spent £613 on June 3 last year . The . accountant had not initially bothered to tell Mr Saatchi and Miss . Lawson about the pair's credit card spending when he first . uncovered it last year because he didn't want to trouble him with 'trivial matters', the jury heard. Asked . by prosecutor Jane Carpenter why he did not go straight to them with his suspicions, he said: 'It was on the back . burner. 'We were dealing . with more corporate matters - more serious corporate matters - and Mr . Saatchi and Miss Lawson normally didn't have time for what we thought . were trivial matters.' The jury was told Francesca's average . monthly spend was £48,000 while Elisabetta's was £28,000 - compared with . the other personal assistants who spent a maximum of £8,000. The jury was told that Miss Lawson spent £7,000 per month on her credit card on average. The average monthly outgoings of Mr Saatchi's household, including . the two sisters, three other personal assistants and Nigella, amounted . to £100,000 a month - the equivalent of £1.2million a year, the court . heard. Francesca, 35, . ran up a £64,000 bill in June last year and her expenditure included over . £4,700 on flights to New York, where she spent £1,850 at high-end . fashion store Miu Miu. Luxuy: Francesca spent £1,424 at Gansevoort . Hotel in New York (left) in June last year, the court heard. She also . used the credit card the same month to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz . hotel in Paris on the day she bought a Chloe dress for £723, it is . alleged . 'Spending spree': Elisabetta spent thousands of . pounds on designer clothes from Calvin Klein at Harrods (left) and . Harvey Nichols (right), both in central London . Jurors were told that she had paid £613 at the Soho House Hotel in New York on June 3, and two days later had shelled out £1,424 at the . Gansevoort Hotel. In addition, she also withdrew large . amounts of cash while she stayed in the city. Later . that month, she used the card to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz hotel in . Paris on the same day she bought a Chloe dress for £723. And on June 12 she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London and £2,650 at designer store Prada. Her sister, Elisabetta, spent thousands on designer clothes from . Calvin Klein at department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Over the course of a four-year period she splurged £58,744 in just 50 transactions at an array of designer shops and spas. Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein were just some of the luxury brands that the money was spent on. Mr . Gajjar told the court he met with the sisters in the kitchen of the Saatchi . family home in west London, on July 3 last year to examine their credit . card statements. He said . Francesca explained that some of the transactions were for payments on . behalf of her employers, some she was not sure of and others were . personal. 'She admitted . that they were for her own use, her personal expenditure, which she was . slightly apologetic about and vowed to reimburse the company or . Charles,' Mr Gajjar said. Divorce: Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband . Charles Saatchi, 70, are both set to give prosecution evidence against their two former PAs . Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees . Mr . Gajjar said both defendants had been given credit cards in Saatchi's . Conarco Partnership account with Coutt's bank to buy items for the . household. Jurors heard Elisabetta began working . for Miss Lawson as a nanny in 1999 while the TV chef was married to . journalist John Diamond. Mr . Gajjar told the court that Francesca also lived with the Lawson family . as a 'housemate' before their roles began to change in around 2006. He said: 'Between 2006 and 2008 their roles had changed and they were doing more corporate stuff. 'I then got a call to put the Grillos on the Conarco payroll - a call from Nigella Lawson'. The . court heard that the Grillos' heavy spending on the Conarco credit . cards actually came out of Saatchi's personal bank account at Coutts, . rather than his business' account. Mr . Gajjar added that his role as Conarco's finance director meant he was . unable to scrutinise the Grillos' expenditure and the Saatchi and Lawson . family's private outgoings. Referring . to Conarco credit card statements, Mr Gajjar said: 'These items were . for the family and it wasn't in my capacity to say whether this Chanel . handbag was okay or not okay. 'It wasn't me to say that Nigella can't have a £25,000 dress. 'These expenses were personal and not part of the Conarco business - it was Charles and Nigella using their cards'. Concerns . were finally raised about the sisters' spending spree when Francesca's . outgoings regularly hit over £40,000 every month. Thanks to supporters: As Saatchi was arriving at court today, Nigella tweeted a recipe on Twitter . Mr Saatchi . and the TV chef broke up after pictures were published in a newspaper . showing him holding his wife of 10 years by the throat. It is alleged that between January 1 . 2008 and December 31 2012, the sisters committed fraud by abusing their . positions as PAs by using a company credit card for personal gain. The Grillos, both of Bayswater, west London, deny the charges against them. Today's proceedings were moved to a larger courtroom due to the huge press interest in the case. Miss Lawson is expected to give evidence in the trial at a later date, however as Saatchi was arriving at court today, the cook tweeted a recipe on Twitter for Butternut Squash with Pecans and Blue Cheese. The case was adjourned until tomorrow.","Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo 'spent £685,000 on company credit cards'

"By . Paul Thompson . UPDATED: . 06:43 EST, 7 September 2011 . The pilot of Air Force One has revealed for the first time how they feared the presidential jet would be rammed by hijacked jet in the hours after the 9/11 terror attack. Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' as America reeled from the attack on the twin towers. Angel was the secret call sign for Air Force One as it left Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush had been told about the attacks on the Twin Towers. Warning: Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' Under threat: President Bush and staffers look out at fighter jets accompanying Air Force One en route from Sarasota, Florida, to Shreveport, Louisiana . Tillman revealed air traffic controllers also gave them an ominous warning that another passenger jet was close to them that was not responding to calls. 'As we got over Gainesville, Fla., we got the word from Jacksonville Center. They said, ""Air Force One you have traffic behind you and basically above you that is descending into you, we are not in contact with them - they have shut their responder off"". 'And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point. 'We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorist were at that point.' Tillman said he flew the specially adapted Boeing 747 out into the Gulf of Mexico to see if the other plane would follow. Safe: President Bush walks down the steps of Air Force One as he arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on 9/11 . Concern: President Bush speaks to vice president Dick Cheney by phone aboard Air Force One on September 11 . When the other jet continued on its route he was later told it was an airliner that had lost its transponder -which sends out an electronic identification signal - and the pilots had failed to switch to a new radio frequency. Tillman said the threat remained and he received the message:'We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next,' Angel being the classified call sign of Air Force One.' 'Once we got into the Gulf and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us.' The senior pilot said President Bush's plans to fly to Washington DC were scrapped and he landed at air force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska from where the president addressed the nation. Tillman said he was fearful Air Force One would be attacked when he brought the plane back to Andrews Air Force base in Washington DC. Message: President Bush is told news of the 9/11 terror attacks . Escort: A F-16 fighter flies just off the wing of the presidential aircraft Air Force One on a flight back to Washington on 9/11 . 'All along, everybody knew I was bringing him home, so my fear was they've done all of this, they know Air Force One is eventually going to come back to Washington, D.C.; they are sitting there, they're waiting for us,' he said. Tillman, who now flies a corporate jet after retiring from his duties with Air Force One in 2009, said he fears terrorists will launch another attack. He told Fox News:'I'm a strong believer that there will be other attacks. 'They caught us with our pants down, they attacked our country, they attacked from within... You got to assume right now that they're going to go ahead and infiltrate us and they're going to go ahead, take advantage of everything we offer to them.' He added:'I think President Bush did a great job making sure the American people realize our safety is important, but we've got to go ahead and protect each and every one of us, take care of each other and change the way we do business so the terrorists won't take advantage of us anymore.'","Air traffic controllers warned another jet was approaching and not responding to calls .

Legendary political journalist John Cole has died at the age of 85 after a long illness, his family said today. The BBC's political editor came to define political reporting for most of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, covering the Brighton bomb, the Westland affair and correctly predicting the Iron Lady's downfall. David Cameron was 'deeply saddened' by the news, as journalists and politicians of all parties paid tribute to one of the defining voices of the Thatcher era. 'Hondootedly, Mrs Thatcher', was how Private Eye began its satirical bulletins by John Cole, who has died . Obstinate: Mr Cole reported on most of Margaret Thatcher's premiership and predicted her downfall, but he found her difficult to interview . Mr Cole's family said that while a generation of politicians and journalists would remember him for his reporting on a turbulent period in Westminster, they recalled 'the  most loving, funny and devoted husband, father and grandfather'. Born in Belfast, his fast-paced Irish . accent and over-sized glasses became a trademark of his broadcasts and he was so well-known in . the 1980s that he was even featured as a Spitting Image. He was BBC political editor from 1981 to the 1992 general election. He later revealed that Mrs Thatcher's 'enamelled certitude' made her difficult to interview, but conceded that 'her gender and the fight a woman faced to get to the very top made her the kind of determined, obstinate politician she became'. Described as humble, John Cole never stooped to the left-wing bias which existed in much of the BBC . David Cameron's official spokesman: ‘The . Prime Minister is deeply saddened by the news. He is someone who . contributed so much to British political life.’ Kenneth Clarke, Tory Cabinet minister: ‘He was an outstanding political journalist but he was also genuinely a very nice, witty character, whose company was always a pleasure.’ Lord Heseltine, ex-Cabinet minister:’John became a national character. I think the accent was a great help, didn't do him any harm at all, everybody knew who he was.’ Sir John Major, former prime minister: ‘John Cole was one of the finest political correspondents of my lifetime, and a real credit to his profession. When John spoke, everyone listened.’ Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman and former Cabinet minister: ‘John Cole was a hugely respected BBC political editor, whose absolute integrity and astute analysis, to say nothing of his distinctive delivery, defined political reporting in the Eighties.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband: ‘My generation grew up watching John Cole. He conveyed the drama and importance of politics. Many condolences to his family.’ Scotland First Minister Alex Salmond said: ‘Not only was he an extremely able journalist but also extraordinarily helpful and generous to a young politician.’ David . Cameron's official spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister is deeply . saddened by the news and would send his condolences, of course, to Mr . Cole's family and friends. He is someone who contributed so much to British political life.' BBC . Trust chairman Lord Patten, a Tory Cabinet minister in the 1980s and . 90s, said: 'John Cole was a hugely respected BBC political editor, whose . absolute integrity and astute analysis, to say nothing of his . distinctive delivery, defined political reporting in the Eighties. My . thoughts are with his family.' Current BBC political editor Nick . Robinson said: 'Sad news. The man I learnt so much from the BBC's former . Political Editor John Cole has died. He shaped the way all in my trade . do our jobs.' In his . memoirs, Cole recounted how an interview early in his career with then . prime minister Clement Attlee during a holiday in Ireland inspired him . to to work in Westminster. He went on to interview many of Westminster's biggest names and was a regular fixture outside Downing Street in the 1980s. He later recalled how he had become . the first person to predict Mrs Thatcher's downfall after she failed to . secure enough votes to win a first leadership ballot in 1990. 'The . next morning, I had not got my coat hung up before Conservative MPs . were all but queuing up to tell me she was finished,' he said in an . article for the BBC.

Labour leader Ed Miliband wrote on . Twitter: 'My generation grew up watching John Cole. He conveyed the . drama and importance of politics. Many condolences to his family.' Tribute: Current BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cole had defined the role for his successors . Today's generation of politicians and journalists grew up watching Mr Cole reporting on life in Westminster . The BBC's director of news and current . affairs, James Harding, said: 'John was a loved and respected . broadcaster, a journalist with his own unforgettable style and a . commanding knowledge of his subject. 'He embodied the qualities of a truly . great journalist: integrity, curiosity and character. He will, I know, . be sorely missed and fondly remembered across the BBC. Our thoughts are . with his family.' Scotland First Minister Alex Salmond . said: 'When I started out in politics at the House of Commons, John Cole . was the main BBC correspondent. 'Not only was he an extremely able journalist but also extraordinarily helpful and generous to a young politician.' Mr Cole became a household name with his distinctive style, accent and glasses, and was immortalised with a Spitting Image puppet . He died peacefully in his sleep at his . home in Surrey, surrounded by his family. He is survived by his wife . Madge, four sons - Donald, Patrick, David and Michael - and nine . grandchildren. His family . said: 'While many people will remember John for his journalism and . broadcasting, for us he was the most loving, funny and devoted husband, . father and grandfather. 'We will miss him terribly, but have so many memories of the tremendous happiness he has brought into our lives.' Mr . Cole started his career on the Belfast Telegraph in 1945 before joining . The Guardian in 1956, where he later became labour correspondent, news . editor and eventually deputy editor. In 1975 he joined The Observer, . where he was also Deputy Editor.In 1981 he became political editor of the BBC, where he remained for more than a decade. On camera: Mr Cole spent more than a decade reporting on politics for the BBC, but the punishing hours took their toll on the veteran broadcaster, particularly on his heart . He was presented with the Royal Television Society’s Journalist of the Year award in 1991 and BAFTA’s Richard Dimbleby Award in 1993. He retired from the BBC after the 1992 General Election but continued to broadcast and write as a freelance for many years. In retirement he wrote a collection of political memoirs, ‘As It Seemed To Me’, and a novel, ‘A Clouded Peace’. They followed his earlier books, 'The Poor of the Earth' and 'The Thatcher Years'. John Cole's voice, with its strong Ulster accent, was a constant on news broadcasts through the Thatcher years. As the BBC's political editor, he kept the public informed about the major upheavals of the 1980s, from the miners' strike to the Brighton bombing and industry privatisations. Cole was born in Belfast on November 23, 1927 into a Protestant unionist family. Having attended Belfast Royal Academy, he joined the Belfast Telegraph in 1945 aged 17. One of his early scoops was an ad hoc interview with the then prime minister Clement Attlee, who was driving round Ireland on holiday without a police guard. In 1956, Cole moved to the Guardian, then based in Manchester, serving as the newspaper's labour correspondent, news editor and deputy editor. He subsequently became deputy editor at the Observer, and memorably gave evidence against Tiny Rowland at the Monopolies Commission when he took over as proprietor in 1981. He made the transition to television look easy after being offered the BBC political editor role that year, and quickly became a household name. Cole's profile was reflected in the frequent appearances of his puppet on the popular Spitting Image satirical show. Despite suffering a severe heart attack at the House of Commons in 1984, Cole remained in his job until 1992, when he reached what was then the BBC's mandatory retirement age. He continued to broadcast on TV and radio, and penned a well-received autobiography, As It Seemed To Me.","David Cameron leads tributes to former journalist and broadcaster .

It went from one of the world's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs to London's grandest wreck in the space of just 100 years. But now Cambridge House is set to be returned to its former glory and become Britain's most expensive home, with a jaw-dropping price tag of more than £200million. Billionaire property tycoon brothers David and Simon Reuben want to throw money at transforming the former In and Out Club on Piccadilly in central London into a palatial 48-room residence. They bought the crumbling grade I listed mansion, opposite Green Park, last year for £130million and have now submitted plans to Westminster City Council. Development: The billionaire Reuben brothers have announced plans to transform Cambridge House into something worth in excess of £200 million . Plans: The once palatial In and Out Club on Piccadilly fell into ruin but will be turned into Britain's most expensive home . Designed by architect Paul Davis + Partners, it would boast an underground swimming pool, gym and 35,000-bottle wine cellar. Experts are predicting it could fetch £214million, £74million more than Russian billionaire Andrey Borodin paid for Park Place near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire - currently Britain’s most expensive pad. Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs Glentree Estates, which regularly sells properties on this . scale, described the home as a 'great opportunity' for a wealthy . foreigner to buy a piece of English heritage. But the estate agent added it is unlikely anyone will know when the completed home changes hands. He said: 'It would make a wonderful home and be one of the largest private residences in the UK. Billionaires: Brothers David Reuben, left, and Simon Reuben, right, want to restore Cambridge House to its former glory . Beautiful: The Grade I listed building was designed by Matthew Brettingham for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont in the 1750s and was one of London's most impressive structures . 'No one has got much more than £120 million for a home in London but that is not to say it wouldn’t happen. 'This is a unique property and a great opportunity for a very wealthy person who wants a landmark home in London. 'For them, it is about buying a piece of English heritage but you won’t know when it is has been sold. 'Properties like this will be sold through the grey market - when no information is made public.' Cambridge House or No. 94 Piccadilly was London's most exclusive property when it was built more than 250 years ago. The grade I listed mansion on the northern side of Piccadilly was built for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, by architect Matthew Brettingham. It changed hands several times until 1829  when it was bought by Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, when it took the name Cambridge House, which has stuck ever since. Thirty-one years later prime minister Lord Palmerston bought it and lived there for 20 years until he died in 1865. His body was even taken from there to Westminster Abbey for his funeral. It was then bought by the Naval and Military Club and became known as the 'In and Out Club' because of the iconic signs on its gate posts, which still remain today. For more than a century it stayed as the exclusive private members club until it moved, and Cambridge House was bought as a development opportunity but the project went bust and the property fell into ruin. It has now been empty ever since 1999 but this new project by the Reubens, who bought it last year, could now restore it to its former glory. The premises started life as a villa designed by Matthew Brettingham for the Second Earl of Egremont in the 1750s. It was adopted by the Naval and Military club, which became fondly known as the In and Out Club due to the prominent signs on the entrance and exit gates, in the 1870s. Members continued to meet there until 1999 when the club moved to its current home at No.4 St James’s Square. Earlier this year, royal patron the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip joined other bowler-hat clad members there to celebrate the institution’s 150th anniversary. Originally established in 1862 because all other service clubs had reached their full membership quotas, it was initially only open to military officers. This is no longer the case, however, and now both women and men who have not served in the Armed Forces can join. Famous past members include British army officer Lawrence of Arabia, James Bond author Ian Fleming and poet Rudyard Kipling. Naval officer Robert Falcon Scott, who led two expeditions to the Antarctic, also frequented the club. The Reuben brothers were ranked second in this year’s Forbes magazine List of Billionaires with an estimated fortune of £6billion. After making their money in Russian aluminium, they branched into the London real estate market. Their portfolio includes the Millbank Tower, the John Lewis headquarters in Victoria, Carlton House in SW1, Connaught House on Berkeley Square and prime Sloane Street shops. They have also been involved in the regeneration of the Paddington area through the Merchant Square scheme and are in the process of creating a 340,000 square foot mixed-use development on Albert Embankment. At Piccadilly, they also have plans for the house next door to the former In and Out Club – No.95 previously the American Club – and for six luxury flats on another part of the site.

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 10 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:06 EST, 12 November 2012 . I have a blinding headache and I feel dizzy. I’m in my study, barely able to concentrate. My brain seems to have turned to cotton wool and I am behaving like an ill-tempered despot. ‘Mummy, mummy, mummy,’ starts my four-year-old. Sometimes I find her drip-torture attempts at attracting my attention amusing. But not now. ‘GET OUT!’ I blurt, and instantly feel guilty. This is not – as you may have assumed – a hangover.  Nor am I ill. Rather, I am suffering from the effects of sugar withdrawal, and it is excruciating. So why have I quit sugar? We know too much rots the teeth and makes us fat. But cutting it out of my diet completely – what is the point of that? Taking stock: Writer Alice Smellie sits atop her annual consumption of sugar before quitting - a scary six stone . A growing number of American scientists believe the sweet stuff contributes to 35 million deaths worldwide each year. They say added sugar (rather than natural sugars found in fruit, for instance) is in part responsible for obesity, type-2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers and liver problems. And it seems the message  has hit home. In the States, there is a whole genre of literature devoted to sugar and its evils. Endocrinologist Robert Lustig’s Sugar: The Bitter Truth lecture has been viewed almost three million times on YouTube. Sugar is addictive, says Lustig. He claims sugar causes insulin levels to go up, which interferes with the appetite-supressing hormone leptin. His devotees say the only route to good health is to cut out added sugar completely in what has been dubbed ‘The Sweet Nothing Diet’. Advocated on countless blogs – and by a couple of my friends – those who follow it say they have bags more energy, have lost weight (if they were fat) and have better skin. So I decided to give it a go. I expected it to be dull, but I wasn’t prepared for how horrific I felt to begin with. Yet despite that, the experience has made me vow to change the way I eat for ever. Snack swap: Switching from baked beans to fresh berries cuts your sugar consumption with six teaspoons . When I tell a friend about my project, he laughs in a way that suggests he doesn’t believe I can do it. ‘You are a sugarholic,’ he says. Is he right? I calculate my average added sugar consumption and am horrified to discover that it is about 100g (or 25 teaspoons) a day. I drink about a bottle of prosecco per week, which contains 15g of sugar. Despite not adding sugar to tea or drinking coke (which has a staggering 35g or nine teaspoons of added sugar per can), I am hoovering down 40kg – about six stone – of added sugar a year. The Food Standards Agency recommends we consume no more than 60g (about 15 teaspoons) daily, but surveys suggest the average Briton eats closer to 20 teaspoons. Experts say most people vastly underestimate their sugar intake, not realising that it is added to bread, ready meals, pasta sauces and even bland breakfast cereals. Anna Raymond, spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, says: ‘When surveys are conducted, people don’t  necessarily remember all their snacks and drinks. Cereal bars and diet yoghurts contain masses of sugar. Six stone a year for a busy mother sounds quite feasible.’ So what is this sugar onslaught doing to our bodies? ‘Sugar is a carbohydrate,’ says Dr Ashley Brown, a liver specialist at St Mary’s and Hammersmith hospitals in London. ‘Complex carbohydrates – such as bread, pasta and potatoes – are like chains of sugar molecules. The gut breaks them down into single beads so they can be absorbed into to the liver. ‘Processed sugar, which is single-molecular beads, is instantly absorbed. In the case of a high-sugar diet, glucose is delivered to the liver in a big lump. When the liver’s reserves of glycogen – the  storage molecule for glucose – are full, a biochemical process converts it into fat. Obese patients have a fatty liver, like foie gras.’ Spoonful of sugar: It is recommended to eat maximum 15 teaspoons of sugar a day, but the average Briton consumes nearly 20 . Yet being slim is no defence in itself. ‘People who diet without exercise are prone to excess internal fat,’ says Dr Brown. ‘Excess fat means our bodies become less sensitive to insulin, which helps store sugar in the cells. This can lead to type-2 diabetes.’ Statistics from the Department of Health show almost three million Britons have diabetes, while heart and circulatory diseases account for more than 191,000 deaths a year. My blood sugar is within the normal range, but I suffer from mood swings, bloating and energy slumps. And, as I approach my 40th birthday, my skin looks drained. Could going sugar-free help? ‘We don’t recommend completely cutting out sugar,’ says consultant dietitian Sian Porter. ‘But if you are trying to avoid added sugar, look at labels – anything with glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, corn syrup, honey, molasses or treacle contains added sugar.’ Breakfast: Cheerios, 15g sugar  (4 teaspoons*) or 2 slices toast, 2.4g  (half tsp), marmalade, 8g (2 tsp), 200ml orange juice, 20g (5 tsp) Snack: Twix, 28.5g (7 tsp) or Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bar, 11g (3 tsp) Lunch: Baked beans on toast, 20.8g  + 2.4g (6 tsp) or coronation chicken sandwich, 15g (4 tsp) Snack: 2 Hobnobs, 6.8g (1.5 tsp) or  Nestle Ski yoghurt, 16g (4 tsp) Supper: Lasagne ready meal + veg,  6.4g (1.5 tsp), Magnum, 23g (6 tsp)  or sweet and sour chicken, rice, 21.8g  (5.5 tsp), 250ml prosecco, 3.75g (1tsp)Total sugar: 102.9g / 98.0g (25 day tsp a day) Breakfast: Rye bread, butter, marmite  or eggs (poached or scrambled), mushrooms, no toast . Snack: Cheese oatcakes, almonds . Lunch: Salmon, jacket potato with  butter and cheese, spinach, peas  or baked potato, cheese, salad . Snack: Banana, apple . Supper: Tuna, onion and cheese on  rye bread or roast chicken breast (home-made – watch out for shop-bought as can have sugary marinades), stir-fried veg, natural yogurt with blueberries and strawberries . Total added sugar: ZERO! When I check the loaf of Hovis sliced brown bread I use for breakfast toast, I see that it contains almost half a teaspoon (1.6g) of added sugar per slice. All Bran has almost 13g – more than three teaspoons – in a 40g bowl, including milk. And marmalade is out of the question, being 60 per cent sugar. Instead, I eat six cheese oatcakes, sugar content zero. Lunchtime is no better. Baked beans – my staple – contains 10g of sugar per 200g tin. I stir-fry vegetables and eat them with brown rice. I have a headache and the urge to eat sugar is agonising. I munch on almonds, which balance blood sugar. To the disgust of my children, biscuits and chocolate are replaced with oatcakes and dried fruit. A study by Harvard Medical School found women who ate a high-sugar diet had almost three times the risk of getting colorectal cancer. Biologist Dr Hans-Peter Kubis, of Bangor University, points out that rats fed large quantities of sugar display signs of Alzheimer’s. ‘High-sugar intake appears to damage brain metabolism,’ he says. Indeed, studies have shown that those with diabetes and even pre-diabetes are more prone to developing Alzheimers. Sweet death: Our overconsumption of sugar is a contributing factor in 35 million deaths a year, according to American scientists . For me, the clincher is ageing. Researchers at the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands found that people with high blood-sugar levels were judged to look older than those with lower levels. ‘Over time, sugar affects the skin by means of a process called glycation,’ says consultant dermatologist Shamali Hoque at BMI The Blackheath Hospital in South-East London. ‘Excess glucose binds protein molecules to collagen and elastin in the skin. Collagen and elastin are important in keeping skin supple .’ On the school run, another mother pulls me aside. ‘You look great at the moment,’ she whispers. ‘What have you had done?’ I assure her, nothing. Dr Kubis tells me sugar-induced metabolic damage can be reversed. ‘We conducted a study involving a low-carb diet coupled with high exercise, which suggested you could rectify the damage. ‘Fat burning was more effective and the body reacted more efficiently to high levels of glucose.’ I have lost a couple of pounds, and feel strangely calm all the time. By now, I am convinced that a low or no-sugar diet is the way forward. When I joyfully pour baked beans on to granary bread, they taste artificial and cloying. It appears you can train your tastebuds away from sweetness. It is slightly different with the prosecco and I’m certainly not checking the sugar content on every packet, but the cupboard is still full of oatcakes rather than biscuits. Dr Glenys Jones, nutrition communications manager for Sugar Nutrition UK, which is funded by the sugar industry, said: ‘Sugar makes foods palatable. It also provides energy. ‘It is important not to demonise any food. Sugar can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.’ She added that Lustig’s criticisms focused on high-fructose corn syrup, a sugar not commonly used in the UK.","'Sugaroholic' Alice Smellie would eat six stone of sugar every year .

A young judge who was repeatedly raped by guards at a concentration camp in Bosnia has helped to put her perpetrators behind bars. Nusreta Sivac was one of 37 women who suffered the nightly traumas in Omarska concentration camp - they never discussed their abuse -  their pained glances were enough to communicate their suffering. But it was partly thanks to Ms Sivac's efforts to . gather testimony from women across Bosnia that rape was categorised . as a war crime under international law. Trauma: Nusreta Sivac stands at the gate of Omarska, an iron ore mine outside her native town of Prijedor, 250 kms west of Sarajevo . Thirty people have been convicted at the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague and another 30 cases are ongoing. She personally helped put the man who raped her repeatedly during her two months in captivity behind bars. But the journey was not easy for Ms Sivac - there were days when she prayed for a bullet to end her suffering. When she thought she was dying of a heart attack, she whispered 'Thank you God.' She also witnessed murder and torture by Bosnian Serb guards - and was forced to clean blood from walls and floors of the interrogation room. Endurance: The journey was not easy for Sivac - there were days when she prayed for a bullet to end her suffering. When she thought she was dying of a heart attack, she whispered 'Thank you God' She told herself to memorise the names and faces of the tormentors so that one day she might bring them to justice. 'Most of the strength I took from the idea that one day this evil would be over,' she told The Associated Press this week ahead of International Women's Day on Friday. The U.N. Special Representative on sexual violence in conflict said Sivac and other victims are helping to make sure wartime rapists pay for their crimes. 'The courage these women have shown coming forward and sharing their stories demonstrates the need to break the silence and stigma surrounding sexual violence in conflict,' said Zainab Hawa Bangura. 'These survivors are helping to end impunity by making sure perpetrators are brought to justice.' Bosnia's 1992-95 war was the bloodiest in the series of armed conflicts that erupted when the Yugoslav federation fell apart and its republics began declaring independence. It took over 100,000 lives and devastated the region. Deprived: Bosnian Muslim men at Omarska detention camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina - the same camp that Nusreta Sivac was held in . According to the UN, between 20,000 to 50,000 Bosnian women were raped - many in special rape camps - during the war that was fought between the new country's Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. African conflicts have seen even more harrowing figures: Between 250,000 and 500,000 were raped during the Rwandan genocide, and hundreds of thousands more in conflicts in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ms Sivac's ordeal started in the spring of 1992 when Bosnian Serbs took control over her native Prijedor, in the northwest of Bosnia and threw Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats in concentration camps. Alongside the women were 3,500 male prisoners, hundreds of whom were killed. Sivac, a Muslim Bosniak, would start the day counting the bodies of the men who were tortured to death overnight. They were often taken to the notorious 'White House' in the centre of the camp. 'Their bodies lay there in the grass in front of the building. Sometimes 20, sometimes 30 of them,' she recalled outside the factory in Omarska where she was held for two months. The notorious 'White House' at the former Omarska concentration camp. Then the guards would force the women to clean the interrogation rooms strewn with bloody pliers and batons . During the long days of forced labor in the camp's restaurant, the women listened to tortured prisoners screaming, calling for help and begging for mercy with voices that would become weaker until they went silent. Then the guards would force the women to clean the interrogation rooms, strewn with bloody pliers and batons. At night, guards would come to take the women away one by one - to rape. Her captivity ended in August 1992 when a group of foreign journalists found the facility. The images of skeletal prisoners behind a fence and naked bodies beaten black and blue shocked the world and prompted an avalanche of reactions that forced the Serb leadership to release the prisoners. Grim: Forensic experts examine remains of human bodies, discovered at mass grave site in village of Kevljani. Nodies of Muslim inmates of notorious Serb's Omarska detention camp were found here . Ms Sivac's pre-war colleague from the Prijedor court, prosecutor Jadranka Cigelj, was also among the 37 Omarska women. Remembrance: A Bosnian woman prays in a concentration camp in Omarska last year during the 20th anniversary of the closing of the camps . The two escaped to neighboring Croatia, where they began collecting testimonies from hundreds of women who had been raped. They spent years transcribing testimonies, convincing victims to break their silence and putting together legal dossiers which they then presented to the investigators at the International Tribunal for War Crimes in Former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague. During this process, she said, 'it became obvious how many women from all over Bosnia were affected. But I wasn't surprised by the big number.' For centuries, rape was considered a byproduct of wars - collateral damage suffered by women, horrors often overshadowed by massacres. Even though the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 prohibited wartime rape, no court ever raised charges until Ms Sivac and Ms  Cigelj presented their overwhelming evidence. The effort finally paid off in June 1995 when the two traveled to The Hague to take part in preparations for the first indictment by the Yugoslav war crimes court. Their collected evidence exposed the magnitude of rape which courts could no longer ignore. According to the United Nations, it was a major 'turning point' in recognising rape as a war crime. Ms Sivac remembers the sunny July day the two realised their work would be soon rewarded. They enjoyed a coffee in an outdoor cafe in The Hague and wrote a few postcards back to their torturers in Prijedor. Determined: Sivac has testified in several cases, including against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . 'Dear Friends,' they wrote. 'We hope you will soon join us in this wonderful city.' A . year later, the tribunal indicted eight Bosnian Serb men for sexual . assault in eastern Bosnia - a verdict based on testimonies collected by . Ms Sivac and Ms  Cigelj. It was the first time in history that an international tribunal charged someone solely for crimes of sexual violence. Nerma Jelacic, spokeswoman for the Yugoslav war crimes court, recalls the 'shocking' testimony in subsequent cases where some victims were as young as 12. 'We had cases were both mother and daughter came to testify and both were subjected to same kind of torture and kind of crimes,' she said. Ms Sivac who has since testified in several cases, including against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is satisfied with what she has achieved, although she wishes the ongoing cases would accelerate. 'It's slow, very slow,' she said. 'But it is a start.' One of the Omarska guards she testified against was released in 2005 after he served two-thirds of his seven-year sentence. Ms Sivac ran into him on the street one day in Bosnia. 'We stared at each other,' she said. 'He was the first one to lower his head.'","Nusreta Sivac was raped by guards at Omarska concentration camp .

"By . Jenni Murray . PUBLISHED: . 17:50 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 13 November 2013 . A handsome Frenchman is running his fingers through my hair, whispering in an accent as fruity and seductive as champagne. I am melting, nearly purring with pleasure and anticipation, as his fingers, which know me so well, seem to caress my very soul. This man instinctively knows when I’m having a bad day, and how to turn it into a good one. He can tease a smile out of me where all else has failed. He even knows how - and when - I like my coffee, without even asking. Special bond: Jenni Murray has become best of friends with her hairdresser Olivier Morosini . But this is not my lover, nor even my husband of 33 years. This is my hairdresser, Olivier Morosini. We have a relationship like no other. Nothing could have surprised me less than the discovery that it's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband. A survey this week revealed that a woman spends an average of 12 years with her hair stylist and a mere 11 with her partner. And, for me, leaving Olivier would feel like a betrayal or bereavement. I honestly see us growing old together. A friend recommended him to me when Frances, my hairdresser for the previous five years, went through a disastrous divorce and disappeared. Olivier was in his mid-30s when we met and I was in my late 40s. I don't know whether it was his natural Gallic charm or if hairdressers, gay or straight (he's straight by the way), just know how to make a woman feel marvellous. But this handsome, casually dressed, dark stunner and I got off on exactly the right foot. 'Every six weeks, I go along for a colour . and cut and engaging conversation. We've learned a lot about each other . during the hours we have spent together' He sat me down, ran his fingers expertly through my hair, declared it thick and beautiful (exactly the right thing to say), discussed what kind of style I wanted and what he thought would suit me, and our relationship began. At the end of that first visit, in a tiny basement in the middle of Manchester, decorated in a slightly baroque style - a kind of mini-Versailles - I knew I had found someone I could trust implicitly with my hair and, as time went on, with worries and concerns that I knew would never be passed on. So, every six weeks, I go along for a colour and cut and engaging conversation. We've learned a lot about each other during the hours we have spent together. We shared concerns about our ageing parents - mine across the Pennines, his on the outskirts of Paris. We talked about politics in our respective countries, discussed interesting documentaries we’d seen or books we'd read. His favourite author is Aldous Huxley and he's way ahead of me on that one. It's the kind of ever-fresh discussion you'd hope for on a wonderful date - but without the stress and wretchedness of adultery. Set for life: It's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband (posed by models) He's even worked his magic on my son Charlie when I took him for a haircut as a teenager. A Francophile like me, when he chose to study French at A-level and then University, Olivier became invaluable for oral practice. Charlie now lives in London, but still takes time to journey north when he needs a cut. I’ve no idea what language they converse in - I hope it's French. I do like to give Olivier a taste of home with a bit of the old Francais. I greet him with a 'Bonjour!' And he me with a 'Bonjour Mme Jenni' and a hug. He’s even been known to peck me on both cheeks - very French. There aren't many guys who would dare, let alone get away with it. It makes me swoon every time. He now calls me Dame Jenni and was quite unaccountably proud when I was awarded the honour two years ago. We have never discussed holidays - supposedly the classic hairdresser/client conversation - except when, two years ago, I took my family to New Zealand for the Rugby World Cup and, even then, only after my return. 'When life got really tough seven or eight . years ago, it became clear what we had was a friendship, not just a . business arrangement' It's true, I think, that no matter how long you've lived in a foreign country, it's still your homeland you support. Olivier was so disappointed that France lost in the final and I was too ashamed to discuss England's parlous performance. Over the years, it's become a less flirtatious relationship, although he still makes the effort to make me feel special every time I walk through the door. When life got really tough seven or eight years ago, it became clear what we had was a friendship, not just a business arrangement. It was one of the worst times of my life: my parents died, I had breast cancer, chemotherapy and lost my hair. Olivier could not have been more supportive. He still managed to make me feel like an appreciated and attractive woman despite the opposite being obviously the case. And he was able to flatter and pamper when everyone else to whom I'm close was too terrified by the possible impact of the disease to think of anything apart from my survival . . . or otherwise. As the hair began to suffer from the chemo, he cut it shorter and shorter, trying to keep some element of style, until it got so bad I called and said I wouldn't be coming for a while, as I'd had it all shaved off at home. He reassured me it would grow back thicker and bouncier than ever and he'd be waiting to make me look wonderful again. I missed my regular trips to the salon and the relaxing pampering I always get there. Then, as the hair began to recover, the first question I asked my oncologist was: 'How soon can I get this horrible iron grey dyed?' I hadn't seen my natural colour for a good 20 years and hated it as it grew back. The other man: Jenni felt guilty when she went to see hairdresser Daniel Galvin . 'Just get your hairdresser to give it a test in case you've become sensitive to the dye,' he said, to my relief. 'It should be OK now.' What a pleasure it was to go back to Olivier. Walking into the salon felt like an enormous step in my recovery. Now I could begin to look like myself again and we could get back to our regular routine of colour, cut and conversation. Slowly, over the years, as we've both grown older, we've shared our troubles. He doesn't have quite as much hair as he used to and his back has caused him endless difficulties - no joke when you're on your feet all day. But still he manages to smile and touch my hair with a sensuous stroke that's all too rare when you're not as young as you were. So now we’re not discussing the aches and pains of ageing parents any more, but sympathising with each other’s. There has, though, in recent weeks been a bit of a hiccup. The course of true love never did run smooth and I fear I have been unfaithful - cheating on Olivier with another stylist. You may remember the article I wrote about going grey. I was sent to the London hairdresser, Daniel Galvin, to get the colour done. Top of the crops . Women aged 75 and over visit hairdressers more often than any other age group . While I was sitting in the chair, waiting for a blow dry, a familiar voice cried from across the enormous room - it was Frances - the disappeared divorcee. She's still cutting, but in the Galvin salon. It was a glorious reunion, and we spent ages catching up and exchanging news. She couldn't resist getting out her scissors and giving me a quick, impromptu trim. As she snipped away, I had an awful sense of infidelity and I dreaded her making any comment about Olivier's cut - she didn’t. So, I've agonised over my divided loyalties. Guiltily, I have been back to Frances for a cut, and felt dreadful when Olivier's partner Karen called recently to ask when I'd next be in. I've made an appointment for the weekend after next. I called Olivier to discuss the colour question. I've been grey for some time now, but would I want the old brunette with highlights? I explained I'd become quite attached to the grey, on account of everybody saying it was totally on trend, but would like it to be an elegant silver. 'Ah, oui,' he said, 'Like Christine Lagarde! So French!' He will, I know, get my hair just right and there was so much relief on both sides in our conversation when I confessed my betrayal. 'I am so glad you 'ave called,' he said. 'Karen has been shouting at me. Where is Jenni? What 'ave you done to upset 'er? Now I can explain everysing to 'er.' I'm so glad I called, too. When it comes to hairdressing, when you get a good 'un, you don’t let him go! That's generally what they say about husbands, but it applies equally to a good hairdresser, the one person who, no matter how awful you feel when you meet, will always make you feel better. So, there's just two weeks to go until my reconciliation with the true love of my life - my hairdresser. And I think I'll love him all the more for accepting me back after such treachery.","Jenni has a wonderful relationship with her hairdresser Olivier Morosini .

George Osborne's wish to expand airport capacity near London, even if that means building a third runway at Heathrow, has sparked a furious reaction from fellow Tories. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said it would be a 'disaster' while Zac Goldsmith warned he . would stand down at the next election if his party does not block expanding Britain's biggest airport. Mr Osborne, who is in charge of election . policy for the Tories, yesterday opened the door for the Conservatives to complete a sensational u-turn on the third runway issue. Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow and George Osborne sparked speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue . He is also said to be behind unconfirmed rumours that an independent panel of experts will now look at the issue, taking the decision out of MPs' hands. Downing Street today also confirmed that a consultation on airports will be launched in the next few weeks, adding that advocates of Heathrow's expansion would be able to make their case. 'I think the arguments that are put forward in favour of Heathrow . expansion are based on wild exaggerations,' Zac Goldsmith told BBC Radio 4's World . at One. 'Heathrow is already one of the busiest airports in the world.' The MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston went on: 'I think if we . enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out . expansion of Heathrow I think the Conservative Party will be very badly . defeated in areas beneath the flightpath. Anger: Tory Zac Goldsmith says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the Heathrow flight path . 'I personally would not want to stand as a Conservative candidate on a . manifesto that is ambiguous on this issue. I think we need to be very . very clear and honest with voters.' Transport Secretary Justine Greening - . whose Putney constituency lies under Heathrow flightpaths - has been a . vociferous opponent of a third runway and it is thought that her fate in . the Cabinet reshuffle this week may rest on the Prime Minister's plans . for aviation policy. Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said today that the . Government's position was unchanged since the coalition agreement of . 2010, which committed ministers to scrapping plans drawn up by the . previous Labour administration for a third runway at Heathrow. But he confirmed that a consultation process would be announced within . the next few weeks, with all sides being given the opportunity to put . their views - including proponents of a third runway. Controversial: George Osborne said yesterday that the south-east needs to expand its its air capacity, and that could include at Heathrow . The spokesman told reporters at a regular Westminster briefing: 'We said . before the summer that we would come back to this issue in the autumn. We will do that in due course... We will say more about the process in . the next few weeks.' He added: 'The Government's position on the third runway is as set out in the coalition agreement. 'What the Chancellor said was that he believed that there was a case for . additional capacity in the South-East and we should look at all the . options. 'There are strong views about this issue on both sides of the argument. Any process must involve listening to those views and, therefore, I . would expect all the options to be considered within that process. 'If we are going to listen to people's views, there are people who are . making the case for the third runway who I am sure will make that case. 'There's a coalition programme for government that sets out the position . on that, but I think there is going to be a debate about this issue and .

Upset spouse: Jamie Aguiar, wife of missing millionaire Guma Aguiar, is grieving the unknown whereabouts of her husband who disappeared in July . Her blessings include the couple’s daughter and three sons, ages 15 months to 7 years, she said. Ms. Aguiar said she is ‘thankful that they have their health. We have food on the table. I just keep reminding myself of that.’ Despite her husband's absence, the family has continued their holiday routines, the Orlando Sentinel reports. ‘We do both Christmas and Hanukkah, just as I always have,’ she told the local newspaper. ‘We have a Christmas tree and I celebrate with the children and light the menorah, too. It's a really special tradition this time of year.’ Happy times: Video released of missing Florida millionaire Guma Aguiar shows a calm, happy and smiling man sailing with his family on the same boat he went missing from on June 19 . Her 35-year-old Brazilian-born husband disappeared on June 19. The family’s legal battles include . lawsuits with an uncle over profits from a company sale as well as . lawsuits against Mr Aguiar’s siblings and mother over the ownership of . real estate in Israel. The . couple's $5 million dollar mansion, Lazzara yacht and the motorboat that . washed ashore without Mr Aguiar have been put on the market and all . remain unsold. During the . couple’s often tumultuous marriage, Mr Aguiar was committed to a . hospital for mental health-related reasons, sued his wife for divorce . and later withdrew that petition. He was on probation for domestic violence when he disappeared. Family: Jamie and Guma Aguiar pictured with three of their children at a Hapoel Jerusalem basketball game in March 2012 . Mrs Aguiar last April sought a judge's opinion on whether their prenuptial agreement was fraudulent. For . now she is focusing on giving her kids a good holiday season, and . keeping those blessings in mind, according to the Sentinel. ‘I have to do that multiple times each day, when things aren't looking so good. That's how I get through the day,’ she said. Last month, lawyers for Jamie Aguiar . implied that they believe her husband may still be alive and well - and . hiding out in the Netherlands. They are speculating that Mr Aguiar could have faked his own death to avoid losing his $100 million fortune. Not home for the holidays: Guma Aguiar vanished after steering his motorboat through Port Everglades, Florida, on a night-time cruise on July 19 . An attorney for the man's wife has told reporters that the missing man's sister intends to move to the Netherlands, raising suspicion that she could be planning to rejoin her brother, who could have relocated to Europe. Willliam Scherer, an attorney for Jamie Aguiar, told WPLG-TV that they believe Aguiar's sister, Angelika, plans to move to the Netherlands or could already be living there. A close business associate of Aguiar also resides in the Netherlands, the lawyer added. The multi-millionaire had reportedly argued with his wife, when she is said to have threatened him with a divorce, hours before he disappeared. A lawyer for Guma Aguiar's mother Ellen said the wealthy philanthropist was in low spirits when he went out on his boat that fateful Tuesday in June, after receiving the blow from Jamie. Final voyage: Mr Aguiar was last seen on his boat, 'The Zion,' pictured, before heading into the Atlantic Ocean. The boat later washed ashore but no body was recovered . Wranglings: Ellen Aguiar (pictured left) mother of missing Guma, is in a legal battle with his wife Jamie (right) over his $100million fortune . Mr Aguiar, a father of four, had filed for divorce last July but did not go through with it. The 35-year-old man had spoken with his mother, Ellen Aguiar, an hour before he got on to his 31-foot boat, the T.T. Zion, and sailed off on June 19. In addition to battling with her son's wife for control of his estimated $100 million fortune, Aguiar's mother hopes that her son may still be alive. In a petition filed to a Florida court to seize his fortune, Ellen Aguiar stated that her son 'may be in a delusional state or be suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.' His mother, Ellen Aguiar, alleged that her son's $100 million estate would be squandered by his wife. His home in Fort Lauderdale is valued at $5 million, he has seven cars valued at $1.1million, and a yacht that is valued at $2.1million, according to Mrs Aguiar's petition. Aguiar .

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 11:13 EST, 30 January 2012 . Bungee jumper on Queensland's Gold Coast: Psychologists think that the reason we're so bad at second-guessing our future selves is that we can't predict our emotions when we're assessing risk . We've all seen it - when someone is cool and confident before an event, then when the 'moment of truth' arrives they go to pieces. Now psychologists think they understand why people are so prone to doing it - and how to avoid it. When we 'sign up' to do something, we don't feel the emotions we'll feel at the crucial point - and so we make bold decisions that we then regret. People are unable to imagine what it will be like to fail - called an 'empathy gap'. The courage that people summon is illusionary - and crumbles instantly when real emotions come into play. Scientists found that merely showing a video that caused fear or embarassment before asking someone to take a risk made them far more sensible. 'People frequently face embarrassing situations in everyday life, and the illusion of courage is . likely to cause us to expose ourselves to risks that, when the moment . of truth arrives, we wish we hadn't taken,' said George Loewenstein, the CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The scientists say that people can use this knowledge to avoid looking like idiots. 'Knowing that, we might choose to be more cautious,' says Lowenstein, 'Or we might use the . illusion of courage to help us take risks we think are worth it, knowing . full well that we are likely to regret the decision when the moment of . truth arrives.' In a series of three experiments, the researchers found that people overestimate their willingness to engage in embarrassing public performances. They also found that they could reduce this illusion of courage by inducing immediate emotions that effectively put them in touch with the fear they would experience. College students were asked if they would be willing to engage in a future embarrassing situation ¿ dancing to James Brown's Sex Machine in front of the class ¿ in exchange for a few dollars. They were very bad at assessing their reactions . 'We might think that we know ourselves . well enough to predict our own behavior in such situations,' said Leaf . Van Boven, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at the . University of Colorado Boulder. 'But that knowledge isn't . sufficient to overcome the empathy gap — our inability to anticipate the . impact of emotional states we aren't currently experiencing.' In the first two experiments, college students were asked if they would be willing to engage in a future embarrassing situation — telling a funny story to their class in one study, and dancing to James Brown's Sex Machine in front of the class in the other — in exchange for a few dollars. Students were either asked outright or after being exposed to short films that aroused mild experiences of fear and anger. Students who did not view movie clips significantly overestimated their willingness to sing or dance. When they experienced negative emotions - fear and anger - as a result of watching the movie clips, students were much more accurate in predicting their own future lack of interest in performing.","People's guesses of future reactions are often wrong .

George Osbourne and other Minister splashed out £10,000 on lessons from the acting school . Chancellor George Osborne and other Coalition Ministers splashed out £10,000 of taxpayers’ money on acting lessons from Britain’s premier drama school at the same time as overseeing deep public-spending cuts. They paid the world-famous Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) for actors and voice experts in a bid to boost their performance. Rada, which helped launched the careers of Sir John Gielgud and Sir Kenneth Branagh, offers ‘role-playing’ with actors, voice-coaching and tips to boost ‘confidence and gravitas’. Embarrassingly for Mr Osborne, details of the Treasury’s own £3,000 drama bill emerged just days after he warned of the need for fresh cuts. Treasury officials refused to give details on what the lessons involved. Mr Osborne famously took voice-coaching from a £100-an-hour Harley Street expert to improve his own image when the Tories were in Opposition. The Mail on Sunday revealed in 2008 that Mr Osborne had received help from leading speech therapist Valerie Savage to make him sound less ‘posh’. According to Government credit card records, the Treasury last year paid for two sets of Rada courses –  £1,541 in October and £1,500 in February. The Department of Health spent just over £3,500 for three courses in 2012 while the Cabinet Office ran up a £675 bill in December, 2012. The Department for International Development spent £2,370 on coaching in 2012/13. Rada Enterprises, which provides the courses, lists eight other ministries and public bodies as ‘clients’. Neither the Government departments nor Rada would yesterday say exactly what had been taught in the lessons. But Whitehall officials insisted the coaching was for civil servants – not for Ministers. Figures revealed thousands of taxpayers' money was spent on lessons at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London . Last night, a government spokesman said: ‘Civil servants need the right skills to perform at the highest level and deliver better, more efficient services for the public.’ A spokeswoman for Rada Enterprises insisted it provided ‘communication skills training’ – not acting lessons. She added: ‘Communication is a core skill for in any professional environment and our training increases effectiveness in meetings, panels and presentations.’ But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When Ministers are rightly looking for extensive savings so that resources can be focused on delivering essential frontline services, people will be astounded that they are still splashing out on this kind of coaching.’","Ministers paid for lessons from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art .

Federal authorities are investigating whether school board candidates in a small, dirt-poor town in Texas used cheap beer, drugs and cigarettes to buy votes. The federal investigation into voter tampering in the tiny border-town of Donna - near the southern tip of Texas' border with Mexico - was revealed in late December, just days before the president of the town's school board is suspected of committing suicide. So far, three people in Donna - which is so poor that several houses are without electricity and even running water - have been arrested by federal authorities in connection to the alleged voter tampering. Bribes: Authorities say voters in Donna, Texas were bribed by political operatives to vote for certain candidates (Stock Photo) One of the women indicted, 48-year-old Diana Balderas Castaneda, admitted to authorities that she bribed roughly 10 people to vote for Democratic school board candidates during the 2012 election. But authorities suspect these types of bribes began much earlier than the general election - Castaneda also told authorities that a school board candidate gave her $125 to give food and cash to primary voters in exchange for their vote. According to charging documents obtained by ABCNews.com, she sometimes gave voters up to $20 per vote. And in several cases, Castaneda told authorities, she paid voters in cigarettes or beer, or took voters to buy drugs after a campaign manager paid them for votes. An unidentified witness told the FBI that in the days leading up to the 2012 election, Castaneda gave her a card with the names of candidates on it. Poverty: Donna is so poor that authorities say voters were bribed with things like beer and cigarettes . On the cards, she told federal investigators, 'the opposing candidates' names were crossed out.' 'After voting, Castaneda told Witness 2 she would meet him/her at the . shed by Witness 2's friend's house that same day to pay Witness 2,' federal . prosecutors allege in court documents. 'She paid Witness 2 $10 for . voting for her candidates.' Two others arrested as a result of the investigation are Guadalupe Escamilla, 72, and Rebecca Gonzalez, 44, each of whom was arrested in December and formally indicted last week. Not long after the feds made their arrests, Donna school board President Alfredo Lugo was found dead in his home of an apparent hanging.It's unclear whether the women who were arrested worked for Lugo, and he was not specifically named in any of the charging documents against the women - nor were any other members of the school board involved with the vote-buying case. 'Lost': School board President Alfredo Lugo committed suicide just days after authorities began arresting people in the vote-tampering case . Donna is an extremely poor section of Texas, with many residents living in dilapidated shanty-type homes. 'People are desperate and hungry,' a legal source close to the case told ABC. 'It does not excuse illegality, but people do weird things because of poverty.' Lugo was described by the source as a 'hero to the community' who may have lost his way. Each of the women charged face up to five years in prison if convicted.","Three women in Donna, Texas, have been indicted in the federal vote-tampering case .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 24 January 2014 . The Arizona sheriff best known for forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and live in tents - as well as 'deputizing' actor Steven Segal and organizing a 'posse' to investigate whether President Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen - announced yesterday that he has put 38 jail inmates on a 'bread and water diet.' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio - America's self-proclaimed 'toughest sheriff' - issued a press release on Thursday announcing that the 38 inmates will be dining on nothing but bread and water as punishment for 'desecrating the American flag.' 'These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells,' Arpaio says in the release. 'Tearing them, writing on them, stepping on them, throwing them in the toilet, trash or wherever they feel, it's a disgrace to those who have fought for our county [sic]. Besides this is government property that they are destroying, and we will take action against those who act this way.' 'Tough': Sheriff Joe Arpaio has put jail inmates who damaged American flags on a diet of bread and water . Arpaio's bread and water meal plan isn't the only jail-house cuisine served in the Maricopa County jail system - the sheriff also punishes problem inmates by forcing them to eat his 'nutraloaf,' or 'loaf' for short. Arpaio's loaf is a mash of vegetables, fruit, meat and other nutrients that are blended together and baked into a bread-like loaf. 'Quite frankly, I don't think I'd eat this,' Arpaio said before trying - and gagging on - the loaf during a press conference announcing that federal court had upheld his decision to use it in his jails. In addition to the news about flags being placed in the cells, and putting those who damage the flags on a diet of bread and water, Arpaio - who is well known for his media gimmicks - announced yesterday that he also requires the inmates to sing The Star-Spangled Banner in the morning and God Bless America at night. Loaf: Arpaio also forces inmates to eat 'herbaloaf' - a mash of fruit vegetables and other nutrients . During the holidays, the sheriff traditionally plays Christmas music throughout the jail - 24 hours a day. The 81-year-old Arpaio has been the sheriff in Maricopa County - which includes the cities of Phoenix and Scottsdale - for more than 20 years. In that time, he has created controversy over his policies on illegal immigrants, targeting his political opponents and abusing power. Last month, the sheriff was ordered to pay two former newspaper executives $3.75 million after he had them thrown in jail on bogus charges that were almost immediately dropped. The two former executives - Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin - maintain that they were targeted by the vengeful sheriff because their newspaper, the Phoenix New Times, often was critical of the sheriff. Pretty in pink: Arpaio's most well-known gimmick is making jail inmates wear pink underwear . Arpaio also has been the target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he directs his officers to racially profile Latinos for traffic stops. According to DOJ lawsuit against the sheriff, Arpaio's practices are 'discriminatory and otherwise unconstitutional law enforcement actions . against Latinos who are frequently stopped, detained and arrested on the . basis of race, color, or national origin.' The sheriff also made headlines when a Pulitzer Prize-winning article in the East Valley Tribune newspaper revealed that his office had neglected to investigate several hundred sex crimes reported to his office that occurred in a small, unincorporated town called El Mirage. Hundreds of victims - including dozens of children who claimed to have been molested - said that they called the sheriff's office about the alleged sexual abuse but they were never investigated. Tent City: Arpaio keeps jail inmates in outdoor tents. He often says that if soldiers can sleep in tents, so can inmates . Critics of the sheriff's immigration policies say that he spends too much time chasing illegal immigrants - which is not technically in his job description, but helps earn him votes during election years - and not enough time policing unincorporated parts of the county or serving felony warrants, both of which are in his job description. Arpaio says he plans to run for yet another term as the county's top law enforcement officer. He'll be 85 years old the next time there is an election for sheriff in Maricopa County.","Sheriff Joe Arpaio is well known for staging publicity gimmicks at his jails .

Arizona State University is severing all ties with a fraternity following a 'racist' Martin Luther King Jr Day party where guests were photographed wearing sports jerseys, flashing gang . signs and drinking out of carved watermelons. The school said in a statement on Thursday that it has notified Tau Kappa Epsilon its recognition as a fraternity chapter at ASU has been permanently revoked. This means the 65-year-old local chapter is no longer affiliated with ASU, the group won't be listed on the university's website and it cannot recruit members or hold on-campus meetings. Severed links: Arizona Statue University has cut all ties with Tau Kappa Epsilon after it hosted a racist Martin Luther King Jr Day party . Distasteful: Guests were asked to 'dress like black people' Antics: Guests at the party were pictured holding cups carved out of watermelons . Tau Kappa Epsilon was placed on probation in 2012 and then suspended for hosting the party on January 19, while ASU investigated. Meanwhile, civil-rights leaders demanded the university expel the fraternity, following the party which asked guests to 'dress like black people'. University officials said they still are investigating the event and deciding how to handle individual cases of student discipline. Alex Baker, a spokesman for the national fraternity organization, said Tau Kappa Epsilon has received the university's findings and planned to release the results of its own investigation shortly. Baker previously said the group does not condone racist or discriminatory behaviour. Pictures from the party made their way onto social media websites, depicting guests dressed in basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and holding cups carved out of watermelons. The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, an Arizona civil rights activist, who reportedly learned of the events from an African-American student among the guests, said the party antics were outrageous and offensive. He described the fraternity members' conduct as an exercise in 'advanced racism' and suggested they had 'intentionally' wanted to cause offence. Maupin said: ‘I don't think this was a sense of ignorance, I think it was purposeful and intentionally hurtful and they put into play, quote 'MLK Black Party' and not in a way to honor King.’ He called for the school to expel all students involved and permanently ban the fraternity from affiliation with ASU. Celebration: Away from the ASU fraternity, thousands joined Martin Luther King Day parades to celebrate the life of the civil rights leader . Founded in 1899 at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Ill., the fraternity has about 257,000 members at 291 chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada, according to its website. In 2012, the University of Arizona stripped its local chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon of recognition after an investigation showed multiple instances of dangerous hazing.

A dog that mauled to death a 1-year-old boy but avoided being euthanized after a Nevada judge spared the animal's life has found a new home nearly two years after the fatal attack. Onion, a 120-pound Mastiff-Rhodesian Ridgeback-mix, has been turned over to Lexus Project, a New York-based animal rights organization, and the group plans to take the dog to an animal sanctuary rather than allowing it to be euthanized after a years-long court battle with animal control officials in Henderson, Nevada. Animal control wanted the dog euthanized, but Lexus Project fought the officials in court for nearly two years. On Thursday, animal control officials announced that they had given up the fight and have turned the dog over to Lexus Project.

'As part of the court proceedings, . family members would have been required to testify and relive the . horrible details of that day,' Henderson city spokesman Bud Cranor said in a . statement obtained by the Las Vegas Sun. 'We didn’t want the family to have to endure that tragedy all . over again.'

Eskew-Shahan, we will make no further comment on this subject. It’s . over.' Eskew-Shahan died just after celebrating his first birthday when the six-year-old Onion lashed out and clamped onto the child's head for 30 seconds with his massive jaws. The dog shook Jeremiah as he bit down, breaking the boy's neck and mangling his face. 'There is nothing vicious about the . attack,' Lexus Project's Richard Rosenthal told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in May of 2012 . After Henderson officials had decided to euthanize Onion, District Judge Rob Bare issued an emergency restraining order that temporarily stopped Henderson animal control officials from destroying the dog after the Lexus Project filed a legal petition. If not for that order, the dog could have been euthanized in May of 2012. 'Killing the dog will not bring back the baby,'  Mr Rosenthal, a New York lawyer, told the newspaper at the time.

Onion latched on to Jeremiah’s face and neck and began shaking him back and forth. ‘I tried everything I could think of to do to try and get him off our baby,’ Ms Keller recalled tearfully to WXIX. However, she was unable to pry Onion off her grandson. Mr Shahan, rushed to help, saying that his son’s jaw was loose and half of his face was missing.

The NFL sideline reporter who prompted Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's now-famous - or infamous - sideline rant on Sunday says that the controversial interview with the Stanford grad was 'awesome.' FOX Sports reporter Erin Andrews has been covering professional sports for nearly 15 years, but she says her interview with Sherman - during which he rants about San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree being a 'sorry receiver' while lauding himself as 'the best corner in the game' - will be one of the most memorable. 'It was awesome because I’ve done so . many interviews that are just so cliché and so rehearsed and the same . old same old where you feel like you’re sleepwalking,' Andrews said in an interview with Elle magazine. 'This is one where I was like, ‘What is happening right . now?’ I’ve never been a part of something like that, and obviously . that’s why everyone nationally is talking about it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Awesome: Erin Andrews describes her interview with Richard Sherman as awesome, noting that he's one of her favorites players in the NFL . And she's right - in the weeks leading up to a Super Bowl that includes future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning's quest for his second championship, the media is more focused on Sherman, who most people hadn't even heard of until his dramatic interview with Andrews. While many are vilifying Sherman for his lack of sportsmanship after Seattle beat the 49ers, Andrews says he's still one of her favorite players. 'I actually really like Richard Sherman a lot,' she said. 'He’s probably one of my favorite football players. The guy is so smart and he’s got an unbelievable story. That was just pure, raw emotion.' Memories: In her 14 years covering professional sports, Andrews says her interview with Sherman will probably be the most memorable . Sherman's short interview with Andrews started with her asking him to take her through the final play of the game, when he tipped a would-be game-winning pass to Crabtree in the end zone, securing Seattle's place in this year's Super Bowl. 'Well, I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're gonna get .... Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real quick,' he aggressively responded to Andrews' question. In an interview with CNN days after the interview with Andrews, a more composed Sherman apologized for the tirade while also condemning those that blamed his behavior on race - especially so close to Martin Luther King Jr Day. Sorry: Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman apologized for attacking Michael Crabtree in an epic sideline rant in an interview two days later with CNN . 'It's a small part of who I am': Richard Sherman said adrenaline and a long-standing grudge made him launch his attack on Michael Crabtree . 'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world. I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way,' Sherman said. 'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.' He says his behavior has to be seen in the context of playing an intensely competitive sport. 'If you catch me in the moment on the field when I am still in that zone, when I'm still as competitive as I can be and I'm trying to be in the place where I have to be to do everything I can to be successful ... and help my team win, then it's not going to come out as articulate, as smart, as charismatic -- because on the field I'm not all those things,' he said. But he says there's no excuse for the people who called him a 'thug' and a 'monkey' on Twitter. 'What they did was an actual reality. They showed their true character. Those were real comments, not in a moment, not in a - you know, they had time to think about it. They were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way. And I thought society had moved past that.' Crucial moment: Richard Sherman (25) hit the ball away from San Francisco's Michael Crabtree (15) to prevent a game winning touchdown in the dying moments of last night's NFC Championship game . While he wouldn't apologize for the content of what he said, the Stanford communications graduate did regret the way in which it was said and how that impacted him team. 'Mostly I regret the - I guess the storm afterwards. The - you know, the way it was covered, the way it was perceived, and the attention that it took away from the fantastic performances from my teammates, you know,' Sherman told Nichols. 'I probably shouldn't have attacked another person. I don't mean to attack him. And that was immature. And I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that. But I just felt like my teammates deserved better. And I - you know, I have to apologize to them and I have.'

The company changed its 'Simply Natural' line of Frito-Lay chips to be called 'Simply,' although the ingredients remain the same. Similarly, its 'Natural Quaker Granola' got a makeover as 'Simply Quaker Granola.' The food and beverage giant says the name changes, which took place last year, are the result of it updating its marketing. But they come at a time when PepsiCo and other companies face legal challenges over their use of the word 'natural.' Re-brand: PepsiCo has quietly gotten rid of the word Natural in some of its products and instead is going with Simply . Simple enough: Is there anything natural about these Harvest bars? The Food and Drug Administration doesn't have a definition for what constitutes 'natural,' but says it doesn't object to the word's use as long as the product doesn't contain 'added color, artificial flavors or synthetic substances.' Still, a number of lawsuits recently have challenged whether the ingredients in products labeled as 'natural' fit that billing. In some cases, companies are realizing the use of 'natural' isn't worth the headache, said Steve Gardner, director of litigation for the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against companies on the topic. Last year, PepsiCo agreed to remove the words 'all natural' from its Naked juices after a lawsuit noted the drinks contained artificial ingredients, such as a fiber made by Archer Midland Daniels. Another ongoing lawsuit filed in 2012 . has challenged its description of some of its chips as 'natural.' And in .

Natural no more: PepsiCo killed off its Gatorade Natural line, saying the drinks didn't 'resonate' with its core consumers . 'We constantly update our marketing and packaging,' said Candace Mueller-Medina, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo's Quaker brand. PepsiCo Inc. isn't alone in retreating from 'natural.' The owners of Ben & Jerry's and Breyers ice cream agreed to change its packaging in 2012 to settle lawsuits over its use of 'all natural.' Campbell Soup was sued in 2012 for describing its Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers as natural, with the suit noting they contain genetically modified ingredients. The Camden, N.J.-based company removed the word from its revamped packaging, but said it was the result of marketing changes and declined to comment any further on the change. The word 'simply' isn't entirely free of controversy either. Although it didn't file a lawsuit, the Center for Science in the Public Interest met with General Mills in 2010 over labeling on a variety of the company's products. Among those singled out was 'Simply Fruit,' which the group noted contained canola oil and carrot juice â€” not just fruit.

George Zimmerman's recent foray into the art world hasn't exactly earned him much critical praise. But it's definitely garnered him some attention - so much so that it could potentially get him sued by one of the largest news-wire services on earth. For his latest painting, the man acquitted of murder in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin has painted a portrait of Florida State Attorney General Angela Corey, who is the woman who decided to charge Zimmerman with murder in Martin's death. The problem for Zimmerman, however, is that the photo he used as the basis for his painting is owned by the Associated Press, and the wire service doesn't appear too keen on the idea of letting Zimmerman use it free of charge. 'Art': George Zimmerman painted this painting of Angela Corey, the state attorney who charged him with murder in Trayvon Martin's death . Look familiar: This photo was taken by an AP photographer in April 2012. The AP has sent Zimmerman a cease-and-desist order . The photo was taken at a press conference Corey held in April of 2012 by AP photographer Rick Wilson. Now, both Wilson and the AP have taken action to prevent Zimmerman from using the image.

'I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols . that represent my experiences,' a post attributed to Zimmerman ebay reads. 'My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and . allows me to remain indoors.' With that in mind, Zimmerman also is about $2 million in debt for unpaid legal fees, and his only previous painting sold for more than $100,000. According to his brother, Zimmerman hopes to cash in on his latest work, too.

A fiercely conservative Texas congressman who is mounting a long-shot challenge from the right against Senate minority whip John Cornyn has made virtually no public appearances in recent weeks as questions mount about his campaign finances. Republican Steve Stockman has missed 17 straight House votes since January 9 - including one on the $1.1 trillion omnibus federal spending package that he promised on Twitter to vote against. That's unusual since, even though Stockman has a reputation as a Capitol Hill renegade, he missed only about a dozen major votes all last year. Challenge: Republican congressman Steve Stockman's has made virtually no public appearances in recent weeks as questions mount about his campaign's growing debts . The disappearance is mystifying for conservative activists who were hoping Stockman could help them land another blow against the GOP establishment this year. Texas has been a showcase for the right wing's power since firebrand Ted Cruz rose from back in the party's ranks in 2012 to become a U.S. Senate sensation. But Stockman's challenge has slipped from quixotic to downright unusual. ‘He thought he was another Ted Cruz and he isn't,’ said William Murray, chairman of the Washington-based Government is Not God PAC, which backed Stockman's congressional campaigns in the 1990s and 2012 but has now endorsed Cornyn. Stockman is trying to oust senate minority whip John Cornyn, left, and his supporters had hoped he could emulate the success of Ted Cruz, another right-wing firebrand from Texas . Once a homeless college dropout, Stockman is a born-again Christian who lists his official occupation as ‘Constitutionalist.’ He served one term in Congress beginning in 1994, then returned last year and has attracted attention in conservative circles with flamboyant rhetoric about impeaching President Barack Obama and promoting gun rights. Stockman even had a copy of the book Impeachable Offenses: The Case For Removing Barack Obama From Office hand-delivered to all 435 House members. After first dropping out of sight, the congressman recently was spotted on a visit to Egypt as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee - but where he's gone since then is unclear. Stockman's staff won't say where he is. They have ignored more than six weeks of emails, telephone messages and social media posts from The Associated Press and other news outlets. Stockman, right, pictured at  the Million Vet March on the Memorials at the U.S. National World War II Memorial in Washington last October, alongside Sarah Palin and Senator Ted Cruz . Cornyn, seeking his third term, has a campaign that's been more responsive: ‘It's up to Texans to decide if they think someone who doesn't show up to work or adhere to election law deserves a promotion,’ said spokesman Drew Brandewie. Though skipping votes isn't uncommon for congressmen who are campaigning, Stockman hasn't done much campaigning, even with Texas' March 4 Republican primary now looming. Since suddenly withdrawing his bid for re-election to his House seat and filing against Cornyn on Dec. 9, Stockman has made just one major public appearance in Texas - chastising Cornyn as too liberal before about 50 tea party activists at a north Dallas church Jan. 14. That followed his skipping a scheduled appearance before a larger tea party group in Bedford, near Fort Worth. Dale Huls, a board member of the Clear Lake Tea Party in Stockman's district, said the congressman has been quietly courting conservative organizations and local grassroots activists. Still, he called Stockman's campaign ‘a little chaotic.’ ‘I would expect a more transparent staff to citizens and tea party groups,’ Huls said. Fake? The photo, above, appears to show John Cornyn with President Obama . Original: Several media outlets claim the image was doctored from this 2009 photo showing Charlie Crist with Obama . Stockman's problems go beyond visibility. He has reported having only about $32,000 in cash on-hand and $163,000 in debts, while Cornyn's campaign fund is nearly $7 million. Murray, of the Government is Not God PAC, said he got a call soliciting donations for Stockman but ‘I was so furious he was throwing away that congressional seat, I dressed them down pretty good.’ The anti-tax Club for Growth has shunned him - after spending around $5.5 million to help Cruz upset mainstream Republican contender David Dewhurst in the state's 2012 U.S. Senate GOP primary. Since making it back to Congress, Stockman has thrived on shock-value publicity, claiming ‘Democrats worship abortion with the same fervor the Canaanites worshipped Molech’ and offering supporters a campaign bumper sticker reading, ‘If babies had guns, they wouldn't be aborted.’ A Stockman campaign website suggesting that Cornyn secretly supports the White House-backed health care law even doctored what appears to be an old picture of then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist beaming at the president to make it look like Cornyn was the one doing so. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, right, participates in a mock swearing-in ceremony with Speaker of the House Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, for the 113th Congress in Washington . But investigations by The Houston Chronicle and the watchdog Sunlight Foundation have uncovered a bevy of potential violations of Federal Election Commission rules. In October, Stockman fired two congressional staffers for making prohibited contributions to his campaign. Some tea party groups maintain that Stockman can still rally. ‘I know that Steve has gotten hit from multiple sides,’ said Larry Ward, political director of the Revolution PAC in Washington, ‘but that wouldn't be happening if he weren't a serious threat.’","Steve Stockman is running against Texas Senator John Cornyn who he says is 'too liberal'

Washoe District Judge Patrick Flanagan sentenced Scott Thorson, 54, on Wednesday after a string of bad drug tests capped by his failure to show up at a court-ordered treatment facility. Flanagan originally suspended the prison sentence in July and gave Thorson a second chance in September after testing positive for methamphetamine, but he failed tests twice in October and again on November 1. Jailed: Scott Thorson, aka Jess Marlow, is seen in a police booking photo after his arrest for violating the terms of his probation when he failed a drug test September 5, 2013 in Reno, Nevada .

Thorson, whose real name is Jess Marlow, had admitted he was an addict but insisted he was determined to get sober when he tearfully appealed to the judge in September to spare him from prison. 'I'm just asking for another chance,' Thorson said, explaining he was dealing with his newfound celebrity status. 'I can't help who I am,' he told the judge at the time. 'I'm in showbusiness. I attract these cameras.' Former lovers: Liberace (left) with Thorson (right) in 1981 . Flanagan said it would be his 'last chance.' 'I'm not impressed - I don't think anybody is - with this so-called celebrity status,' he said. 'You're just like any other addict who has committed a crime against a victim.' Thorson had said his goal was to write another book on the heels of his Behind the Candelabra, which was used as the basis for the HBO film of the same name that won the Golden Globe for best TV movie earlier this month.

Matt Damon played Thorson in the film, and Michael Douglas, who donned flamboyant costumes to play Liberace, claimed his fourth Golden Globe for his work.

With the benefit of hindsight it was probably not a wise decision for this laden tow truck to venture onto the thin ice. Having been called out to rescue a hapless motorist who had plunged into a frozen lake surface, the salvage crew fell victim to the same fate. The bungling mechanics found themselves needing rescue after driving on to the treacherous water at Xining in Qinghai province in the northwest of China. Trapped: A salvage truck sits half submerged in the lake ice after falling through the brittle surface . The comedy of errors began when a local sports club decided to stage a party on the lake. Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, wanted to get into the swing of festivities and decided to liven up the event by taking his car for a spin across the ice. But he and his friends were forced to leap out quickly when they ice in front of the car cracked sending the front-end sinking into the frozen lake but then wedging on the rim of the ice. Eyewitness Lee Shen said: 'He was lucky it didn't sink immediately but stuck on the rim of the unbroken ice allowing him and his pals to jump out. Entombed: A salvage crew venture on to the thin ice to begin trying to free the sunken vehicle . Danger: Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, decided to take his car for a spin across the lake - not realising how thin the ice was in parts . 'People on the shore went to help by using heavy wooden poles to try and leave the car back out but that was really foolish because it levered it off the edge - where it sank into the ice hole.' A rescue truck that was on the scene then tried to help. But acting on bad advice that it was quite safe the truck also drove onto the ice, where it then fell through and also became stuck leaving both vehicles stranded.

For more than two centuries, a dark and sinister secret has laid buried deep within the walls of the ancient Bithynian kingdom. Archaeologists excavating the 2,300-year-old remains of the region in modern-day Bursa, Turkey have uncovered a series of dungeons and tunnels that would have been used to lead prisoners to their death. Inside these dungeons, the researchers also found torture chambers, death pits and even a well covered in what appears to be blood. Archaeologists excavating city walls of the 2,300-year-old region of Bithynia in modern-day Bursa, Turkey, have uncovered a series of dungeons and tunnels. Stock image of Bursa walls pictured. Inside these dungeons, the researchers found torture chambers, death pits and even a well covered in what appears to be blood . Bithynia was an ancient kingdom and Roman province in the northwest of Asia Minor between 297 and 274BC. The dungeons were found during restoration of the Zindan . Kapi part of the wall, in the Alacahirka region of modern-day Bursa. These dungeons were connected to towers where prisoners would have been kept. Hangmen . of the time, who were deaf and mute, would have cut off the heads of . the prisoners and thrown them into the well, while remaining body parts . were given to the prisoner’s relatives. The hangmen were also known to have sold the dead bodies back to the families for a price. The discovery was made by İbrahim Yılmaz, from the Uludağ University Faculty of Science and Literature History of Art Department. He was part of an excavation team set up as part of a wider project to reveal the old city walls of the region now known as Bursa, in the northwest of Turkey. The walls stretch for 3.4km around the city and the Bursa Municipality is funding the restoration of the centuries-old foundations. It was during restoration of the Zindan Kapi part of the wall, in the Alacahirka region, that Yilmaz made the gruesome discovery. The dungeons were found buried beneath the foundations of houses where people were living at the time, but have since been demolished. Yimiz told Hurriyet Daily News that the Bursa dungeons of that time were underground structures known as ‘stucco’. These dungeons were connected to towers where prisoners would have been kept.

The Food and Drug Administration says knowledge about nutrition has evolved over the last 20 years, and the labels need to reflect that. As the agency considers revisions, nutritionists and other health experts have their own wish list of desired changes. Calories to the front of the line: New labels will likely focus on calories, but remove calories from fat . The number of calories should be more prominent, they say, and the amount of added sugar and percentage of whole wheat in the food should be included. They also want more clarity on how serving sizes are defined. 'There's a feeling that nutrition labels haven't been as effective as they should be.' says Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'When you look at the label, there are roughly two dozen numbers of substances that people aren't intuitively familiar with.' For example, he says, most of the nutrients are listed in grams, the metric system's basic unit of mass. Jacobson says people don't really understand what a gram is. Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, says 20 years ago 'there was a big focus on fat, and fat undifferentiated.' Since then, health providers have focused more on calories and warned people away from saturated and trans fats more than all fats. Trans fats were separated out on the label in 2006. The nutrition facts label 'is now 20 years old, the food environment has changed and our dietary guidance has changed,' says Taylor, who was at the agency in the early 1990s when the FDA first introduced the label at the behest of Congress. 'It's important to keep this updated so what is iconic doesn't become a relic.' The FDA has sent guidelines for the new labels to the White House, but Taylor would not estimate when they might be released. The FDA has been working on the issue for a decade, he said. Due for a makeover: Current food labels focus more on outdated portion sizes and fat content . There's evidence that more people are reading the labels in recent years. According to an Agriculture Department study released this month, a greater percentage of adults reported using the nutrition facts panel and other claims on food packages 'always or most of the time' in 2009 and 2010 compared with two years earlier. The USDA study said 42 percent of working adults used the panel always or most of the time in 2009 and 2010, up from 34 percent. Older adults used it 57 percent of the time during that period, up from 51 percent. One expected change in the label is to make the calorie listing more prominent, and Regina Hildwine of the Grocery Manufacturers Association said that could be useful to consumers. Her group represents the nation's largest food companies. Hildwine said FDA also has suggested that it may be appropriate to remove the 'calories from fat' declaration on the label. It's not yet clear what other changes the FDA could decide on. Nutrition advocates are hoping the agency adds a line for sugars and syrups that are not naturally occurring in foods and drinks and are added when they are processed or prepared. Right now, some sugars are listed separately among the ingredients and some are not. It may be difficult for the FDA to figure out how to calculate added sugars, however. Food manufacturers are adding naturally occurring sugars to their products so they can label them as natural â€” but the nutrition content is no different. Other suggestions from health advocates: . Tracy Fox, a Washington-based nutrition consultant, says clearer information is needed to balance the billions of dollars a year that the food industry spends on food marketing. 'There's a lot of information there, it's messy,' she says. 'There may be a way to call out certain things and put them in context.'","Food labels are being redesigned for the first time in 20 years .
'Calories from fat' may be removed .
'Per cent of whole wheat' could be added .
Serving sizes are likely to be tweaked to reflect more realistic portions .
Add the percentage of whole wheat to the label. Many manufacturers will label products 'whole wheat' when there is really only a small percentage of it in the food.
Clearer measurements. Jacobson of CSPI and others have suggested that the FDA use teaspoons, as well as grams, for added sugars, since consumers can envision a teaspoon.
Serving sizes that make sense. There's no easy answer, but health experts say that single-size servings that are clearly meant to be eaten in one sitting will often list two or three servings on the label, making the calorie and other nutrient information deceptive. FDA said last year that it may add another column to the labels, listing nutrition information per serving and per container. The agency may also adjust recommended serving sizes for some foods.
Package-front labeling. Beyond the panel on the back, nutrition experts have pushed for labels on the package front for certain nutrients so consumers can see them more easily. The FDA said several years ago it would issue guidelines for front of pack labeling, but later said it would hold off to see whether the industry could create its own labels."

New set of laws, which ban nearly all forms of protest in the ex-Soviet country and have enraged demonstrators, were officially published today, and are set to come into force at midnight. The laws, set out in the wake of warnings from President Viktor Yanukovych that the violence threatened the entire country, allow for jail terms of up to . five years for those who blockade public buildings. They also set out provisions to arrest protesters wearing masks or helmets.

Russian police are hunting three women suspected of preparing for suicide bomb attacks, with one thought to be hiding in the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi. So-called ‘black widows’ – the wives of slain Islamic militants – have been blamed for recent suicide attacks in the country which left dozens dead. Islamic groups have already threatened to strike during the Games, which begin on February 7. Police have warned the public to be on the lookout for three women trained ‘to perpetrate acts of terrorism’, with Ruzanna Ibragimova, 22, believed to be at large in Sochi. It is not known where the others are hiding. Russia has mounted an intense security operation around Olympic venues, but there is concern that ‘soft targets’ – such as buses and tourist facilities – are vulnerable to attack. He said: 'They show that the situation is getting out of control', describing the situation as an 'absolute violation of all European norms of behaviour'. He also slammed the EU's 'indecent' support of the protest movement against Yanukovych. On Tuesday, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay called the situation in Ukraine 'very worrying' and said the government should suspend the controversial anti-protest laws. The clashes follow two months of protests, and are thought to have involved some 10,000 demonstrators. It was not immediately clear how many protesters were injured as many were afraid to seek medical help on fears of getting arrested, but activists said hundreds were hurt. At least 35 journalists were hurt in the clashes and some received injuries to their faces and eyes from rubber bullets, Ukrainian press freedom group the Institute of Mass Information said. The interior ministry said 50 activists had been arrested as part of an investigation for mass rioting. Calls for peace: Members of the Ukrainian clergy stand between police and demonstrators .

Klitschko went to the presidential administration in Kiev for a meeting with Yanukovych but left after being told the president was too busy to receive him, his party said. Opposition leaders appeared unable to have any influence on the hard core of radical protesters and stopped short of supporting their actions. But Ukraine's jailed former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko came out in support of those clashing with police, saying she would be with them if she could. And today opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who had previously condemned violent protests, said the situation has changed.

A kitten born with a defect so severe that it could not stand or walk, has found new purr-pose in life, thanks to medical help from a Chicago animal shelter. Stockings was just a few weeks old when he was brought in to the Tree House Humane Society, where staff noticed his hind legs were hyperextended backwards, forming a 'W' shape. The deformity meant that Stockings couldn't play, jump or use a litter box and he developed sores on his legs as the orange tabby dragged himself along. When he arrived at the centre, he was also underweight and suffering from an upper respiratory infection. Medical miracle: Stockings the kitten has undergone surgery after he was born with his hind legs turned inward . Tree House . spokeswoman Jenny Schlueter told ABC Chicago: 'He had to drag his whole behind, and we . knew that was going to be a really difficult way to live.' 'He had a lot of energy and wanted to run around like other kittens and play. 'He'd jump up and fall on his face - he really wanted to do what he couldn't do.' But rather than opting to put him down, Tree House contacted Dr Steve Neihaus, an orthopaedic specialist who suggested a series of operations to cut the tendons in Stockings' hind legs so they could be realigned. Schlueter added: 'We knew it was risky. We knew there were no guarantees it would work.' Although the procedures were experimental, Dr Neihaus believed doing nothing for the then eight-week-old kitten would mean he would have to be euthanised. 'We went forward with surgery knowing we . could never make him normal. 'Our goal was to make his feet functional so . he could live a happy, pain-free life.' Rescued: Stockings was taken to the Tree House Humane Society in Chicago . Operation success: Stockings underwent four procedures to realign his hind legs . No alternative: Dr Neihaus believed doing nothing would mean Stockings would have to be euthanised . The eight-week-old underwent his first surgery in October, followed by three more procedures - and the result was a success. With his feet now pointing in the right direction, Stockings has 'blossomed into a rambunctious, lively, and energetic kitten'. The fearless feline can walk, run and play as well as any other normal kitten. Stockings has even found the purr-fect ending to his endearing tale, having been adopted by Priscilla Cherry, a veterinary technician who cared for the kitty while he underwent his surgeries. She said: 'I saw him trying to grab people through . the bars of his kennel without a care about his malformed legs, and I . knew he was for me.'

A minister has claimed expenses for returning to Parliament for last year’s crunch debate on Syria, despite missing the crucial vote. Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds faced embarrassment last summer after it emerged he was one of 10 members of the Government who missed the key vote on David Cameron’s bid to launch retaliatory strikes against Syria, which was lost. He was apparently deep in conversation about Rwanda with International Development Secretary Justine Greening in a room just yards from the Commons chamber and did not hear the bell for the crucial vote. Foreign office minister Mark Simmonds claimed £100 to return to the Commons for a vote - which he missed because he was in a nearby rooming discussing Rwanda with International Development Secretary Justine Greening . But figures released by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) revealed that, despite missing the vote, Mr Simmonds lodged two mileage claims totalling £112.50 for driving to Westminster and back from his constituency in Boston, Lincolnshire. Mr Cameron recalled Parliament on August 29 to debate the principle of British involvement in military action in Syria, after reports of war crimes by the Assad regime against his own people. Figures released yesterday revealed that MPs have so far claimed more than £8,000 in expenses for travelling back for the one-day sitting of Parliament, although the final figure is likely to be significantly higher. MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject British intervention military in principle, forcing David Cameron to abandon all plans for the UK to become involved in Syria. In total 10 members of David Cameron's . government failed to turn up to take part in the vote on military action . in Syria which the Prime Minister lost by just 13 votes. Other prominent expense claims for returning for the vote included a £550 . bill for a flight back from Nice, France, by Chief Whip Sir George . Young, who was accused of presiding over a ‘shambolic’ whipping . operation. Sir George claimed an identical sum to fly his wife Aurelia . home with him. Cabinet minister Miss Greening, who did not claim expenses to return to London, was forced to apologise to Mr Cameron personally for failing to enter the division lobby in time to register her name. Shock: The House of Commons was stunned when the result of the Syria vote was announced, inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the Prime Minister . The vote forced David Cameron to abandon any plans to for Britain to be involved in military action in Syria . But it sparked a public spat between the minister and Commons officials, who insisted the bells were working correctly. All MPs knew there would be two votes – one after another – at 10pm at the end of yesterday’s eight-hour debate. Miss Greening and Mr Simmonds, minister for Africa, both took part in the first vote to defeat the Labour amendment to the motion. But they then went off for a discussion on a Rwanda in the Reasons Room - a small, 'almost soundproofed' office reserved for ministers near the Chamber. A source close to Miss Greening suggested clerks 'confirmed' they had not rung the bell and by the time she realised the mistake, the vote had happened. After MailOnline reported the claims, Commons officials carried out tests on the bells to proive they were working and had been rung. Government chief whip Sir George Young claimed £550 to return from holiday in France while Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt claimed £420 for help with his tax returns . Defence minister Philip Dunne billed taxpayers for a £152 taxi ride from his holiday resort in Greece in order to catch a flight home from Athens. The Conservatives yesterday highlighted expenses claims by prominent Labour figures to pay for accountants to help them fill in their tax returns. Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt claimed £420 for the service. Mr Hunt, who rose to fame as a TV historian, declared outside earnings of almost £40,000 last year on top of his MPs’ salary of £66,396. Most of his earnings came from writing articles and books. Other claimants included the shadow culture minister Helen Goodman who claimed £945 for an accountant and the shadow local government minister Chris Williamson, who claimed £534. Claiming for accountancy services is allowed under the expenses rules, but is likely to raise eyebrows among members of the public who believe the system remains too generous. MPs claimed a total of £4.58 million in the latest round of expenses, which cover the two months of August and September last year, during most of which time the Commons was not sitting.","David Cameron was humiliated after losing by just 13 votes in August .

Generous donors have contributed more than $55,000 to the family of an 8-year-old boy who saved his relatives from a fire before dying in the flames - but his parents are now fighting over how the money should be spent. A friend and neighbor of Tyler Doohan's mother, Crystal Vrooman, set up the online fundraiser through the website YouCaring and initially hoped to raise $5,000 to 'give this baby the (funeral) service he deserves.' But the incredibly heroic actions of the boy who went back into the burning mobile home to rescue his disabled grandfather made headlines the world over, resulting in more than 10 times that amount flooding in for the family. Fundraiser: A friend and neighbor of Tyler Doohan's mother, Crystal Vrooman, set up the online fundraiser through the website YouCaring and initially hoped to raise $5,000 to 'give this baby the (funeral) service he deserves' 'My intention was to pay for the memorial service,' Theresa Fiorica, 28, told FoxNews.com. 'I didn't think that it was going to go as far and as big as it did.' The account names Vrooman as the beneficiary, and the distraught mother, who did not live in the Penfield trailer that burned, said she hopes to use the money to buy a new home. 'My son just got lost in a huge tragedy,' Vrooman told FoxNews.com. 'Do you think I want to move into a trailer? I want a nice house (as) I have always been telling the kids, and to give my kids a great school district.' But the boy's father, Jason Doohan, has attacked his ex-girlfriend, claiming she's not fit to be handling the money. 'My actual fear is that she is not going to use the money properly,' Doohan said. 'My son is the greatest kid Iâ€™ve ever known. Use (the money) the right way, on what Tyler would want it to be spent on.' The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, 43, . who is speaking for the fire's survivors agrees, and pointed out . Vrooman's previous substance abuse problems, which she claims are . 'years' behind her. Best friend: A tearful Crystal Vrooman, pictured, said her son, Tyler Doonhan, died trying to save his grandfather, who was his 'best friend' 'My . biggest concern is that the money is going to be mismanaged and the . people who went through the tragedy are going to be forgotten,' Breyette . told FoxNews.com. 'I would prefer someone court-appointed, not her, should have control of that money.' Vrooman . insists she hasn't touched any of the money yet and said she plans to hire an attorney to handle the account. She also wants to thank everyone . who donated for their support. 'I . will hire an attorney to do this right and have receipts to do . everything,' Vrooman said. 'I planned on having receipts to show . everyone what we used the money for and to send out thank you cards... to say thank you to these people.' News . of the disagreement came as Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer said revealed Thursday that . he was so impressed with the child's bravery that he is considering giving Tyler an honorary firefighter's . funeral to recognize his heroic actions. 'From . our standpoint as a fire department, this kid definitely played a role . in saving six individuals' lives, and he lost his life trying to save a . seventh and an eighth. It brings it into a different arena...This hero . deserves to be recognized for what he did,' Ebmeyer said. Smile: Vrooman recalled hugging her son, pictured, goodbye before the sleepover with his grandfather, and he had a big smile on his face . On Wednesday, a tearful Vrooman described being . 'really proud' of her son for what he did but said she just wanted him back. Tyler . and his grandfather, who Vrooman said was his 'best friend,' were found . together on a bed in the back room of the charred mobile home. Authorities said it appeared the child was trying to lift the elderly . man off the bed when he was overcome by smoke and flames. 'All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe, how scared he must have been, Vrooman told WHAM Wednesday. She added: 'I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone.' The boy, from East Rochester, was staying with relatives in nearby Penfield overnight on Sunday. Vrooman recalled hugging her son goodbye before the sleepover, and he had a big smile on his face. But . around 4.45 a.m. Monday, Tyler noticed a fire had broken out in the . narrow trailer when his 4-year-old cousin's blanket set alight. Vrooman . told the station that, after waking five of his relatives and ensuring . they got out safely, Tyler broke away from his aunt and ran back inside . the burning trailer. 'He just ran to the back steps and my sister followed him and tried to stop him,' said Vrooman. Deadly inferno: An electrical fire engulfed Louis Beach's single-wide mobile home in the town of Penfield as nine people slept inside Sunday night . Fearless: Officials say Tyler (left) roused five of his relatives, and then ran back into the burning trailer to rescue his grandfather, pictured . The boy's grandfather was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Ebmeyer said. 'By that time, the fire had traveled . to the back of the trailer,' said Ebmeyer. 'Unfortunately they both . succumbed to heat and smoke.' Vrooman said her sister initially had Tyler's hand when he stepped into the trailer. 'I . guess he let go of her and tried to get to my dad. She opened the . window and he wasn't there anymore. She started feeling around through . the smoke,' she said, crying. 'It was his best friend, and he just tried to save him.' Ebmeyer said the trailer had no working smoke detector. He said that with so many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to survive. There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, he said. Another relative was killed in the fire along with several pets - including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters, Ebmeyer said. Fatalities: The raging blaze killed Doohan, his grandfather and amputee uncle, who were unable to flee in time . Horrific find: Tyler's body was found in the rare of the scorched home, just feet away from the bedridden family member he was trying to rescue . Earlier Wednesday, Cpl. John . Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said nine people were in . the single-wide mobile home when the electrical fire started. The Democrat and Chronicle reported . that Tyler asked his mother if he could stay with his grandfather at 39 . Fondiller Avenue because he knew he was off from school Monday for . Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, said his young nephew heard his grandfather calling for help inside the house and rushed in to get him. 'The . kid has got more guts than I know of,' Breyette said. 'I mean to run . back in there and go through what he went through to try to save him, . what can you say for the kid? He was a great kid.' The . child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a . few feet away from the bed of his disabled grandfather. The boy's relatives who managed to flee from the trailer were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital. Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher. 'He saved those other people,' he said. Safe haven: Neighbors say Louis Beach was in the habit of letting relatives who didn't have a place to live stay in his home . Makeshift memorial: Tyler's friends and members of the community have been leaving teddy bears, flowers and other tokens in honor of the brave fourth-grader . Neighbors at the trailer park said the . reason the mobile home was overcrowded with people Sunday night was . because he often welcomed down-on-their-luck relatives who needed a . place to stay. Those . who knew the family described Tyler as a rambunctious boy who liked . playing kickball and tag with other children in the area. According to his education records, the child had been in and out of several different schools over the past few years. He was currently enrolled as a fourth-grader in the East Rochester Central School District, where officials called the boy a hero this week. 'He was the kind of young man who would bend over backwards for anybody. He was a very caring individual always came to school with a smile on his face. Always asking what can I do to help,' Interim Superintendent Richard Stutzman Jr told the station WHEC. Stutzman added: 'In bravely and selflessly giving his own life, he was able to save the lives of six others - and he truly is a hero.'","A friend and neighbor of Tyler Doohan's mother, Crystal Vrooman, from Upstate New York, initially hoped to raise $5,000 with the fundraiser but generous donors have given 10 times that .

Spy: 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on Britain's roads 26 million times every day . Police are recording 26million images of motorists every day – an increase of 61 per cent since 2012, it emerged yesterday. Senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks. But civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight. The images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the UK. In 2012, 16million images were recorded every day by cameras – many of them unmarked – which are positioned on motorways and A and B roads. Each time a vehicle passes, a camera takes a picture of the vehicle’s numberplate and another of the front of the car, including the driver’s face. The cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored  on a national database of 17 billion  images, used by police and intelligence services to track criminals. However, it  also contains the records of innocent motorists, showing a detailed map of their daily journeys. Police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras, saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system. It is thought that by 2018, between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day. The network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day. Pictures can be checked against the Police National Computer and used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in the battle against crime. The first cameras were installed in Britain on the M1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles. By 2005, the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000. As well as fixed cameras, police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in London alone. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public's knowledge. 'ANPR is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate. Tracked: The Government archive of 17 billion images works out as nearly 500 pictures of every one of the 36 million cars on Britain's roads . 'The public hasn't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded, how long it is kept or who is able to access it. 'When you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked, down to the second, and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where, it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system. 'How many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys? Yet this is exactly what ANPR technology allows. Secret camera: More Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras are expected to be rolled out over the next five years . 'It is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion of ANPR systems is legal.' Julian Blazeby, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Given the nature of ANPR it is understandable that some will be concerned about how this data is used. 'ANPR has only ever been for the prevention and detection of crime as well as locating vulnerable people with the intent of preserving life. 'It has saved lives, brought serious, violent offenders to justice and is used in the detection of would-be terrorists. It’s not about tracking every vehicle’s journey – which is an exaggeration of ANPR’s capabilities. 'Currently we have an average of 7,750 active cameras within any seven day period and an average daily read of 26 million. 'However an increase to 50 or 75 million is not anticipated at this time and there are no current plans for a mass roll out of ANPR cameras. 'The database consists of approximately 17 billion records. This data is owned by the chief officers of law enforcement agencies who act as data controllers.' Police forces want to share the information harvested by the cameras with countries across Europe. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'ANPR is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate. 'We have created a new, independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this. 'These cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect, deter, and disrupt criminality. Any new ANPR camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment.'","A network of 8,000 cameras photograph cars on Britain's roads every day .

Before her granddaughter Maggie was born, Karen Bowersox knew little about Down syndrome and even less about fashion design. But as she watched Maggie grow, the Ohio grandmother was inspired to create a range of clothing that fitted the shape and needs of those who had the condition. After finding a designer to help with her idea, Ms Bowersox launched Downs Designs, a stylish range of clothing, which can be altered to meet each client's needs. Muse: Karen Bowersox with her granddaughter Maggie, who inspired the clothing range . Ms Bowersox said she came up with the idea for the clothing range when Maggie was four, and her family were finding it hard to find clothes that fitted her. 'People with Down syndrome typically . have a short thigh bone and upper arm bone which makes sleeves and pants . too long and pants and shirts sleeves donâ€™t break properly where they . bend,' she told Daily Dot. 'With low muscle tone, they often develop . larger tummies and may gain weight due to thyroid problems. Clothes off . the rack generally donâ€™t fit well at all.' In 2010, Ms Bowersox got in touch with a young designer and the pair set about creating a fashionable range that would fit the shape of someone with Down syndrome. One of the lines they focused on first was a range of jeans. While they are a wardrobe basic for many people, those with Down syndrome often find buttons and zips difficult. Made to measure: Cute Griffin models a pair of Downs Designs jeans . Perfect fit: Karen's clothing range is designed around the shape of those with Down syndrome . 'Having . a stylish pair of jeans that is comfortable, fits properly and allows . independent dressing gives the wearer a sense of self worth. All that in a pair of jeans is so inspiring to me,' Ms Bowersox said. All smiles: Maggie helps her grandmother by modeling the clothes . Her clothing line - Downs Designs - offers jeans, capri pants and shirts, but one of its biggest draws is the tailoring service that is offered. Customers can apply for a Try On service that lets them find the perfect fit. Ms Bowersox then takes note of the adjustments and sends them a personally tailored outfit. 'People have been so grateful that . someone has taken on this task that that is what has kept me going . during my most difficult times,' she said. A quick glance through her website's testimonials page shows just how life-changing Downs Designs has been for her customers. Tim, a young German with Down syndrome, was featured on the company's Facebook page showing off his new outfit of made-to-measure jeans and a long sleeved shirt. His parents had used Skype to communicate with the design company to get the best fit.

'Good and loving': Alcoholic Ann Lupton beat her senile mother to death at her home in Preston . An alcoholic who beat her senile mother to death could be free in just two months after a judge said she deserved 'mercy'. Marie Hothersall, 83, died in hospital two months after her 54-year-old daughter Ann Lupton launched a savage drunken attack at her home in Preston, Lancashire on July 23 last year. But after the mother-of-six pleased guilty to manslaughter, Judge Alistair Macduff said he was able 'to show mercy, some might say leniency' to a woman he described as 'good and loving', and remanded her in custody for six months, of which she may only have to serve eight weeks. Lupton, who previously admitted drinking a bottle of wine or half a bottle of spirits every day for almost 12 years, inflicted a catalogue of injuries on her mother 'consistent with forceful slapping, punching, kicking or stamping'. Mrs Hothersall was found on the floor of her home by a support worker the morning after the attack suffering from two black eyes, a fractured hip, a large lump on her head, and swollen hands which had turned black from bruises. She died in hospital two months later. But despite her crime, Lupton’s father told the court the death may have been a 'blessing' before the judge passed a sentence he described as 'merciful'. Jailing Lupton at Liverpool Crown Court today, Mr Justice Macduff said: 'Forgiveness and compassion are wonderful human qualities and are even more to be commended in a society which appears to many people to value retributive instincts even more highly.' 'I can tell you that I am going to pass a merciful sentence so that your release back into the community and into the care of your wonderful family will not be too far into the future,' he said. 'I need to explain why, although I cannot release you immediately, I am able to show you the mercy, some may say leniency, which I believe you deserve. Over the years you had a good and loving relationship with your mother,' he added. The court earlier heard how Lupton became . ‘agitated and aggressive’ when drunk, and she initially told police her mother had . injured herself falling out of bed. Just . minutes after neighbours reported hearing screams and banging, she . messaged her husband saying: 'Mum is a nightmare! Lol xx' The jury at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) heard how Lupton became 'agitated and aggressive' when drunk, and that she initially told police her mother had injured herself falling out of bed . When her husband phoned her at around 8pm, Lupton said her mother was still being 'stubborn and hard work'. At . about 10pm neighbours heard more thumping and banging that sounded like . 'someone being knocked against the wall', the court heard. Mr Reid added: 'At about 1.10am he heard loud banging, thumping and shouting coming from the victim’s bedroom... He described it as 'so loud it sounded like it was coming through the walls'.' The sentence comes less than a fortnight after Mr Justice Macduff sentenced Emma Parr to ten months in prison for killing her mother Carol in an almost identical attack. Parr, 38, who was suffering depression at the time, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Carol, 62, and was shown sympathy by the judge for being a ‘loving and caring person’. Sentencing Lupton, Mr Justice Macduff said: 'Unhappily, as you well know, there were two very sad features of your relationship in recent times... You had sunk into deep alcoholism and your mother, by now aged 83 years, developed severe dementia. This made her difficult and unreasonable.' 'Your drink and her dementia coincided with tragic consequences on the night of July 23 last year... What is clear is that you inflicted a dreadful beating on your mother, as a combination of two things - your alcoholic state and your mother’s behaviour which frustrated and provoked you into anger.' He added: I accept that it is your alcoholism which has been directly responsible for your actions on that evening. That does not excuse but does explain... Like your wider family, I have a great deal of sympathy for you. You will suffer a life sentence whatever I do today.' He went on to say: 'I know that you will have to live with your dreadful actions for the rest of your life. To that extent, you are already being punished.' Lupton wept in the docks as the judge passed sentence, before had wished her ‘good luck’. Mr . Justice Macduff added: 'I am entirely satisfied that what you did on . take dreadful was the product of your illness and that through it all . you continued to love your mother and she you...Thus I can apply clemency and mercy when sentencing you.'","Ann Lupton, 54, beat mother to death at home in Preston, Lancashire .

The NYPD believe just four men may have been behind the attack on a Kenyan mall that killed more than 60 civilians in September and they all probably escaped alive. The report, released on Tuesday, contradicts many of the claims made by Kenyan authorities, who had previously said that as many as 15 attackers were involved, including possible foreign nationals, and that they held hostages. More than 60 civilians and six soldiers died in the Sept. 21 assault by terrorists from Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab terror group on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. The victims aged eight to 78, from 13 different countries. The NYPD believe just four men may have been behind the attack on a Kenyan mall that killed more than 60 civilians in September and they all probably escaped alive . On Tuesday morning, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that while investigators didn’t know ‘with certainty’ how many people were involved, ‘we believe there were only four shooters.’ The New York police report said the last confirmed sighting of the attackers on the mall's CCTV system was on September 22 at 00:54 hours, 12 hours after the start of the attack. It took the Kenyan military almost four days to declare the mall safe. The day before doing so, Kenyan forces started a fire and collapsed a large part of the mall, the report said. ‘It is unknown if the terrorists were killed or escaped the mall. A major contributing factor to this uncertainty was the failure to maintain a secure perimeter around the mall,’ it said. Chilling: . Surveillance footage has emerged of the moment a gunman shot down a . shopper in the Kenyan mall attack in September - the same shop appears to . have been looted by soldiers hours later . On Tuesday morning, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that he believes there were only four shooters who attacked the mall . According to the NYPD, the attackers carried only light weapons, there was no evidence that they had taken hostages and it was apparent that the Kenyan military had actually looted the high-end shopping complex. The report also discredited the theory that the female British jihadi known as the White Widow was at the mall. The NYPD sent several detectives to Nairobi with the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force to investigate the assault. Their findings were assembled into the report by Lt. Detective Commander Kevin Yorke. He questioned the Kenyan authorities’ theory that four of the attackers died when explosions collapsed parts of the mall. Fear: Men, women and children run for their lives as the terrorists target the shop . t took Kenyan forces almost four days to declare the mall safe and the day before doing so they started a fire and collapsed a large part of the mall . ‘As a cop, I’m very skeptical of claims until I see proof,’ said Yorke, and added that there is ‘a lot of doubt in my mind it is true.’ Most of the victims were probably killed in the first hour of the attack when the gunmen engaged in ‘wholesale killing’ of those trying to hide in places like storerooms, the report said. According to witnesses and CCTV footage, the gunmen did not want to take hostages, only kill a broad spectrum of people. The New York report also highlighted poor coordination between the Kenyan police and the army, which saw troops kill one police officer and wound the commander of a police team. The report also describes a ‘conscious but erratic attempt’ at avoiding Muslim casualties. Looters: Footage shows Kenyan soldiers walking through the devastated mall carrying bags containing the goods they stole . At least one attacker asked some of the victims if they were Muslim, if they answered yes they were asked the name of the Prophet Mohammed's mother. If they didn't know, they were shot. The four attackers are understood to have trained in Somalia. Interpol is assisting Kenya in trying to identify four bodies suspected of being those of the gunmen. No identification has yet been announced.","NYPD sent several detectives to Nairobi with the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force to investigate September's assault .

Radical hate-preacher Abu Qatada has refused to answer questions during his terrorism trial in Jordan as he claims the court setup 'violates' the deportation deal with Britain. Qatada, who was deported earlier his year, is charged with plotting terror attacks against several Western nations in two foiled attempts in 1999 and 2000. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison in absentia for the crimes, but upon his deportation in July, the sentences had to be re-tried. Abu Qatada, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, has been described in British court as a senior Al Qaeda figure in Europe with close ties to the late Osama bin Laden. Britain accused him of links with Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the United States over 9/11, and 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid. Audio recordings of Qatada's sermons were found in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, used by some of the 9/11 hijackers. On his arrival in Amman on July 7, Jordanian prosecutors charged him with conspiring to carry out terror attacks in Jordan twice. The first attacks was planned in 1999 against the American school in the Jordanian capital, and another time in 2000 for allegedly targeting Israeli and American tourists and Western diplomats during Jordan's Millennium celebrations. On Tuesday, the tribunal - consisting of two civilian judges and a military one - said the cases will be heard separately, and proceeded with the hearing in the case involving Israeli and American tourists. However, Abu Qatada objected to the presence of the military judge and said it violated the agreement with Britain that paved way for his extradition to Jordan. In attendance: Abu Qatada's sons Qarada, right, and Zaid, left, are seen outside the State Security Court ahead of their father's trial in Amman . Arriving: A special police force convoy carrying Abu Qatada arrives at the State Security Court where he later refused to recognise the tribunal . Wearing a dark brown prison uniform, . Abu Qatada appeared defiant as he stood in the dock, pleading not . guilty. Later, he asked for a microphone and addressed the tribunal. ‘I . will not answer questions by this court because I do not recognize its . jurisdiction,’ he said. ‘This tribunal includes a military judge and . this is a violation of the deal with Britain that encouraged me to . return home for re-trial.’ The . presiding judge halted the hearing for 30 minutes after Qatada's . protests, before continuing and although the court had planned to hear . the other case, proceedings were adjourned until Christmas Eve. Before . his deportation, Abu Qatada questioned the impartiality of Jordan's . military court, an issue which had previously delayed his return to . Jordan for years. The radical Islamist cleric has already been sentenced to life in prison in absentia for planning the two foiled terrorist attacks, however upon his return to Jordan, a re-trial was ordered . Not until after Jordan and Britain ratified their treaty on torture in June, did the radical preacher voluntarily accepted to return to Jordan for a re-trial. Abu Qatada arrived in Britain on a forged passport in 1993 after fleeing a Jordanian government crackdown on militants. He was granted asylum a year later, but he eventually wore out his welcome because of his suspected militant activities, which allegedly included raising funds to finance terror plots in Jordan. British authorities first tried to deport Abu Qatada in 2001, then detained him a year later under anti-terrorism laws, which at the time allowed suspected terrorists to be jailed without charge. He was released in 2005 when the unpopular law was overturned, and kept under close surveillance and detained in various ways, until his extradition to Jordan in July this year.","Radical hate-preacher Abu Qatada on trial after deportation to Jordan .

David Cameron’s attempt to enshrine his promise of an EU referendum in law is a 'dead parrot', MPs warned tonight. Labour and Lib Dem peers in the House of Lords united to defeat the Tories in key votes today, plunging the legislation into a parliamentary quagmire. It means it stands little chance of becoming law before the 2015 election, leaving Eurosceptics to liken it to the dead parrot in the infamous Monty Python sketch in which a pet shop owner repeatedly pretended there was still life in it. Blow: David Cameron, who used a speech at the World Economic Forum today to attack the EU, wants an in-out referendum by 2017 . Mr Cameron today launched a fresh attack on Brussels, claiming . Eurocrats fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they . are ‘not doing their job’. He said British workers risk becoming . ‘unemployable’ because EU red tape means foreign firms will take their . business elsewhere. He . urged global firms to bring jobs back to Britain, but warned that . ‘complex and overwritten directives’ impose such heavy burdens on . business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside . the EU. Mr Cameron promised that if he is Prime Minister after the next election he would claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2015. Tory peer Lord Dobbs said the legislation was suffering 'death by a thousand cuts' However, he could not bring forward government legislation on the idea because Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems would not back it. Instead, Tory MP James Wharton took it through the Commons but it has floundered in the Lords. Today peers voted by 245 votes to 158, majority 87, to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum in 2017. It means the European Union (Referendum) Bill will have to go back to the Commons for further consideration - eating up more of the little remaining parliamentary time for its consideration. Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘As I understand it from the House of Lords, the European Union Referendum Bill is now, in effect, a dead parrot.’ Lord Hill, Conservative leader in the Lords, added: ‘Labour and the Liberal Democrats have today done yet another U-turn on their position on an In-Out referendum on the European Union. ‘Having accepted this Bill in the House of Commons, they are now trying to kill it in the Lords. Having stayed mum in the Commons, they have now been revealed in their true colours. ‘Although they daren’t admit they do not think the British people should have their say, they are trying to do their dirty work unnoticed in the Lords. ‘Voters will see through this subterfuge and realise that only the Conservatives will give them their say on whether they should remain in the European Union.’ The Bill has already passed its Commons stages. Peers were under pressure to pass it speedily and without amendment to ensure it could proceed before the end of the Parliamentary session. But peers voted to amend it after more than two and a half hours of impassioned and sometimes angry debate in the Upper House. Tory Lord Dobbs, who is trying to steer the Bill through the Lords, warned it risked suffering  ‘death by a thousand cuts’. He said: ‘We know some of the opponents of the Bill are determined to use any means to kill it. ‘We cannot deny the presence of an elephant in the room and a very large and unreasonable elephant - those who have no intention whatsoever of working to improve this Bill but who are solely intent on trying to kill it. ‘If this Bill is to survive and we are to give the people the referendum they want, we have to get this Bill through this House in reasonable shape and very short time.’","Lords torpedo legislation to ensure referendum is held by 2017 .

Surveillance footage captured them locking up a house in California without seeing the bear was right next to them . Bearly there: The couple were locking up the front door of the house where they were staying. The bear eyed them up but they barely noticed! On the hunt: The elderly couple head to the car and the curious creature follows them . Neighbors say the baby brown bear has been wondering around the neighborhood which is located in the foothills near the Angeles National Forest, since Tuesday. The video shows the bear slowly approaching the entrance, only to stop as the couple walks out of the house. The bear then follows the pair as they walk to their car. It was then they realized they were not alone. After helping Irene into the vehicle, Bob felt something on his leg. 'I closed the door and I looked…. a . bear!' Bob McKeown said. 'You don’t know how scared you are, you just . see a bear. I’ve never encountered a bear.' he added. With his wife safely inside the vehicle, Bob McKeown ran for the stairs to let himself back into the house. Scratched: Just as Bob was getting back into the house, he felt a nick on his leg. He had to go to hospital to have a tetanus shot soon afterwards . But he did not escape unscathed, the bear had clawed at his right calf. 'It comes around trash day. It gets hungry, so it just comes out. But it's very friendly. It's not aggressive at all,' said Pasadena resident Marina Tucker. Animal control officers and Pasadena police, armed with shotguns, were on the scene monitoring the bear as it meandered. 'He might be just knocking, looking around for some garbage cans, looking for something to eat and then once he couldn't find something, or he found something, he'll work his way back to an area where he feels safe, which is suitable habitat,' said J.C. Healy with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Bearing-all: Thankfully the couple were unharmed by the bears antics and  were able to have a good chuckle about it all afterwards . On the loose: The bear has been roaming the streets in Pasedena, California for a few days now . We've got you: The bear was spotted in residential backyards in Pasadena on Thursday afternoon, prompting a response from police, wildlife officials, local residents and news media . Pasadena police say residents should be aware that the bear could still be out in the neighborhood. They will be back later today to patrol the streets and watch for the animal. California's black bear population is at about 25,000 to 30,000, with most living in mountain areas above 3,000 feet, according to what the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife calls conservative estimates. In 1982, the statewide bear population was estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000. Less than 10 percent of the state's black bear population lives in the central western and southwestern California region, according to agency estimates. About half of the population resides in an area north and west of the Sierra Nevada. The Department of Fish and Wildlife has recorded 12 'bear attacks' since 1980. An attack is defined as 'physical contact, injury or death.' The last reported attack in Los Angeles County occurred in July 2003 when a hiker was knocked down by a bear at a campsite on Pacific Crest Trail in Angeles National Forest. Bear TV: Residents watched the bear as some four television news helicopters hovered overhead. It appears the baby bear comes out on trash day when he can have a good rummage through the trash cans .

British workers risk becoming ‘unemployable’ because EU red tape means foreign firms will take their business elsewhere, David Cameron warned today. The Prime Minister launched a sustained attack on Brussels, claiming Eurocrats fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they are ‘not doing their job’. He urged global firms to bring jobs back to Britain, but warned that ‘complex and overwritten directives’ impose such heavy burdens on business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside the EU. Warning: David Cameron launched a push to attract more customers to bring jobs back to Britain but warned they would be deterred by excessive EU regulations . Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Cameron launched a drive to reverse the trend of ‘offshoring’, which has seen thousands of British jobs shifted to low-cost countries in the East over recent years. He argued that cheap energy from shale gas and less red tape could be key to attracting firms to move posts back to the UK. He said it was wrong to write-off western countries told they cannot compete with cheap labour overseas, but warned the European Union it will prevent jobs returning to the continent if it imposed excessive and unnecessary rules. Progress had been made in curbing the impact of Brussels but ‘the fight is not yet won’, Mr Cameron said. He added: ‘There are still people who think that the key to success is ever greater social protections and more regulations. ‘Some in the European Commission seem to think that if they’re not producing new regulations they’re somehow not doing their job and that removing existing regulations is somehow an act of self-harm, while many in the European Parliament are tempted to gold plate every piece of legislation. ‘Let’s be clear. We don’t protect workers by piling on the regulations and directives to such an extent that they become unemployable. ‘We have to maintain the flexibility for companies to grow and expand. ‘Incredibly complex and overwritten directives that take this flexibility away, that make life difficult for temporary workers, or that stop firms moving people between plants just mean that companies who want to re-shore will re-shore somewhere else.’ The Prime Minister yesterday visited the headquarters of ventilation manufacturer, Vent-Axia in Crawley, East Sussex which has recently created 26 new jobs by moving production back to the UK from China . He also issued a warning to Brussels not to stand in the way of Britain exploiting its reserves of shale gas through the controversial practice of fracking. The Premier said the prospect of developing ‘cheap and predictable’ energy sources could help to attract back to the Europe jobs which had been ‘off-shored’ to the rising economic powers of Asia. But he warned that the opportunities presented by shale gas - which had helped transform the US economy - could be undermined if the European Union sought to impose unnecessary new regulations. ‘To relocate in Europe, businesses will be encouraged by cheap and predictable sources of energy,’ he said. ‘We should be clear that if the European Union or its member states impose burdensome, unjustified or premature regulatory burdens on shale gas exploration in Europe investors will quickly head elsewhere. ‘Oil and gas will still be plentifully produced, but Europe will be dry.’ Mr Cameron also warned that Britain could miss out on the benefits of fracking if European legislation failed to keep pace with the rest of the world . According to Government figures, some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the UK since 2011. Today ministers launched a new service called Reshore UK to help firms which want to do the same. Mr Cameron admitted that companies will still move production facilities to countries like India and China but he insisted that the West should not be ‘written off’. Citing recent research which found that one in 10 small and medium-sized businesses have brought production back to the UK over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will said that reshoring could become ‘a fresh driver of growth in Europe’ and Britain should take advantage of the trend. He added: ‘For years the West has been written off. People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more. ‘Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way.’","Prime Minister says Eurocrats think producing more rules is 'their job'

A three-year-old boy with epilepsy has been free of seizures for six months after surgeons ‘disconnected’ half of his brain. Ernie Djedje, from Sheffield, had up to 100 devastating seizures a day before the pioneering surgery. Each severe seizure caused him to forget all of the skills he had learnt meaning his parents, Kelly and Franck, had to keep teaching him to sit up and crawl over and over again. Ernie Djedje (right) has a severe form of childhood epilepsy called West Syndrome and had up to 100 fits a day. He is pictured with his brother, Alfie, and parents Franck and Kelly . Mrs Djedje said: ‘Ernie’s has not had one seizure since his operation in June 2013 and it has transformed his life. ‘There is a huge difference in Ernie, it’s like having a different child as his development was affected but he’s now learning new things all the time. ‘Before the operation he had the abilities of a three-month-old, but since then he’s been making improvements all the time. ‘He is more like a nine-month-old now, and wants to stand and try and walk, which wasn’t possible before. He will always need additional support because of his health issues, but it is fantastic that Ernie is no longer having seizures.’ Ernie was diagnosed with West Syndrome – a severe form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children – when he was just six weeks old. His parents took him to hospital because they noticed his face was twitching and were given the shocking diagnosis. Ernie's fits could not be controlled with medication so doctors operated to disconnect the two hemispheres of his brain in a bid to stop his seizures. He has not had a fit since the operation took place in August 2013 . Mrs Djedje told MailOnline: ‘I had never heard of West Syndrome. I was very upset when I was told but I knew I had to get on with it.’ West Syndrome causes seizures that tend to make the baby either bow forwards or lean backwards. It occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children. In 90 per cent of sufferers, the spasms first occur before they are one. West Syndrome is a form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children. It causes seizures in which the child appears to either bow forward or lean backwards. It occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children. 90 per cent of those affected develop symptoms within their first year of life. The condition is usually treated with drugs initially and if this is not successfully, the child may require surgery. Most children with the condition go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most also have learning difficulties. The long-term prognosis for children with West Syndrome depends mainly on the cause and the severity of the syndrome. Source: epilepsy.org.uk . Babies who have these spasms often have slow development and their development can even go backwards. Some patients respond well to treatment while others continue to have spasms despite drug treatment. Most West Syndrome sufferers tend to go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most have learning difficulties. Ernie’s epilepsy was completely out of control despite a strict drug regime. This meant he had as many as 100 seizures a day which each lasted from between 30 seconds and six minutes. These seizures affected his development and meant he needed constant supervision. Every time he learnt to do something – like to sit up – he would have a severe seizure and the skill would be wiped out. His parents were also having to call an ambulance frequently when they were unable to stop him fitting. Mrs Djedje, 34, said: ‘Before Ernie had the surgery he was on medication but his condition became so severe he was having up to 100 seizures a day. ‘It affected Ernie’s development, so he’d learn things, and then lose the ability. He became so ill that an operation was needed to stop the seizures.’ When Ernie was two, his doctors at . The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, suggested that he have an operation . to ‘disconnect’ the two hemisphere of his brain in the hope this would . stop his seizures. Mrs Djedje said: ‘When I was told about the operation I was shocked because you don’t think about having your brain separated. ‘But, I just wanted to stop the seizures.’ Every time Ernie had a severe fit he forgot all of the skills he had learnt meaning his parents had to teach him basic skills over and over again. He is pictured shortly after his operation . In a desperate bid to help their son, Mr and Mrs Djedje agreed to allow him to have the eight hour procedure which was carried out in August at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. During the operation – which is called a hemispherectomy - surgeons made a large cut above Ernie’s ear, and through his skull, to allow them access to his brain. They then disconnected the outer layer of one half of the brain - the half that was causing the seizures – from the other half. They carried out a procedure called a hemispherectomy. This involved disconnecting the outer layer of one half of his brain - the half that was causing the seizures - from the other half. In doing so, they disconnected the communication between the two hemispheres preventing the spread of electrical seizures from one side of the brain to the other.

Mrs Djedje told MailOnline: 'I am so grateful to the surgeons - they have changed his life and they have changed our lives. They are absolutely fantastic. We will be happy if he stays seizure free and if he stays happy' Mrs Djedje said: ‘When he was ill he couldn’t sleep because of the seizures and so neither could we. So Ernie being well rested makes a difference to us all. ‘We’re also able to go out more as a family, because when Ernie was ill we couldn’t go out if he was having a bad day.’ Ernie is now able to retain what he has learnt and, while he can’t talk or feed himself, he is having physiotherapy to try and help him stand.

A growing trend in shops using fatter child mannequins has been described by a leading children’s charity as ‘desperately sad’. Fifty per cent of the British population is predicted to be obese by 2050 and the UK has the highest child obesity rate in Western Europe. In a sign of the deepening crisis, one mannequin manufacturer has seen a 300% surge in requests from shops for plus-size child models. Fat's shocking: Stores are increasingly demanding bigger mannequins . The dummies used to display clothing for seven to eight-year-olds have a standard size of 4ft in height, with a 26in chest and 22in waist. However, many shops are requesting plus-size mannequins 20 per cent bigger, according to The Daily Mirror. Vicky Chatten, communications executive at mannequin manufacturer Displaysense, said: ‘We’ve had a 300% increase in calls from retailers looking for much larger child mannequins, ranging from as young as four years old up to 10-year-olds. It is quite shocking and a trend that is one the increase.’ Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, told the paper that the situation was ‘desperately sad’ but added that the country needs to face up to the fact that there is now an epidemic of fat children.

The news follows controversy stirred up by clothing store American Apparel, which last week decked out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. The storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York features three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines and stopping window shoppers dead in their tracks. But while some Twitter users have labeled the exhibition 'kinda pervy', the retailer has defended it by saying it is intended to start a conversation about society's concept of feminine beauty.","Fifty per cent of the British population is predicted to be obese by 2050 .

A mentally ill British man has been sentenced to death in Pakistan after writing letters claiming he is the Prophet Mohammad, his lawyers said today. Muhammad Asghar from Edinburgh was found guilty of blasphemy, a crime punishable by death, in the city of Rawalpindi, neighbouring the capital Islamabad. Despite his history of mental illness, the 68-year-old's lawyers were barred from the courtroom partway through the trial, the firm said on Friday. Sentenced: Muhammad Asghar, 68, from Edinburgh, has been found guilty of blasphemy, and has been sentenced to death in Rawalpindi, Pakistan (pictured) Accusations of blasphemy are surging in Pakistan, according to an Islamabad-based think-tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies. Many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs. The charges are hard to fight because the law does not define what is blasphemous and presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. The firm said it was not present during the trial because the judge had prevented it from representing Asghar in court since October. He was arrested in 2010 after writing letters to a lawyer and politician claiming to be a prophet. Though Asghar did not post the letters, a disgruntled tenant whom he was in the process of evicting took them to police, the law firm said. 'Blasphemy': Despite his history of mental illness, the 68-year-old Briton's lawyers were barred from the courtroom partway through the trial in the city, (pictured) which neighbours the Pakistani capital . Asghar has previously been detained under the mental health act in Britain and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, it added. After the removal of the law firm, Asghar was appointed a state counsel, who did not put his medical history in evidence or call witnesses in his defense, and did not question a state-appointed board that declared him sane, the firm said. The state counsel could not immediately be reached for comment. The law firm asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by extremists. Lawyers defending those accused of blasphemy frequently receive death threats and politicians supporting reform of the law have been killed. A British doctor, 72-year-old Masood Ahmad, is also in prison in Pakistan, charged with blasphemy after a mullah used a mobile telephone to covertly record a conversation with him in his dispensary.","Muhammad Asghar, 68, has been sentenced to death in Rawalpindi .

An opulent mansion financed by one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution has been put on the market for a cut price £4million. Dunstall Hall in Burton on Trent, Staffordshire, boasts 12 bedrooms, its own lake, orangery, ball room, a labyrinth of cellars and even has its own cricket pitch. The Grade Two Listed property was paid for by the profits of Sir Richard Arkwright, one of the leading entrepreneurs of the 18th century and credited with transforming Britain's fortunes. Up for sale: The grand Dunstall Hall in Staffordshire is on the market for a cut price £4million and was financed by one of the founding fathers of the Industrial Revolution in Britain . Added extras: Set in 85 acres with magnificent gardens, the mansion also has a beautiful cricket pitch in its Staffordshire grounds . Icing on the cake: The magnificent orangery at the hall, which has had its priced slashed by £1million because of a lack of interest . Stunning: Set in the rolling hills of Staffordshire the impressive property has it all either for a rich landowner or for a developer looking to open a new hotel or wedding venue . He invented the spinning frame, which made it easy to spin thread from wool or yarn, and later opened the world's first water-powered cotton mill in 1771, an act that made him a pioneer of British engineering. A self-made man who was taught to read and write by his cousin, Mr Arkwright accumulated huge wealth and his son, Richard Jr, used it to finance this vast property. The grand mansion was put on the market for £5million last May but estate agents Strutt and Parker have been forced to slash £1million after failing to get enough interest. Agent Luke Morgan said: 'The thing about the house is there are two types of end users - someone who has made a few quid and wants a good-sized house, or the commercial buyer, who thinks they can create a swanky hotel or a wedding venue. 'It's appealing to quite a lot of people. 'It is worth more than that, but what we get for it depends on who is out there.' Through the gates: The house is one of Britain's most splendid yet estate agents have admitted that they have struggled to find a buyer willing to pay £5million for it . Dynasty: Richard Arkwright accumulated huge wealth and his son, Richard Jr, used it to finance this vast property which he then passed on to his child in the 19th century . History: The Grade II listed property is built on land occupied since 1145 where it is believed the Earl of Derby built a grand hunting lodge in a royal forest . Special entrance: Even the main door of Dunstall Hall is grand, and is hand-carved with images of its vast grounds showing its animals and animals hunting on horseback . Tapestry of colour: The mansion has a mosaic in its main hallway and also has a number of grand painted ceilings covered in precious gold leaf . Grandeur: The building contains lavis decorations like stained-glass windows and this hand carved sweeping staircase at its heart . The estate, which sits in 85.7 acres of rolling countryside, dates back to 1145 when the manor was owned by the Earl of Derby. The main building, which still exists today, was built by Sir Richard Jr in 1814 who passed it onto his son Charles who lived there until he died in 1850. It was sold to the High Sheriff of Staffordshire John Hardy who carried out extensive alterations and improvements to the property including the new entrance with portico. In 1953 civil engineer Sir Richard Douglas purchased the property until he died in 1997 when it passed to race course owner Sir Stanley Clarke. Sir Stanley converted the property into a hotel and wedding venue until he put it on the market last May. The cricket pitch, which is included in the particulars, is known as Deer Park and is the home of Dunstall Cricket Club who play in the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League. Special: Cromford Mills in the Derwent Valley, Derbyshire, was built by Sir Richard Arkwright at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and changed his and Britain's fortunes . Sir Richard Arkright, right, was one of the founding fathers of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Born in 1732 and the youngest of 13, his tailor father could not afford to send him to school so he was educated by his cousin. But from those humble beginnings sprung a genius who created a number of life-changing inventions culminating in the truly revolutionary water-propelled spinning frame, which led . to the mass production of cotton thread. Sir Richard started work as a trainee barber and wig maker in Bolton, where he later invented and patented waterproof dye. This cash was used to finance prototypes that would later spin thread so successfully. In doing so this former Lancashire barber unleashed the Industrial Revolution on the world. Arkwright's engineering invention is credited along with James Hargreaves's Spinning Jenny with transforming the British economy. Having created the world's first water-powered cotton mill he  died in 1792,  and his son, Richard Jr, would then carry on his dynasty and make even more money. As well as maintaining the family's network of factories he also invested cash in property and government bonds, saving himself from financial ruin in the recession following the Napeolonic Wars. He also helped finance canals and railways and at his death he was worth an astonishing £3milllion in 1829. This comfortably made him the richest non-Royal in Britain and he used his money to build Dunstall Hall for his son Charles.","Dunstall Hall in Staffordshire was built with the vast fortune of entrepreneur Sir Richard Arkwright .

"By . Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 05:24 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 24 January 2014 . Mark Carney yesterday said he would not raise interest rates for some time, even as Britain’s economy records the strongest growth in the developed world. The Bank of England’s Governor confirmed that borrowing costs will not rise when unemployment falls below 7 per cent – a threshold the Bank set for considering an increase less than six months ago. Mr Carney also said that any eventual increases ‘would be gradual’ and lead to rates ‘somewhat lower than before the crisis’, when they averaged about 5 per cent. Bank of England governor Mark Carney reassured mortgage-holders that there is no immediate need to increase interest rates . The comments, to British executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were welcomed by the audience. One business leader said borrowing costs ‘should remain low to help sustain the recovery’. George Osborne said merely discussing the possibility of higher interest rates was ‘a mark of success’ for the economy, as it shows ‘we have started to see the recovery take off’ – but added that ‘there is not a need for an immediate rise’. The Chancellor, who was also in Davos, would prefer that interest rates do not rise until after next May’s general election. However, with the economy powering ahead, the jobless rate falling and concern growing about a credit boom, the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee could feel the need to act before then. The Bank’s base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but the economic revival has fuelled speculation that the MPC could soon raise it for the first time in nearly seven years. Experts have warned that the move, which would hammer millions of families with mortgages, could snuff out the UK recovery. In August, with unemployment at 7.8 per cent, the Bank said it would not consider raising rates until the jobless figure fell to 7 per cent – something it did not expect to happen until late 2016. The unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1%, putting it within a whisker of the 7% target set by the Bank of England when it could consider putting up interest rates . The policy – known as forward guidance . – is now set for the scrapheap after data this week showed unemployment . has fallen to 7.1 per cent. Mr Carney said the MPC will ‘evolve’ and . ‘update’ its forward guidance next month. The . Bank has several options. It could ditch the link between joblessness . and interest rates altogether; lower the threshold to 6.5 or 6 per cent; . or incorporate other indicators such as wage growth. Chancellor George Osborne has previously warned about the dangers of an interest rate rise . The Governor said that although the UK, along with the US, is ‘leading the pack’ in terms of economic growth in the developed world, there are nearly 750,000 more Britons out of work than before the financial crisis struck, and another 750,000 part-time workers who want a full-time job. ‘Many of the headwinds holding back the economy will remain for some time yet,’ the Canadian said. ‘A few quarters of growth driven by household spending represent a good start, but they aren’t sufficient.’ The Chancellor agreed: ‘The job is not done. It is not even half done.’ He said the next step would be for business investments and exports to become ‘key components’ of the recovery. Mr Carney stressed in his speech: ‘Even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of [interest rates] ... It is widely recognised that our 7 per cent threshold is not a trigger.’ David Cameron, who was also in Davos, defended Mr Carney. ‘To be fair, he always said that this was a threshold, not a trigger,’ he told Bloomberg television, adding that the Governor’s latest comments are ‘consistent with that’. John Cridland, the head of the Confederation of British Industry and a member of Mr Carney’s audience yesterday, said: ‘Business will welcome the Governor’s comments on interest rates. Interest rates should remain low to help sustain the recovery.’ However, former Bank of England economist Rob Wood said there was a 30 per cent chance of a rate increase by the end of the year, claiming such a move would be necessary ‘in late 2014’.","As economic recovery builds, unemployment has fallen to just 7.1% .

The court sketch artist told MailOnline that Moore did not seem nervous as he faced charges that carry jail time. The other man indicted is 25-year-old Charles 'Gary' Evans. Both he and Moore have been charged with multiple counts of conspiracy access a protected computer without authorization to obtain information for private financial gain. Sketches show the so-called Revenge Porn King and creator of areyouup.com Hunter Moore, who was in federal court on Thursday to be charged with conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, and unauthorized access to a computer . From the artist: . I'm assuming that is Hunter's parents because the attorney was talking to them before court started, and his attorney also mentioned in court that he had been staying with his parents in Woodland (A little town about 20 minutes north west of Sacramento ) and that they were there supporting him in court. Hunter did not seem nervous. And the reason his hand is up near his face, is to show that it was covered in tattoos. Another person that was in the court room said that the part of his neck I could not see, was covered in tattoos also. His parents figured out that I was trying to sketch them before the hearing started, and the mother tried to turn her face away f . Hated: Hunter Moore's isanyoneup.com website has earned him the title of 'most hated man on the internet' 'Bully': Moore's website features nude photos of people without their consent. Authorities say he obtained some of the photos by hacking email accounts . According to the indictment, on multiple occasions, Moore paid Evens to break into email accounts and steal nude photos. In an October 2011 email, authorities say that Moore wrote to Evens that 'they needed to . create new e-mail accounts and delete evidence of the hacking scheme.' In other e-mails to Evens, Moore allegedly instructed him to 'hack more' and 'hack all week for me,' presumably referring to hacking into email accounts in search of nude photos. Moore, 27, earned the title of 'most hated man on the Internet' by using his website to post unflattering photos of people - who are typically female and in most cases naked, or engaging in a sex act - as a form of 'revenge porn.' Anti-bully: James McGibney won a $250,000 lawsuit against Moore after he claimed McGibney was a pedophile . The photos are often provided to Moore by scorned exes, and posted on the website without the consent of the person in the photograph. By 2012, Moore's website had essentially become a photographic database of humiliation for hundreds of people - many of whom sought legal avenues to get Moore to remove their photos. In a 2012 television appearance, Moore was confronted by the mother of one of the women he featured on his website. All he would say to the woman is 'I'm sorry that your daughter was ""cyber-raped,"" but, I mean, now she's educated on technology.' In March of 2013, Moore was ordered to pay $250,000 to James McGibney, the founder of Bullyville.com - which sought to put an end to Moore's online 'bullying' - for falsely claiming that McGibney was a pedophile. Good company: Moore tweeted to Justin Bieber - who was in a Florida jail at the time - just moments before he was arrested . For his most recent brush with the law, Moore and Evens face much more than a fine - if convicted the pair  face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and computer hacking . counts. The identity theft charges carry 'a mandatory two-year sentence' that would run 'consecutive to any other sentence imposed in the case,' according to federal prosecutors. Moore was taken into custody this morning - shortly after taking to Twitter to direct a tweet to pop singer Justin Bieber, who was arrested early Thursday morning on charges that he resisted arrest during a DUI stop.

He can detect the opening of  a biscuit tin from 100 paces and performs tricks at the click of your fingers. But it seems the true display of your dog’s intelligence comes when he interacts with his canine friends. Researchers have found that, when walking in a pack, dogs adopt a social hierarchy that gives away leadership roles, social rank and personality trait. Dogs that lead when out for a walk with other canines are more responsive to training, research shows . Using high-resolution GPS harnesses, researchers from Oxford University, Evtvvs University, Budapest and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences tracked the movements of six dogs and their owner across fourteen 30 to 40 minute walks off the lead. Results showed pooches that take the lead are more responsive to training, more controllable, older and more aggressive than dogs that follow. Dogs that led more often had higher dominance ranks in everyday situations, the study for PLOS Computational Biology revealed. The researchers say the technology used in the study could be applied to other dogs used for search and rescue to allow handlers to compare how different dogs work together and pick those with the highest compatibility. Lead author Dr Mati Nagy, of Oxford University’s Department of Zoology, said: 'We showed that it is possible to determine the social ranking and personality traits of each dog from their GPS movement data. 'On individual walks it is hard to identify one permanent leader, but over longer timescales it soon becomes clear that some dogs are followed by peers more often than others. 'Overall, the collective motion of the pack is strongly influenced by an underlying social network.' Dr Enik Kubinyi, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, said: 'The dominance questionnaire tells us the pecking order of dog groups by quantifying interactions between pairs. 'For example, the dogs that bark first and more when strangers enter the house, eat first at meals and wins fights are judged as more dominant. 'Conversely, dogs that lick other dogs’ mouths more often are less dominant as this is a submissive display.' The researchers say pack leadership is well-established in wolves, where packs are typically led by a single breeding pair, but it is unclear whether groups of domestic dogs have a social hierarchy. 'These dogs have no breeding pair', said Dr Kubinyi. 'However, there are dogs who take the lead more often than others. On average, an individual took the role of the leader in a given pair in about three-quarters of the time. 'This ratio is of similar magnitude to the case of wild wolf packs with several breeding individuals. 'Using this qualitative data over longer time scales allows us to see the more subtle relationships that might otherwise be missed. Of course, hierarchies are likely to vary across breeds and individual groups, so we hope to use this technology on other animals in future to investigate further.'","Researchers found dogs adopt a social hierarchy when walking in pack .

You can now dine in denim at The Ritz or land your dream job wearing your favourite jeans - and no one will blink an eye. Denim has today been revealed as the nation's favourite material and it is now so universally accepted, it's not unusual to wear jeans to fine restaurants and job interviews. Jeans were first designed to be worn by laborers and then became synonymous with casual wear. Denim fan: David Beckham dresses up jeans with smart shoes and a navy jumper at his book launch last year . But driven by the likes of David Beckham . and Cameron Diaz, denim is no longer considered a purely casual option, . according to the research by online retailer Littlewoods.com. Their statistics reveal that the typical British woman wears denim 152 days a year and the average man dons jeans on 181 days. A quarter of men even wear jeans nearly every day - on 312 days a year or more. The study revealed 31 per cent of women now wear . jeans to work and 26 per cent (30 per cent of men) would wear . them to a fancy restaurant. The latter is thanks to the strict dress codes of upmarket establishments becoming more accommodating of denim. Although Harrods still bans customers from wearing ripped jeans in the store, in 2010 The Ritz eased their centuries-old rule to allow guests to wear jeans - albeit only at breakfast. Stylish and functional: Kim Kardashian shows off her figure in grey jeans while running an errand . Indicating denim's elevation in status, one in 11 men - 9 per cent - say they even think it's now acceptable to wear jeans to a job interview. The study of 2,000 men and women, looking at the nation's style preferences, found denim now rates above traditional luxurious fabrics such as fur, leather and wool in the fashion stakes. The average woman's wardrobe contains eight jeans at any one time, with men having seven. And the research found they have enduring appeal as we typically hold onto a favourite pair for eight years. Classy: Myleene Klass pairs a purple coat with comfy jeans and black boots showing why she was voted one of the best dressed celebs in denim . Indeed, 7 per cent of men own jeans they have had for 21 years or more. Meanwhile one in seven (14 per cent) admit they wear jeans every single day. Denim's growing ubiquity is illustrated by the attitudes of different generations. It would seem 35 to 44 year olds are leading the denim fashion pack in the office, with 40 per cent choosing to wear it during the daily nine-to-five. Easing the strict dress code: The Ritz now let guests dine in denim - but only at breakfast . Meanwhile those aged 25 to 34 are the most inclined to wear it on glamorous nights out, with 40 per cent of year olds wearing jeans to a stylish restaurant. And the nation's love affair with denim is such that 46 per cent of us think it's the perfect thing to wear on a first date. A person's favourite jeans can also serve as a gauge of changing shape. Three quarters of women (75 per cent) admit holding on to old jeans to use as an indicator of their weight. Best dressed in denim: Cameron Diaz looking smart in tightly fitted jeans and a black jumper at her book launch earlier this month . A near majority of 81 per cent insist that still being able to fit into their favourite pair is the ultimate confidence boost. The study found many shoppers are willing to splash on the perfect pair of jeans. While the average Brit spends £42 on a quality pair, one in seven 35 to 44 year olds (13 per cent) will happily pay more than £100. Littlewoods.com's buyer Toni Craig, obtains nearly £12m worth of denim a season to feed the nation's demand for the fabric. She said: 'We're witnessing a real denim renaissance. Jeans are no longer just something we throw on to pop to the shops, they're now acceptable to wear for almost any occasion, especially those traditionally considered to be more formal. 'Last year we sold over 680,000 pairs of jeans - black was our best selling colour, indicative of people looking for smart denim options. 'This year already we are selling 78 pairs of jeans every hour, and skinny is our best-selling style. 'True blue shades are increasing in popularity, which we believe has been fuelled by the need for an outfit to transcend day and night time.' Queen of fashion: Victoria Beckham shows off the versatility of the nation's favourite fabric in shorts and jeans . Too much: Denim may now be acceptable in formal situations but - but don't over do it like Britney and Justin back in 2001.

Gyarmati, . who came to the UK to find work three months before the murder, . admitted killing Miss Kovacs after they had sex in her house but claimed . he did not intend to cause serious injury. Hard-working: She was working at a t-shirt factory to send money home to her parents and brother in Hungary . He claimed he grabbed her by the throat and put a pillow over her head to keep her quiet during an argument. Police found Miss Kovacs' body after a tip off from a member of public. They also found bloodstains on the wall and headboard of her bedroom. Gyarmati said that after they had sex . twice Miss Kovacs tried to persuade him to get involved in a sham . marriage immigration fraud. He . told jurors: 'She really wound me up. What wound me up was I told her . this was not going to work. She said it was going to work because she . knew better.' Gyarmati . added: 'I put the pillow on her face so that she could not be heard, so . that she should be silent. I thought that someone was going to come in . but noone did. 'Then I took the pillow off. She didn't move. I realised I had killed her.' 'Screams': Miss Kovacs' housemates in Mill Hill, north London, heard screams but were too scared to investigate . Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said: 'Despite the fact that she cried for help and that those cries were heard by other residents, it seems that none of them went to her assistance. 'The following morning the defendant placed the victim's body in a large suitcase belonging to one of the other tenants before wheeling it to a nearby park where he dumped it in the bushes.' Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, . Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'Alexandra was a young woman . starting out in life when she was killed by Laszlo Gyarmati. She was . working very hard sending money back to Hungary to her mum and younger . brother. 'Alexandra knew . Gyarmati and was happy to be in his company that evening. She obviously . had no thoughts that he would hurt her. Sadly he betrayed that trust in . the ultimate way. 'After he . killed her Gyarmati took steps to cover his crime by callously putting . her body in to a suitcase and secreting it in local woodland.'","Laszlo Gyarmati, 29, jailed for 17 years for murdering Alexandra Kovac, 25 .
