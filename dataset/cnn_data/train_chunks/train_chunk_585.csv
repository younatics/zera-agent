Fans of veteran heavy metal band Napalm Death are used to seeing their idols bring the house down. But it was their reputation for ear-shattering sets which led to a gig being cancelled this week. The band were due to take part in a special one-off performance alongside ceramic artist Keith Harrison at London's Victoria & Albert museum in Kensington. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Eardrum assault: Heavy metal band Napalm Death have been entertaining 'grindcore' fans since 1981 . Disappointed: Napalm Death singer Mark Greenway, left, and guitarist Shane Embury, in full flow . Mr Harrison, who shares the band's roots in Birmingham, had built a sculptural sound system clad with ceramic tiles which would in theory disintegrate as the band thrashed out their songs to illustrate a theme of 'sound as a weapon'. A limited number of fans had been given free tickets for the show in Room 7 of the European Galleries on Friday. But earlier this week, museum bosses were forced to pull the plug on the event amid fears that not only would the ceramic tiles explode, the building could come down with it. A statement on the V&A's website . reads: 'It is with regret that we have taken the decision to cancel the . one-off Napalm Death performance in collaboration with our ceramic . artist in residence Keith Harrison. 'This . was due to take place in the Europe Galleries which are currently being . refurbished and a further safety inspection has revealed concerns that . the high level of decibels generated by the concert would damage the . historic fabric of the building. 'The . V&A is committed to an exciting programme of exhibitions and events . but the safety of our visitors and building remains our priority at all . times.' Historic: Ceramic specialist Keith Harrison has been an artist in resident at the Victoria & Albert museum since last October . Worried: Museum bosses had concerns that the loud decibels could damage some of the ancient artifacts (pictured is the Medieval and Renaissance Gallery) Mark 'Barney' Greenway, the lead singer of Napalm Death, told The Times he was disappointed but not entirely surprised. 'They had been making noises. They started asking the sound guy fairly nervously: ""What will the volume be like?"" He was like, ""What can I tell you? They make a lot of noise"",' he said. He added there were specific concerns about a hanging sculpture near to the stage. The museum's worries were unlikely to have been alleviated by Mr Greenway's influences. 'Some of my favourite bands go out to make enough noise to make people physically sick. They use sound as a weapon,' he told The Times. 'We were ready for things to go awry,' he added. 'Apparently there was some suspended china thing around the stage. Obviously if we cranked [the music] out and it detached from the ceiling, that would be embarrassing.' The band, who released debut album 'Scum' in 1987, are regarded as pioneers of the 'grindcore' scene and one of the loudest performers in the music industry.","Special performance with ceramic artist Keith Harrison had been lined up .

The sisters of child killer Mairead Philpott claim she is a 'victim' of her controlling husband Mick - but they cannot forgive her for the deaths of their nieces and nephews. Jennifer Lobban and Bernadette Duffy told of their desperate attempts to convince her to leave Mick since they married in May 2003, and take the children away. They claim Mairead was so unhappy she had even attempted suicide in the months before the tragic fire. Emotion: Mairead Philpott weeps as she is sentenced to 17 years in prison for the manslaughter of her six children . Distraught: Jimmy Duffy, the father of Mairead Philpott, hugs daughter Bernadette, outside Nottingham Crown Court as his daughter was sentenced today . Distraught: Mairead's sisters Jennifer Lobban, left, and Bernadette Duffy, right, told a Panorama . documentary how they tried on several occasions to rescue her from . Philpott's clutches without success . But the family told Panorama ultimately she put the man she described in court as her 'guardian angel' above everything else. During the couple's eight-week trial, Mairead painted herself as a vulnerable character from a troubled background. Born in Ireland, she came from a traveller family and made allegations of abuse as a child, having been forced from school by bullies and raped in her teenage years. Vulnerable: Mairead Philpott was 19 and at 'rock bottom' when she met Mick . She was, she admitted, at ‘rock bottom’ when she met Philpott aged just 19, and jumped at the chance to move in with him. Mairead gave birth to their first child Jade in August 2001, followed by John in October 2002. They would go on to have three more children together. But while they were by then engaged, there was nothing conventional about their living arrangements because Philpott had introduced a second woman, Lisa Willis, into the household. Within weeks, their relationship had become sexual, the two women agreeing to take it in turns to share Philpott’s bed. Despite this Mairead agreed to marry Mick in May 2003. Miss Willis even acted as bridesmaid at their wedding. In court she admitted she was 'hurt' by his relationship with Miss Willis but agreed to it because she didn't want to lose her family. Sources said the women were expected to have sex with Philpott virtually every day, and were ‘on their backs’ even when pregnant. So why did Mairead put up with this? Her family say she was terrified of him, and that he isolated her and the children from those who cared about them. Jennifer and Bernadette told how the fragile peace which held the household together imploded after Lisa Willis finally had enough and left. Jennifer Lobban told Panorama: 'We would try and get round there when he was doing the school run because we knew that he wouldn’t be in the house. 'We told her that we could go to the school, we could go now; go take the kids from school. We would get her out, but she just wouldn’t leave.' Did the benefits system contribute to the Philpott fire killings? Mick Philpott once allowed the eldest child, Duwayne, 13, to have a sleepover at Bernadette’s house. Bernadette said the little boy was in a terrible state, adding: 'Mick said he hadn’t eaten for a week and I took him and my little boy out for a pizza. 'I had never seen a child eat so fast in my life.’ Mairead's father Jimmy Duffy told Panorama he has had difficulty accepting his daughter was responsible for the children's deaths. He said: . 'It’s wrecking me inside, wrecking me... I bottle a lot up away from my . kids... Some nights I sit for hours in the dark.' Neglect: Mairead Philpott's sister Bernadette told how one of the children Duwayne, 13, had once gone a week without eating . The family have also dismissed Mairead’s claims in . court that her father abused her as a child. Police have confirmed the . allegations were investigated at the time and found no evidence of any . crime by Jimmy Duffy. They also said there are no plans to follow up . Mairead’s courtroom claim. Bernadette and Jennifer say it is . not the first time their sister has made a false sex allegation. In . court, Mairead told the jury she'd been raped on holiday as a teenager. Her sister Jennifer says she was with her at the time of the alleged . incident: 'I think it’s just one of the many lies she tells. She got . caught sleeping with a married man for money and she said she was raped. Not only has she played a part in her children’s deaths. It just seems . that she will do anything to get out of it.' Although Mairead’s sisters say they both . believe she is a victim of Mick Philpott, they cannot understand why she put him before the lives of all her children. Jennifer said: 'Yeah. She is a victim of Mick. But at the end of the day, when it . comes to your kids, she should have put them first. She should have put . the kids first.' Disbelief: Jimmy Duffy says he still finds it hard to comprehend that his daughter was responsible for the deaths of six children . Sentencing Mairead to 17 years in jail today, Mrs Justice Thirwall made it clear she did not regard Mairead Philpott as a 'victim'. She said: 'I have already made clear that this was Michael Philpott's plan. I accept that he treated you as a skivvy or a slave, and you were prepared to put up with that. 'As became clear during the trial you were prepared to go to any lengths, however humiliating, to keep him happy. 'But as the evidence came out it was plain that this was not quite the position. 'This was put beyond doubt when you gave evidence. You pointed out that you had stood up to him in the past. That is why when he asked you for a divorce on no fewer than three occasions you refused him. 'It is inescapable therefore that when something was important enough to you, you were capable of exercising a choice which was not his choice. 'Instead you joined in with his plan. Child killers: Mairead Philpott weeps in front of the judge as she is jailed for 17 years as her husband (left) and friend Paul Mosley (right), who was also given 17 years, look on . 'The risks were obvious and overwhelming and anyone who has heard the harrowing wailing from you on the 999 call can hear your realisation that this had gone horribly wrong and your children were in mortal danger. 'You put Michael Philpott above your children and as a result they have died. After the fire you threw your lot in with Michael Philpott. You supported him in his quest to get residence of the other children. You complied with his sexual demands to keep Paul Mosley onside. 'You lied to the police and you stuck to the story, just as he asked you to, to the police and to the jury.

Convicted rapist: Max Factor heir Andrew Luster will get a new sentence today after his 124-year prison term was thrown out . A California judge who threw out the . 124-year prison term of an heir to the Max Factor fortune convicted of . drugging and raping three women will hear arguments Tuesday on a new . sentence for Andrew Luster. Attorneys for the 49-year-old Luster, . who has been in prison for a decade, said they will ask for Ventura . County Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz to give him a sentence . of 25 years or less. Luster's lawyers Jay Leiderman and J. David Nick said in court documents filed last month that Luster is not a . sexual predator and has had a 'stellar performance' in prison, the . Ventura County Star reported. Prosecutors argued in a sentencing . memorandum filed last week that Luster's sentence was appropriate, but . the original court's reasoning needed to be explained. 'The original sentence was not . erroneous – only the record needed to be corrected,' Deputy District . Attorney Michelle Contois wrote. It was not clear whether Stoltz would hand down the new sentence at Monday's hearing or sometime afterward. Last month the judge refused a . request to throw out Luster's conviction, but granted him a resentencing . hearing, writing in her ruling that the court 'failed to state specific . reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' as the law requires. Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, was arrested in 2000 and . charged with giving three women the drug GHB and raping them at his . beachfront home while they were unconscious. He was convicted in 2003 in absentia . of 86 counts including rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an . unconscious person and sexual battery. He fled to Mexico during the . trial. He was captured the same year in Mexico by . reality TV bounty hunter Duane 'Dog' Chapman in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta. New hearing: Luster, left, is led out of the U.S. Customs building at LAX by FBI agents a day after being captured by Dog the Bounty Hunter in Mexico in June 2003 . Last month Chapman revealed that he got a vital tip-off about the fugitive's hiding place from Luster's own attorney, the late Richard Sherman. The . make-up heir ultimately sought a new sentencing hearing, and Stoltz ruled last month that the . judge who sent him to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific . reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them . run concurrently. 'The . previously imposed sentence is vacated and a new sentencing hearing . will be held,' Stoltz wrote in her 28-page opinion that also denied him a . new trial. The judge set an April 4 sentencing hearing for Luster. Attorneys . for the Max Factor heir had argued he deserved one, in part because his . original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one . lawyer, Richard Sherman, gave him ill-conceived advice to flee to . Mexico. Bounty hunter and TV star, Chapman told Radar Online that Sherman gave him very useful clues as to Luster's location. Reality TV star: Dog the Bounty Hunter, pictured, caught Luster while he was on the run in 2003. Last month, he revealed that he was tipped off about Luster's location by the fugitives own attorney . As Radar Online reports, Sherman passed away in April 2011. The lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client's hiding place. But according to 'Dog' the attorney did give him the information, in a very subtle way. 'Sherman became very nice to me,' Chapman explained to Radar. 'We used to tease each other. And at one point he said to me, ""I’m going to tell you something Dog, so don’t be so dumb."" And then he said, ""The guy (Luster) speaks Spanish. Do you get it?""' The bounty hunter immediately understood. 'I had leads that pointed to Thailand and Mexico,' he said. 'Right then I dropped all my leads on Thailand and focused on Mexico.' Chapman captured Luster in June 2003 and was briefly jailed himself as bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Judge Kathryne Stoltz ruled last month that the judge who sent Luster to prison for 124 years 'failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences' rather than having them run concurrently . On Monday, Stoltz wrote that Luster's attorneys did not fail him at trial, and she rejected his current lawyers' arguments that Luster was manipulated into fleeing. 'Although several witnesses did describe Luster as 'childlike,' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund, and he lived the life of a carefree 'beach bum,' Stoltz wrote. She added that Luster, who spent much of his time surfing, described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading, and that he did not appear to have a low IQ. Luster was found guilty of giving three women the date rape drug GHB and raping them while they were unconscious or intoxicated. Video tape Luster took of his sexual acts with the women was presented against him at trial.","Andrew Luster, great-grandson of cosmetics giant Max Factor, will get a new sentencing hearing for his 86 counts of rape but no new trial .

They may have never spoken out publicly about their romance, but Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower are magical together, according to their unwitting matchmaker and best-selling writer Cassandra Clare. The young Hollywood stars met last year on the set of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, the upcoming big screen adaptation of Cassandra’s book and have been inseparable ever since. And the novelist – whose new book Clockwork Princess, the highly anticipated end to her Infernal Devices trilogy is out today - tells MailOnline they are 'clearly in love'. Happy couple: Jamie Campbell Bower and Lily Collins beam as they attend the British Fashion Awards in London in November. Clearly in love: Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower as Shadowhunters Clary Fray and Jace Wayland in the big screen adaption of City of Bones. Going into battle: Lily Collins and Jamie Bower Campbell in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. The couple play Clary Fray and Jace Wayland, both ‘Shadowhunters’,  a breed of demon hunters, in the film that comes out this summer. Jamie was previously engaged to his Harry Potter co-star Bonnie Wright after meeting on the set of the Wizard hit, but the couple split last summer after two years together, while Lily dated Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner. Cassandra, 39, admitted: ‘I remember coming to the set and one of the people who worked on the crew mentioned it. ‘Then I saw them together and they’re so clearly in love and it’s very sweet. I wish them all the happiness. ‘They’re very close and I begin to see them now in my head when I’m writing. I wrote Clary as very petite and delicate with freckles, because it’s a lot of fun to do a reversal because she turns out to be strong, which is very like Lily. There’s a sense of sweetness about her, but she can also transform into being really tough and strong and an ass-kicker, which is a lot of fun too. Fantastic: Best-selling fantasy author Cassandra Clare . ‘And Jamie IS Jace – he’s exactly the same! Very sarcastic and funny and very beautiful.’ As their romance bloomed on the set of her film, Cassandra adds: ‘I still find it amazing that they first time they met was in their audition for Clary and Jace! ‘The first time I really got to talk to them was at dinner, and we were talking about the chemistry test Jamie did with Lily. Lily was our Clary and we were looking for Jace and I said ‘you guys were amazing, anybody could see that Jamie just seemed to be Jace’. ‘And they said ‘we were just watching our audition together the other day’, which I thought was very sweet.  Lily is stunning in person - her mum Jill is very pretty, she came on set while we were filming and you can see she has good genetic material.’ Indeed, speaking about Jamie, 24, earlier this month, Lily, 24 - the daughter of singer Phil Collins - said: ‘He had this perfect mixture of being this witty, kind of jokey, cocky in the best sense of the word, but also extremely vulnerable, emotional and this great mixture of emotions. And that’s what Jace is. He has to walk in a room and make people turn their heads and that’s what Jamie does. The petite brunette added: ‘He just brought everything to the room that day. And he left and I just turned to everyone and was like, ‘I really don’t know what else you could be looking for. That’s Jace’.’ Cassandra’s success has ensured that she is now one of an elite group of women fantasy writers who have spawned chart-topping series. She joins Harry Potter star J.K. Rowling, Twilight writer Stephanie Meyer and Hunger Games scribe Suzanne Collins in creating strong female characters for young girls to aspire to. She's magical: Lily Collins in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. Jace and the gang: Jamie Campbell Bower and his band of Shadowhunters. Her new book, Clockwork Princess, is the end of the series which takes place in Victorian England and centres around a teenage girl called Tessa who finds herself swept into the Shadowhunters world. And Cassandra says: ‘For me, the triad of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games and Twilight feature strong women and as a declared feminist, it’s a wonderful thing. These women have really opened up this particular world of storytelling, which I’m very grateful for. ‘I think as women we’ve always been very used to growing up reading and identifying with male protagonists, especially in fantasy. There’s a saying in publishing that girls will read about boys, but boys will only read about boys and it’s important to give women strong heroines. ‘And as women we’ve come to recognise the necessity of writing these characters and making them accessible to everybody. Highly anticipated: Clockwork Princess, the third and last installment in The Infernal Devices series, is out today. ‘There’s an aspect to readying this age group, with the trials the characters are facing: how do I become a person? How do I become a  good women? And these books directly address that.’ She added: ‘Harry Potter came out and said these books are about kids, but not necessarily for children. And that made it okay, for people of all ages, from all walks of life, to read fantasy. I feel these books really opened up the gates for people like me.’ Cassandra revealed that she had also been helped by her best-selling peers, although she has never met J.K. Rowling, joking: ‘I believe she lives in a castle in Scotland now!’ However, she does keep in touch with Stephanie Meyer and Suzanne Collins, saying: ‘Stephanie has been lovely, super-promotive and she’s recommended my books to a lot of people. ‘She ready the manuscripts of two of my books early on and was also one of the first big promoters of the Hunger Games, she talked about it everywhere. ‘And Suzanne worked as a screenwriter for a long time and she gives great advice.’ When it comes to bidding farewell to her characters, Cassandra admits: ‘It is really difficult to say goodbye to the characters and know I’m not going to write about them after five years of working and doing research and traveling to England every year. ‘I’ve had a lot of feedback from fans, they email constantly. I’m going to miss Tessa a lot, she has some grand adventures, she has to face off against great enemies, she has to do battle and defeat her enemy and find out who she really is. She knows she has a magical power, but she doesn’t know why. ‘One of the reasons why I constructed a love triangle is that she’s a girl who has these many, many choices about her life. Co-stars: Lily Collins fell for Jamie Campbell Bower after auditioning with him for The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. British: The cast is made up from a number of UK actors including Mad Men star Jared Harris who plays Hodge Starkweather in the film. ‘I think the books don’t necessarily follow the traditional love pattern, fans will find the ending bitter sweet, but it’s a fitting conclusion.’ Cassandra, who lives with her husband, fellow writer Joshua Lewis along with their three cats in Western Massachusetts,  is currently working on the sixth installment as she revealed the Mortal Instruments series has its genesis in the 9/11 terror attacks. She said: ‘I had just moved to New York in September 2001 and immediately 9/11 happened and of course it completely changed the city and everybody who lived there. ‘I was in Brooklyn, coming down the bridge as everyone was walking over, covered in plaster dust and blood, and the shopkeepers opened up along the street to give out free water and we were running over to hand it out. People were very kind and brave in a crisis. ‘It made me want to write a story set in New York, a kind of fantasy and a love letter to the city and the people who live there. Heartthrob: Jamie Campbell Bower has become a rising star. ‘There was this idea of monsters and demons and people were so afraid of the city being attacked. There were missing posters everywhere - it was a really a terrifying time to live in the city. I thought ‘what if the city was really under attack by supernatural dark forces, who would protect it?’ She sold the film rights to her Mortal Instruments series soon after publication and will be treated to the first glimpse at the first film at a private screening in LA next month. She admits: ‘I was very lucky and was brought into the audition process and I had all my friends trying to hack into my computer to watch all these famous actors auditioning.’ But the writer will have to wait to see how the film fares to see whether the next two books in the series, City of Ashes and City of Glass, will be turned into movies. The next installment, City of Heavenly Fire, is due next year. On top of that, she’s written a project with her best friend Holly Black, about a young magician, called The Magisterium. She’s also teamed up with her husband to write the Shadow Hunters Codex, a guide to her world, which, as she says, makes for interesting dinner talk. All of which makes for a pretty fantastic life.

A dog had a lucky escape when it was thrown out of a car and across a canal after the car it was travelling in careered off the highway yesterday. The white Cadillac Escalade had been heading eastbound along the Wyoming Highway 230 when it veered off the road and landed in the canal next to it, leaving the female driver so badly injured she had to be carried from the scene by paramedics. Emergency services workers estimate that the car was airborne for at least 30 feet after it left the highway and plunged down to the east bank of the Pioneer Canal, near Laramie, WY. Firefighter Kevin McIntyer comforts the dog that was thrown from the Cadillac in yesterday's accident . The female driver was stretchered off by paramedics following the accident that happened at mile marker 22 yesterday at about 4pm. Emergency workers who arrived at the scene were astonished to find the pet, a type of cattle dog, whimpering but alive, 20ft from the wrecked car it had been travelling in and on the opposite bank of the canal. Animal Health Center veterinarians were called, and tended to the animal before loading it onto a stretcher and taking it to the health center for treatment. Initial reports suggested the dog had suffered a broken leg and injured jaw in the accident, while its owner, who is not being identified until her next of kin has been informed, was said to be conscious and able to speak at the scene. The Cadillac, which was the only vehicle involved in the incident, was badly damaged. Wyoming Highway Patrol Trooper Erin Devries told local paper the Laramie Boomerang: 'It appears she failed to negotiate a right-hand curve in the road, went through a fence and went airborne and, once she landed, she landed front-end into the ravine.' Workers were still trying to salvage the car from the ravine this morning. The injured dog was stretchered away for medical treatment after being thrown from the Cadillac yesterday .

Britain's shortest double yellow lines have appeared on a city's street - measuring little over a foot long. Two sets of double yellow lines measuring just 13 inches long apiece have been painted in between parking spaces on a residential road in Cambridge. Cambridge County Council say the lines, which beat the previous shortest double yellows by a good four inches, are to deter drivers from encroaching on disabled parking bays. The tiny 13-inch double yellow lines have been painted between official parking spaces in Cambridge . If motorists park on the new lines they will incur a £70 fine.  But local residents say the new markings 'defy logic' and are simple waste of time and taxpayers' money. Liz Hazell, 51, lives on Humberstone Road near Cambridge city centre, where the lines have been painted. She said: 'It's the craziest set of double yellow lines I have ever seen.  It just defies logic as to why they bothered painting them on the road.' Her son Nik, 21, who helped row Oxford's reserve vessel Isis to victory in last weekend's Varsity boat race, added: 'It's ridiculous. I have no idea why they have done that. You can't even fit a remote control car on it.' Councillor Rob Dryden, a former mayor of Cambridge, also branded the new road markings 'rididulous', adding: 'Perhaps a child with a toy car could park there, but nothing else could.' Cambridgeshire County Council said: 'This is common practice. 'I think they're cute': City councillor Damien Tunnacliffe hopes the lines will become a tourist attraction . Measuring little over a foot long, the new yellow lines are more fitting for toy cars than real ones . 'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay.' Councillor Damien Tunnacliffe said he hoped the lines would become an attraction for visitors. He said: 'I think they’re cute and could be on the tourist trail. We should get the blue badge tour guides onto it.' The previous shortest double yellow line record was held by the city of Norwich, where residents woke up to find a set just 17 inches long in Stafford Street in 2011. Council bosses also laid down 18 inch double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, North London, in 2007. And last year Canterbury in Kent painted double yellow lines measuring just 21 inches.","Parking on the lines in Humberstone Road, Cambridge will mean a £70 fine .

Poppy Knight, 22, pictured outside court, helped her lover Christopher Zeb groom the schoolgirl and filmed an orgy between the three . A young sadistic couple acted out dark sexual fantasies on a 14-year-old girl after grooming her on internet chat rooms, a court heard today. Married engineer Christopher Zeb, 26, and his deviant mistress Poppy Knight, 22, blindfolded, bit and bruised their teenage victim in a seedy 24-hour sex session in a hotel. The schoolgirl, whose name police found in a document in Zeb's home entitled 'Slaves In Training', told her mother she was going to stay with a schoolfriend before catching a train to Manchester and spending the night with the couple. A judge today condemned the pair's 'serious sexual offences' as he jailed Zeb for six-and-a-half years and Knight for 30 months. Sitting . at Oxford Crown Court, Judge Ian Pringle heard that married Zeb began . an extramarital affair with Knight in 2011, which 'quickly developed . into a sadistic sexual relationship'. Within the relationship, Knight acted as her lover's consenting 'slave', taking pleasure in him inflicting pain upon her. But Zeb also trawled websites and chat rooms looking for younger 'slaves' to feed his sexual desires. On Easter Sunday last year, Zeb and . Knight travelled to Manchester to meet a 14-year-old girl from Bolton, . Lancashire, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Prosecutor . Cathy Olliver said: 'During the Easter holidays in 2012, she lied to . her mother about going to a friend's house in Bolton. Instead she got . the train to Manchester. 'Mr Zeb and Miss Knight picked her up at the station and drove her to a hotel.' After going out for a meal together, . the trio went upstairs to the bedroom where the girl was blindfolded and . twice forced to perform a sex act on Zeb. They . then made a 'den' out of bedclothes in the room which all they entered . into naked, and began an orgy which Knight filmed.  As she did so, she . encouraged the girl, the court heard.' Poppy Knight had brought the morning after pill for her, so she didn't use condoms', the prosecutor said. Christopher Zeb, 26, and Poppy Knight, 22, were today both jailed after admitting grooming a child for sex. 'Poppy Knight is fully participating . and praises her...It's clear from [the girl's] interview she was not . aware she was being filmed'. She added: 'Her parents had no idea . where she was that evening. They didn't know she was in a hotel in a . strange city or what was happening to her for that entire night.' The . girl, who had returned home with bite marks and bruises after her . ordeal, did not complain to the police, but the alarm was raised when . the father of a 12-year-old girl from Humberside raised the alarm after . discovering Zeb was grooming her online. Relatives of Zeb and Knight were at Oxford Crown Court today to hear Judge Ian Pringle hand down his sentence . The horrified father found out she had sent Zeb pictures of herself and he had asked to meet up with her. Police . raided Zeb's marital home in Banbury, Oxfordshire, last September and . seized his computer and a mobile phone found hidden in his loft. Detectives . discovered the hotel room video on his computer, along with a word . document entitled 'Slaves In Training' which detailed girls he was . targeting on the internet. They . also found sexual pictures Zeb had encouraged both the 12 and 14 year . old girls to email to him after he'd set them tasks to 'please daddy'. Zeb and Knight lured the schoolgirl to Manchester and took her out for dinner before beginning an all-night orgy . When police seized the girls' phones, they found Zeb's phone number stored in them saved under the name 'Master'. Mrs Olliver said: 'It was clear he had contacted, in a sexualised manner, a number of girls.' Investigating officers also found that Knight had been in contact with the 14-year-old girl they met in Manchester. In an email exchange read out in court, she told the schoolgirl they were 'slave sisters' and they had to please Zeb. Zeb had admitted nine offences, including abducting a child, meeting a female aged under 16 after sexual grooming and five child sex offences. One count referred to sexual activity with a child aged under 13. Knight, of Banbury, had admitted eight similar offences related only to the 14-year-old girl. Shocked relatives of the pair, including Zeb's parents, sat in silence in the public gallery as Knight's counsel David Bright claimed she was also one of Zeb's victims and that she was following orders as his slave because of his 'evil and malign influence'. Zeb's defence counsel Trudi Yeatman told the judge: 'He's not in denial. He fully accepts the extent of his offending.' Mrs Yeatman added that Zeb and Knight's relationship was 'dark and often sadistic' but at all times consensual between the two of them. Judge Pringle said to Zeb: 'I've had to look at seven clips and videos which depict clearly what took place.  You were the main perpetrator of that abuse, and abuse it was.' He said to both: 'You subjected that girl to all forms of intercourse and I would be failing grossly in my duty if I was not to impose on both of you a sentence of immediate imprisonment.' The judge ordered Zeb and Knight sign the sex offenders register and be banned from contact with children. He also banned them from using the internet on a computer not fitted with police monitoring software.","Christopher Zeb, 26, and Poppy Knight, 22, from Banbury jailed after admitting child sex offences .

"By . Harriet Arkell . UPDATED: . 05:14 EST, 9 April 2013 . A notorious Rockefeller impostor was a master manipulator who 'always had a lie in his back pocket to explain things', but slipped up and left clues that he was a killer, a court heard yesterday. Prosecutor Habib Balian told the jury that Christian Gerhartsreiter murdered John Sohus in San Marino 28 years ago and said that all the evidence they needed to convict him was there. 'This isn't a movie, a book, a TV show, a docudrama,' the Deputy District Attorney said in his closing argument, referring to the fact that the case has been turned into all of those things over the years. 'This case is about two people who lived and died,' Balian said. Gerhartsreiter is on trial in California, U.S. for the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his home in San Marino with his wife, Linda . Defendant Christian Gerhartsreiter is charged only with the murder of Mr Sohus in suburban San Marino, but the prosecutor has been allowed to say he believes Gerhartsreiter also killed Mr Sohus' wife, who remains missing after nearly three decades. 'She's dead', Balian said repeatedly as he described the disappearance of Linda Sohus and her husband, John - newlyweds he said had no reason to vanish. The bones of John Sohus were unearthed in the backyard of his mother's former house in San Marino a decade after he and his wife disappeared.  He was found to have died from multiple fractures to the skull, probably caused by a blunt instrument such as a baseball bat. Gerhartsreiter lived as a tenant on the property in 1984 and 1985, but called himself Chris Chichester then.  He vanished around the same time the couple disappeared in 1985, according to witnesses. As part of his closing argument, Balian used a Powerpoint presentation that showed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle falling into place. Balian predicted that the defense would seek to paint Linda Sohus as the murderer of her husband. Previously the trial heard from Gerhartsreiter's ex-wife Sandra Boss, right, to whom he lied about who he was . 'They're going to batter her over and over and say she was the mastermind,' Balian said in his presentation. 'But all the evidence in this case is going to point you to the fact that only one person was the mastermind. ... He is charged with murder.' However, defense attorney Jeffrey Denner was less demeaning of Linda Sohus than he was of his own client. He said Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant, was a white-collar criminal with a long list of offenses including identity theft and immigration fraud. 'Over a period of time in this country, he committed a lot of crimes with which he was never charged', Denner said. 'It's no wonder he would want to stay under the radar.' But the lawyer said his client had not been running from a murder investigation. The defendant, seen here with pen in his hand, took copious notes as the prosecutor summed up the case against him . Denner noted that no trace evidence was scientifically connected to the defendant, and he suggested it was more likely that Linda Sohus had a 'dark side' of her life that led her to kill her husband. But he offered no evidence to support that contention. 'That's the stuff that reasonable doubt is made of', he told jurors. 'You don't know what happened. If you don't know what happened, you can't convict anybody.' Balian noted that Monday was the 28th anniversary of the day Linda and John Sohus were reported missing. 'What do we do with a case 28 years old?' he said, acknowledging there are no eye witnesses or physical evidence in the case. 'Circumstantial evidence is just as powerful', Balian said as he detailed the pieces of his puzzle. 'Not only does he flee, he changes his identity and discontinues contacts with friends. Why? Because he's a murderer', the prosecutor said. Eventually, Gerhartsreiter turned up on the East Coast using the name Clark Rockefeller and living well at the expense of his wealthy wife. Gerhartsreiter was previously prosecuted for kidnapping his own daughter and is serving a prison sentence for that crime. Defense lawyers have suggested that he lived a life of pretense, making up wild stories about royal lineage, but they say he never killed anyone. 'He lied at will and his life was based on that', Denner said. 'He said he was a filmmaker and he could amend the script anytime he wanted.' Gerhartsreiter was previously accused of kidnapping his own daughter Reigh, above, in 2009 . Balian reminded jurors of testimony by former friends from San Marino. A woman remembered seeing dirt in his yard where a large hole had been dug. A forensic expert said traces of blood were found on the concrete floor beneath a rug in the guest cottage the defendant occupied, bt it was never clear if the blood was human or animal, and it was not linked to Gerhartsreiter. The prosecutor also emphasized what was found in the backyard grave along with bones - plastic shopping bags from the University of Southern California and University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, two colleges the defendant attended. 'The case is easy', said Balian. 'The evidence is right in front of your eyes.' The only thing missing, he acknowledged was a motive. Why would the defendant kill John Sohus? 'The prosecution need not prove why', he said. 'It's not part of our burden of proof. Nor do we need to prove the type of weapon used or where he was killed.'Superior Court Judge George Lomeli instructed jurors that if they cannot agree on the charge of first-degree murder, they have the option of considering second-degree murder, which does not require premeditation. He told jurors to return Tuesday for Balian's rebuttal before the start of their deliberations. Accused: Christian Gerhartsreiter is accused of the 1985 murder of John Sohus .

Lies: Emma La Garde shaved her son's head and eyebrows to pretend he had cancer in a sick benefit fraud . A mother who shaved her son’s head . and eyebrows to pretend he had cancer so she could claim benefits was . sent to prison yesterday. Emma La Garde, 37, made the . seven-year-old use a wheelchair and shaved his head to mimic the effects . of chemotherapy in a scam that made her £86,000. The boy, who cannot be named, was not . suffering from any illness but was forced to play along with his . mother’s lies, wearing a bandana to school and not being allowed to take . part in PE lessons. A court heard he hated being in the wheelchair and refused to use it at home, where he enjoyed playing on a trampoline. Meanwhile his mother used her Facebook page to announce he had cancer and kept up the elaborate farce for four years. La Garde used forged medical . documents to enable her to earn money from a carer’s allowance, tax . exemptions and disability benefits. The mother of five, who was also . given a specially-adapted car, used some of the money to pay for luxury . holidays, including a trip to Disney World in Florida where she took her . son in his wheelchair so they could get to the front of the queues. The court heard that the fraud started when she took her son to see a doctor in 2008 after he complained of pains in his legs. Following tests, the doctor wrote to . La Garde to say the boy’s blood tests were clear and that he was . healthy. But she used the letter as a template to forge letters that . said he was gravely ill. At first she claimed he had ALPS – . autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome – causing an enlarged spleen. She sent it to his school and the Department of Work and Pensions to . claim Disability Living Allowance. In 2009 she sent her son to school in . a wheelchair donated by the Red Cross and told teachers he could not do . physical education. In February 2010, La Garde sent . another forged doctor’s letter to the school claiming her son had . lymphoma, a type of cancer. Lisa Hennessey, prosecuting, said: ‘She said . he would be treated with an oral tablet that would make his hair fall . out. 'Within days he was wearing a bandana at school and La Garde told . teachers that the other children should be stopped from pulling it off . as they would make fun of him. ‘There was visible hair growth around . the edges of the bandana and it was obvious to the school that his . eyebrows had been shaved off. Hometown: The mother, who forged doctors' notes and made it look like the boy was taking medication for cancer, is from the Stroud area of Gloucestershire (file picture) On holiday: The woman used benefit money to take her children to a location in Florida, where she made the boy sit in the wheelchair so they could jump queues. South Beach in Miami is pictured . ‘The person who had carried out this was Emma La Garde.’ La Garde’s deceit was uncovered when the boy’s father, from whom she had separated, was shown the faked letters at school. The doctor confirmed his son’s clean . bill of health, at which point the father contacted social services, and . La Garde was arrested in May 2010. She later admitted one charge of . child cruelty, eight counts of fraud and one of forgery. Jailing her for . three years and eight months, Judge Jamie Tabor said she was a . congenital liar. ‘What a tangled web you wove,’ he added. ‘This was cruelty over a long period of time.’ He . read out a victim statement for her son, who is now ten, which read: ‘I . don’t like her, she is evil. She should be normal but I don’t think she . has a normal brain. I know I don’t miss her any more.’ The judge said the boy did not want to see his mother, who has also lost custody of her other four children.

Claim: Author Patti Davis, pictured last summer, has claimed that her mother, former first lady Nancy Reagan, supports gay marriage . Though her late husband may have had an embattled view of same-sex marriage, Nancy Reagan fully supports it, her daughter has sensationally claimed. Patti Davis, the daughter of the former first lady, announced in a radio interview this week that her mother ‘does’ support it. Davis’ claim directly goes against an op-ed written by her half-brother, Michael Reagan, who claimed earlier this month that legalizing gay marriage would lead to ‘polygamy, bestiality, and perhaps even murder.’ Speaking on SiriousXM’s show, ‘OutQ,’ Davis was asked whether her mother supported the progression. The former first daughter responded simply: ‘She does.’ Two weeks ago, she again made headlines for making a posthumous claim that former president Ronald Reagan would also support same-sex marriage. Davis also spoke out on her half-brother’s piece, condemning it as ‘ugly.’ ‘It’s all such ugly stuff…But there are other people who feel this way and who lump gay people in with people who have sex with donkeys and farm animals. Scroll down for full audio . Speak for yourself: Nancy Reagan, pictured last year, is now 91; Davis said she wanted to be careful about speaking for her mother . ‘That is just horrific. Our father would in no way tolerate that kind of ugly talk and that kind of hateful speech.’ Davis was on the program to speak about her upcoming novel that is about a romance between lesbians, entitled ‘Till Human Voices Wake Us.’ Though Davis never spoke to her father about gay marriage before he died in 2004, Davis told the New York Times that he would have ‘been puzzled’ by the force with which government was intruding into people’s private lives. Davis herself has a complicated relationship with her mother, now 91. As the Huffington Post notes, the two were estranged for some time, only reconciling after former President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 1994. Earlier this month, Michael Reagan, a political consultant, called on church leaders to stand up and fight against same-sex marriage. 'It’s ultimately about changing the culture of the entire country,' he wrote in the Ironton Tribune. Dire warning: Michael Reagan, son of former U.S. President Ronald . Reagan, warned in an op-ed published earlier this month that legalizing gay marriage . will lead to 'polygamy, bestiality and perhaps even murder' Legalizing same-sex marriages, he writes, 'inevitably will lead to teaching our public school kids that gay marriage is a perfectly fine alternative and no different than traditional marriage.' 'There is also a very slippery slope leading to other alternative relationships and the unconstitutionality of any law based on morality,' he continues. 'Think about polygamy, bestiality, and perhaps even murder.' Michael Reagan slams the Republican Party, saying party leaders are too preoccupied with the next presidential election to be concerned about the moral threat that he believes same-sex marriages pose to the country. 'Where’s the moral outrage?' he asks. 'Why aren’t thousands of our pastors, priests and rabbis shouting from their pulpits? Why aren’t they leading their congregations through the streets in mass protest?'

The family of a college student who went missing two years ago have spoken of their heartbreak over her disappearance. Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished on June 3, 2011, following a night of partying with friends in downtown Bloomington, Indiana. There has been no sign of the young blonde woman for two years as her family have struggled with false leads and what they allege is a pact of silence among her friends. Missing: Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, 19, disappeared from Bloomington, Indiana, in June 2011. Police have few clues about her whereabouts . Desperate search: Charlene Spierer, left, has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter Lauren . Miss Spierer was due to graduate from Indiana University next month in apparel merchandising - a milestone which causes her parents further agony. This week her father Robert Spierer told Fox: 'We’re experiencing a terrible strain.We miss Lauren terribly and the not . knowing makes it all the worse for us. 'We think about her every day and . we talk about her every day. It’s not any easier today than it was two . years ago.' No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance. Human remains were recently found in a remote area of Indiana causing the Spierer family further fears. Autopsy results are expected next week. The search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When the investigation began, five of her male friends, who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully cooperating with police. Firefighters recently rebuilt the weathered signs spread across Bloomington that feature a photograph of the smiling 20-year-old. The 20 large, wooden-framed signs were erected after she banished in 2011. Firefighters in the college town also . are hanging new posters of Miss Spierer from Greenburgh, New York. Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating . Her mother, Charlene Spierer, thanked the firefighters in a letter for their efforts to keep Lauren’s image prominent in Bloomington. She also said in an email to The Herald-Times that while Lauren won’t be graduating, she will still 'have a presence in Bloomington'. 'Our one and only goal until we find Lauren is to be a reminder, to maintain awareness, to be Lauren’s voice with the hope of getting that one final lead which will allow us to bring our daughter home,' she said in her email. Bloomington firefighter Lee Chapman said that helping refurbish the signs urging people who might have information on her disappearance to contact authorities has brought him some personal solace. His 22-year-old son Robert died in a car accident after his first night on duty as a Bloomington Township firefighter. Chapman said the time he’s spent helping the Spierers 'has just kind of filled the void, where I would be thinking too much. At least I got closure on my end'.",The 20-year-old should be graduating from Indiana University next month .

If you, like millions of others, are seduced by Amazon deals when shopping for that shiny new kitchen appliance or camera, beware. It turns out that some of those tempting savings are not quite as good as advertised. The world’s largest online retailer and rivals Argos and Currys have been accused of making bogus claims of bargains on kitchen appliances and other electrical goods. Cheap: But Amazon is accused of exaggerating the savings it offers on many electrical appliances . All three boasted of big discounts on washing machines, cameras and irons – coaxing shoppers with savings on ‘original’ prices – but which actually offered little or no real saving. The Office of Fair Trading had already put retailers on notice, threatening legal action and fines over attempts to fool shoppers with fake price cuts. Now research by Which? has found a series of examples in which retailers apparently failed to play straight with families seeking value for money. The consumer champion tracked prices for more than five months at the three retailers, the UK’s biggest sellers of electrical and white goods. Bargain? A Canon Powershot camera similar to this one was said to be £130 cheaper than its RRP on Amazon, but in fact was just £30 less than normal . Deals: A Morphy Richards steam iron, left, and Zanussi washing machine, right, were also involved . It found some of the original prices they used as the benchmark for price-cut claims were long out of date. Some also used what they claimed was a recommended retail price for a kitchen appliance as the basis for the claim of a big price reduction. However, Which? found the true manufacturer’s recommended price was often lower – with the result the saving was less than claimed. For example, Amazon advertised a Canon Powershot camera for £198.86, which it claimed was a saving of £130.14 against the RRP of £329. In fact the manufacturer was selling the camera for £229, which meant the saving was a more modest £30.14. Misleading: Currys promised to investigate the anomalies unearthed by Which? magazine . Sale: Argos claimed an iron was on offer, but it was available from the manufacturer for the same price . Canon Powershot camera (sX260) - AmazonClaim: Sale price of £198.86- Save £130.14 on the RRP of £329Reality: Saving of £30.14 on the Canon price of £229 . Nikon Coolpix camera (s9300) -Amazon.Claim: Sale price of £179.99-£201.03 - Save £98.96-£120 on the RRP of £299.99Reality: RRP was £50 less at £249.99 . Zanussi washing machine (ZWc1301) - CurrysClaim: Save £88.99Reality: Original higher benchmark price had been charged more than a year earlier in 2011 . Morphy Richards eco steam iron (40625) - Argos Claim: Sale price of £29.99 - Save £10Reality: No saving on the £29.99 charged by Morphy Richards . Argos sold a Morphy Richards steam iron . for £29.99, which it claimed was a price cut of £10. But this ‘offer . price’ was actually the same as the manufacturer’s own retail price. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘When household budgets are squeezed it is unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case.’ Amazon said it has updated the RRP prices on the two cameras highlighted by Which?, and said it liaises with manufacturers to provide the most up to date information to shoppers. Currys thanked Which? and promised to investigate the price anomalies it highlighted. Argos said it ‘strongly refuted any suggestion that its deals are not genuine’. The firm said its offers fully comply with official guidance. OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell  said: ‘Shoppers should be able to trust that special offers and promotions really are bargains.’","Amazon, Argos and Currys advertised massive savings on appliances .

Miuccia Prada, the designer behind global fashion house Prada and its more playful line (inspired by her own style and nickname) Miu Miu, has defended of the high cost of the label's designs, calling those who disagree 'hypocrites'. One beaded jacket by Miu Miu costs nearly £3,000, an amount most people find hard to justify, but Miuccia says such hefty price tags simply reflect the cost of ethically producing high-quality products. She says those who demand high-quality and fair working conditions but low prices 'hypocrites'. Designer Miuccia Prada has defended her luxury brands' high price tags, saying they reflect the cost of producing high-quality goods in ethical working conditions... and those who disagree are 'hypocrites' Speaking to Women's Wear Daily (WWD), Miuccia said: ‘People [who] are intellectual leftists, they say I am expensive and horrible: ""How can you sell clothes at that price?"" Simply, it's the cost. 'If you pay people to do everything with the right system, things are expensive. And the same people that criticize the [dangerous production environments], when it comes to cost, they like the inexpensive pieces because they think it's more democratic. This is an example of hypocrisy.' Alongside her husband, Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli, Miuccia heads up the global conglomerate, which also owns labels Fendi, Helmut Lang, Jil Sander and Azzedine Alaia. A favorite with celebrities, a single pair of Prada shoes can cost upwards of £700, while handbags are often over £1000. Miuccia's defence of the company's cost - citing trying to create an ethical production line in which workers are treated fairly and materials source responsibly - echoes a sentiment across the fashion industry. Pieces by luxury fashion brand Prada can cost upwards of £3,000 each . Many high street brands, such as H&M, have brought out ethical ranges recently, reflecting a growing public awareness of exploitation within the industry. But less in keeping with public sentiments was Prada's spring 2013 collection, a line full of furs, a move which the enigmatic designer now admits was deliberate: 'Now, because they are so forbidden, there is a contradiction.' She also talks in the interview about her dislike of online shopping and e-commerce, into which most designers are rapidly expanding. Miuccia, who has a PhD in political science, says of Prada's decision to limit their online shopping presence: 'Yes, we don't like it. I don’t care.

"Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season . Name to be retired from its list of tropical storm names and replaced with 'Sara' The most names ever retired in one year was five in 2005, including Katrina and Rita . Sandy is the only name to be retired from 2012 . 2013 hurricane season begins on 1st June . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 18:06 EST, 12 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:11 EST, 12 April 2013 . It's a name the residents of New York and New Jersey will never forget, but rest assured there will never again will there be a hurricane called 'Sandy'. The hurricane which struck the Northeastern United States with devastating impact last October was the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. At least 285 people were killed along the path of the storm in seven countries. Hurricane Sandy: Although the damage has not been fully calculated, estimates put it well in excess of $50 billion . The damage was particularly severe in New Jersey and New York. The storm surge hit New York City on 29th October 2012 flooding streets, tunnels, subway lines and cutting power in and around the city. Preliminary estimates suggest the damage in the US alone is likely to be well over $50 billion. The final figures will be released later this year. Sandy has been retired from the official list of Atlantic Basin tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization’s hurricane committee. Enormous: Sandy was a Cat. 3 storm when it made landfall in Cuba and a Cat. 2 storm off the coast of the US. The storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record spanning 1,100 miles . Damage: Winds were only part of Sandy's devastating impact - the floodwater was also extremely damaging as the hurricane made landfall along the New Jersey shore. Parts of the state were flooded and without power for days . It now joins a so-called 'hall of fame' for retired hurricane names - a move that usually only occurs when the damage is particularly extreme. Storm names are reused every six years for both the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific basins. Meteorologists use six alphabetical lists of names that alternate between male and female names. One set is used per year and the sets are recycled in the same order. However, if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of the name would be insensitive or confusing, the WMO hurricane committee may retire the name. Clean-up: Months on the clean-up continues where large section of the iconic boardwalk was washed away in the heavily damaged Rockaway neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City . Battered: Coastal communities like this one in Queens were torn apart by Sandy's devastatingly strong winds and storm surge. Thousands were left without heat and power for weeks . Sandy was a classic late-season hurricane in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The cyclone made landfall as a category 1 hurricane in Jamaica, and as a 115 mph category 3 hurricane in eastern Cuba. Hurricane Sandy merged with a second winter storm hours before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey. Its size and strength caused catastrophic damage all along the mid-Atlantic shoreline. Sandy was the second costliest hurricane to hit the United States since Katrina in 2005. Switched off then struck off: Sandy saw half of Manhattan without power for days. It's destruction was so severe, the name 'Sandy' is being removed from the list of approved hurricane names . Sandy is the 77th name to be retired . from the Atlantic list since 1954 and was the only name retired for . 2012. The name will be replaced with 'Sara' beginning in 2018. In 2011, Irene was the only name taken off the list. The . 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs 1 June – 30 November, will . use a set last used in 2007. It begins with 'Andrea' and ends with . 'Wendy'. The sets are only 21 names long without names for names beginning with Q, U, X, Y and Z. If there are more than 21 storms in a season, storms are named after the letters of the Greek alphabet. The Atlantic Hurricane season begins on 1st June and lasts until 30th November.","Sandy was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season .

Two NFL draft prospects who left the bathroom of their Indianapolis hotel room covered in urine and feces during a scouting event in February have been identified as Clemson's DeAndre Hopkins and Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison, league sources told ESPN. A report emerged over the weekend revealing that the staff at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Downtown discovered urine and feces in the bathroom, found the bathroom mirror matted with toothpaste and had to clean up leftover food discarded on one of the beds. The hotel manager photographed the repulsive scene and sent photographs to National Football Scouting president Jeff Foster, who confirmed the embarrassing incident but failed to identify the instigators. Scroll down for video. Claims: NFL sources allege Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, left at the Chick-fil-A Bowl in Dec., and Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison, right in Sep., were responsible for the disgusting hotel room . Scene: The two men were roommates for three nights in a room at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Downtown . A report published on Monday described the appalling state of the room, located on the first floor of the hotel, but did not identify the occupants of the room. On Thursday, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter tweeted the identity of the players, citing NFL sources who have not been named. Hopkins, who has been rumored to be a late first-round draft pick, and Harrison did share a room for their nights at the event but have denied any wrongdoing. The football league hosts the week-long combine every year in February at the Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis. Draft prospects strut their athletic prowess before NFL coaches, general managers and scouts in anticipation of the NFL draft in April. The 2013 NFL Scouting Combine was held from February 20 - 26. Show: The scouting combine, held each year at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, is an opportunity for draft prospects to demonstrate their athletic ability for coaches and scouts . Just one hour after identifying DeAndre . Hopkins and Mark Harrison as the alleged perpetrators, Mr Schefter posted a follow-up message on Thursday night saying, 'NFL . sources said they are convinced that Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison . is not responsible for the trashed hotel room.' Rutgers' former Head Coach Kyle Flood also issued a statement to Schefter defending his player. 'I've been on a lot of road trips and . we’ve never had a single disciplinary issue with him,' Mr Flood said. 'He’s a model of . the type of person we want here at Rutgers. It would be so out of . character to be involved in this that I just cannot imagine under any . circumstance that it would happen and involve him.' Mr Flood then retweeted the message from Schefter that cast doubt on the accusations implicating Mr Harrison . Draft prospect: Mark Harrison, left: at 2013 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium on February 24, and right: with his agent Ed Wasielewski during the event. His agent denied Harrison was involved in the hotel room incident . His agent, Ed Wasielewski, also has denied Harrison was involved. 'My client completely denies having anything to do with the hotel incident,' he said. According to Mr Wasielewski's Twitter profile he was in Indianapolis for the week of the combine event in Indianapolis. Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has also denied he was involved in any shenanigans, in an interview with FOXSports on Thursday. He claims he checked out of the hotel room before Harrison and said the hotel room was fine when he left. 'I got done before Mark Harrison, so I was already packed. I already took a shower and packed and everything.' DeAndre Hopkins, of Clemson, during the 2013 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium on February 24 . 'Mark came in and we spoke for at least 20 minutes about the Combine. Then the bellman came in and helped me get my bags out. And I left. That’s honestly all I can say.' He says he doubts that Harrison had anything to do with the incident. 'I say check the [security] cameras, that’s the best way that you’re going to get the answer. Check the cameras and check the timing of everything.' Requests for comment placed to the NFL and to the NFL's Scouting Combine were not returned. In the travel information page on the .

A representative from the hotel told . the MailOnline that they would not comment or elaborate on anything . having to do with the Scouting Combine. National Football Scouting president Jeff Foster confirmed the shocking incident to Yahoo reporter Jason Cole earlier this week. 'I can confirm that a room was left in an inappropriate condition and we're disappointed by both players who occupied the room,' he said. 'There was no material damage to the room; otherwise we would be pursuing further action and really be trying to get to the bottom of the situation. It's just very disappointing, and the people we feel the worst for are the people at the Crowne Plaza who had to clean it up.' Mr Foster reportedly warned all participants at the event to be on their best behavior and to keep in mind that all their movements during their week in Indianapolis would be observed. Both agents for the players had called Foster after the incident was reported, in order to deny the allegations. One unnamed NFL coach reportedly told ESPN he was extremely disappointed to hear about the allegations involving Hopkins. League sources have said such an incident could greatly damage a prospect's chances at the upcoming draft.","Hotel bathroom found covered in urine and feces, with toothpaste matted onto the mirror and discarded food on the bed .

Not content with becoming David Beckham's official purveyor of pants, Swedish high street giant H&M has announced that it is to dress the Swedish Olympic and Paralympic teams. Set to form part of the brand's extensive new sportswear range, the collection will make its debut during the Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi next year. In addition to leisure and sportswear, which will be available to buy from January 2014, H&M will also produce the outfits for the Opening and Closing ceremonies. Vision: H&M's patriotic designs for Team Sweden mirror the country's blue and yellow flag . Stars: Ice skating sisters, Viktoria and Joshi Helgesson, and biathlete David Ekholm will star in the campaign . Athletes who will feature in the initial campaign include ice skating sisters, Viktoria and Joshi Helgesson, and biathlete, David Ekholm. 'It is such an honour for H&M to dress both the Swedish Olympians and Paralympians for the upcoming Games in Sochi and Rio,' said Ann-Sofie Johansson, H&M’s head of design. 'The designs will bring together sport and fashion in a totally new way and have Swedish heritage as a proud influence on the collection.' 'I am very pleased to announce this long-term partnership with H&M, starting with H&M equipping the Swedish Olympic team for the Winter Games in Sochi 2014,' added Stefan Lindeberg, chairman of the Swedish Olympic Committee. 'H&M’s approach is innovative and exciting, involving a group of our athletes in the design process. We are proud to be working with H&M, a Swedish brand which is known throughout the world.' Although the collection is a first for H&M, it isn't the first time that an Olympic squad has turned to a high street retailer for clothes. At the 2012 Olympics, Team GB wore gold and white tracksuits by Next to the Opening Ceremony, although the rest of the kit was designed by Stella McCartney. High street heaven: Team GB wore gold and white tracksuits by Next to the opening of the 2012 games .

The majority of Olympic teams, however, have chosen not to embrace the high street, with Team USA continuing to work with Polo Ralph Lauren and Italy with Giorgio Armani. The Jamaican team wear outfits designed by Bob Marley's daughter Cedella while the French, true to form, roped in Hermes to create beautifully tailored jackets for their equestrian team. Far more down to earth is the Netherlands, whose bright orange kit was created for them by sportswear giant Nike. While H&M may not have the cache of Hermes and Armani, the athletes who will be donning the new kit have declared themselves 'really happy' about the decision to go high street. 'To represent our country wearing clothes from a Swedish company will strengthen the team, our team spirit and image to the outside world, especially when it is an internationally renowned brand like H&M,' says Anja Pärson, former alpine skier and multiple Olympic champion.

Rhode Island's tallest building will soon be its most visible symbol of the state's Kryptonite - long economic decline. The 26-story Art Deco-style skyscraper, known to some as the 'Superman building' for its similarity to the Daily Planet headquarters in the old TV show, is losing its sole tenant this month. No one is moving in, and the building, the most distinctive feature on the Providence skyline, will no longer be fully illuminated at night, if at all, its owner says. Going dark: The 26-story Art Deco-style skyscraper, known to some as the 'Superman building' for its similarity to the Daily Planet headquarters in the old TV show, is losing its sole tenant this month . Namesake: The skyscraper is known to some as the 'Superman building' for its similarity to the Daily Planet headquarters in the old TV show . It's a blow for the city and the state, which had 9.4 per cent unemployment in February and has had one of the worst jobless rates in the nation for years. Nicolas Retsinas, a senior lecturer in real estate at Harvard Business School, says 111 Westminster, as the building is also known, will be 'the ultimate urban pothole.' At 428 feet, or about one-third the height of the Empire State Building, it was the tallest skyscraper in New England when it opened in 1928 as the Industrial National Bank Building. It has housed a bank ever since. That 85-year run will end when Bank of America ends its lease for the building's entire 380,000 square feet and completes its move into more modern space nearby in the coming days. The bank most recently occupied only about 20 percent of the building, says Bill Fischer, a spokesman for its owner, High Rock Development of Newton, Massachusetts. Disappointment: The loss of the building's final tenant is a blow for the city and the state, which had 9.4 per cent unemployment in February and has had one of the worst jobless rates in the nation for years . High Rock says it does not want to use it as offices. The building represents such a large share of downtown office space, Fischer says, that it would flood the market to do that. Instead, High Rock wants to turn it into about 290 apartments. But the company has offered no timetable for the project or said how much it might cost. High Rock says it will need to persuade state lawmakers to revive a program that gives tax credits for rehabilitating historic buildings. Vacant: Bank of America is set to end its lease for the building's entire 380,000 square feet and completes its move into more modern space nearby in the coming days . Mayor Angel Taveras says he is disappointed the skyscraper will be vacant and he will do what he can to make sure it has a productive use. But he hasn't committed himself to any specific course of action. In the meantime, the Superman building will stand dark and empty. That's a mistake, says Retsinas, who lives in Providence. He likens the significance of the building in Providence to the Empire State Building in New York. 'Buildings like that are also advertisements about the city. It's sending a signal to the rest of the city that we're willing to write off this building,' he says. Rather than turning off the lights and letting it sit empty, Retsinas suggests a phased transition: keeping the lights on and possibly putting something in on the ground floor. In Detroit, which is hurting much more than Providence and has many more vacant large buildings, the government has worked to find tenants for some empty properties. For example, the state moved some of its offices into General Motors' old corporate headquarters after GM moved out. Rhode Island Gov Lincoln Chafee last year suggested the state move employees into the Superman building, but that idea has gone nowhere. Washington, D.C., has gone further. It taxes vacant and blighted properties at a higher rate, giving property owners a disincentive to sit on an empty building as they wait for a turnaround in the market or try to extract something such as tax breaks. Rhode Island was once a manufacturing powerhouse and is still covered with old mill buildings, but many are vacant or have been turned into housing or office space. The state has struggled over the past 25 years or so to make the transition to a service and information economy. Set in stone? Rhode Island was once a manufacturing powerhouse and is still covered with old mill buildings, but many are vacant or have been turned into housing or office space . The most recent attempt was a $75million state loan guarantee handed out in 2010 to a video game company started by former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling. The company declared bankruptcy last year, leaving taxpayers on the hook. Given that debacle, it is unclear whether lawmakers have the appetite to grant what could be tens of millions of dollars in tax credits to get the Superman building back up and running, even given its significance to the state. Brown University sits atop the city's College Hill and overlooks the skyscraper. Mike McCormack, an architect and assistant vice president for planning at the Ivy League school, says downtown is filled with beautiful, historic buildings, but the city needs to figure out how to 'reoccupy' it. 'There needs to be life on the street. People have to walk around and feel like there's energy,' he says. 'Then it encourages investment, it encourages entrepreneurs.'","The 26-story skyscraper is known as the 'Superman building' due to its similarity to the Daily Planet in the old Superman TV series .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:48 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 20 March 2013 . Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford advanced on Tuesday to a runoff in the Republican contest for an open congressional seat, taking a step toward reviving a political career that was derailed by an extramarital affair while he was governor. 'Are you ready to change things in Washington?' Sanford, flanked by his four sons, asked a boisterous crowd at a restaurant in Charleston's historic district. 'I'm incredibly humbled by the outpouring of support we have seen tonight.' Success: Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford celebrated his win with his four sons at a restaurant in Charleston's historic district on Tuesday night . With all precincts reporting, unofficial results show Sanford received about 37 per cent of the vote in the southern coastal district. It was unclear who he would face in the April 2 GOP runoff. Former Charleston County councilman Curtis Bostic held a slim lead over state Sen. Larry Grooms for second place. But the margin is so narrow, less than one percent, that it will trigger an automatic recount. Teddy Turner, the son of media mogul Ted Turner, trailed Bostic and Grooms. The eventual Republican candidate will square off in the May 7 general election against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of comedian Stephen Colbert. She won the Democratic primary for the seat, handily defeating perennial candidate Ben Frasier. 'My pledge is to you. You are my only cause. I will fight to improve your lives and the lives of your children,' Colbert Busch told supporters across town. Tuesday was Sanford's first run for office since a 2009 scandal in which he acknowledged an affair. After disappearing and telling his staff he was out hiking the Appalachian Trail, he returned to the state to reveal that he was in Argentina with a woman he later become engaged to after divorcing his wife, Jenny. She briefly weighed a bid for the congressional seat herself but decided against it. Sanford is now engaged to his former mistress Maria Belen Chapur, an Argentine journalist. Mark Sanford, who vied against 15 other Republican candidates on Tuesday, said it was 'a treat and a blessing' to be back on the ballot. Resurrection: Mark Sanford was one of the Republican frontrunners for South Carolina's first congressional race . The 1st Congressional District seat . became vacant last year when Republican Gov. Nikki Haley appointed . then-U.S. Rep. Tim Scott to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Republican . Jim DeMint, who resigned to head The Heritage Foundation. Wearing a gray windbreaker, Sanford . walked alone up the street and up a flight of stairs to the building . with the polling place in Charleston's historic district. He represented . the district in Congress from 1994 to 2000, before he was elected . governor. 'Casting your . vote wasn't that hard,' he laughed, but then added, 'It's a very . significant race for me in a lot of different ways.' Sanford said after voting that life can be a series of course corrections. 'We all hope for a second chance. I . believe in a God of second chances,' Sanford said. 'On a professional . level, we have had a couple of months to talk about the issues. In that . regard it has been a treat and a blessing.' Sanford, who spent months apologizing . to groups around the state after he revealed his affair, said when he . announced for his old congressional seat that the apology tour was over. Known for his frugality as both a . congressman and governor, he has been spending the campaign talking . about getting the nation's fiscal house in order. Helping hand: Stephen Colbert helped campaign for his sister Elizabeth Colbert Busch in Charleston last month . Big money: Teddy Turner (seen left), is the son of former CNN owner Ted Turner (right), ran against Sanford . With Sanford's campaign war chest and name recognition, Tuesday's race was largely for second place. Minutes . before Sanford voted, state Rep. Chip Limehouse cast his ballot at the . same polling place. Limehouse, who spent almost $500,000 on the race, . said he was sure Sanford would make the runoff and hoped he would be in . second place. 'Purely by name ID, the governor has an advantage going into today. I'm not sure that goes past today,' he said. Before finishing fourth, Turner was optimistic after voting at an armory in nearby Mount Pleasant. 'This race has been exciting all . along because we started at zero,' said Turner, making his first run for . political office. 'We have made our way as high as you can go in this . race because you're not going to pass Sanford in the primary.' For Colbert Busch, the race was the fulfillment of a dream she has had since a young child. 'What an incredible opportunity. God . bless America that we can do this,' she said earlier Tuesday, adding . that if she won, she would have two weeks to concentrate on the campaign . while the Republicans in the runoff battle each other. 'That is a real . advantage.' Turnout was low, as expected in a special primary. The general election is set for May 7. The congressional vacancy was left by . Republican Tim Scott, who was appointed to replace Republican Jim DeMint . in the U.S. Senate after he resigned last December to head the Heritage . Foundation, a conservative think tank. The . district, which was redrawn after the 2010 Census, takes in the city of . Charleston and parts of four nearby rural counties and stretches south . along the coast to include wealthy Hilton Head Island. Sanford, . who held the congressional seat from 1995 to 2001, spent Monday in the . Charleston area at businesses and at campaign stops on Tuesday . in Charleston.

Sanford has been pointing to his record of 'standing up to big spenders, regardless of party,' his campaign said. As governor, he carried two squealing piglets, named 'Pork' and 'Barrel,' into the Statehouse in Columbia to protest the state's budget deficit. He was the first governor to formally reject federal stimulus money, his campaign said. In 2009, the state Supreme Court ordered him to accept $700 million in stimulus funds.

Charges: Fergus Shanahan, executive editor and former deputy editor of The Sun, will face magistrates following allegations of corruption and illegal payments to public officials . An executive at The Sun, who was a deputy to Rebekah Brooks when she was editor, is be charged over alleged payments of £7,000 to a public official, it was revealed today. Fergus Shanahan, 56, is accused of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office between August 2006 and August 2007. The Crown Prosecution Service said today he will appear before Westminster Magistrates on May 8. Scotland Yard officers from its corruption probe, Operation Elveden, have been investigating him. Former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were told last month that they will face trial in September next year over alleged illegal payments to public officials. Prosecutors believe Mr Shanahan, who was deputy editor from 2003 to 2009 when Ms Brooks was editor, allowed a journalist to make two payments totalling £7,000 to a public official in 2006 and 2007. The 56-year-old is The Sun's Executive Editor and leader writer, crafting the comment pieces that appear under paper's name every day. He was previously night editor and worked on the 'back bench' in production, having started out on the Reading Evening News. The announcement was made by Alison Levitt, QC, who oversees CPS decision making and all potential prosecutions in relation to the ongoing phone hacking investigations and other related matters. 'Following a careful review of the evidence, we have concluded that Fergus Shanahan, who served as an Editor at the Sun newspaper, should be charged with an offence of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office,' she said.

A fortnight ago the crime editor of The Sun was told he would face no further action after he was arrested as part of Scotland Yard's investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials. Mike Sullivan, 49, was held under Operation Elveden on January 28 last year. The journalist, who was arrested at the same time as three other current and former journalists from the tabloid, welcomed the decision. He said: 'I feel sadness that colleagues are still in the same predicament over the last 14 months, but hopefully they will find a successful resolution.' Ongoing cases involve four former police officers, six journalists and two other public officials. Former deputy editor of The Sun, Geoff Webster, 53, was last month charged with paying out a total of £8,000 to public officials in exchange for leaked information. The official in the first charge cannot be identified for legal reasons, and the second was unidentified but is understood to have been either a member of the Armed Forces or a Ministry of Defence employee.

The poll - conducted by money-saving website CouponCodes4u - asked 2,135 adult females in the U.S. with full-time jobs: 'Would you prefer to work for a living, or be a ""lady of leisure"" and have your partner look after you financially?' While it found that the majority - 55per cent - would prefer to keep their careers, more than a third said they would rather be looked after by their other halves. A step back for feminism? A study has found that 32per cent of women in the U.S. would prefer to rely on their partner for money rather than work for a living . The remaining 13per cent of the women polled said they were unsure of their preference.

'I am so grateful it went past Scarlett. Scarlett was fine, and I don't think she even noticed, but I could not see her. The first I knew about it was when it bounced off the oven behind me. 'I don't want to be shut up in my house forever as a result of this, and luckily it is very unusual. My garage door was open so the fox had a clear path through the house. Usually I do not have both doors open. 'It was a very rare chain of events, and I just can't believe it really.

'People should be aware though because some people feed these foxes and they get very tame.' David North, head of people and wildlife at Norfolk Wildlife Trust, said fox attacks were very rare. But he warned that people should be wary of feeding urban foxes and taming them. Mr North said: 'Foxes are not really a significant threat.

Damages: Captain Francesco Schettino is being sued for 80million euros following the Costa Concordia disaster . With its pristine waters and sandy beaches, it was once considered among the Mediterranean’s most beautiful unsung holiday destinations. Now Giglio, the island blighted by the Costa Concordia shipwreck, is suing the ship’s disgraced captain saying its image has been ‘irreparably damaged’ by the cruise ship tragedy. Lawyers for the tiny islet are seeking damages of 80million euro. Captain Francesco Schettino was at the command of the Concordia cruise liner when it slammed into reef off the island in January last year, killing 32 people. The accident was the worst maritime disaster in Italy since the Second World War. Commanders had allegedly attempted a ‘sail past salute’ when the ship hit reef tearing a massive hole in its belly. Criminal proceedings against Schettino, dubbed Captain Coward and Captain Calamity, began today in Grosseto, Tuscany. Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandonment of post before the evacuation of all 4,200 passengers and crew. Giglio's municipality is seeking to be made a civil plaintiff in the trial, because of the ‘irreparable damage’ to their own identity, its tourism industry and its image, which it says is now destined to be associated with the tragedy. The legal petition demanded damages of at least 80 million euros. Alessandro Maria Lecce, the lawyer hired by the island Giglio, told the Daily Mail: ‘The damages we request are for the citizens who have not been able to lead a normal life since the wreck, the local council which has been unable to do anything but handle the crisis.

But when people talk of Giglio they talk of nothing but the Concordia tragedy, the shipwreck and the dead. ‘It’s destroyed tourism-the livelihood of the island.’ The semi-submerged ship has not yet been removed. Schettino said nothing as he arrived for the preliminary hearing looking tanned and relaxed, although his lawyer said he was ‘focused as always.’ Today the owner of the Costa Concordia also asked the court to consider it a victim of the disaster. Costa . Crociere Spa made the request during the opening of a preliminary . hearing into the sinking and whether to issue indictments against the . captain and crew.

Web users have turned into detectives in the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy, looking through hundreds of photos to find the person or group behind Monday's carnage. As authorities conduct an exhaustive investigation of the moments leading up to the double bombing near the finish line, Reddit and 4chan users are doing one of their own - pointing out people at the site of the first bombing whom they think the FBI should be talking to. There is, however, no official evidence to support that the individuals pictured had anything to do with the devastating twin bombing, which claimed three lives and injured 183 others. The claims are merely speculation, and not considered viable evidence in the Boston . and federal investigation. Meanwhile, CNN reported that a suspect has been identified by police after two pieces of video evidence at the scene of the second blast were handed in to authorities. Scroll down for video . Is this the suspect? People on Reddit have . claimed that while everyone around him seems to instinctively cower, . this man appears to sprint away in the opposite direction to everyone . else caught in the blast . Another look: Two men donning similar black coats, khaki pants and backpacks were also pictured, but they could also be undercover police officers . However, it is hard to see how the men identified by the Reddit users fit the description of the suspect leaked to other media outlets. CNN's John King said sources told him it was a 'dark-skinned man' and CBS reported that it was a white man who was wearing a black jacket, a gray hooded sweatshirt and a white or off-white baseball cap backwards. He is said to be six feet or 6-feet-2-inches tall with a medium build. Investigators have not named any suspects in the bombing, but have revealed that two pressure cooker bombs were stuffed inside black vinyl backpacks or duffel bags when they went off. Using that information and numerous photos - mainly from the site of the first blast - users have pointed out several people either wearing black backpacks or otherwise individuals who could be thought to be acting strangely before the explosions. The people are circled and their movements are documented by comparing several photographs in a subreddit called 'FINDBOSTONBOMBERS.' The person who started the subreddit, who goes by the moniker Oops777, has been identified as a 23-year-old professional poker player who lives in Boston, according to reports. The FBI's Boston office did not return a call from MailOnline for comment. Bird's eye view: It's possible that this man is an undercover police officer, but redditors claim that he may be involved . In one series of photos, one . internet user marks a face the crowd two hours prior to the bombing, and . then his reaction afterward, noting that the man, wearing a white . hooded sweatshirt, does not appear interested in the race and can be . seen walking away calmly after the first blast. While . some posts may be perceived as accusatory, other users are quick to . warn that just because the person is pictured with a black bag, it . doesn't mean they had anything to do with the bombing. Spotted: One user marks a face the crowd two hours prior to the bombing, and then his reaction afterward, noting that the man, wearing a white hooded sweatshirt, does not appear interested in the race .

Next to it is a photo of a mangled backpack from the crime scene, with straps that bear a striking resemblance. Another man, wearing a green hat and wearing a black backpack, was also highlighted on Reddit as a person who could be involved. The Boston Marathon was a public event, and hundreds of black backpacks were worn among the thousands of attendees. Hunt for clues: Another man, wearing a green hat and wearing a black backpack, was also highlighted on Reddit as a person who could be involved . But at the very least, it gives people a . glimpse of the excruciating job the FBI have in scouring through . thousands of images in a situation where anyone can look like a suspect. Yesterday, a preliminary probe by Boston officials revealed that they were made of two 1.6-gallon pressure cookers - one containing shards of metal and ball bearings and the other packed with nails - and both stuffed into black backpacks or duffel bags, according to a source close to the probe. The method used to make the bomb is reminiscent of the failed attempt to bomb Times Square by Faisal Shahzad in 2010 - and other terror strikes in India, Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan. The FBI and anti-terror officials have urged the public to turn in any photos or video footage they may have of the marathon that may have captured a suspect or suspects before the blasts. Descriptions: Picking out people from the crowd, the web sleuths comment on their behavior before the bombs went off . Ben Levine, who works in public relations in an office on Boylston Street and was directly above where the first bomb exploded, responded to that call. In a piece he wrote for Deadspin, . Mr Levine said that he was standing at his second floor office window . and snapping pictures of the runners and crowds below when 'a bomb went . off in my face.' Investigators have circulated . information about the bombs, which involved kitchen pressure cookers . packed with explosives, nails and other lethal shrapnel – but the FBI . says no on has claimed responsibility. 'Someone . knows who did this,' Richard DesLauriers, FBI agent in charge in . Boston, said at a news conference where he detailed the type of clues a . bomber might have left. 'Importantly, the person who did this is someone's friend, neighbor, co-worker or relative.' Accusations: In a photo posted on both 4chan and Reddit, a man wearing a blue coat is pictured with a backpack - with distinctive black and grey straps - dangling on his arm. A bag with similar straps is pictured at the scene of one of the bombings . Claims: As the FBI scours through thousands of photos of the moments before the Boston Marathon, various Reddit and 4chan users are pointing out who they believe to be possible suspects . Speculation: In this photo, the Redditors claim that a man can be seen dropping a suspicious object near the scene of the second explosion . New crime scene photographs of the remnants of the first bomb which detonated during Monday's Boston marathon shows that a six-liter pressure cooker was used in at least one of the deadly charges - as experts described the devices as military-style 'anti-personnel' devices. The images - released by the Joint . Terrorist Task Force - show the wreckage of a stainless steel pressure . cooker with an Underwriters Laboratory safety mark and an imprint that . reads gas or electric, with experts describing the devices as . military-style 'anti-personnel' devices. Furthermore, it is being claimed the . deadly devices used were designed to act like 'homemade claymores' - . powerful, directional anti-personnel devices. The . lid of a pressure cooker was found on a nearby rooftop and . investigators were able to pinpoint which type of cooker was used. Probe: Investigators comb through the post finish line area of the Boston Marathon at Boylston Street, two days after two bombs exploded just before the finish line . One brand of pressure cooker with '6L' on the bottom is made by the Spanish company Fagor, which sells about 50,000 of the six-liter pots in the United States every year, The New York Times reported. This gives investigators a real chance to narrow down their list of suspects - which they said yesterday was 'wide open' - and find out who is responsible for the worst attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11. They will use every clue, from the cooker's manufacturer and retailers to the types of nails used in the shrapnel, to try and find out from where the bomb parts were purchased and by whom. Roy Parker, a retired Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent who ­developed the agency’s explosives training program, said examiners are looking at scraps of the bomb components, bags and all other forensic evidence. He said: 'You’re looking for a needle in a haystack, but the needle is there. If you look long enough, you’ll get stuck with it. This is not an unsolvable crime.'","Internet users turn detectives as they go through photographs from Boston Marathon to find anyone who may be involved .

Unexpected: Gun violence and obesity are two of the top factors that cause America to have a lower life expectancy than other wealthy nations . The United States has far more violent deaths than any other wealthy nation in part because there are so many residents who own guns and store them in unlocked places in their homes. The lax gun rules are a major contributor to the low life expectancy rate that Americans have compared to their global counterparts. A new report reveals that of the 17 wealthiest countries, American males have the lowest life expectancy of 75.6 years and their female counterparts are the second lowest in the rankings coming in at 80.7 years. The blame placed on guns comes just weeks after the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and as politicians make calls for stricter gun controls. The United States has about six violent deaths per 100,000 residents and none of the 16 other countries included in the review came anywhere close to that ratio. Finland was closest to the U.S. ranking with slightly more than two violent deaths per 100,000 residents. 'With lives and dollars at stake, the United States cannot afford to ignore this problem,' said the report from the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine. The . researchers said there is little evidence that violent acts occur more . frequently in the United States than elsewhere. It's the lethality of . those attacks that stands out. ‘One . behavior that probably explains the excess lethality of violence and . unintentional injuries in the United States is the widespread possession . of firearms and the common practice of storing them (often unlocked) at . home. The statistics are dramatic,’ the report said. For . example, the United States has the highest rate of firearm ownership . among peer countries — 89 civilian-owned firearms for every 100 . Americans, and the U.S. is home to about 35 to 50 per cent of the . world's civilian-owned firearms, the report noted. Congress . is taking a renewed look at gun legislation, but the researchers said . in a conference call they were just as concerned about factors that have . nothing to do with guns, such as the high prevalence of illness among . teenagers and young adults. Taking action: Vice President Joe Biden met with the committee that is debating possible ways to tighten gun control throughout the country in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre . Global: Though all of the wealthier countries throughout the world have high life expectancies, but America's rate has been going down throughout the years because of health problems . While . 2012 was a particularly shocking year in terms of mass shootings- with . the movie theatre shooting in Aurora, Colorado that left 12 people dead . and 58 injured, and more recently 26 people were killed at the Newtown, . Connecticut massacre- Americans have been dying younger than their . global counterparts for years. In addition to the impact of gun violence, Americans consume the most calories among peer countries and get involved in more accidents that involve alcohol. Slight improvement: Though the U.S. life expectancy rate does not match up well world-wide, it does show an increase compared to itself . The U.S. also suffers higher rates of drug-related deaths, infant mortality and AIDS. The result is that the life expectancy for men in the United States ranked the lowest among the 17 countries reviewed, at 75.6 years, while the life expectancy for U.S. women ranked second lowest at 80.7 years. The other 16 countries that were reviewed in the study by two of the nation's leading health research institutions included Canada, Japan, Australia and much of Western Europe. The nation's health disadvantages have economic consequences as they lead to higher costs for consumers and taxpayers as well as a workforce that remains less healthy than that of other high-income countries. ‘With lives and dollars at stake, the United States cannot afford to ignore this problem,’ said the report from the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine. In attempting to explain why Americans are so unhealthy, the researchers looked at three categories: the nation's health care system, harmful behaviors and social and economic conditions. Researchers noted that the U.S. has a large uninsured population compared to other countries with comparable economies, and more limited access to primary care. And although the income of Americans is higher on average than that of other wealthy countries, the United States also has a higher level of poverty, especially among children.","Lax gun security and poor healthcare contribute to low American ranking .

Google's search engine - the world's most influential gateway to online information and commerce - enjoys a near-monopoly in Europe. The major concession offered by Google is widely expected to center on more clearly labeling search results stemming from its own services such as YouTube, Google Maps or its shopping search function.

Four Navy officers of the USS Guardian, which ran aground on a Philippines protected coral reef, have been relieved of their duties, U.S. officials say. Initial findings showed that the men, including their commanding officer, had not followed standard procedure, according to a Navy statement. The U.S. could face a fine of more than $2 million for damaging the Tubbataha Reef, which is a Unesco World Heritage site, the report shows. The four officers have been reassigned while investigations continue. Mess up: Initial findings showed that the men, including their commanding officer, had not followed standard procedure, according to a Navy statement . Potential damages: The US could face a fine of more than $2 million for damaging the Tubbataha Reef, which is a Unesco World Heritage site . The USS Guardian struck the reef south-east of Palawan island on January 17. The last piece of the mine countermeasures ship was lifted out of a reef in the Philippines last Saturday. After the vessel ran aground the Navy was left with no other option than to cut the ship into pieces to remove it from the water. The final section of the hull, which weighs about 250 tons, was removed from the reef by the U.S. salvage ship Jascon 25. ‘As the hull has been removed, the . team is now shifting their effort to collecting minor debris that . remains on the reef,’ Supervisor of Salvage, Captain Mark Matthews told . news channel WTKR. ‘We also have a collaborative team from the U.S. and the Philippines beginning to assess the condition of the reef,’ he said.

Final piece: The last piece of the former USS Guardian mine countermeasures ship was lifted out of a reef in the Philippines on Saturday, March 30 . Over the past two months the Navy has been working to salvage any reusable equipment from the vessel and remove any potentially harmful materials such as petroleum-based products and human wastewater. ‘Every salvage operation presents unique challenges. It has been difficult to extract the Guardian without causing further damage to the reef, but the U.S. Navy and SMIT salvage team with support from other companies and the government of the Philippines have really done a superb job,’ said Matthews. ‘I could not be more proud,’ he added. No fuel has leaked since the grounding and all of the approximately 15,000 gallons aboard Guardian were safely transferred off the ship in the early days of the salvage operation. 'We continue to work closely with the Philippine Coast Guard, Navy, and Tubbataha Reef Park Rangers, and we are grateful for the support we have received to remove Guardian and minimize further damage to the reef,’ Matthews told the news channel. Several other ships, including the USNS Safeguard, the SMIT Borneo, the Trabajador, the Intrepid, and the Archon Tide joined the Jascon 25 to assist in the clean-up operation.

She is the niece of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, while he is touted as one of the most outstanding England batsmen of his generation, whose cricketer grandfather remains an icon to lovers of the game. Stepping out for the first time as a couple this week, Lady Kitty Spencer and Nick Compton – grandson of the legendary Denis - made a dazzling couple – impossibly good looking, blue-eyed, tousled blondes. And far from being concerned that Kitty might have inherited her family’s marital curse (her father, Earl Spencer, has of late married his third wife and fathered his seventh child), Nick’s family have welcomed her with open arms. Kitty Spencer and boyfriend Nick Compton have kept their romance under wraps until now, but Nick's mother says it began last year . The pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at Lord's last week in their first public confirmation of their romance . Speaking exclusively to Mail Online from her home in Durban, South Africa, the mother of the 29-year-old sports star, who was England’s leading run scorer last year and was this week named by Wisden as their cricketer of the year, described Prince William’s pretty cousin as ‘bright, funny, down-to-earth – without any airs and graces’. British-born Glynis Compton, a newspaper sub-editor, revealed that the pair had been dating since September last year and Lady Kitty, 22, had already flown over to meet her and husband Richard. For his part, Nick who was born in South Africa but educated at upper-crust English public school Harrow, has visited the Spencer’s ancestral home, Althorp in Northamptonshire, and told his parents that he was ‘blown away’. ‘He said it was unbelievable….magnificent,’ Mrs Compton said. Spirited aristocratic beauty Kitty was raised in Cape Town after her mother, former model Victoria Lockwood’s, marriage to Earl Spencer acrimoniously broke down in the face of his infidelity as well as her own eating disorder and battles with alcohol and drug addictions. Ironically, however, Kitty, who has been named as one of the eligible girls in the country by society bible Tatler, and Nick did not meet until she came to England last year to study for an MA in luxury brand management. The pair were introduced by a mutual friend from Cape Town and hit it off straight away, exchanging flirty messages on the social networking site Twitter with Lady Kitty teasingly calling her new man ‘granddad’ due to their seven-year age gap. Kitty (centre) with her sisters, twins Amelia and Eliza, 18, attracted attention at the marriage of Prince William for their fashion choices and good looks . Kitty is the daughter of the Earl of Spencer and Victoria Lockwood, though their marriage ended due to his infidelity as well as the former model's mental health problems . ‘They’ve only known each other for a short while, since September or October last year and I have no idea where their relationship is going. But they have seemed to have carried on [to the next level],’ Mr Compton’s mother said. The family met Lady Kitty for the first time over Christmas when she joined Nick at their family holiday cottage in Knysna, on the picturesque Garden Route, for the Compton family’s annual holiday. Apparently she drove down from Cape Town by herself to spend time with them. A friend said: ‘For her to do that she has to be super keen on him. For Kitty that’s like driving across Africa…’ ‘I was really impressed. She’s very bright, she’s cheerful, down to earth and funny. And she’s stunning looking and very natural,’ Mrs Compton, who gave the Mail this photograph taken during that holiday, recalled. Nick is touted as one of the most outstanding England batsmen of his generation . ‘She’s different, a really lively character who is interested in things and interesting to talk to. She’s had a completely different upbringing to Nick and that must be difficult to cope with but it doesn’t show. She’s got no airs or graces. I really like her.’ Asked whether her son was ‘keen on Kitty’, Mrs Compton said with the kind of toe-curling candour only a mother can: ‘Of course he is keen on her! He hasn’t had many girlfriends because he’s always been really focussed on his cricket and hasn’t had time for relationships. But he is still with Kitty… ‘ . But she insisted her genial son, who is known as a gentleman both and on and off the field, wasn’t fazed by her status or aristocratic lineage. ‘No, Nick is a very down to earth person. He’s completely honest and straight. He says what he thinks. So I don’t think it really matters at all,’ she said. Nick's grandfather, Denis, right, is a sporting legend while Kitty's Aunt is the late Princess Diana, right . ‘Nick has also never shied away from the cameras. He’s very easy going in TV interviews, very good at talking to people and always outgoing. ‘They do look the part don’t they? They look comfortable together. They are quite different in some ways… their backgrounds are very different… but they make each other laugh and he feels very comfortable in her company.’ She added laughing:  ‘Her dad is also very keen on cricket so that counts. ‘Nick’s met her family, but I have no idea if they approve. I haven’t met them, but they seem like very nice people. Nick really likes them.’ Lady Kitty should also be impressed by Nick’s own, some might say more illustrious, family lineage. Lady Kitty Spencer is a first cousin of the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry . His grandfather, Denis, played 78 Tests for England  - as well being a top class footballer, playing in the FA cup for Arsenal in 1950 and taking a winner’s medal. Sixty years ago this summer he hit the run that won the Ashes for England – and his grandson is tipped to help his country retain the series this year. He has also inherited his grandfather’s model looks. Denis was dubbed the Brylcreem Boy after advertising the brand and Nick is cutting quite a dash himself off the field, too. So could Kitty be ‘the one’, then? ‘I think it might be a bit too early to say that,’ his mother said. ‘Nick is probably going to kill me [for saying all this]!’","Stunning blonde couple only went public with romance at event last week .

A ‘devoted’ daughter whose body was found next to her dead mother, may have killed herself out of grief, it emerged today. Griselda Folkard, 69, and her mother Barbara Innes were found side-by-side in the home they had shared for 40 years, on Monday morning. Close friends believe 107-year-old Barbara died of old age, and that her daughter ‘took something’ upon finding her mother’s body in their flat in the quiet market town of Builth Wells in Mid Wales. Tragedy: Mother and daughter were found side-by-side in their home int he quiet market town of Builth Wells in Wales . Margaret Warlow, 85, rubbished rumours of a murder-suicide, saying Griselda was ‘a marvellous woman who always looked after her mother and then herself.' Mrs Warlow had known the mother and daughter for 40 years, becoming ‘best friends’ with Barbara and Griselda’s shopping partner. She said: ‘I think her mother passed away and Griselda was overcome with grief and has taken something.’ Mrs Warlow said Barbara had not been out of the house for around 15 years, and was confined to her bed with only her daughter to care for her after her husband passed away. 'Griselda's other sister married and . moved away but she always stayed with her parents and looked after them . and did the shopping. ‘I don't know how she stuck at it with her mother in bed all the time - it was a great sacrifice. Broken heart: Friends and neighbours in the town of Builth Wells, pictured, believe the grief-stricken Griselda, 69, may have taken her own life upon finding her 107-year-old mother . ‘The last time I saw Griselda she said her mother wasn't very well and didn't have long left. ‘She did say to me once: “If ever anything happened to mum I wouldn't know what would happen”.’ Another neighbour said: ‘Griselda spent the last 40 years looking after her mother - she was devoted to her. ‘They were as close as two people can be - it seems fitting that they went together like that. ‘They have lived in the town for as long as anyone can remember - it's a shock that they have died tragically.’ Dyfed Powys Police confirmed they are investigating the sudden deaths of a mother and daughter at their home in Builth Wells. A spokesman said: ‘Post mortems have taken place and inquiries are continuing.’ ‘They are not believed to be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.’ An inquest has been opened and adjourned after hearing the cause of both deaths were ‘unascertained’.

The uniform buried with a soldier in another plot was strewn on the ground. Now, a reward of more than $2,000 is being offered for information on the desecration at the Old Church Cemetery, which dates to 1758 in the east Georgia countryside near Waynesboro. Clothing buried with a soldier was removed, leaving his bones exposed, Burke County sheriff’s Sgt. Sean Cochran said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Among the soldiers desecrated were those dating back to the Revolutionary War, Civil War, and World War I, he said. Relic hunting is a possible motive, he said, though authorities aren’t certain what the motivation was.

Torn off: Clothes belonging to a soldier sit on the ground after being removed from a grave by vandals who allegedly stole its buttons . 'They took it completely out and dumped . everything out in the perimeter of the family plot,' Bell told The . Associated Press on Wednesday. 'It was just total devastation,' he recalled. 'I thought ""why in God’s name could anybody do anything like this?""’ he said. 'I just can’t understand it, other than the fact they were wanting some kind of trinkets.' Cochran said authorities don’t know what items were buried with the bodies, so they’re not sure what might have been stolen from the bodies and the graves.

Leaders of American Legion Post 120 are planning to rededicate the soldiers’ graves and restore the monuments that were damaged, Bell said.

South Africa's notorious Pretoria Prison was fabled under the apartheid regime as a stronghold of steel and stone from which no prisoner could ever escape. But there were just two men who held the key to freedom... and they made it out of wood. One quiet night on December 11 1979, anti-apartheid freedom fighter Tim Jenkin stretched his arm through his cell window and opened his cell door from the outside with a click. In his hand he held a broomstick with a wooden key he had fashioned attached to its end, like a rudimentary crankshaft. Now: Tim Jenkin holds the wooden key he fashioned to break out of Pretoria Prison, left, and his escape partner Stephen Lee, right . Then: The friends were supporters of Nelson Mandela’s ANC and had been locked up in the maximum-security jail for setting off harmless leaflet propaganda bombs in a bid to spread dissent against the apartheid regime in 1970s South Africa . He silently opened the door and stepped out into the corridor before tip-toeing to the next cell to set free his best friend and accomplice Stephen Lee. 'It was hugely emotional,' Stephen, now 62, told The Daily Mirror from his home in North London. 'This was going to let us out of the cells into the corridor.' But it was only the beginning. Standing in the darkened hallway, the friends still had ten more steel-clad gates and many more ruthless armed guards between them and fresh air. Staunch supporters of Nelson Mandela’s ANC, they had been locked up in the maximum-security jail for setting off harmless leaflet propaganda bombs in a bid to spread dissent against the apartheid regime in 1970s South Africa. Maximum security: Prison officers stand guard in the excercise yard at Preoria Prison, left, and the cell door which Stephen and Tim broke through on the final stage of their daring prison break . How it worked: The pair had made the key out of wood and attached it to a broomstick like a rudimentary crankshaft to unlock the heavy cell door . Stephen had been sentenced to eight years and Tim to 12. Describing the length of time they received as 'gut-wrenching', Stephen said: 'We were contemplating escape even before our conviction.' The men were so determined to break free that they had asked relatives to smuggle them money for taxi fares to a train station. A third ­prisoner, Alex Moumbaris, was brought in to be part of the escape. The idea for the makeshift key came to Stephen when he was lying on his bunk one evening and he remembered how he had learned to pick the lock of his back door of his home as a youngster. 'I got a piece of paper and, using a knife, pressed it into the lock [which] gave me the depth of the lock inside - the same measurement as the key. 'We were working in a carpentry workshop and I thought, ""I wonder if we can make a key out of wood""'. Daring: Jenkin stretched his arm out of his cell window from inside his cell to painstakingly unlock the door . How it worked: How their rudimentary crankshaft mechanism worked . Ingenious: They came up with a plan leave dummies - made from boiler suits stuffed with sheets - in their beds, sneak downstairs, hide in a cupboard and wait for the warder to go upstairs. But they would have to do it right under the noses of the guards. So he smuggled the parts he needed from he workshop to his cell in a flask and began work in the dead of night. By trial and error, he would try the key each day, using marks left on it when it jammed to work out which parts he needed to file. Within days it worked. Over the next 18 months the pair would slip out each night after lights out to start work on the next door, then the one after that. Painstaking: In all, the men had to fashion 10 keys for each of the doors to the outside world . The prison: South Africa's notorious Pretoria Prison was fabled under the apartheid regime as a stronghold of steel and stone from which no prisoner could ever escape . But it was the fifth and sixth doors that would test their nerves to the point of breaking. These were right next to the guards' office and they would surely be seen or heard if they tried passing through with anyone nearby. So they came up with an ingenious plan leave . dummies - made from boiler suits stuffed with sheets - in their beds, . sneak downstairs, hide in a cupboard and wait for the warder to go . upstairs. Then they would get to work as they had done already on all the other doors behind them. One by one, they fashioned keys for them all. All except the eleventh and final door, which they decided would be too risky for a dry run so it would have to be done once, on the fateful night of their actual escape. 'We got through the nine doors and then at the final door, we found we couldn’t open the lock,' said Stephen of D-day itself. But they had a plan B. Employing a chisel which they had brought along, they proceeded to attack the lock with 'tremendous noise'. Yet still, nobody appeared to notice. 'We were right underneath an armed guard but he didn’t see us. We walked out as if we had every right to be there,' Stephen said. They used their money to pay for taxis and left South Africa and headed for England. A huge police manhunt was launched to re-capture the fugitives, but by then they were already across the border en route to the UK. Their incredible story is to be told tonight in Breakout on the National Geographic Channel.","ANC heroes Tim Jenkin and Stephen Lee were held in Pretoria Prison in 1978 .

The Mayor of London has already said he wants there to be a statue erected in the capital to honour Lady Thatcher in the ‘heart of the nation’. But Mr Johnson would also like to see any future airport - likely to be built to create new capacity in the south - named after Britain’s longest-serving Prime Minister in over a century. Ideas: Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, has already said he wants there to be a statue erected in the capital to honour Lady Thatcher in the 'heart of the nation' He said: ‘Mega airports are springing up all over the continent that are stealing British trade and are a threat to our economy. ‘It is why this country so desperately needs a new four runway hub airport and I can think of no name that would strike greater fear into the heart of our European rivals than Margaret Thatcher International Airport.’ The naming of airports after celebrated public figures is a well-established means by which to create a permanent and lasting tribute. Paris has an airport named after former president Charles de Gaulle, Liverpool has John Lennon, New York has John F Kennedy and Belfast has George Best, to name but a few. The Mayor is a supporter of plans to build a new international airport in the Thames Estuary. The airport, which has been nicknamed Boris Island, would be built on an artificial island made of landfill. Landing: The Mayor is a supporter of plans to build a new international airport in the Thames Estuary (file) It would become Britain’s main international hub, replacing Heathrow, handling 300,000 passengers a day. However, Conservative MP Conor Burns said . he thought that Lady Thatcher would be ‘appalled’ at the idea of having . an airport named after her. 'I can think of no name that would strike . greater fear into the heart of our European rivals than Margaret . Thatcher International Airport' London Mayor Boris Johnson . He said: ‘It’s a lovely, touching idea but knowing Thatcher as I knew her, I think she’d hate it.’ Meanwhile, a Facebook campaign group calling for Heathrow Airport to be renamed as Margaret Thatcher Airport was created online and a petition lodged with Number 10. The group’s mission statement said: ‘Heathrow Airport should henceforth be known in the United Kingdom and around The World as Margaret Thatcher Airport. 'This, among other measures should act as a fitting and lasting tribute to Margaret Thatcher.’ Concerns: Conservative MP Conor Burns said he thought that Lady Thatcher (pictured centre, outside Downing Street in May 1979) would be 'appalled' at the idea of having an airport named after her . One online user wrote: ‘Why not rename LHR to Margaret Thatcher Airport, I think it’s a good idea. 'So many other airports around the world have been renamed in honour and memory of the person whether they were supported or not. Go for it!’ Did Baroness Thatcher face a tougher job as prime minister than David Cameron does today? But some Facebook users left online comments disapproving of the idea, with one writing: ‘There should be no major public tributes for such a divisive character. 'Parliament should not have been recalled, the funeral should be kept low key (or better still private). Heathrow (or any other airport) should not be renamed after her!’ Prime Minister David Cameron is considering what would be the best memorial for the Baroness, including plans to rename the capital of the Falkland Islands from Port Stanley to Port Margaret.

A Livermore high school teacher has pleaded no contest to charges she had a six-month sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student which started through social networking. Marie Johnson, 42, now faces up to nine years and eight months in prison. She'll be sentenced on May 15. Arrested: Marie Johnson, 41, has been accused of having sexual relations with a student over a six-month period - but she has denied the claims . She will also have to register as a sex offender. She was arrested and . booked on 24 counts of sexual assault charges in 2012. Authorities . believe a sexual relationship started in December 2010 until May 2011, with . most incidents taking place in the teacher's car. The boy is said to be a former student of Johnson's, who has been a math teacher for 13 years, at Granada High School. She was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18, oral copulation and committing a lewd act on a child. But she entered a not guilty plea on Thursday in Alameda County Superior Court in Pleasanton. According to the San Francisco . Chronicle, the relationship between Johnson and the boy started through . text messages, Facebook and instant messaging through the smart phone . game, Words with Friends. Scene: The teen was at Granada High School when the alleged sexual assaults took place. He told his coach he was a victim of 'repeated molestation' On January 10, 2012, the boy told a coach at his school that 'he was a victim of repeated molestation,' police Detective Joseph Draghi wrote in a statement.

A major US air show has canceled plans to stage a re-enactment of the World War II atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima following complaints that it was 'inappropriate.' Dayton Air Show in Ohio has featured a re-enactment of the bombing of the Japanese city - in August 1945 - for more than 30 years. Spokeswoman Brenda Kerfoot said a planned 'Great Wall of Fire' pyrotechnic show will still go ahead - but will not be used to represent the bombing after critics said it was inappropriate for a family event. Grounded: The annual Dayton Air Show (pictured) has canceled plans to stage a re-enactment of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima after critics said it was inappropriate . History: A B-29 bomber has been used annually to represent the 'Enola Gay' that dropped the first nuclear bomb on the city of Hiroshima in August 1945 (file picture) Ms Kerfoot said the show at Dayton International Airport in June, will not now feature a B-29 bomber - used . to represent the Enola Gay which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. The B-29 plane 'Fifi,' will remain in the show but in a separate role, she said. Air show officials said the re-enactment was meant to highlight an historic event that helped end the war and save lives that would have been lost if it had been prolonged. 'We've taken it as more of an educational show,' Ms Kerfoot said. 'The wording that we used probably wasn't the best.' Terrifying: A mushroom cloud shoots 20,000ft above Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city . She said organisers did not want the Hiroshima aspect to 'become a distraction to the overall quality of the show.' The . Dayton Daily News reported earlier that art curator Gabriela Pickett . started an online petition to object to the 'glamorization of . destruction.' 'I'm very pleased to hear that they . are going to have two different events, and not the re-enacting,' she . said. 'It would have been pretty much a celebration of dropping the bomb . that killed hundreds of thousands of people.' She said some 200 people signed her . online petition in a little more than a day, and that she had received a . number of emails from Japanese-Americans who were upset by the . re-enactment. She highlighted Dayton's immigrant-friendly 'Welcome Dayton' initiative. 'We are a city of peace,' she said. The city has for years highlighted its role as the site of the Dayton peace accords on Bosnia negotiated in 1995. The Dayton Literary Peace Prize each year honors literature's power to promote peace. Ron Katsuyama, a University . of Dayton associate professor who was born in a US wartime detention . camp for Japanese-Americans, said the show's contention that the bomb . that killed so many Japanese ended up saving more lives is disputable. He said some historians say Japan would have surrendered without the atomic bomb attacks. Devastation: Hiroshima following the dropping of the atomic bomb on 6 August 1945. The building in the foreground was retained in its ruined state as a peace memorial .

A bus driver's quick reflexes saved the lives of his passengers - and his own - when a lamppost came crashing through his windscreen. Mao Zhihao, 44, was driving along a busy dual carriageway in eastern China's Zheijang province when a crash on the opposite lane sent the post tumbling into his path. He narrowly escaped being killed by leaping to one side as the metal pole pierced the windscreen at high speed, but not before bravely taking evasive action to avoid the full force of the impact.

Cheating death: The post comes right past where Mr Mao's head would have been had he not reacted so fast . Pinned: Despite bearing the weight of the . lamppost, Mr Mao puts the bus back in gear and removes his seatbelt to . start helping his passengers escape from the wrecked vehicle . Battling the pain of a ruptured spleen, the courageous driver then slid from beneath the lamppost which had pinned him to his seat to open the doors so passengers could escape. The bus's conductor Yu Jingya told China Daily: 'I asked Mao if he was hurt when I got off. He pointed to his stomach. And I saw [there] was blood on his hands.' CCTV surveillance cameras aboard the number 602 bus from Jiangshan to Quzhou show Mr Mao chatting to someone before apparently letting out a shriek as he spots the danger ahead.

The pole slams through the windscreen just in from of Mr Mao, sending shards of glass flying into the bus, and would have surely decapitated him if it wasn't for his quick reaction. Although the steel column lands heavily on his left, the driver manages to put the bus into gear and bring it to a halt by driving it up against the barriers at the side of the road. He then frees himself from his seatbelt and clambers back beneath the lamppost to pull a lever opening the doors. All 26 passengers escape unharmed as Mr Mao reaches for his phone and satchel before getting off the bus himself. He reported the accident to police before being taken to a Jiangshan hospital for treatment, where doctors found he was suffering from a ruptured spleen.

A Montana federal judge who sent a racist email about President Obama and his deceased mother from his work email last year says he will now retire only days after an investigation was ordered. U.S. District Judge Richard Cebull had previously announced he would step down as chief circuit judge and take a reduced caseload after the shocking email was produced but now says he intends to fully retire on May 3. In February of 2012 Cebull forwarded an email from his chambers that contained a joke comparing interracial relationships to bestiality. Cebull argued at the time that he not racist, only anti-Obama. Resigning: U.S. District Judge Richard Cebull who sent a racist email about President Obama and his deceased mother has announced he will retire as an investigation into the incident continues . The appellate court posted a statement by Chief Judge Alex Kozinski on its website on Tuesday announcing Cebull had submitted the retirement letter on March 29 but refrained from providing a reason. The letter comes after the appellate court's Judicial Council issued a March 15 order on the investigation into his email, but appellate court spokesman David Madden could not say whether Cebull resigned because of it. 'The misconduct process is confidential. I am not privy to what the order said nor do I know what Judge Cebull's motivations were,' Madden said in an email on Wednesday. The council's order will remain confidential during an appeal period, which concludes May 17, Madden said. The council will make an announcement after Cebull's retirement takes effect, he said, but added that he was unable to answer when the order or the letter will be released to the public. A Cebull aide directed calls for comment . to Clerk of Court Tyler Gilman, who said on Wednesday that Cebull would . not have any comment other than the court's statement. Apology: Cebull wrote a letter of apology to Obama and filed a complaint against himself after The Great Falls Tribune published the contents of the email . He declined to release the resignation letter or describe what it said. Cebull wrote a letter of apology to Obama . and filed a complaint against himself after The Great Falls Tribune . published the contents of the email, which included a joke about . bestiality and the president's mother. The judge said the e-mail, which he . admits is racist, doesn't reflect how he treats black people in his . courtroom. However, calls for his resignation immediately began pouring . in. Judge Richard Cebull said the joke, which plays on the fact that President Obama's mother was white and his father was African, was never meant to become public. It reads:Subject: A MOM'S MEMORY . Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine. A little boy said to his mother; 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!' The Billings judge forwarded the email from his chambers to six other people on Feb. 20, 2012, the newspaper reported. The text of the e-mail, with the subject line 'A MOM'S MEMORY' reads: 'Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine. 'A little boy said to his mother; ""Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white? His mother replied, ""Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!""' Two other groups also demanded an investigation, with one, the Montana Human Rights Network, starting an online petition calling for Cebull's resignation. Kim Abbott, the network's co-director, said on Wednesday she was pleased with the announcement but hopes to see the results of the investigation. 'The email really called into question his ability to treat women and people of color fairly, so we're happy Montanans will get to appear before a different judge,' Abbott said. The complaints were referred to a special committee appointed by the appellate court to investigate whether Cebull's email constituted misconduct. Kozinski's statement said the committee submitted a report to the Judicial Council in December after 'a thorough and extensive investigation' that included interviews with witnesses and Cebull and going over related documents. The council issued its order based on that report. The statement says the Judicial Council will not comment further until Cebull's retirement is effective. Cebull stepped down as Montana's chief federal judge and took senior status March 18, which allowed another judge to be appointed while he continued working with a reduced caseload. U.S. Sen. Max Baucus then formed a committee to replace Cebull and another judge taking senior status, with Baucus recently recommending that Obama appoint state District Judge Susan Watters of Billings to take Cebull's spot on the bench. The new chief federal judge, U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen, plans to meet with other judges to discuss how to handle the Cebull's cases, Gilman said. Cebull was a Billings attorney for nearly 30 years before becoming a U.S. magistrate in Great Falls in 1998. He became a district judge in 2001 and has served as chief judge of the District of Montana since 2008. Cebull's notable cases include his block of reopening of the U.S. border to cattle in 2005, two years after the U.S. banned Canadian cattle and beef products over fears of mad-cow disease. The 9th Circuit overturned that decision. Cebull also presided over a lawsuit filed by landowners against Exxon Mobil Corp. over the cleanup following last year's pipeline spill of 1,500 gallons into the Yellowstone River.","District Judge Richard Cebull  forwarded an .

He has already written to the chief constable of West Mercia Police about the issue. Residents in his Mid-Worcestershire constituency are also very upset. One wrote to Mr Luff to say: 'This riot class is really worrying me. It is things like this that make me frightened to leave the house.' Another said: 'Is this really the best thing to teach young people - to go and torch things and loot shops. It is disgusting.'

Birmingham MP Jack Dromey, whose own constituency was caught up in the 2011 riots said: 'Rioting is not a game. It is utterly irresponsible and insensitive not least because there are thousands of victims scarred to this day by the memories of what happened in that terrible August week of last year.' The activity's webpage says thrill-seekers arrive and have a full briefing on modern riot control techniques. Then they are trained to use batons and four foot riot shields, see a petrol bomb demonstration and learn the basics of casualty evacuation. They will also be kettled. After lunch they are split into a group - one acting as police, the other as rioters - before a ' pitched battle will ensue'. They then switch sides. The company is being criticised as offering something in bad tastes after Britain's cities suffered days of violent riots in 2011.

The collective behaviour of moshers at heavy metal rock concerts is similar to the way particles move in a disordered 2D gas, new research reveals. Physicists at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who studied the movements of concert-goers caught up in chaotic-looking mosh pits found they actually follow a certain logic. They say their insights could help to predict how crowds behave in emergencies, and could lead to more effective evacuation strategies.

'Over the years, experiments and computer simulations have helped scientists work out the basic rules of pedestrian traffic moving down the street. 'However, we don't know much about the collective behaviour that emerges from panicked crowds - it's not exactly ethical to start a riot for the sake of science.' Crowds at heavy metal concerts often firm circles called mosh pits where they violently lunge and bounce off one and other with their arms flaying and their legs kicking. 'Often resulting in injuries, the collective mood is influenced by the combination of loud, fast music (130 dB, 350 beats per minute), synchronised with bright, flashing lights, and frequent intoxication,' the study notes. However, while the movements appear to be chaotic and random, Mr Silverman and his colleagues claim that there is actually a logic which enables them to statistically predict the ways in which moshers move. Upended at Coachella: Physicists at Cornell University, New York, who studied the movements of concert-goers caught up in mosh pits found they actually follow a certain logic . It is a feeling we have all experienced - an irritating song that just will not leave your head. But despite the widely help opinion that only the most infuriating songs get buried in your head, research has suggested we might actually like the songs that push us close to migraines. Using songs by artists such as Lady Gaga, scientists proved that songs people know and like frequently become more intrusive than songs people dislike. Psychologists at Western Washington University found that if a song continues to play in someone's head immediately after listening, it is likely to come back as an intrusive thought in the next 24 hours. Their findings could explain why some pop songs and TV theme tunes go round in people's heads, despite finding them annoying. Researchers also found songs are more likely to get stuck in your mind during challenging mental activities. Inspiration for the study came after . Mr Silverberg, a graduate student at Cornell, took his girlfriend to her . first heavy metal concert several years ago, where he had a chance to . witness the movements of moshers from the outside. 'I didn't want to put her in harm's way, so we stood off to the side,' he told New Scientist. 'I'm usually in the mosh pit, but for the first time I was off to the side and watching. I was amazed at what I saw.' He told NBC News that as the band played louder and the moshers got more inebriated, he realised there was a ripple-like pattern to the movements caused after one person bumped into another. 'The collision went from one side to the other,' he said, adding it looked as if moshers were following the rules of collective motion. 'I had a hard time focusing on the music for the rest of the evening.' To study the phenomenon, Mr Silverberg and his colleagues collected their data from mosh pit videos on YouTube featuring crowds of between 100 and 100,000 people. They corrected for camera shake and distortions in perspective, then used particle image velicometry techniques to measure the collective motion of those involved, The Physics arXiv Blog reported. After analysing their findings, they discovered that the speed distribution of moshing metalheads bears a remarkable resemblance to the movements of molecules in a 2D gas at equilibrium. To deepen their understanding of the movements of moshpits, Mr Silverman enlisted the help of fellow grad student Matt Bierbaum to build a computer simulation of a mosh pit with a few basic rules. Their virtual moshers bounced off each other when they collided, they are able to move independently, and they can follow each other to varying degrees in a behaviour the researchers dubbed 'flocking'. Finally, the team added a variable amount of statistical noise to their model, which, Mr Bierbaum told New Scientist, is 'to mimic the effects of the inebriants that the participants typically use.' They found that they could quite accurately reproduce the characteristics of a mosh pit when the self-propulsion and flocking variables were dominated by noise. On the other hand, when they adjusted the flocking variable to dominate their computer generated moshers' behaviour, they found their simulation mimicked another phenomenon seen at metal concerts known as a circle pit. The researchers said that although moshers are self-propelled, and the collisions between them dissipative, they move in a similar way to a disordered gas. 'These ﬁndings offer strong support for the analogy between mosh pits and gases,' they concluded in their paper, Collective Motion of Moshers at Heavy Metal Concerts, published on Cornell's online open-access journal arXiv. Mr Silverman elaborated in his Huffington Post article: 'Just like moshers bouncing around in a pit, it's near impossible to tell where molecules of air in a room are going to be in the future. 'To deal with this problem, physicists started describing molecular gasses with statistical mechanics over a hundred years ago. As the researchers discovered, mosh pits have the same statistical character, and hence the analogy.' The team behind the research believe that it could have important implications for understanding how crowds behave when they are panicked. 'When you have earthquakes or buildings on fire, people tend to panic when they escape. We don't have a good way of experimentally seeing what's going on,' Mr Silverberg told New Scientist. 'By going to these heavy-metal concerts, we're able to ethically and safely observe how humans behave in these unusual excited states.'","Behaviour of metalheads in a mosh pit closely resembles particle movement in a disordered 2D gas, study claims .

A French family of seven, including four children, have been released in Cameroon following secret talks, France said today, ending two months of captivity in the hands of Nigerian Islamist militants. Armed men on motorcycles snatched the family on February 19 while they were on holiday near the Waza national park in north Cameroon, some six miles from the Nigerian border. 'I spoke to the father this morning ... He told me how happy and relieved he was,' French President Francois Hollande said at a news conference in Paris on Friday. 'This is an immense relief. This will redouble our determination to free the hostages who remain.' Fear: Tanguy Moulin-Fournier, centre, was seized with his wife, four sons, and his brother, far left, who was visiting them on holiday . Eight French hostages are still being held by al Qaeda-linked Islamist militant groups in the arid Sahel region of west Africa. Hollande said there had been discrete contacts over the last few weeks to free the family under French terms and denied any money was paid for their release. 'France has not changed its position, which is not to pay ransoms,' he said. The father of the kidnapped family, Tanguy Moulin-Fournier, worked in Cameroon for French utility firm GDF Suez. He was seized with his wife, four sons, and his brother, who was visiting them on holiday. Militant: Gunmen claiming to be from Boko Haram released videos of the family in March, threatening to kill them unless Nigeria and Cameroon released Muslim militants held in detention . 'It was very long. It was very difficult. It was physically and psychologically tough and there were some very low moments,' Moulin-Fournier told France Inter radio. 'We're very tired but life will resume and life is stronger than everything else.' Both adult males of the family had thick beards while the children looked drawn, and wore flip-flops, knee-length shorts and tee-shirts. 'Immense relief': France's president Francois Hollande spoke of his reliefe, adding the release would 'redouble' his determination to free the hostages who remain . 'We are very happy to be released. I want to thank (Cameroon) President Paul Biya for making all the effort to ensure our release,' his tired-looking wife, Albane Moulin-Fournier, said on Cameroonian television, holding her smallest child. Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh, secretary-general of Cameroon's presidency, said all family members were well. State television showed the family descending from a plane where they were greeted on the tarmac by the French ambassador who took them to the embassy in the capital Yaounde. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was due to meet them there, a French official said, and they would be repatriated to France as soon as possible. 'I think I'll bring them (back to France) early tomorrow,' Fabius said before boarding a flight to Cameroon on Friday. The release of the hostages is a rare piece of good news for Hollande's government, which is struggling to cut unemployment and has been hit by a tax fraud scandal which has forced its budget minister to resign. Mostly Muslim northern Cameroon is considered an area within the operational sphere of Islamist militants including Boko Haram, Nigeria's biggest security threat. Gunmen claiming to be from Boko Haram released videos of the family in March, threatening to kill them unless Nigeria and Cameroon released Muslim militants held in detention. Cameroon denied it was holding any militants and it was unclear if any of the group's demands had been met.","Tanguy Moulin-Fournier, wife, four children and brother taken in February .

Former primary school teaching Ursula Rose, 42, pictured at Croydon Crown Court, south London, today, was sentenced to 18 months in prison . A teaching assistant has been jailed after she conned £20,000 out of friends by saying that she had terminal cancer. Ursula Rose, 42, duped colleagues into handing over money from loans and savings to finance Harley Street treatment. One donor even raided her children's savings after the mother of four told the school she had 'tumours in her head'. Rose told friends she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive brain tumours - including one allegedly wrapped round a main artery that could kill her at any moment. Judge Jeremy Gold QC today ordered Rose to pay her victims back £15,000 she still owes. He said: ‘You were much admired by your colleagues and they believed you when you said you had a brain tumour. ‘This was a gross betrayal of their trust. Good people with the best of intentions were completely taken in by your lies. 'You even forged documents to continue your fraud. Your fraud, I'm afraid to say, must be categorised as calculated and wicked. ‘It makes it all the more sad that you used your effervescent personality to deceive those who trusted you.’ Dressed in black, Rose, who worked at Saint Thomas Becket school in South Norwood, south London, stared blankly ahead as the sentence was read out. School staff members sat in the public gallery wept and breathed an audible sigh of relief as Rose was led away from the dock in handcuffs. Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave her £3,000 - borrowing her two daughters' saving - after Rose convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a £37,000 private operation. Rose took time off work for the 'operation' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful, but a £7,000 American wonder drug could combat the remaining life-threatening tumour. In June 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at a bar in Croydon, south London, contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug. Another colleague, Allison Patmore, gave Rose £6,500 as a deposit on a £40,000 private Harley Street operation after Rose claimed it was too dangerous to be carried out by the NHS. Mrs Patmore took out a £6,200 loan plus £300 from her own bank account to be repaid when Rose remortgaged her home. Rose was ordered by the judge at Croydon Crown Court, above, to pay her victims back £15,000 she still owes . The teaching assistant was finally caught out when the school's headmaster, Noel Campbell, received confirmation from Rose's doctor at Mayday University hospital that she never had cancer. Rose resigned in February, 2010, telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all-clear and was cured. Christopher Bertham, defending, told the court that Rose was being hounded for mortgage arrears at the time of the con, suffering from severe migraines and feared for her health. He said: ‘Mrs Rose expresses shame and regret and has asked me to say that to the court, and that she is sorry for her behaviour. ‘At the time she was operating under not only financial stress but she was stressed gravely about her state of health as well. ‘There is no doubt that the fears and concerns that she had were real enough but her expression of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis that she told her colleagues did not reflect the truth.’ He said Rose had breached the trust and generosity of her colleagues and that ‘her career has fallen to ashes at her own hand’ as a result of the con. But speaking outside court today, kind-hearted colleagues caught up in Rose's web of lies said they were relieved to finally see her behind bars. Teaching assistant Mrs Trype, 54, said: ‘When I first found out I was absolutely mortified. I couldn't believe that somebody could be so deceitful. ‘She has never made eye contact with me, spoken to me or apologised to us.’ Her husband Kevin, 52, an electrician, said: ‘It just goes to show that people can't use the big C to get what they want. Anybody who uses the cancer card deserves jail. ‘There are so many people with cancer who can't get money but they don't go around conning people. I'm glad she got what she got.’ Iona Horwood, a fellow teaching assistant who attended fundraisers for Rose, said: ‘It is very emotional. We are not jumping up and down because because it is a sad event. But justice has been done.’ Rose was sentenced to 18 months each for four counts of fraud, to run concurrently, at Croydon Crown Court. She must serve at least half her sentence behind bars.","Ursula Rose, 42, to pay back money to staff at school where she worked .

Dead: Malcolm Levesconte, 59, was found in the sea near Dover after telling his partner he would 'come back to haunt her' A pub landlord who took his own life after stealing nearly £30,000 from his customers’ Christmas fund, told his partner to ‘be good, or I’ll come back and haunt you’, on the night he disappeared, an inquest heard today. Malcolm Levesconte, 59, left the chilling message for his girlfriend after it was discovered the money from the savings club had gone missing. Police believe he had been sieving money from the thrift club fund throughout the year to save his pub, the Royal Oak in Shrewton near Salisbury in Wiltshire. He was then last seen on December 9 last year boarding a ferry from Portsmouth to France. His body was found in the sea off Dover, Kent, on Christmas Eve. A coroner ruled he had taken his own life. Mr Levesconte only disclosed the level of his debt in a series of notes discovered after his death was confirmed. His partner, Janet Handsley, told police she had seen one of the notes the night before Mr Levesconte disappearance. The note prompted Ms Handsley to contact her son, but she did not read further than the top line because she found it upsetting, the inquest in Salisbury heard. Ms Handsley told the court she did not discuss the note with Mr Levesconte the next day, which was the last time she saw him, as he said he was leaving to speak to somebody who could resolve a financial issue. In a statement to police, she said: ‘About a month ago (before his disappearance) I noticed a change. He hadn’t been himself and couldn’t sleep properly. ‘On December 8 I found a letter in an envelope with my name on it. It upset me greatly so I didn’t read any more. ‘I didn’t discuss it with Malcolm. I last saw him at 5.30pm on December 9. He went out having said goodbye to me and that he loved me. ‘He said: ""You’ll have to be good or I will come back and haunt you"". At the time I didn’t think anything about it.' Villagers' savings: Mr Levesconte took his own life after it was discovered that he had stolen nearly £30,000 from the 'thrift' fund at the Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, Wiltshire . Letters . found after Mr Levesconte’s disappearance - in a bundle with his last . will and testament - spoke about his debt to the thrift club and, . according to coroner Dr Claire Balysz, ‘quite clearly expressing his . intentions and the reason he chose to take the course of action’. Wiltshire . Police said they had been working on the theory that Mr Levesconte had . been propping up his failing pub business with money from the fund. Dr . Balysz read evidence to the court stating how Mr Levesconte was a man . with few friends, who worked every day in the pub and rarely had any . time off. His partner described how Mr Levesconte would put his own money into the pub, which was leased from Enterprise Inns. She added: ‘When he makes up his mind about something, he keeps to it.’ The . court heard Mr Levesconte had booked a ferry ticket to St Malo and had . left the pub in Shrewton, three miles from Stonehenge, around 5.30pm the . night he was last seen alive. Mr Levesconte's body was found in the English Channel on Christmas Eve four miles from the port of Dover (pictured) Having . told his regulars to ‘take care’, Mr Levesconte headed south to the . ferry port at Portsmouth. CCTV confirmed he had arrived on the south . coast and boarded a shuttle bus onto the ferry. However, . he did not arrive in France.

The coroner said Mr Levesconte had drowned and had taken his own life. The thrift fund had been set up by Mr Levesconte with around 60 local families paying into it throughout the year.

Sex attacker: A 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified, raped a four-year-old girl (picture posed by model) A judge yesterday condemned online porn after a 14-year-old boy who was ‘obsessed’ with sex websites raped a four-year-old girl. The boy was given free rein by his parents to watch graphic material on hi-tech gadgets such as his Xbox console and iPod. But in an unusual move, Lord Burns directly linked the teenager’s exposure to porn to the sex attack. He also criticised the boy’s parents who, even after the offence, allowed their son to carry on accessing the internet with virtually no form of restriction. The case comes amid the Daily Mail’s on-going Block Online Porn campaign to protect children from graphic images. Scotland’s top sex crimes prosecutor, Alison Di Rollo, has recently warned that online filth is fuelling a rise in sex offending by children. The 14-year-old, who was spared a custodial sentence, forced the girl to perform a sex act on him at his home during the school holidays. She later told the boy’s mother, a childminder, what had happened. The youth initially denied the accusations but confessed after DNA evidence came to light. He eventually admitted raping the child. At a hearing earlier this year, the Lanarkshire teenager admitted the offence, which happened last August. He was referred to the Children’s Reporter and his behaviour will be monitored under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements set up to deal with sex offenders. Campaign: The Daily Mail has called for internet service providers to block online porn unless users 'opt in' His name has already been added to the sex offenders’ register and he will be subject to random checks by social workers and police for any devices capable of online access. Frank Gallagher, defending, said the accused’s parents had tried but failed to put a parental lock on their internet account. They had handed back their son’s Xbox, iPod and mobile phone ‘on trust’ after the offence. He said: ‘His bedroom door wasn’t to be closed and they frequently visited his room to make sure he wasn’t accessing pornography. But he breached his parents’ trust.’ Unrestricted: The boy, 14, has free rein to watch online porn (picture posed by model) Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, West Lothian, judge Lord Burns criticised the parents, who wept during the hearing. He told the boy: ‘The whole circumstances, I have to say, don’t reflect well upon your parents and I have no doubt that they are aware of the element of responsibility that they must take for this shameful event.’ Describing his offence as ‘highly serious’, he went on: ‘You are a young boy but you became obsessed with pornography through the internet and were able to access that freely. The result of that obsession, it appears, caused you to commit this crime.’ Last night, Tory chief whip John Lamont said: ‘Parents will be worried that this child will only be subjected to random checks. Something far more robust is needed to ensure his behaviour does not escalate as he gets older.’ Earlier this year, Mrs Di Rollo warned that the availability of sexual imagery ‘must have some effect on the attitudes’ of young people. Anne Houston, of the CHILDREN 1ST charity, said: ‘Online pornography can give young people a skewed idea of sex and relationships. Sadly, in this case, it appears to have been one contributory factor.’","Boy, 14, given free rein to view porn on his Xbox and iPod .

"By . Gavin Allen . UPDATED: . 14:24 EST, 7 October 2011 . Despite being considered the most destructive force in space and absolutely uninhabitable, the conditions for life exist inside supermassive black holes, a Russian cosmologist has theorised. Going out on a scientific limb somewhat, Vyacheslav Dokuchaev has even suggested that if life did exist inside the SBH, it would have evolved to become the most advanced civilisation in the galaxy. Supermassive black holes are such powerful gravitational forces that they suck in everything around them, including light, and nothing that crosses the black hole's 'event horizon' is ever seen again. White noise? A Russian cosmologist says that life could exist inside a supermassive black hole - which flies in the face of accepted scientific theory . But now Dokuchaev, of Moscow's Institute for Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, says existing evidence combined with new research throws up intriguing possibilities for certain types of black holes. Inside a charged, rotating black hole there are regions where photons can survive in stable periodic orbits. Dokuchaev specialises in studying those orbits and their dynamics . He speculates, in a paper published in Cornell University's online journal arXiv, that if there are stable orbits for photons, there is no reason why there could not be stable orbits for larger objects, such as planets. The problem is that these stable orbits would only exist once you have crossed the threshold of the event horizon, where time and space flow into one another. Stable orbits: This diagram from Dokuchaev's paper shows the orbit of a photon stablising in a supermassive black hole, with thin line indicating the start point and thicker line the end point . Science fiction: Laurence Fishburne (rear, cente) starred in the film Event Horizon, in which a spaceship passed through the space-time boundary . The event horizon, at the lip of the black hole, is known as the point of no return. However, beyond the event horizon is another domain, known as the Cauchy horizon, where time and space return to stable states. It is inside the Cauchy horizon that life could exist, Dokuchaev argues in a paper published in Cornell University's online journal arXiv, . However, the type of life that could exist in those conditions - where they would be subject to massive fluctuating tidal forces - would have evolved beyond ours. The life that could exist there would likely be a civilisation ranked as Type III on the Kardashev Scale. There are three levels to the scale with one being the lowest and three the highest. Humanity is still looking to attain Level 1 status; mastery of its own planet.

Images of what is believed to be parts of the forthcoming iPhone 6 have emerged online for the first time. Apple are said to have been preparing several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year, including a cheaper, plastic-bodied model aimed at customers in emerging markets. The need for the company to diversify its offerings was underlined yesterday by a report which showed that the iPhone is losing its appeal among well-heeled Asian customers. Is this the first look at the next iPhones? The image purporting to show the speaker parts from the forthcoming iPhone 5S and iPhone 6. The same part from the current generation is shown not to scale . And the leaked images come as rumours began circulating that Apple is also readying a new version of its iPad with 128GB of storage - a potential direct challenge to Microsoft's Surface Pro, which launches in the U.S. next week. The photos, which the editor of French tech blog Nowhereelse.fr said he found 'while browsing the web', show speaker components which are similar to ones used in the iPhone 5. They were apparently leaked online by an employee of the Far Eastern company which manufactures the parts for the Silicon Valley tech giant. The rather fuzzy images purport to show the block speaker parts which will be used on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6. Both parts appear to be similar in design to the part currently used in iPhone 5s, but the one thought to be for the iPhone 6 is slightly smaller. It is speculated that this could actually be designed for the as-yet hypothetical 4.8in iPhone, an iPhone Mini or a possible budget iPhone. There have been rumours that Apple is preparing a cheaper version of its iPhone for emerging markets, where demand for the smartest of smartphones has been hampered by its rather smart price-tag. But stiff competition at the top end of the market by tablet/smartphone hybrids like Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 has also led to rumours that the company could also be readying a larger version. The same parts are shown from above: The fuzzy images were apparently leaked online by an employee of the Far Eastern company which manufactures the parts for the Silicon Valley tech giant . While it is not possible to tell for certain whether the photos are indeed legitimate leaks of iPhone parts, Nowhereelse.fr has published a number of accurate photos in the past. The writer claims the source of the images, whose identity he has chosen to keep secret, told him the 5S is set for launch between March and July, while the iPhone 6 will be unveiled at the year's end. That matches the predictions of a recent analyst's report, which said production of the upgraded version of the iPhone 5 will begin in March for a June release. Apple is reported to preparing a 128GB version of the iPad, which would be perfectly positioned to take on the latest top-of-the-line pro version of Microsoft's Surface tablet. The forthcoming fourth-generation Apple tablet with a Retina display would not be a redesign of current models but rather an addittion to the current line, sources told 9to5Mac. It will join the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB fourth-generation iPads which Apple already has on the market. No price has yet been released. It comes after Microsoft last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in North America from next week. Powered by an Intel x86-type processor, the Microsoft Surface Pro will run a full version of the latest Windows 8 OS, allowing it to use fully featured Windows software rather than the slimmed-down apps currently available for Windows RT. That has allowed Microsoft to position the gadget as a complete laptop replacement. It comes in both 64GB and 128GB versions but, unlike Apple's tablets, does not have a SIM slot to enable connection to mobile networks. The expectation that Apple is preparing to expand its so-far one-dimensional smartphone range comes as analysis of mobile web traffic from Hong Kong and Singapore showed consumers there are turning away from its products. Driven by a combination of iPhone fatigue, a desire to be different and a plethora of competing devices, users in these influential markets are turning to other brands, Reuters reported. In Singapore, Apple's products were so dominant in 2010 that more devices here ran its iOS operating system per capita than anywhere else in the world. But StatCounter, which measures traffic collected across a network of 3 million websites, calculates that Apple's share of mobile devices in Singapore - iPad and iPhone - declined sharply last year. From a peak of 72 per cent in January 2012, its share fell to 50 per cent this month, while Android devices now account for 43 per cent of the market, up from 20 per cent in the same month last year. In Hong Kong, devices running Apple's iOS now account for about 30 per cent of the total, down from about 45 per cent a year ago. Android accounts for nearly two-thirds. 'Apple is still viewed as a prestigious brand, but there are just so many other cool smartphones out there now that the competition is just much stiffer,' said Tom Clayton, chief executive of Singapore-based Bubble Motion, which develops a popular regional social media app called Bubbly. Where Hong Kong and Singapore lead, other key markets across fast-growing Asia usually follow. 'Singapore and Hong Kong tend to be, from an electronics perspective, leading indicators on what is going to be hot in Western Europe and North America, as well as what is going to take off in the region,' said Jim Wagstaff, who runs a Singapore-based company called Jam Factory developing mobile apps for enterprises.","Fuzzy images purport to show speaker block component from forthcoming iPhone 6 and 5S models .

It is a practice that has endured for generations – feeding the birds at the local park with the scraps from a loaf. But now wardens at Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park have been ordered to stop bird-lovers throwing the ‘wrong’ kind of bread. They will swap visitors’ white bread for a replacement snack of ‘healthier’ birdseed for them to distribute. The policy is said to be aimed at protecting birdlife at St Margaret’s Loch in the royal park – including the Queen’s swans. Wardens are confiscating white bread from bird-lovers in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh (pictured) Officials in charge of Holyrood Park, claim bread can lead to starvation in birds . Officials claim white bread can give birds arthritis and cause birth defects or even starvation and they have put up signs warning against the practice. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has questioned the crackdown, saying all bread is fine, as long as birds have a balanced diet. However, Holyrood Park ranger Matt McCade said: ‘White bread doesn’t have any nutritional value. It can cause arthritis and birth defects. ‘It will also fill ducks and swans up, stopping them from feeling hungry, which can sadly lead to them dying of starvation.’ He added: ‘Rangers will have a chat and encourage them to use birdseed or wholemeal bread. ‘I carry a bag of seeds with me and swap it for the white bread. It helps to encourage  young families to feed the ducks and swans properly.’ Park wardens have been ordered to confiscate white bread from bird-lovers to protect the Queen's swans . The Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but the Queen only exercises this on parts of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries. The Keeper of the Queen's Swans office dates from the 13th century. It was abolished in 1993, when it was replaced by two new offices, the Warden of the Swans and the Marker of the Swans. Swan Upping plays an important role in the conservation of the mute swan and involves the Queen’s Swan Warden collecting data, assessing the health of young cygnets and examining them for any injuries. Cygnets are extremely vulnerable at this early stage in their development and Swan Upping affords an opportunity to help both adults and cygnets that might otherwise go untreated. Historic Scotland, the quango charged with running and maintaining many of Scotland’s most famous buildings, took over the park in 1999. Its official guidance states that birds such as Mallard ducks, kestrels and the Queen-owned mute swans could be harmed by non- wholemeal bread. Park users are also discouraged from giving birds treats such as ‘crisps, chips, rice and curry’. But an RSPB Scotland spokesman said: ‘As far as the RSPB is concerned, all types of bread are acceptable as part of a bird’s balanced diet.’ Visitors branded the policy ‘ridiculous’. Jayme Jamieson, 20, said: ‘It’s one of the most stupid things I’ve ever heard. 'I can see the point about not feeding the ducks chips and rice and things but I can’t see the problem with white bread.’ A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: ‘Brown bread is encouraged because of its nutritious value. White bread can cause joint problems in birds.’","Officials claim white bread causes arthritis, birth defects and starvation .

Flight attendant Tatiana Kozlenko put the snap up on her personal page on Vkontakte, one of Russia's most popular Facebook-style social networks. Within hours the snap - which appears to show the arm of an air hostess giving the finger to an airplane cabin full of passengers - had clocked up dozens of 'likes'. Sacked: Air hostess Tatiana Kozlenko, pictured left, has been fired by Russian airline Aeroflot after posting a picture online that appears to show a flight attendant giving the finger to a cabin full of passengers, right . But the image then went viral after it was posted on Twitter and reTweeted by hundreds of users. Aeroflot airline bosses soon found out about the photo and fired Ms Kozlenko. Aeroflot - who announced the sacking on their Twitter account - said: 'Posting this photo shows Tatiana’s attitude towards passengers and her duties. She acknowledged her fault when she spoke to her managers.' But Ms Kozlenko claims it isn't her arm in the snap - or even one of her her airline's planes. She admitted that she tagged herself in the photo, which doesn't show anyone's face - but claims it isn't her. 'I don’t consider myself guilty!

Axed: Aeroflot bosses fired Ms Kozlenko after the image went viral on the internet (stock image) Ms Kozlenko is not the first to get in trouble over making the gesture. Teenager Penelope Soto was jailed for thirty days after sticking her finger up at a judge during sentencing yesterday. Soto - who was in court after being arrested for drug possession - made the gesture after Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jorge Rodriguez-Chomat doubled the amount of her bond. As a result she was hauled back in front of the judge and given a jail sentence for contempt of court. Another woman was forced to apologise after an image of her flashing her middle finger at Arlington National Cemetery sparked widespread disgust across the web and prompted an online petition to get the woman fired from her job. Lindsey Stone posted the picture of herself making the obscene gesture at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, next to a sign at the military cemetery that asks for 'Silence and Respect,' in October and the snapshot quickly went viral. Stone issued an apology for the picture calling her gesture a 'visual pun' and saying she now realizes the picture 'was in incredibly poor taste'.

Murder suspect Oscar Pistorius has not resumed training and is still highly traumatised following the tragic death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, according to his family. Pistorius's family have released a . statement after pictures of him jogging around a running track in . Pretoria were published in a South African newspaper, raising the . prospect of his return to competition again. The photograph, taken by a member of a children's hockey team, shows the three-time 2012 Paralympic gold medal winner wearing his blades around the track at the University of Pretoria. His family deny he is engaged in any formal programme, but admit they have been proactive in encouraging him to begin training again soon. Back in training: Pistorius was spotted jogging across the track at the University of Pretoria . Pistorius is on bail after being charged with the premeditated murder of his girlfriend and his next court appearance is on June 4 and is likely to stand trial before the end of the year. The statement said: 'Oscar is not back . on any official training programme. This may change in future, but this . will be a decision taken by Oscar, and Oscar alone. 'At this point Oscar is still in an . extremely traumatised state and has made it clear to all of us that he . is not able or willing to even contemplate this issue at this stage. 'We can confirm that we did have a . meeting with Oscar yesterday where various family members and his . trainer were present. We all encouraged him to get back onto the track . to help stabilise him emotionally. 'Oscar has been out running on a . number of isolated occasions in the days following the relaxation of his . bail conditions, but each time has been very difficult and he has .

Pistorius's agent Peet van Zyl also confirmed the athlete has no immediate plans to compete. Van . Zyl denied Pistorius has returned to training following the relaxation . of his bail conditions, which now allow him to travel abroad in order to . continue his athletics career, but confirmed he could resume soon. 'He was just having a jog around his track on his own accord. He wasn't back at training,' Van Zyl said . 'That . picture was taken by a schoolkid on March 24.

A federal jury in New York on Thursday handed a legal victory to U.S. billionaire William Koch and awarded him damages in his dispute over the alleged misrepresentation of 24 bottles of wine he bought at auction, one of the attorneys said. Koch, 72, the founder of Oxbow Group energy company and worth an estimated $4 billion, . bought the vintage wine as an investment in a 2005 Zachys . Wine Auctions but claims tech entrepreneur Eric Greenberg knowingly sold him counterfeit bottles of wine. Koch filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 2007, accusing Greenberg, the San Francisco-based founder of several Internet companies, of fraud and misrepresentation and seeking $320,000, the amount he paid for the 24 bottles. Victor's delight: Billionarie Bill Koch, 72, was awarded $320k for fake wine he was sold at auction . Wine savant: Koch spent $3.7 million at a Zachys auction for 17,000 bottles from Greenberg's cellar in October 2005. He says 24 bottles were fake . 'There was a code of silence in this bloody wine business, and now it's been broken,' Koch said after he won his lawsuit. 'I can't stand being cheated. But the worst thing of all is that counterfeiting degrades the love of the vintner for his wine,' he added, according to the Wine Spectator. The federal jury started deliberations on Thursday afternoon and returned early evening, after just two hours, with its verdict that Koch should be compensated for the amount he spent on the wine, Greenberg's attorney Arthur Shartsis said. Koch had spent $3.7 million at a Zachys auction for 17,000 bottles from Greenberg's cellar in an October 2005 sale. He alleged that 24 of the bottles he purchased were not real and accused Greenberg of fraud. Experts for both sides agreed that the wine in one of the 24 bottles is fake. The authenticity of the other 23 bottles was unclear, although expert witnesses testified that some of the labels were copies of the originals. Greenberg denied the charges, saying any forgeries from his wine cellar got to the auction house by mistake. None of the bottles has been opened nor the wine tasted. Wine lover: (From left) Eric Greenberg with John Kapon and Paul Pontallier showing off some Chateau Margaux . In closing arguments on Thursday, Shartsis told the jury his client did not knowingly sell fakes. He argued that the New York-based Zachys auction house sold the bottles 'as is,' meaning the buyer accepted the product in whatever condition it was at the time. Greenberg's contract with the auction house did not require him to prove the wine was real, the attorney said. Bottle of Chateau Latour (1928) - $2,873 . Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1811) - $29,172 . Magnum of Chateau Petrus (1921) - $29,500 . Magnum of Chateau Lafleur (1921) - $18,564 . Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1870) - $18,564 . Three magnums of Chateau Lafleur (1945) - $57,000 total . Bottle of Chateau Petrus (1928) - $17,238 . Magnum Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1870) - $33,150 . Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1805) - $22,542 . Two bottles of Chareau Mouton Rothschild (1900) - $10,114 total . Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1900) - $11,977 . Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1805) - $22,542 . 'Eric didn't know if the bottles were fake,' the attorney said afterward. Koch's . lawyer John Hueston said in court that Greenberg withheld information . about the provenance and authenticity of his wine collection. Koch, . whose brother David Koch is a major supporter of conservative political . causes, settled a separate lawsuit with the auction house in 2011, . details of which were kept private. Bill Koch has become a crusader against counterfeit wines being slipped into wine auctions. 'Collectors and individual sellers don't want anyone to know they have fake wine,' he told Wine Spectator earlier this year. 'They want to dump it on others. I'm the only guy who's blowing the whistle on it.' Sources close to the billionaire estimate he has spent $10 million on legal fees for the lawsuit but Mr Koch insists the money is well spent in the prevention of fraud. The case shines new light on the astronomical prices paid by wealthy collectors at auction for wine. Mr . Koch, from Florida, first brought the lawsuit against his Californian . rival in 2007, accusing him of auctioning off more than three dozen . 'fake' bottles, which he bought for $460,000. But . the claim now involves 24 of the bottles, and wine expert William . Edgerton is expected to testify that he raised suspicions about two of . them when inspecting Mr Greenberg's cellar in 2002. The expert had been called in when Sotheby's decided against auctioning them because of doubts over their authenticity. Bill Koch has launched a campaign against fraud in the wine market . Papers . filed at the court house claim Mr Greenberg told Christie's officials, . after selling the wine to Mr Koch, that there was 'no garbage' left in . his cellar because it had been sold. Mr Koch has reportedly pursued litigation against four auction houses and various wine sellers since 2005 when he discovered . four bottles of French wine, which he had bought and were said to have . been owned by former U.S. president Thomas Jefferson, were bogus. Mr Greenberg has a wine collection of more than 70,000 bottles, and his spokesman Bill Cunningham said that no one denies that in such a large number there will be some fakes. He said: 'But to go from that and say, 'because you have them you are guilty of fraud', is a big jump.' Mr Cunningham claimed Mr Koch has spent $10 million in legal fees so far, but would not say how much Mr Greenberg has spent. Wine expert Jim Hammond said the hefty price tags attached to vintage wines are down to exclusivity, such as age and where they are from, and not taste. Los Angeles School of Wine founder, Martin Weiner, said it is extremely difficult to prove authenticity of vintage wine, which has led to more fake bottles on the market. Mr Greenberg made his billions after founding dot-com companies, Viant and Scient, while Mr Koch, a sailor who won the 1992 America Cup, has a wide portfolio of oil and other investments.","Billionaire Bill Koch dolled out $3.7 million for 17,000 bottles of wine at an auction in October 2005 .

The game wastes no time in throwing you into the cockpit of a Porsche 911. You're instantly encouraged to drive around the city looking for races. The racing mechanic generally works very well, capturing a sense of speed and urgency through finely-tuned gameplay and visuals. AI is usually very aggressive, regardless of difficulty. Foes will ram you off the road, nudge you into on-coming traffic and cut you up at any chance. It's a level of aggression not oft seen in racing games - resulting in many races quickly becoming revenge missions to take out the driver who just caused you to crash. Hot wheels: Most of the cars on offer are some of the fastest on the planet . This helps enforce the personal significance and urgency of the task in hand, and stave off races feeling fragmented and not connected to the narrative. Indeed, although the open world nature of Most Wanted clearly lends itself to be enjoyed more with human opponents, there's still plenty of fun to be had for those who predominantly play offline. Upon completion of a race, you are awarded Speed Points to spend on your car. You can upgrade tyres, chassis, and gearing to name but a few tweaks. These come in handy when dealing with the varied game modes on offer. There are circuit races, unsurprisingly reminiscent of the Burnout games, while pursuits involve you trying to out run the police. Of particular enjoyment are the Most Wanted races - where you tackle one of the game's strongest drivers in a one on one. If successful, you'll be awarded their car - that is, after you run them off the road. But perhaps Most Wanted's most impressive hand is the cars themselves. All are beautifully recreated, if deliberately overstated, beasts. Duel: Races are similar to the Burnout games, featuring lots of takedowns . Criterion hasn't just caught their aesthetic beauty, but have captured and exaggerated their distinct character and charm, too - every one boasting their own unique, boisterous exhaust notes and aggressive engine whines. The result is a selection of cars that feel and handle very differently - adding a tactical element to what one to select for a specific race. All, though, possess the trademark Criterion arcade-style under steer and drifting ability. There are also some arcade elements in the game's structure to allow the player to concentrate on the racing. For example, many of the best cars are hidden around the map and can be accessed immediately and are easily found. Simply drive up to them, press a button and you switch instantly. This pick-up-and-play approach is echoed in fixing damage, too. Just drive through a garage and your car is magically fixed. There is also the EasyDrive system which allow you to keep track of what races are available, tune your car and access online play via the Autolog. This lets you hop into multiplayer at any time. Lose the cops: Fairhaven City is vast, and has plenty of backstreets to explore . Graphically, the game is stunning. In particular, damage models on the cars is frighteningly realistic. There's a sense that you're driving an exotic vehicle, rather than some fairground dodge 'em that bounces off everything it touches. Fairhaven City is a wonderful playground - its tall skyscrapers and sandy beaches provide the perfect backdrop to the carnage. Sadly, the takedown camera - a staple in many-a-Criterion game has vanished. Although crashes are stunningly realistic, often reducing cars to piles of twisted metal, they are all over too quickly. Upon taking down an opponent, you have to look in the rear view mirror to see the result - rather than a slow-motion cinematic that served as a wonderful payoff in Hot Pursuit. But bar this blip, Most Wanted is a frantic, adrenalin-soaked racing game that refuses to take its foot off the gas.

Shopping mad British women walk more than 200 miles, the equivalent of eight marathons, each year simply by visiting their favourite stores. A new study has discovered that women walk two miles over a three hour period during twice weekly shopping trips. Over a year, that equates to walking 208 miles and burning off 14,844 calories, or 67 bars of chocolate. Finally an excuse! Over a lifetime we walk 12,000 miles just by hitting the stores, which is more than the distance from London to Sydney . During a lifetime, shoppers can expect to walk over 12,000 miles which is a little more than walking from London to Sydney (10,557miles) as the crow flies. The study was carried out with a group of shoppers who were asked to wear a pedometer when out shopping over a four week period to measure the distance they walked. Small trips to buy everyday essentials were not included in the study which instead focused on the weekly supermarket shop and visits to shopping centres, the high street and city centre retailers. One of those who took part commented: 'I love to shop and can easily waste hours pottering around stores over the weekend. The shopping workout: Shopping burns off 14,844 calories each year . 'While I’m out I don’t give a lot of thought to how far I’ve walked, but by the time I get home my feet are killing me so I know I’ve gone some distance.' Another added: 'I can easily walk from one end of town to the other a couple of times  during a shopping trip. I always end up buying the first thing I saw which is inevitably at the opposite end of town to where I end up!' A female shopper said: 'It never crossed my mind I was exercising while out shopping – it’s certainly more fun than going to the gym. There’s the walking which is great cardio exercise, stretching by picking things off high shelves and racks, and a work out for the arms carrying all those heavy bags of goodies home.' A spokesperson for PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who conducted the study, said: 'Most of us see popping to the shops as a leisurely pastime. However, over a three hour shopping trip you can easily cover off a couple of miles, more if you’re striding out from one end of town to the other, so you get a bit of a workout as well as indulging yourself. 'I think most of us would agree a trip to the shops beats the gym every time.'","British women walk the equivalent of eight marathons each year shopping .

Dramatic plans: Heiress Fawn James wants to turn one of her father's lap-dancing clubs into a theatre . Five years ago she inherited a 60-acre property and publishing empire in the heart of London, including, of course, the site of Britain’s first-ever strip club, the Revuebar. But now, as a film starring Steve Coogan as ‘King of Soho’ porn baron Paul Raymond is launched, his gamine granddaughter Fawn James, 27, is turning her back on the girlie shows on which her fortune was based in favour of serious theatre. Fawn, who with her younger sister India Rose inherited a vast chunk of the red-light area, will next month ask Westminster Council  for ‘a change of use’ for a table-dancing club she owns above the infamous former Revuebar, which is now the home of the louche Box nightclub, much loved by the young royals. Fawn plans to kick out the lap-dancers and create a new, 120-seat theatre which, I can reveal, she will manage herself. ‘I am really excited about it,’ says Fawn who has ambitions to become an actress. Last year, she took a course at the Lee Strasberg Institute of Film in Los Angeles and has since appeared in a play called Riot Night about the summer riots of 2011. Her grandfather opened the Revuebar in Walkers Court in 1958. The club upstairs was previously the Boulevard Theatre, which launched the careers of many comedians in the Eighties. Fawn tells me: ‘The Boulevard was the platform for the Comic Strip, Eddie Izzard and Steve Coogan. It’s our intention to introduce this space as an off-Broadway style fringe theatre in the heart of the West End.' The table-dancing club above the former Revuebar could be about to undergo a major change of entertainment . Dancers in action at Raymond Revuebar in Soho, central london . She wants her new theatre to showcase up-and-coming young playwrights and directors and I am told: ‘Fawn is going to manage the venue herself, although it may be in partnership with someone else who will be artistic director.’ She has, meanwhile, acquired an agent, Kenneth Earle, to help pursue her acting career and she will be performing in the West End chorus for The Night Of 1,000 Stars at the Royal Albert Hall on May 5. Fawn, who shares her life with Nottingham University graduate Nick Lawson, whom she met backpacking in Thailand, is planning to overhaul Walkers Court, cleaning up the facades of the buildings and improving the lighting and paving.

Samantha Cameron gave a respectful nod to Margaret Thatcher today as she arrived for the great leader's funeral wearing a pussy-bow blouse - the very distinctive style of blouse made popular by Baroness Thatcher herself. Mrs Cameron could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute - unless it had been blue, of course - to pay her respects to Britain's first female Prime Minister and longest serving PM in 150 years. Paying respects: Samantha wore a pussy-bow blouse by French label Paul & Joe for the funeral of Baroness Thatcher today, no doubt in tribute to the Iron Lady's fondness for the style .

If smartly . cut jackets, sensible skirts and large shoulder pads gave Thatcher . presence and the masculine edge that helped her dominate in a man's . world, the addition of those pussy-bow blouses - Thatcher herself called them 'softening and pretty - rounded the edges of the masculine look. Margaret Hilda Thatcher may have been an indefatigable politician and imposing opponent - but she understood the power of the correct clothes. Always well dressed - she famously took advice from Gordon Reece that led her to leave her easy-to-mock hats behind and dress in a more approachable way - she often said it was not 'unfeminine to be well-tailored'. Indeed, she said, 'it often perhaps concentrates . on what you are going to say if you have got well-tailored things on . because people no longer look at your clothes.' Inside the ceremony: Samantha Cameron with Prime Minister David Cameron, with an emotional George Osbourne to the rear .

But it . was not until Thatcher met her wealthy future husband, Denis, that she . could afford to spend a lot of money on outfits. She soon forged her . trademark style of colourful suits, hats, handbags, pearls - and, of course, those blouses. Feminine touch: Thatcher said she often wore pussy-bow blouses because they were 'rather softening and pretty' Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that didn't mean forgoing femininity . The former Conservative leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire TV in 1985, saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish. She said: 'What you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable. You must be comfortable. You are going to a great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in. It must be a fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.' While the Baroness knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously, she also did not want to lose her femininity. 'You do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a Prime Minister,' she said. This is why she loved her pussy-bow blouse so much. 'I often wear bows; they are rather softening, they are rather pretty,' she said. Political wives: Sarah Brown arriving at St Paul's cathedral today, left, and Miriam with husband Nick Clegg, right .

Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James has competition for her erotic fiction throne... and Sylvia Day - sitting pretty at the top of Kindle's steamiest chart with her Crossfires novel Entwined With You - had better watch out. Another woman has been churning out racy tales of sex and sadomasochism as fast as her hot little hand will allow, and her new one hit the top of the Amazon charts within two weeks of its release. And thanks to the online success of With This Collar, the first of Manchester-born Sierra Cartwright's six-part Mastered series, the e-book is now being published in print by Total-E-Bound Publishing. Sierra Cartwright's steamy novel, With This Collar, claims to be even racier than Fifty Shades Of Grey by British writer EL James . With This Collar tells the story of Julia Lyle, who finds herself . unexpectedly thrown into the world of BDSM at her best friend's . wedding. As she begins to object during a . ceremony in which her friend vows submission to her new husband, she is . stopped by Marcus Cavendish, who offers to introduce her into the clandestine lifestyle. Speaking to Handbag.com, Cartwright said: 'I had written nine books but then I went through a difficult divorce and I channelled all my creative energy in to writing murder mystery novels, but I ended up taking a break. 'I've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce I started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband. 'So I actually had a little bit of experience that was helpful, and it allowed me bring an added dynamic to the romances that I write.' Cartwright said: 'I've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce I started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband' Claire Siemaszkiewicz, CEO of Total-e-Bound, said: 'We watched the 50 Shades phenomenon with interest, we've seen the copy cats so we decided to get right under the skin of what women want when it comes to their ""me time"" reading material. 'Over the last 2 months we've surveyed 1800 women in the UK and US and we know that they're hungry for well-written, sexy stories about love, power and relationships.

'Would you like to offer your submission?' Ben asked. Lana tipped back her head. 'Yes, Sir, I would.' Damien picked up something from the mantel and offered it to Ben. Julia stood on her toes, trying to get a better look. 'To the vanilla world it looks like a silver necklace with a lock on it,' Marcus said. 'But those of us in the lifestyle recognise it for what it is. A collar.' 'Collar?' Julia repeated. The word startled her so much that she didn't think to ask what he meant by lifestyle. 'Some people use dog collars from the pet store,' he said. 'You can't be serious.' 'Deadly.' She wrapped her arms around her middle. 'In this case, it appears to be an ordinary piece of jewellery, but it likely has a hex screw so that she can't remove it.' Ben accepted the necklace from Damien and passed the chain through the flame of an enormous candle. 'He's purifying the metal,' Marcus explained. 'And then he'll ask her again if her submission is given of her own free will.' Ben looked down at Lana and captured her chin before saying, 'I offer you this collar as a symbol of my love, and as a promise to be a kind, consistent and honourable Master. In return, I will demand your servitude. I will enforce the rules we have agreed to, and I will never touch you in anger.' Lana linked her hands at the small of her back, while she continued to meet her new husband's gaze. Firmly she said, 'I accept your gift. In return, I offer my humble devotion and a promise of my servitude.' To Julia, the words sounded just as practised as their traditional vows had. 'We're here in front of our friends and mentors, and I want everyone to hear your assurance that you are willingly agreeing to be my slave.' The blood chilled in Julia's veins. As if Marcus sensed it, he tightened his grip on her. Oddly, the touch reassured and grounded her rather than annoyed her. 'I am joyfully agreeing to be your slave, Sir.'

A controversial new BBC reality TV show is under investigation by police over the shocking driving offences committed by teenage motorists on the programme. Barely Legal Drivers, broadcast on BBC Three, uses dashboard cameras to film youngsters screaming swear words at other drivers and talking on mobile phones while behind the wheel. Now more than 300 viewers have complained about the behaviour of the teenagers, and police are looking into whether any of the participants should be prosecuted for their sloppy driving. Many have expressed outrage at the fact that some contestants are apparently rewarded by being given a free car by the BBC. Scroll down for video . Screaming: Chantelle Jefferies, 19, is shown yelling obscenities at other motorists on Barely Legal Drivers but was given a free car at the end of the programme . Danger: Tommy, left, had to be prevented from driving while drunk during his appearance . The show hit the headlines even before its premiere after one teenager revealed that she had been tricked into taking part by being told that the programme would be similar to The Only Way Is Essex. In the first episode, broadcast last week and seen by 700,000 viewers, 19-year-old Chantelle Jefferies from Bristol was shown repeatedly yelling obscenities, talking on her mobile while driving and even eating a sandwich on the road. She also applied lipstick while cruising on the motorway, and screamed in surprise when a bus pulled out in front of her at a junction. However, at the end of the episode she was judged to have learned her lesson, and producers gave her father enough money to buy her a brand new car. Offences: Kayla is one of several teenager drivers shown in risky situations on the BBC Three show . Outrage: Bradley shown taking a breathalyser test on the show which has attracted 300 complaints . Another boy on the programme took pride in doing 100mph on the motorway, and at one point producers had to stop him from driving after he was found to be almost twice the legal drink-drive limit. One girl featured even said: 'I drive so much better when I'm a little bit tipsy.' Each episode sees the contestants given either a car or advanced driving lessons after their driving habits are analysed by their parents and retired traffic policewoman Judith Roberts. Avon and Somerset Constabulary, Miss Jefferies' local force, is looking into the behaviour depicted in the programme. 'We are investigating the driving offences being committed on the programme and are considering prosecution,' Superintendent Paul Richards said. 'At the very least, we condemn such irresponsible behaviour and would reassure everyone that we treat it extremely seriously.' Probe: Police are investigating whether there are grounds for prosecuting the participants, who include young driver Matthew, left, pictured with a friend . Lesson: Lauri, another contestant on the show which the BBC claims teaches the importance of good driving . So far, 286 people have complained to the BBC about the dangerous driving shown, and the apparent reward of bad behaviour by a free car. In addition, 45 people had complained to regulator Ofcom by the time the second episode was broadcast on Tuesday. Road safety charity Barke warned that Barely Legal Drivers must ensure that 'depictions of risky driving aren't glamourised'. The BBC insists that the programme rewards those who learn from their mistakes and improve their driving, adding that the car given out as a reward is 'sensible' and has a small engine. 'Barely Legal Drivers highlights the issue that young drivers in the UK are some of the most dangerous in Europe,' a spokesman said. 'It's about making young people better drivers.' Before the show aired one contestant, Amy Smith, complained that she had been tricked into appearing after producers told her it would be a glossy lifestyle programme like Towie or Made in Chelsea.","Barely Legal Drivers on BBC Three shows teens swearing and speeding .

Richard de Wit (left), who . is accused of murdering British backpacker Sarah Groves (seen right last . November) in India . Last night, Srinagar's Deputy Inspector General Aftul ul Mujtada said his detectives were investigating the loans separate from the inquiry into her murder. They . suspect that Saeed Shoda and his family may have befriended Ms Groves . in the southern state of Goa to dupe her into giving them money. He has told Mr Shoda the money must be repaid to Ms Groves' family. Ms Groves was attacked and stabbed to death in her room on the Shoda family's New Beauty houseboat hotel on Srinagar's picturesque Lake Dal in the early hours of April 5. De Wit, was arrested for her murder and later said he had killed her under the influence of cannabis, which had aggravated his paranoid condition, police said. The victim had been living with Saeed Shoda and his family for several months after they met and began a relationship in Goa during Christmas. Family: Saeed Shoda said Sarah had been enjoying her time with the family. The family is now under investigation . Discovered: Police said the 24-year-old was found inside the boat on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir . Scene: The houseboat where the body of Sarah Groves was found in Srinagar . He had invited her to his home where they had shared a room and she had lived as part of the Shoda family. Members . of the Shoda family have given many interviews to newspapers and . television stations voicing their grief at her death and describing her . as 'like a daughter' to them. But the disclosure that the financially comfortable family had borrowed large sums of money from Ms Groves has raised questions about the true nature of their relationship. Location: Houseboat owner Abdul Rahim Shoda speaks on his mobile phone near the house boat where the body was found . 'Wonderful girl': One of the sons of the owner of the houseboat owner described her as 'a wonderful girl' who had stayed on the boat for the last two months . Kashmiri neighbours said it was highly unusual for conservative Islamic families in Kashmir to be happy about unmarried couples sleeping together in their homes, while others noted that Ms Groves had been working hard in the family kitchen throughout her stay. The Daily Telegraph reported today that DIG ul Mujtada said: 'The family of Sarah have expressed some misgivings about the [Shoda] family. 'Sarah had given Saeed some money. Since they were in Goa she gave him four to five lakhs (£5,000 to £6,200) and it must be paid back.' There have been a number of cases in recent years of Kashmiri men starting relationships with foreign women to dupe them into giving them money, he added. In 2008, Patrina Churm, a 55-year-old divorcee from Gateshead, was left penniless after her 30-year-old Kashmiri boyfriend siphoned her bank accounts and cheated her out of more than £80,000 by promising they would spend their lives together. Months earlier another British woman, 54-year-old Sarah Matheson was also cheated out of £80,000 by a Kashmiri man she fell in love with while holidaying in Goa. Richard De Wit, the accused, has told detectives the Shoda family had also asked to borrow money from him, but the Shoda family denied his claim. Last night Saeed Shoda confirmed he had borrowed money from Ms Groves but denied there was an ulterior motive. She had given him 458,000 Rupees, just under £5,500. He said: 'We had personal plans, we were in love, it's personal, what we wanted to do. Now it doesn't matter so I gave it back to her Dad. It doesn't matter because I lost someone who was everything to me.'","Detectives reveal they are investigating boyfriend of Ms Groves .

Operations Superintendent Tracy Bradley, of Humberside Police, said: 'Our deepest thoughts go out to the family and friends of those who were tragically killed in this collision which happened on the A18 yesterday. We are working closely with relatives of those who lost their lives and are supporting them through what will be a very difficult time.

But there was no doubting the power of her sense of style. And while Samantha Cameron paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher by wearing a pussy-bow blouse at her funeral yesterday, it is the Iron Lady's signature handbag that is causing more of a storm out in the real world. Since the announcement of Baroness Thatcher’s death, luxury bag firm Launer - the brand also favoured by the Queen - has seen a 53 per cent rise in sales of the black structured handbag that Thatcher loved. Thatcher's handbag became associated both with her personal fashion and her political personality, with her fiery temper and the permanent presence of her rigid black bag causing MPs to coin the phrase 'handbagging' The Baroness favored classic styles, often in black, such as the Bellini (left) and Adagio (right) style, which have both had a increase in sales following her death last Monday . Thatcher’s love of a good handbag - frequently a Launer - became inextricably linked to her political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined the phrase ‘handbagging’ - a reference . to both the structured  handbags she always carried and the dressing downs she would give her team. And now sales of the styles Thatcher treasured the most, including the Bellini and the Adagio, have seen a huge jump in sales. In a reflection of the impact of her death, the biggest spike in sales came at 9.30am on the day of her funeral and on the evening of Monday 8 April after the announcement of her passing. Gerald . Bodmer, CEO of Launer London, fondly remembers how the relationship . between his Launer London label and Baroness Thatcher began, ‘It was the . early 80s and I saw a rather humorous cartoon in a national broadsheet . of Baroness Thatcher waving around a rather understated handbag, and it . suddenly struck me that she should be wearing our bags. Styles including the Bellini handbag the Adagio handbag which were her most treasured styles have seen a huge jump in sales since her death . Thatcher's love of her black handbags spanned her entire political career, from her election to a member of parliament, to well after she had left Downing Street and retired . ‘With Her Majesty The Queen a loyal supporter of Launer for many years by now, it seemed only fitting. ‘I . sent one of our handbags (in standard issue black, in the highest . quality) from our mainline collection to her with a cutting of the . cartoon, and not long afterwards received a personal letter of thanks . from Baroness Thatcher herself, who adored it. ‘I . suspected she appreciated my sense of humour, also. Thus, a . longstanding relationship between Launer and Baroness Thatcher began . until her passing this week'. The Queen has long been a fan of Launer bags, awarding the company a Royal Warrant in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations . Samantha Cameron wore a pussy bow blouse for the funeral of Baroness Thatcher yesterday, perhaps in tribute to the Iron Lady's fondness for the style (left) Whilst Baroness Thatcher embraced the gesture of a Launer handbag as a gift, she insisted on always purchasing them herself, or through her shopper who struck up a lasting friendship with Gerald. Baroness Thatcher would always send a letter of acknowledgement to Gerald whenever she purchased a Launer handbag. She would usually make two purchases . yearly throughout the 80s and 90s, all in a very, simple structured . style in black or nude tones. Baroness . Thatcher would always emphasise in her personal letters to Gerald how . much she wanted to support British business and would often purposefully . carry Launer bags on foreign appointments. ‘There . is a great deal of noise made around Made In Britain these days, which . we are a great advocate of as all our product is made in our factory in . Walsall with traditional British handmade techniques. Baroness Thatcher . really understood the ethos of Launer and this is something she wanted . to be associated with. Interestingly, she would only buy bags for . daywear, never eveningwear’ Gerald says. The firm experienced a similar spike in sales after the Jubilee celebrations when the monarch was pictured on multiple . occasions with her trusty Launer bags. Then, the majority of sales were . international, whereas in the case of Margaret Thatcher's sales spike, . over 75 per cent of those purchasing the bags were in the UK. Launer has also seen a 43 per cent sales rise with its more colourful handbags and clutchbags including the Traviata handbag in yellow (left) and the Lisa handbag in green (right) Bags of laughter: A happy Queen Elizabeth pictured with two handbags as she toured the Launer leather factory in 1991 . 'When .

President Obama is cast in a negative light in the upcoming movie about the Osama bin Laden raid as it opens with 15 graphic minutes of a terror suspect being waterboarded. Moments later, the screen flashes to a news interview of the then-President elect talking about how he does not believe in torture. Conservatives were quick to criticize the film Zero Dark Thirty, preemptively proclaiming that it would prove to be a campaign tool for President Obama, but now select critics have actually seen the film, political pundits may be forced to eat their words. Another criticism of the film was that director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (both of The Hurt Locker fame) received special treatment by the Obama administration during the production stages of the film, but both have denied such claims. 'It was all based on first hands accounts so it really felt . very vivid and very vital and very, very immediate and visceral of . course which is very exciting as a film maker,' Bigelow said without revealing any specific sources. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hints: A trailer for the film shows one agent (Jessica Chastain) watching footage of an intrrogation . Hard to watch: Chastain stars as the tough agent Maya who is present in the first 15 minutes of the film which are filled completely by the torture of a detainee . The film has been . controversial from its inception but now the hot button issue is the use . of waterboarding rather than the partisan slant. Poster: The film 'Zero Dark Thirty,' which details the hunt for Osama bin Laden is non-political . At one point, an agent tells a . captured al Qaeda leader that he should just give up early in the . ‘interrogation’ process because it would just be easier. ‘In the end, bro, everybody breaks. It’s biology,’ the agent named Dan, played by actor Jason Clarke, tells a terror suspect. While the public will have to wait to . evaluate the torture scenes until the film is released- which will take . place in select markets on December 19 but not until January 11 . nationwide- TIME Magazine’s Richard Corliss say that the CIA operative’s . methods include the use waterboarding, a dog collar, heavy metal . soundtracks on full blast throughout the day, and food deprivation. ‘Once you see it, you’ll be writing to your congressman to prevent it from happening again,’ Showbiz411 critic Roger Friedman says of the waterboarding of a suspected terrorist. It is in the context of the waterboarding debate where President Obama makes his sole appearance in the film, as the screen flashes to a real 2008 news clip where he says that he doesn’t believe in torture. Though it is unclear which news clip is used in the film, there are plenty to choose from. One of the clearest examples is a sit-down interview that the then-President-elect had with 60 Minutes just days after he won the presidency in November of 2008. During the lengthy interview, Obama asserts: 'I have said repeatedly that America doesn't torture and I'm going to make sure we don't torture.' Possibility: In Zero Dark Thirty, a news clip from 2008 shows then-President-elect Obama talking about his stance against torture. He said so repeatedly, including during the pictured interview with 60 Minutes . Though the film claims to avoid the partisan nature of the debate on what torture should be condoned to allow for the retrieval of critical information, the juxtaposition of Obama's statement against torture next to 15 gritty minutes of a waterboarding scene shows a clear disconnect between what what was being said on the issue and what was actually happening. He stood by this belief as he transitioned into office, and one of the first executive orders that he signed banning torture techniques- even explicitly citing waterboarding as one that was outlawed- during his first week in office. The framing of the President’s stance in the film comes as a bit of a surprise to many, since he and his administration reportedly allowed the filmmakers- director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal- access to a number of classified information. Once news broke of the . administration’s willingness to work with the Hollywood heavyweights- . Bigelow won the Oscar for Best Director and Boal for Best Writing for . their work on The Hurt Locker- Republicans cried afoul. Congressman . Peter King, the Republican head of the House Committee on Homeland . Security, called for an investigation into whether or not the filmmakers . were given confidential information during the making of the . blockbuster. Chilling: In the film American agents (like the one portrayed by this actor in the film's trailer) are shown torturing suspects by blasting metal music, depriving them water and sleep, and waterboarding them . Adding to the expected outcry, The Center for Responsive Politics . reports that there was one Kathryn Bigelow who donated $200 to the . Obama campaign in 2011- right when she would have been working on the . film- though she has not publicly supported any political candidates in . the past. Waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the CIA in their interrogation of terror suspects. The specifics of the tactics differ, but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head. It is thought to simulate drowning, and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die. The official stance on it's use has varied over the years, though the CIA has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three al Qaeda operatives, including self-proclaimed '9/11 mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In an interview with ABC's Nightline, Bigelow and Boal said that they never asked any politicians for any top-secret information. 'I certainly did a lot of homework, but I never asked for classified material. To my knowledge I never received any,' Boal said, as he was the one to research and write the screenplay. 'I picked up the phone and started calling sources and asking them what they knew and taking referrals and knocking on doors and really approached it as comprehensively as I could,' he told Nightline. '(The CIA agents) were proud of what they had done, but they had more or less resigned themselves to the fact that what they had done is not something they could talk about publicly. 'But one of the things a movie allows people to do is talk in a way that is a little bit freer because they know that movies can change the way people look, [and] that I don't have quite the same standards of having to reveal sources as I would if I was, let's say, running a front page piece in the New York Times.' King’s knee jerk reaction against Obama administration involvement may have been too soon, however, as the full extent of the film’s depiction of torture was not fully realized until a critic’s screening took place over the weekend. Hints of the inclusion of torture came in the second version of the trailer, which opens with the voice of an agent presumably warning a detainee. ‘Can I be honest with you? I am bad news. I'm not your friend, I'm not going to help you, I'm going to break you,’ the American actor says. CIA: The film focuses on, Maya, the 'wicked smart' female CIA agent played by actress Jessica Chastain who was obsessed with catching and killing bin Laden, pictured . Women of the film: Chastain plays the lead character (left) and said that she knew the film would be politically controversial, while director Kathryn Bigelow (right) said that the torture scenes were the hardest to film . In another clip, the film’s lead, . actress Jessica Chastain who plays the intense CIA agent Maya, is seen . watching footage of an interrogation where the suspect has a cloth . covering his head as his hands are bound behind the chair. According . to the TIME review, Maya sits quietly as Dan tortures the suspect named . Ammar. At one point, Ammar turns to Maya pleading 'your friend is an . animal. Please help me,' but she allows it to continue. According to the critics, the film’s focus on the decade-long hunt for the terrorist mastermind takes the attention away from the partisan politics and onto the true facts of what took place in the years, and eventually, final days leading up to the killing. Operation: Bin Laden's body was identified and buried out to sea after the raid, pictured as portrayed in the film . ‘I knew the second I read the script and I was learning things, I knew that it was going to be a hot-button issue,’ Chastain previously told The Wrap. ‘Even when we were shooting, there was great care to be as respectful to the story as possible. For me, that was the most important thing: that we tell the right story for history’s sake.’ For the director, that meant the jarring waterboarding scenes, which she said were the most difficult to film. ‘I wish that it wasn't a part of history, but it is and was,’ she said.

She was perhaps paying tribute to the Iron Lady, famous for her political wardrobe of pillbox hats and pussy-bow blouses. But Samantha Cameron’s choice of outfit to Baroness Thatcher’s funeral failed to take off with fashion watchers. Her gold pussy-bow blouse and neat grey hat inspired a bout of mild teasing on Twitter, where she was likened to an air stewardess. Some even reworked her nickname, dubbing the Prime Minister’s wife ‘PanAm SamCam’. One user, Vivienne Clore asked: ‘Why . did Sam Cam come dressed as a flight attendant?’ Rosie Ellis wrote: ‘Sam . Cam is channelling her inner air hostess with choice of outfit today. I . keep expecting her to point out the exits.’ And Nizaar Kinsella said: ‘I’m sure I saw SamCam working on my EasyJet flight the other day.’ As a fashion power player, Mrs Cameron puts a lot of thought into her attire. She knows clothes deliver a message – . hence her prudent ‘recycling’ of the same clothes for public . engagements, and her desire to team expensive pieces with low-cost . brands such as Zara, Topshop and Hobbs. For high-profile occasions, Mrs Cameron . usually looks the antithesis of a traditional Tory wife, choosing to . champion up-and-coming and edgy British labels such as Alessandra Rich . or Jonathan Saunders. Distinctive style: Mrs Cameron could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute, . looking elegant but demure as she arrived at Westminster Abbey with her . husband . True blues: Samantha held the PM's hand as they walked to the service, a dark wool coat worn over her skirt and Paul & Joe blouse and an elegant sinamay hat, mirroring a style often wore by Baroness Thatcher . And because fussy buttoned-up necklines are strictly not her usual style, it’s all the more unthinkable that yesterday’s blouse, teamed with a black pencil skirt, nude Jimmy Choo ‘Agnes’ heels, costing £360, and dark grey pillbox hat, was unintentional. The pussy-bow is a style that our first and only woman prime minister trademarked during her tenure, most notably during a photocall aboard the ‘Thatcher Battle Bus’, ahead of her first election victory in 1979. Pussy-bow blouses first became fashionable in the 1940s, but the sterner more buttoned-up power dressing version we know today found favour in the late 1970s and remained popular throughout the 1980s. Seen as the feminine equivalent to a man’s shirt and tie, the style became the office staple for a new generation of women in male-dominated offices who wanted to look powerful but feminine. No wonder then, that Lady Thatcher wore a great many versions of this look to one of the most masculine of all work places – Parliament. Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that didn't mean forgoing femininity . The bows, which she personally deemed ‘softening and pretty’ were used to temper the formal skirt suits that were the complementary weapon in her power-dressing armoury. ‘What you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable,’ she said at the time. ‘You must be comfortable. You are going to a great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in. 'It must be a fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.’ Monochrome Choice: Cherie Blair's hat resembled a cake tin while Norma Major teamed a pearl necklace with a white trimmed hat . Formal: Harriet Harman dressed in a traditional fedora hat while Theresa may's headwear was inspired by Downton Abbey . Which is more than can be said for Mrs Cameron, whose outfits have caused controversy – and plenty of Twitter debate – before. Her decision to wear a jewelled hairpiece, rather than a hat, to the Royal wedding two years ago caused much consternation, as did some of her outfits during the Camerons’ Washington visit last year. However, Lady Thatcher would perhaps have approved of Mrs Cameron’s frugal approach to dressing. Although the gold blouse by French designer Paul & Joe was a hefty £280, she has worn it twice before – to a tea party in 2008, then to her daughter Florence’s christening in 2011. Chic and cosy: Shirley Bassey, left, wore a warm looking fur hat, while Miriam Clegg had her hat at the right angle . Mrs Cameron did seem to get the dress code right in one respect: Neat millinery was the order of  the day, with political wives and celebrities all opting for small  chic hats. Carol Thatcher’s chic felt fascinator featured an over-sized bow and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece chose a small hat topped with a circle of net and a brooch embellishment. Subtle Sarah: Mrs brown chose neat millinery . While Sarah Brown got the memo, perching her hat decorated with a birdcage veil and flower on the back of her head, Cherie Blair missed the mark with a large hat reminiscent of a cake tin covered in satin. Dame Shirley Bassey chose to keep warm in a trim fur beret, while Dame Norma Major, wife of former prime minister Sir John, opted for a classic black and white hat, which she teamed with a double string of pearls. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam looked effortlessly chic in a flat saucer hat with a sculpted veil, which she wore to the side of her head. Foreign Secretary William Hague’s wife Ffion wore an elegant black velvet pillbox hat, and Labour leader Ed Miliband’s wife Justine wore a pillbox hat that was subtle and discreet. Less successful were the choices of deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and Home Secretary Theresa May. While Miss Harman opted for a casual-looking felt fedora, Mrs May managed to obscure most of her face with a 1920s style hat, featuring a large satin bow, which could have come straight off the set of Downton Abbey. The rest of her outfit did just the trick however, as she paired a black pencil skirt with a cropped black suit jacket buttoned at the waist.

Tiger Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn's ex-husband jokingly posted on Twitter today that he was the television viewer who ratted out Tiger's illegal ball drop during the Masters tournament. 'No problem Masters tournament happy to call in and help. You always have to keep an eye on those cheaters ;)' Thomas Vonn wrote yesterday while linking to a news story about Woods, who notoriously cheated on his wife with a bevy of women. Woods finished Saturday, day three of the prestigious major golf competition, tied for seventh place as he's three-under par. He's four strokes behind the leaders, Brandt Snedeker and Angel Cabrera. Sweet justice: Thomas Vonn, whose ex-wife Lindsey is now dating Tiger Woods, said yesterday on Twitter that he was the one who ratted out Tiger's cheating at the Masters . Although Woods was allowed to keep playing, not everyone agreed with that move. Six-time major champion Sir Nick Faldo says Woods needs to do 'the manly thing' and withdraw from the tournament after he was spared by a 2012 rule on Friday provided to players believed to have committed an honest mistake. Woods, however, later admitted to knowingly taking his ball drop two yards further back from where he hit his original shot - a rules violation that provided him with an improper advantage after sinking his ball in Rae's Creek. Outrage: Tiger Woods takes a drop on the 15th hole after his ball went into the water during the second round of the Masters golf tournament on Friday, one that launched cries for his disqualification . Pressure: Six-time major champion Sir Nick Faldo, seen with Woods in 2006 in Hoylake, England, says he needs to 'man up' and resign from the 2013 tournament . 'I went back to where I played it from, but went two yards further back and I tried to take two yards off the shot of what I felt I hit,' Woods said on Friday while three shots out of the lead. 'And that should land me short of the flag and not have it either hit the flag or skip over the back. I felt that was going to be the right decision to take off four (yards) right there. And I did. It worked out perfectly.' It was that statement that launched a firestorm of uproar, and on Saturday led to a 2-stroke penalty by the Masters committee. 'He should really sit quietly with whoever he trusts, [long-time agent] Mark Steinberg, a few others, maybe Lindsey [Vonn, his girlfriend] as well, and sit and just go, ""wow, I would be doing the manly thing to go, I have broken the rules of golf,""' Faldo told the Golf Channel on Saturday. 'There is some leeway with the signing the incorrect (score) card. Not with . intentionally not dropping as near as possible,' Tweeted David Duval, a former World Number One golfer. It was a television viewer who brought Woods’ illegal drop on the 15th hole to officials' attention, which would have been otherwise missed, according to a statement by Augusta National. Happier times: Lindsey Vonn with then husband Thomas. Lindsey and Tiger Woods announced they were dating recently and his play as markedly improved . Sunk: Woods reacts after the ball went into the water on the 15th hole, a trap that gave him three options to wiggle out of, one he's said to have illegally performed . While Woods was on the 18th hole, officials consequently reviewed footage of his drop before announcing their decision - a pardoning one. 'The penalty of disqualification was waived by the Committee under Rule 33 as the Committee had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of [Woods’] round,' Fred Ridley, the committee's chairman said. According to USGA Rule 33-7: ‘A penalty of disqualification may in exceptional individual cases be waived, modified or imposed if the committee such action warranted. If a Committee considers that a player is guilty of a serious breach of etiquette, it may impose a penalty of disqualification under this Rule.’ The committee issued him a 2-stroke . penalty on Saturday morning Woods says strictly because of his interview . on Friday that appeared to express his admission of knowing wrong . doing. Leader: Jason Day of Australia, seen during the second round of the 2013 Masters Tournament, starts the third round on Saturday 6 under . On Saturday, roughly an hour before teeing off, Woods released the following statement claiming he didn't realize he was so detrimentally far from his original place before taking that shot. ‘I didn’t know I had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard,’ Woods tweeted. ‘Subsequently, I met with the Masters Committee Saturday morning and was advised they had reviewed the incident prior to the completion of my round. 'Their initial determination was that there was no violation, but they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview. After discussing the situation with them this morning, I was assessed a two-shot penalty. I understand and accept the penalty and respect the Committee' decision.' Round three: Woods, right, is seen putting on the practice green before the third round on Saturday afternoon after assessed a 2-stroke penalty by the rules committee for the drop on Friday . Playing fair: Woods, seen on Saturday, started the year with a rules violation after taking relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in Abu Dhabi which was determined not allowed in the sand . Woods will begin 5 strokes behind leader Jason Day on Saturday afternoon, who's 6 under. The revision to Rule 33 was based upon the modern era of television. One example cited was Padraig Harrington, who opened with a 65 in Abu Dhabi at the start of the 2011 season. Harrington was disqualified when a slow-motion replay on high-definition TV revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly after he replaced his marked. Harrington didn't realize it had moved - a two-shot penalty - and was disqualified for an incorrect card. That same year, Camilo Villegas was disqualified in Hawaii when a TV viewer noticed he tamped down a divot in an area where his chip was rolling back down a slope. Rule 33 would not have applied there because Villegas did not know the rule. Woods started the year with a rules violation. He took relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in Abu Dhabi. It was determined that relief was not allowed in the sand. He was docked two shots before signing his card, and it caused him to miss the cut. Hunter Mahan summed up the mess on Twitter: ""If you think tiger should be dq'd your not wrong, if you think 2 shot penalty is enough your not wrong. Not sure the right answer.""","Masters Committee spared Woods' disqualification on Friday while believing he committed an honest mistake .

Margaret Thatcher ‘would not be the slightest bit upset’ by the controversy generated by her death and modern Britain needs a dash of her resolve, William Hague said last night. The Foreign Secretary paid tribute as a ICM poll for the Guardian showed the Tories would soar to 40 per cent in the polls if Lady Thatcher were still its leader. Devoting his entire annual speech at the Lord Mayor’s Easter Banquet to her memory, Mr Hague suggested the Tories needed to show Thatcherite determination on issues ranging from reform of public services to tax rates and Britain’s future in Europe. Devoted: Foreign secretary William Hague paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher in his speech yesterday . In death as in life, Lady Thatcher had ‘drawn both praise and opposition’, he noted. Speaking of her legacy, he said: ‘She, who prized freedom above all things, would not be in the slightest bit upset by the disagreement.’ Paying lavish tribute to the former prime minister, the Foreign Secretary quoted his predecessor Douglas Hurd, who recalled her using the words of Shakespeare’s Henry V as she prepared for the Falklands War: ‘He who hath no stomach for this fight, let him depart.’ Inspiration: William Hague with Margaret Thatcher in 1999 who said he was shaped by her achievements . Speaking of her legacy William Hague said she prized freedom above all things and would not be upset by the disagreement . Support: Margaret Thatcher with a 16-year-old schoolboy William Hague after he received a standing ovation from delegates during the debate on economic policy at the Tory Party conference in Blackpool in 1977 . Citing tributes ranging from former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to the leaders of Kuwait and Estonia, Mr Hague hailed her ‘moral clarity’, saying governments around the world could learn from her example. He suggested this decade is again one in which Britain must demonstrate her ‘firmness of purpose’, including having ‘the resolve to confront our national debt, reform our schools, our health system, our welfare system and our tax system’. The Guardian poll puts Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 32, the Liberal Democrats on 15 and UKIP, nine. But when voters were asked ‘imagine for a moment that a younger Margaret Thatcher were the leader’, it suggests that the Tories would rise to 40 per cent, putting them three points ahead of Labour, which would fall to 37. Mr Hague said while some, including him, would ‘always be inspired and shaped by her achievements... others may never reconcile themselves to her policies or her character’. But he noted that from friend or foe, tributes to Lady Thatcher had been ‘strikingly unanimous’. Abroad, her name will always be synonymous with firmness, national pride and strength of character, and that is something for us all to be proud of,’ he said.","William Hague said Margaret Thatcher would not be upset by the controversy caused by her death .

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hoped the offer of a 'compromise' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among Tory and Lib Dem MPS . Eric Pickles has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over his plans to allow homeowners to build huge extensions without planning permission. Following a revolt by Tory and Lib Dem backbenchers, the Communities Secretary yesterday promised to water down his unpopular proposals in a bid to avoid outright defeat when the legislation faced a Commons vote. Despite his efforts, 16 Tories and eight Lib Dems still voted against the Growth and Infrastructure Bill yesterday. Many more abstained, cutting the Coalition’s majority to just 27. The embarrassing U-turn throws into disarray the Government’s ‘planning free-for-all’ which is aimed at boosting the building trade. It enables homeowners to build 26ft extensions in their garden without planning permission, doubling the current limit. Opponents have slammed Mr Pickles’ proposals as neighbours and local councils would be powerless to object to unsightly developments. No details have yet been released about the compromise promised by Mr Pickles, but rebels – led by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith – have warned they will have no hesitation in voting against the revised plans if they are not good enough. On Monday night, planning minister Nick Boles launched a last-minute bid to persuade rebels to drop their opposition to the proposals by inviting them to face-to-face meetings. But his attempts ended in failure, forcing Mr Pickles to announce his climbdown yesterday. During a fractious debate in the Commons, Tory MP after Tory MP stood up to condemn the reforms. Andrew Bingham said: ‘We’ve heard about monstrous carbuncles. I think we could end up with a lot of small warts on properties.’ Under the government's reforms, the size of single-storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres . Anne Main said it was ‘potentially going to be extremely divisive in communities’, while Stewart Jackson said: ‘We have seldom had a situation where so many Conservative councillors and councils and other bodies have united to say this is very bad legislation. It offends against the principle of localism.’ The Commons vote was on an amendment to the Bill put forward by the House of Lords that allows councils to opt out of the planning changes limits, which the Government wanted to reject. The Local Government Association said it was disappointed the Commons had voted against the amendment. Councillor Mike Jones, chairman of its environment and housing board, said: ‘It is hugely disappointing that MPs have failed to listen to the concerns of their constituents and councils and voted against this common-sense amendment and local opt-out. Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, will vote against the law which will double the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission . ‘Imposing this home extensions free-for-all on the whole country will risk opening the floodgates to thousands of unsightly and unsuitable extensions which could create disputes between neighbours.’ Responding to the barrage of criticism, Mr Pickles said: ‘We will bring forward a revised approach on the contentious question of permitted development rights for home extensions when the Bill returns to the Lords.’ But Mr Goldsmith said the opt-out for councils was ‘in itself a modest amendment’. He added: ‘It is hard to know what further compromise the Government might accept.’ Details of the compromise will be unveiled in the coming days, with a vote in the Lords next week and another in the Commons a few days later.","Communities Secretary offers last minute deal to prevent rebellion .

Arrests: A man and a woman have been held after Cumbria's crime commissioner Richard Rhodes' expenses claims, which included limo journeys, were allegedly leaked . Three whistleblowers have been arrested after details of chauffeur- driven journeys taken by a newly-elected police tsar were leaked to the Press. Cumbria Police’s decision to launch a probe into the exposure of the £700 trips – made by its Police and Crime Commissioner Richard Rhodes – has provoked a major political row. Last night two police staff and another man were arrested as part of the inquiry into ‘disclosure of personal information’. Another police worker was suspended after agreeing to a voluntary interview. The investigation began after Mr Rhodes’ office responded to the publishing of his expenses bill for two trips in a Mercedes by ‘raising concerns’ with police. Last night MPs queued up to protest that the arrests stifled freedom of speech and set a ‘dangerous precedent’. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the police had been ‘heavy-handed’ and that whistleblowers should be protected. South Lakes MP Tim Farron added: ‘It is wrong to seek to silence whistleblowers in this case. Details of the expenses of public officials ought to be publicly available anyway, we shouldn’t have to rely on leaks to find these things out. ‘This information was in the public interest. Most councils publish this information on a regular basis so why not the police commissioner? To arrest these staff members is high-handed, a threat to free speech and a very dangerous precedent.’ Defence: Cumbria Police say that the commissioner is driven for his safety and the trips were stopped once he saw the cost . The row over Mr Rhodes’ expenses began last week when the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald published details of the trips made by him in a hired Mercedes with a driver. In one, Mr Rhodes and his wife travelled 25 miles for a dinner with the Archbishop of York at a hotel. Mr Rhodes, a churchwarden, billed the public £313 for the journey, which was not listed among his official engagements. The second journey from his office in Penrith to another hotel, the Pheasant Inn at Bassenthwaite Lake, covered 28 miles in each direction and cost taxpayers £385. The retired headmaster – who is paid £65,000 as commissioner – paid back the money after the newspaper exposed his expenses. Theresa May last night urged caution over plans for secret arrests. The Home Secretary said the Association of Chief Police Officers should be ‘very careful’ about removing the right for people to know who they detain. Under guidance being drawn up by ACPO on behalf of the judiciary, forces would be banned from revealing the names of those held on suspicion of crimes, to protect their reputation. Even families and friends would be kept in ignorance and unable to help. Mrs May told MPs: ‘These are not just black and white arguments. ‘You have to look at them very carefully in terms of the impact that they have.’ Critics say it is an assault on open justice and threatens to turn  Britain into a ‘banana republic’. His staff also said he had used a car and driver for ‘personal safety reasons’ because of his long hours and the practice had now ceased. However Cumbria Police then visited the newspaper’s editor, Colin Maughan, to ask for information and documents. He declined to pass either to officers, and yesterday said he thought officers had been on a ‘fishing expedition’. On Wednesday it was revealed that police had been arresting suspected whistleblowers. A 47-year-old man and a woman, 50, were arrested on April 10. Yesterday a 54-year-old man who is not a police employee was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Another police staff member, a 59-year-old man, was suspended after a voluntary interview. Mr Rhodes confirmed yesterday that his office had made a complaint to police about the leak. The veteran local magistrate, who won his post as Tory candidate in November’s elections, said: ‘Nothing more than concerns were raised by my office to the constabulary and a criminal investigation was not requested.’ He added that he had now asked for an investigation into the ‘scale and nature’ of the probe. The affair raises a number of questions over freedom of speech and disclosure of information that have become sensitive in the wake of Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations for Press regulation. Barrow and Furness Labour MP John Woodcock said: ‘The public rightly demand full transparency on the expenses of elected officials and will be alarmed to hear about these arrests. ‘To maintain public trust,  Richard Rhodes needs to make clear he had no conversations whatsoever with officers about the handling of this issue and explain why these claims apparently had to be brought to light by a whistleblower.’ Cumbria police said last night: ‘These arrests form part of an ongoing investigation which was launched after police received concerns that confidential information was leaked to the media relating to the Police and Crime Commissioner. ‘Initial concerns were raised by a member of staff within the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner after a member of the local media approached the OPCC for a comment on a story. ‘Cumbria Constabulary has internal whistleblowing policies and processes that support officers and staff who want to raise legitimate issues or concerns in a lawful and appropriate way.’ The affair is the second row in a week over attempts by police to put pressure on local papers. Sergeant Paul Beale of Hampshire Police phoned staff at the New Milton Advertiser to say that 80-year-old councillor Goff Beck was ‘not happy’ with a story. Days later he visited the newsroom and said the councillor was dissatisfied that the paper had ‘raked over previous stuff’. His actions were condemned by MPs and freedom of speech campaigners. The arrest of whistleblowers in Cumbria is just the latest embarassment to the newly created role of police and crime commissioners. Kent PCC Ann Barnes faced public ridicule this month after she appointed a 17-year-old as a £15,000-a-year youth crime tsar – only for the teenager to resign tearfully within a fortnight of her appointment. The teenager, Paris Brown, stepped down after she was found to have posted a string of racist and obscene rants on Twitter which ended up being investigated by her own force. Resigned: Teenager Paris Brown . Mrs Barnes has also been criticized for spending large sums on staff and equipment, including £15,000 on a battle bus she has called Ann Force One. Other PCCs who have faced controversy include former Labour minister Vera Baird QC, who is in charge of Northumbrian police. She was criticised after saying she would not prioritise tackling low-level drug use because it would take up too much of her officers’ time. In her new policing plan she has completely ignored drug use. Elected PCCs were brought in by the Coalition to introduce democracy to policing. But the campaigns to choose the first of the new commissioners failed to generate interest among members of the public, and turnouts for elections last November were as low as 10 per cent in some areas. Critics say the system has introduced an expensive and pointless layer of bureaucracy to policing. PCCs, who earn £65,000 to £100,000 depending on the size of their force, must disclose their expenses every three months, but more than half the 45 in England and Wales have failed to.

Warning: Lord Ashcroft says Labour will oust the Tories if they fail to engage with ethnic minorities in Britain . David Cameron must do more to woo non-white voters or he has no chance of  winning the next election, a former Conservative Party  donor has warned. In a hard-hitting critique, Lord Ashcroft pointed out that the Tories won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the last general election in 2010. Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the party, said: ‘Only 16 per cent of ethnic minority voters supported us at the last election. ‘We must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country, and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them. ‘There is no doubt that in 2010 this situation cost us seats.’ Lord Ashcroft released details of a poll showing that ethnic minority voters share the Tory creed that ‘if you work hard, it is possible to be very successful in Britain’. But when asked which party shares their values, they opt for Labour by a margin of more than two to one. The survey also shows that 51 per cent of ethnic minority voters have never heard of Enoch Powell, the former Tory Cabinet minister whose 1968 speech implying that immigration to the UK would lead to ‘rivers of blood’ is believed by many Tories to have alienated ethnic minority voters from the party. Asked whether they agree hard work can bring success, one of Mr Cameron’s core messages, 69 per cent of Asians agree, along with 59 per cent of black voters and 66 per cent of black Africans. Only voters of black Caribbean origin are tied 50-50. Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims are more likely than the population as a whole to agree with that statement. But asked which party shares their values, Asian voters opt for Labour over the Tories by a margin of 62 to 30 per cent and black voters by a margin of 65 per cent to 16. Just 29 per cent of Asians and 22 per cent of black voters think the Conservatives understand minorities. The poll is not all bad news for Mr Cameron, however. British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to India was seen as an attempt to reach out the UK's Indian community . A clear majority of both black and Asian voters believe Mr Cameron and George Osborne’s economic prognosis that borrowing more money now – as Labour wants – ‘will simply make matters worse’. The Prime Minister led a Cabinet meeting earlier this year at which ministers were urged to reach out to non-white voters in their constituencies. Mr Cameron and his strategists are keen to target Asian voters on the grounds that they share Tory values of thrift and hard work. His visit to India in February, during which he visited Amritsar, the holiest site for Sikhs and the scene of the worst massacre in the history of the British empire was designed to show he is taking the non-white community seriously.","Party must reach out to non-white voters or risk being ousted .

Leeds bar Revolution Electric Press have also seen a surge in orders for the tomato-based tipple. Joe Mitchell, Deputy Manager at Revolution's Electric Press venue in Leeds, says: 'The Bloody Mary is a classic cocktail served all over the world.

Bloodshot Vodka is a new British premium spirit created by chef and food and drinks writer, Mark Douglas Hill with the golden jazz era very much its inspiration. A fiery fusion of exotic spices, hot peppers and aromatics, It combines the smoothest taste with an edgy character, which makes it the ingredient of choice for the true Bloody Mary connoisseur. Distilled using only the finest English wheat, Bloodshot is created through combining both traditional and cutting edge techniques, and retails at £19.95. The primary distillation takes place in the UK’s most state-of-the-art still followed by a second distillation through Angela, a 108-year-old copper pot still that breathes life, character and texture into the premium spirit. Bloodshot has a fiery side due to the maceration process that follows, when it is infused with a carefully balanced blend of spices, aromatics and botanicals, including: smoky chipotle chilies, cracked black pepper, lemon peel, horseradish root, coriander seed, hot cayenne pepper and celery seed. The devilish spirit is then blended with lemon and lime, Worcestershire Sauce and award-winning Port from the Douro Valley. After three weeks of maturing, it passes through a four-step filtration process finishing with its distinctive deep red colour. DENI KIRKOVA .

Dennis Wyness, 36, who attacked a former teammate after he saw him helping his wife get a taxi home. Pictured with his wife Hazel on their wedding day . A professional footballer attacked a former teammate after he saw him helping his wife get a taxi home. Dennis Wyness, 36, and childhood friend Martin Bavidge had enjoyed a night out before the assault. Mr Bavidge, 32, had gone to the Babylon nightclub with the Elgin City striker and his wife Hazel after attending a fundraiser in Aberdeen on October 28 last year. Wyness, of Westhill, Aberdeenshire, disappeared from the city centre club after his wife began dancing with other men. Mr Bavidge became concerned about her as she was unsteady on her feet and offered to help her get a taxi home in the early hours of the morning. But he was punched to the ground when former Aberdeen star Wyness spotted them on the street together a short distance away from the nightclub. Wyness admitted a charge of assault when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday. Fiscal depute Lorna McLafferty said: 'The complainer was a semi-professional footballer with Peterhead Football Club. 'The accused was known to him as a childhood friend and former teammate at Peterhead Football Club.' Miss McLafferty told the court that Mr Bavidge had been on the way to a taxi rank with Mrs Wyness when he was attacked by her husband. She said he had tried to contact Wyness on his mobile phone after leaving the  Babylon nightclub but had not been able to get through. He then called in the help of a friend, Robin Ritchie, with whom he had been out earlier that evening, to help him get Mrs Wyness home. Mr Ritchie arrived at the scene and spotted Wyness walking towards them on the city's Union Street. Miss McLafferty said: 'The accused continued to walk past all the witnesses and raised the middle finger of his right hand at them. On seeing this, Mr Bavidge approached the accused and asked him what was wrong. 'Mr Bavidge and the accused were facing each other. 'Mr Ritchie saw Mr Bavidge make a motion with his  shoulder as if the accused had struck out and Mr Bavidge was observed falling backwards on the ground, striking his head on the pavement.' The court heard that Wyness had then 'casually' walked away, leaving his friend bleeding and unconscious on the ground. He was taken to hospital with head injuries and received five stitches to the back of his head. Doctors noted he had a blood clot on the inside of his cheek, which he is believed to have bitten as he fell. Former Elgin City player Dennis Wyness, 36, and childhood friend Martin Bavidge were enjoying a night out in town before the attack in the early hours of October 28 last year . Punched: Former teammate Martin Bavidge in action for Peterhead . When police officers went to the family home the following day, Mrs Wyness told them she had been intoxicated and had not seen anything happening. Her husband later went to police and made a full and frank confession. Miss McLafferty said: 'The accused admitted that he had punched Mr Bavidge once on the face due to being angry about contact Mr Bavidge was having with Mrs Wyness. 'He stated that he had not realised Mr Bavidge was seriously injured.' Sentence was deferred until next month for background reports. Outside court, defence  lawyer Charles Benzies said his client regretted what had happened. He added: 'Mr Wyness wants to apologise. He is 36 years old and has never been in trouble before. 'He hopes Mr Bavidge makes a full recovery and has no ill feelings towards him now. 'Mr Bavidge has been back playing football and it hasn't affected his career.' Wyness started his career with Aberdeen in 1996 but went on loan to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 1999. He signed for Caley Thistle in 2000 and was the club's top scorer in 2000-01. Wyness went on to play for Hearts, St Mirren, Queen of the South and Peterhead before moving to Elgin City last year.","Dennis Wyness, 36, wife Hazel and Martin Bavidge were on night out .

"By . Jenny Stalland . PUBLISHED: . 15:28 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:30 EST, 17 April 2013 . Baggy black T-shirts, vice-like sports bras and a collection of thigh-high mini skirts to re-route male attention southwards. I’ve tried everything to divert the opposite sex from staring at my rather ample chest. But no matter what I attempt, I’ve always been known as Jenny With The Big Boobs. That’s the thing about having a 34F bust: it’s the first thing people see. So, almost inevitably, it becomes your defining characteristic. Curvy curse: Jenny Stallard hates people staring at her cleavage . But more often than not the dubious attention attracted by my bangers/ puppies/fun bags — oh yes, I’ve heard all the ‘hilarious’ euphemisms — is entirely unwelcome. Please don’t think me po-faced or ‘ungrateful’ (as some of my more petite friends have labelled me), but the lascivious stares and lewd comments seem to be on the rise — even in this supposedly politically correct age. And I blame the likes of TV presenter Holly Willoughby — who is said to be a  size 34DD — who recently declared: ‘I don’t mind people fixating on my cleavage.’ The more that Ms Willough-booby, as she’s apparently happy to be known, pouts and preens and pretends she’s fine with the fact her fame revolves around her mammary glands, the more people think it’s fine to gawp at the rest of us big-breasted girls. Holly Willough-booby: The TV presenter recently declared, 'I don't mind people fixating on my cleavage' Just the other day, I encountered a man in a bar who couldn’t peel his eyes away from my cleavage: ‘God! I mean wow! Seriously — wow!’ I wanted to shout: ‘I do have an entire body — not to mention a brain — you know!’ But, of course, I didn’t say anything. Unlike any other part of your anatomy, when the joke’s about your heaving bosom, you’re simply supposed to laugh along. Despite Holly’s declarations to the contrary, a sizeable bust quickly becomes the bane of your life.Quite apart from the physical discomfort of lumbering around a 9lb bosom (yes, I once weighed them), I can’t go for a run without teenagers shouting ‘Bouncy, bouncy!’ and am yet to speak to a man who has been able to meet my gaze for any length of time. 'I'm sure there are many women who would imagine such attention boosts your confidence, but in reality it's uncomfortable' All this has made me — like everyone else — utterly obsessed with my boobs. If only they were smaller, I muse, I could for once look elegant in a dainty bikini. It wasn’t until I was 14 that my breasts began to grow out of all proportion. Those early days of shopping for bras left mental scars, with me sobbing ‘I hate my boobs’ to my mum. Two-inch-wide straps carved pink grooves into my shoulders and the cups struggled to contain my curves. ‘We all love you as you are,’ Mum would say. ‘Try not to worry.’ She meant well, but as a neat B-cup, how could she ever understand my trauma? I’m 35, but when I was a teenager more generous sizes weren’t readily available. I was consigned to an old ladies’s lingerie store near where we lived in Reigate, Surrey, which only emphasised my freakishness. I’d go home and prod my breasts in front of the mirror. They weren’t round and voluptuous: they were more teardrop-shaped and droopy. Bane of my life: Jenny believes her 34F boobs mean she can never look elegant while she's had to endure taunts of 'bouncy, bouncy' when going for a run . Recently, I flicked through an old diary and was shocked to see that such was my paranoia back then that I’d drawn a diagram of everything I hated about what I called my ‘old lady boobs’. And this was before I’d had to contend with the bewildering reactions of the opposite sex. It wasn’t until I moved from my girls’ school to a sixth form college at the age of 16 that I became painfully aware of the rubbernecking and widening eyes that my breasts elicited from hormonal young males. That’s when I started wearing the baggy black T-shirts. I’m sure there are many women who would imagine such attention boosts your confidence, but in reality it’s uncomfortable, humiliating and you just want to run away and hide. So distraught was I with my breasts in my late teens that I visited the doctor to inquire about a reduction. My GP warned me such operations come with big risks and suggested that, in time, I might grow to love my breasts. After his well-meaning words, I didn’t pursue the idea of a breast reduction, but I continued to torture myself with physical comparisons to my svelte best friend, Christine. Size matters . The best-selling bra size is 34DD - that compares to 34B in 2010, according to Debenhams . Whenever we had sleep-overs, I’d watch how she slipped effortlessly into her pyjamas. When I got changed, my breasts swung from side to side in cumbersome and clumsy unison. When I went to university in Hull, I found myself gravitating towards other busty girls. My housemate’s cleavage was as eye-popping as mine. We endured vulgar taunts about our bosoms, but took comfort in the fact we were not alone. I never dressed revealingly for dates when I was young and, even now, I refuse to display my cleavage when meeting potential suitors. I just want a man who will love me for me — and that includes my whole body and my brain. Meanwhile, my nights out in bars and clubs continue to be dominated by vulgar comments about my chest. As a woman with a larger-than-life personality, I tend to laugh off such comments. But there are times when I go home feeling genuinely upset. Would these men say anything if I was flat-chested? Or big-bottomed? I don't think so. Thanks to Holly Willoughby and her ilk, curvy women with big boobs are considered to be fair game for ribald comments from strangers. As at this time of year, I’m dreading having to strip down to a bikini on holiday. Unwelcome attention: Christina Hendricks' character in Mad Men flaunts her womanly curves but Jenny is not proud of hers . Girls with big busts tend to look like budding porn stars, even if they choose the classiest two-piece on the block (which will have to employ heavy scaffolding and cost at least £50). The extent to which my god-forsaken breasts put a dampener on everything is best summed up by a recent phone call. It was my sister Pamela, 25, ringing to tell me she was engaged and she’d like me to be her matron of honor. Of course, I congratulated her, but my very first question was: ‘Do I have to wear a strapless bridesmaid’s dress?’ Forget inquiries about the venue, the number of guests, how she was feeling — my fears about my figure clouded my reaction to her happy news. I admit this makes me feel silly, childish and a bit sad. I do wish I could learn to accept my body.Thankfully, Pamela is very laid-back and assured me that I could wear whatever made me feel most comfortable. So I would say to Holly Willoughby, and all those women who revel in comments about their breasts, to think again and realise that not every big-busted girl is happy to be judged by her boobs alone. I, for one, feel better having got that all off my chest.","Jenny Stallard admits she hates having big boobs .

On TV show The Intern last night, viewers watched as teenager Lisa Palmer from Essex secured a coveted job at fashion website my-wardrobe.com. But those who have previously watched The Devil Wears Prada, the film starring Meryl Streep as the tyrannical editor of a fashion magazine, may wonder why anyone would want to sign up to such a role? The fashion industry is notorious for its cut throat nature and The Devil Wears Prada was based on the book by Lauren Weisberger who was inspired by her own demeaning experiences when working at Vogue. Coveted role: Lisa Palmer won a job at my-wardrobe.com via TV show The Intern . The film's intern, played by Anne Hathaway, is run ragged to meet the demands of her boss from getting her the next installment of Harry Potter before it has been published to looking after her pet dog and remembering how everyone in the office takes their coffee. But after securing her role as an intern at my-wardrobe.com, Lisa, 18, said she is delighted to report the job is nothing like she expected. 'The fashion industry is better than I . thought. I did think it would be a bit more stressful and harder. I did . imagine it would be like The Devil Wears Prada but everyone is so nice . and I was so wrong,' she said. Fact 'nicer' than fiction: Lisa said the fashion industry is nothing like The Devil Wears Prada, where Anne Hathaway is an intern to tyrannical boss Meryl Streep . Dogsbody: Some interns will have horror stories like those that inspired the film but the industry has cracked down on making interns go beyond the call of duty . Speaking of the film, she added: 'That's what I was comparing it to and I watched it . before I started and thought 'I hope it's not like that'.' My-wardrobe.com feature in one episode of Hilary Devey's Channel 4 show, The Intern, in which young people compete for internships in hard-to-break-into industries, including fashion and publishing. David Worby CEO of my-wardrobe.com, said: 'We have always supported internships at my-wardrobe and it’s . an ideal opportunity to discover and nurture young talent.' Lisa had to prove her worth against two other candidates by impressing my-wardrobe founder Sarah Curran with her attitude and ability. The candidates were put into various awkward situations on photo shoots and meetings to see how they would cope, deal with 'egos' in the industry and avert a potential crisis. Sarah told Hilary she encounters a . lot of young people desperate to get their foot in the door of fashion . so she's developed a keen eye on what makes a good intern. Tough start: Lisa had to impress my-wardrobe founder Sarah Curran, pictured left with Hilary Devey, against two other candidates . She said: 'I expect a lot from my . team and if I see potential I will give that person a role but if I . don't, then I’ll be honest and I won't.' Nicola Copping, editor in chief at the . website added that interns that 'stand out' are 'passionate but possess a . certain amount of humility so they are prepared to get their hands . dirty no matter what, whether that's making tea or helping to organise a . photo shoot. You really want someone who is willing to do anything and . not complain about it.' Thanks to her can-do attitude, Lisa won the role and will now work for six months at my-wardrobe's London HQ. After leaving college, Lisa had . various temp jobs including at clothes shops and on make-up counters so . was delighted to secure the job via the Channel 4 show with former . Dragons' Den star Hilary. Learnt so much: The teenager said her internship has been invaluable . 'I didn’t have as much experience as . the others. I wasn’t working with them all week so I just assumed they . were doing a lot better,' Lisa said. 'Hilary said I had made a big . change from when I started to when I finished.' Lisa hopes the placement will lead to . a permanent job either at my-wardrobe.com - where many of the staff started . out as interns - or elsewhere in the industry. Support: Businesswoman Hilary Devey is on a mission is help young people break into difficult work industries . However, while internships can provide valuable experience to those starting out in a new industry and give them their first step on the career ladder, they are often criticised for using and abusing the ambitions of young people for free labour. The situations Andie is placed in in The Devil Wears Prada may be fictional but many interns will testify that they've often had to go beyond the call of duty or been treated like a general dogsbody, often for zero remuneration. As a result in 2011, HM Revenue and Customs said they intended to crackdown on those using interns to breach minimum wage laws. Since then, many fashion companies appear to have tightened up their rules when it comes to hiring and using interns. Fashionista.com reported last year that Conde Nast, publishers of Vogue, had made a number of changes to their intern programme. These included not allowing interns to work unpaid for more than one semester, not allowing interns to work after 7pm and not forcing them to run personal errands for members of staff. Meanwhile my-wardrobe.com state on their website that their internships range 'from one month to three months in duration, and are on a paid basis for any which run longer than one month'. They add that their internships provide 'a platform from which valuable industry experience is gained, specifically designed to support the initial stages of a career in the highly competitive fashion sector'. Sarah Curran told the MailOnline: 'My-wardrobe has always placed a great deal of importance and focus on . supporting young talent and nurturing careers within the business. 'Our internships are fully paid for one to three months with a structured . induction and review process and the opportunity to experience . different departments and aspects of the business. 'There has been long-running perception that the fashion industry takes . advantage of the opportunity for free or low-cost labour. Businesses . need to realise that they need to present a chance for young talent to . learn from the experience and to reward their time investment during . that internship. 'Businesses that offer fully-paid and structured internships can gain so . much more by preparing interns for a more permanent role.' Lisa has nothing but praise for her experience as an intern. 'I've gone from knowing nothing about fashion to learning everything about fashion, knowing every designer, every brand,' she said. Following her baptism of fire on the TV show, she added her current job is 'so much more organised and relaxed than I expected. I'm quite happy working here and I've learnt so much. I've worked in different roles and done different things so I've got a feel for everything.' She added that her English and Maths has improved thanks to the opportunity being an intern provided.

An 18-year-old ballerina who was orphaned in war-torn Sierra Leone at the age of three, fulfilled a childhood dream on Wednesday night as she played the lead in Swan Lake at the Lincoln Center. Michaela DePrince took to the stage at the prestigious New York venue and performed an excerpt from the ballet, which saw her embody the evil Black Swan. While it marked a milestone in her dance career, the determined teenager told CBS: 'I feel like I've come a long way, but there's so much more that I need to do.' Inspiration: Michaela DePrince, who lost her parents at the age of three, said that her obsession with dance originated from a photograph of a ballet dancer she found while she was at an orphanage in Sierra Leone . She is currently the youngest member of the Dance Theater of Harlem and made her professional debut last year in Le Corsaire at the Johannesburg Theatre in South Africa. Michaela - who was then called Mabinty Bangura - was born in 1995 in the midst of Sierra Leone’s 11-year civil war, which claimed more than 75,000 lives. Recalling her early years, she previously told The Guardian: 'I have a lot of bad memories. I remember seeing a lot of rebels killing people that I knew. It was disgusting and just revolting.' When she was three years old her father was shot by rebel soldiers and her mother - who didn't have enough food to feed herself - later died of starvation. Her three brothers also died young. Childhood dream: The teenager, who now lives in New Jersey, played the Black Swan in an excerpt from Swan Lake at the Lincoln Center on Wednesday night . Enchanting: One reviewer described Michaela as the 'sweetest seductress you ever saw' As a result Michaela was placed into an orphanage by her uncle - an experience which she said scarred her for life. She remembers going hungry, being mistreated by carers and taunted as 'the devil's child' because of vitiligo on her neck - a skin condition that causes patches of lightened skin. 'I have a lot of bad memories. I remember seeing a lot of rebels killing people that I knew' When reports emerged that the orphanage . was going to be bombed, Michaela fled and walked shoeless for miles . until she reached a Ghanian refugee camp. It was there that Michaela's life changed, as two volunteer workers, Elaine and Charles DePrince, decided to adopt her along with two other girls, Mia and Mariel. The couple took the children back to their home in New Jersey in the U.S. in a bid to provide them with a fresh start. Discriminated: While she demonstrated talent and enthusiasm, Michaela often lost parts in productions to her white counterparts - but she said that made her more determined to succeed . Lifelong passion: The teenager, pictured in 2012, started dancing when she was five years old . Mrs DePrince said that she soon . noticed Michaela's love of ballet and the toddler watched a video of the . Nutcracker 150 times and could recite the moves. Michaela . said that her obsession with dance originated from a magazine she found . while she was at the orphanage in Sierra Leone. The cover featured a photograph of a female ballerina. But not knowing what a ballet dancer was, she believed it was a fairy. 'I was just so fascinated by this person, by how beautiful she was, how she was wearing such a beautiful costume,' she told CNN, 'So I ripped the cover off and I put it in my underwear.' Distressing time: Michaela said that she saw a lot of rebels killing people during the Sierra Leone civil war . Savior: When she was four years old Michaela was adopted by Elaine DePrince from New Jersey . When she was five years old Michaela . started taking classes at the Rock School of Dance in Philadelphia, and . the painfully shy youngster found it easier to express herself through . movement rather than . words. 'I was just so fascinated by this person, by how beautiful she was, how she was wearing such a beautiful costume' But while she demonstrated talent and enthusiasm, she often lost parts in productions to her white counterparts. One of her first encounters of discrimination occurred when she was eight years old and rehearsing for The Nutcracker. Just a few days before she was due to perform a teacher told her: 'I'm sorry, you can't do it. America's not ready for a black girl as Marie [the heroine].' 'To say this to an eight-year-old is just devastating. It was terrible,' Michaela told the Associated Press. But she refused to let the negative . comments hold . her back and when she was 13 years old she earned a full scholarship to . the prestigious American Ballet Theater's summer intensive in New York. Two years later she won a full-time place at the school. Giving back: The dancer, who still describes herself as African, plans to return to Sierra Leone one day to open a performing arts school . The teenage dancer also became the subject of First Position, an award-winning documentary about the competitive field and performed on the TV show Dancing with the Stars. She has been described as one of the ballet world's 'rising stars' and a reviewer from The New York Times, who attended Wednesday night's performance said she was the 'sweetest seductress you ever saw' and 'her fouettes [turns] nearly carried her offstage.' Michaela, who still describes herself as African, plans to return to Sierra Leone one day to open a performing arts school.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:06 EST, 18 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:35 EST, 18 April 2013 . As people lay badly bleeding in the smoke of the Boston Marathon bombings, rescuers immediately turned to a millennia-old medical device to save their lives — the tourniquet. Using belts, shirts and other materials, they tied off bleeding limbs in fast-acting bids to prevent major blood loss, shock and death. Such fast work no doubt saved many lives, doctors at Boston area hospitals said. So it's interesting to note that if this had happened a decade ago, many emergency responders might have avoided the tourniquet. Heroes in Boston: A man tries to stop the bleeding of the leg of a man injured in the first explosion at the Boston Marathon, using a tourniquet . As recently as the early 2000s, the tourniquet was still enmeshed in a long standing controversy about whether they were more trouble than they were worth. 'Some people saw them as lifesaving, and others said they were the instrument of the devil,' said Dr. John F. Kragh Jr., an orthopedic surgeon with the U.S. Army's Institute of Surgical Research in Texas. Although tourniquets have been used to stem blood loss since at least the time of the Roman Empire, modern military surgeons had grown to doubt it. There were no good studies proving their benefit. And there was a common belief that some tourniquets could do more harm than good, cutting off blood and oxygen to limbs and resulting in amputations. Some tourniquets that were used in the right situation were not tight enough, causing bleeding to actually get worse. Some were not wide enough. Compression device: Boston Firefighter James Plourde carries an injured girl away from the scene, who sports a tourniquet on her calf . Making a comeback: A decade ago, many emergency responders might have avoided the tourniquet (Women pictured after the Boston bombings) 'There are a number of ways to mess it up,' said Kragh, who is a leading researcher on methods to control bleeding. 'In Vietnam, tourniquets were not typically used' because it was thought they led to many amputations, said Dr. Kevin Kirk, an Army lieutenant colonel who is chief orthopedic surgeon at San Antonio Military Medical Center. Tourniquets date back to 199BC, when Romans used the device to control bleeding during amputations. French surgeon, Jean Louis Petit, then developed the idea further in 1718 by creating a screw device for occluding blood. The tourniquet was continued to be used regularly in the surgical field in the 1800s and 1900s, before some military personnel questioned their effectiveness in the early 2000s. They weren’t used typically in the Vietnam War because some professionals thought they led to many amputations. The compressing device works by controlling blood circulation during traumatic bleeding. A stick or some other elongated object supports the tourniquet once it’s twisted around the stick to stay fastened. That's because tourniquets often were . placed too high above the injury, leading to loss of tissue that . otherwise might be saved, he said. Now they are used lower, and 'a lot . of lives and limbs have been saved by the use of a tourniquet,' Kirk . said. The American Red Cross came to call tourniquets a last resort for stemming severe bleeding. The dust settled only in the last decade, according to some experts, following publication of studies from the Iraq war by Kragh and others that showed tourniquets were clear-cut lifesavers. Those studies showed timely use of tourniquets could raise survival rates as high as 90 percent. Tourniquets are now routinely issued to soldiers. However, some experts remain cautious about their use. The Red Cross, for example, continues to worry that tourniquets may be used improperly or in situations when blood loss is not great enough to warrant their use. 'Clearly, if a leg is blown off, it's OK to go straight to tourniquet,' said Dr. Richard Bradley, a member of the Red Cross's scientific advisory council. But the Red Cross continues to advise that direct pressure be applied to a wound in less extreme situations. Tourniquets should be at least 1½ inches wide, and pulled very tight, to properly shut off blood flow. Medical supply companies make tourniquets that do the job best. Bradley also stressed that it's important to use a real tourniquet if possible. News coverage of the Boston tragedy describes emergency responders using all sorts of things as makeshift tourniquets, including neck lanyards. 'Is a lanyard better than nothing? Probably,' Bradley said. But other kinds of care, and rapid transport to . hospitals, may have been at least as important as tourniquets, he . added.

Three spectators died and 13 people lost one or more limbs. Nicholas Yanni of Boston was with his wife and friends watching another friend cross the finish line when the explosion occurred. Yanni's wife had an injury to her lower left leg. Another woman with them had a leg injury, too. Yanni ducked into a nearby sports store for T-shirts that they tore to create a tourniquet. At Tufts Medical Center, surgeons fixed the smaller of the two bones in her lower left leg that was apparently shattered by shrapnel from the blast. 'My worst fear was that I could have lost my wife. Other than that it was autopilot, adrenaline, chaos. There was a lot of just 'not-even-thinking,' sort of animalistic, you know, thought. What needs to be done, you do it,' Yanni said.","The once-doubted devices may not have been used a decade ago under similar circumstances .

Apple will begin initial production of its next iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July, an influential analyst has claimed. Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries, who was ahead of others with news that Apple had cut orders for components for the iPhone 5, made the prediction in a note to investors. The news comes as a string of analysts denied that the Silicon Valley firm's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 parts was prompted by a fall in demand for their latest smart phone. Already obsolete? Two models display the Apple iPhone 5 during the product's release at a store in Taipei on December 14. An analyst has claimed production of the next iPhone will begin in March for a summer launch . That revelation sent Apple shares slipping below $500 - as arch-rival Samsung announced it had sold 40million of its flagship Galaxy S III phone in the seven months its been on the market. Mr Misek predicted in his note that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he expects between 44million to ship in the quarter to March. 'As word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider. 'Therefore we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.' The analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life. He last month also predicted that the . new model could ship with a new 4.8in display, a claim he rowed back . from in this week's note where he said he now expects that to be the . design for a forthcoming iPhone 6. Get the camping gear ready: Eager customers queuing outside the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London, to be among the first to get an iPhone five when it was launched in the UK in September last year . On . rumours of an entry-level iPhone, Mr Misek claimed Apple could release a . low-cost device made of polycarbonate with no 4G Long Term Evolution . (LTE) capability. Apple will launch five new products in the next 12 months, including its highly anticipated TV set, two leading analysts claimed today. Analysts Gene Munster and Douglas Clinton of Piper Jaffray say the firm will launch a plethora of new products in a bid to keep its position as the world's biggest company. However, the analysts say the new gadgets could be just the beginning of a major change in Apple's products in 2014. The pair told Fortune magazine 2013 'will set the stage for bigger changes in the product lineup in 2014 and beyond.' Apple is believed to develop products several years in advance, with its design team, led by British-born Sir Jonathan Ive, producing hundreds of prototype products each year. The speculation seemed to be backed up by comments made by Paul Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this well never be the future of Apple's products.' Mr Misek's predictions came as a string of analysts suggested that Apple's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 components might not be a result of weak demand for the device. Earlier this week, MailOnline Science reported how the iconic gadget company had told suppliers it only wanted half the number of screens it had originally asked for and reduced orders for other parts too. Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March and comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google’s Android operating system. But Shaw Wu, an analyst with brokers Sterne Agee, was quoted by the Telegraph as telling investors that 'as far as we can tell, iPhone 5 demand remains robust.' He added that the change in orders could be down to 'much improved yields meaning lower component builds and supplier shifts.'",New comes as analysts deny that cut in iPhone 5 parts orders was prompted by fall in demand .

The H-53 US Marine Sea Stallion, which was carrying 21 US soldiers, came down in flames on a military shooting range 55 miles northeast of the South Korean capital, though the US military attempted to play down the crash, describing it as a 'hard landing'.

Down in flames: The H-53 US Marine chopper, which was carrying 21 US soldiers, came down in flames in what US military described as a 'hard landing' It came as North Korea issued new threats against South Korea on Tuesday, vowing 'sledge-hammer blows' of retaliation if South Korea did not apologise for anti-North Korean protests the previous day when the North was celebrating the birth of its founding leader. But despite the new ultimatum, the North Korean leadership was looking for a way to cool down its rhetoric after weeks of warnings of war, a senior U.S. military official in South Korea said. On Monday, the North dropped its shrill threats against the United States and South Korea as it celebrated the 101st anniversary of the birth of its first leader, Kim Il-Sung, raising hopes for an easing of tension in a region that has for weeks seemed on the verge of conflict. The hint of a scaling back of the confrontation followed offers of talks with the isolated North from both the United States and the South. Wreckage: The helicopter crashed onto a military shooting range in Cheorwon, about 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Seoul .

'Our . retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,' KCNA . reported, citing military leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of . Korea (DPRK), as North Korea is officially known. South . Korean media reported several small demonstrations in the capital, . Seoul, on Monday. One television station showed pictures of a handful of . protesters burning a portrait of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Small counter-protests, by South Koreans calling for dialogue with the North, were also held, media reported.

Burning issue: South Korean media reported several small demonstrations in the capital, Seoul, on Monday.

The North has . also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South . Korean forces, describing them as a 'hostile' act. The United States . dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part. But along with the new threat on Tuesday, the North's KCNA raised the possibility of dialogue. 'If . the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations, they . should apologise for all anti-DPRK hostile acts, big and small, and show . the compatriots their will to stop all these acts,' KCNA cited the . North's military as saying. Ramped up rhetoric: The North has threatened nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and Japan after new U.N. sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in February . A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman later told a briefing the North Korean ultimatum was not worth a response and South Korea was waiting for the North to make a 'wise decision'. Last week, the South's President Park Geun-hye offered talks but the North rejected the overture as a 'cunning' ploy. Park will meet U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House on May 7 to discuss economic and security issues, including 'countering the North Korean threat', the White House said on Monday. The U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a North Korean missile test or nuclear test were possible but he believed it was trying to tone down its the war of words. 'The DPRK leadership is trying to figure out a way to off-ramp from the heightened state of rhetoric that we've been seeing for the past several weeks,' the official told reporters. North Korea faced difficulties trying to 'fix and tune up' its Soviet-era conventional weapons, and that was why it wanted nuclear weapons, and the missiles to deliver them. 'They are replacing that decreasing conventional capability with increasing asymmetric capability of weapons of mass destruction, intercontinental ballistic missiles and special operations forces,' the official said. The United States has offered talks with the North, but on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions. North Korea deems its nuclear arms a 'treasured sword' and has vowed never to give them up. Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, on Monday stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution. A day earlier Kerry had appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearisation steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability. Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions that were expanded after the North's February test. The aim of the North's aggression, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson Kim Il-Sung, or to force the United States, which has 28,000 troops in South Korea, to open talks.","H-53 US Marine Sea Stallion came down in flames 55 miles northeast of Seoul .

As the race to be the next London Mayor reaches its crucial final days, candidate Ken Livingstone is facing embarrassing allegations that he earned up to £1.2million over the past three years, but still used a tax loophole to save more money. The figure is thought to be more than his rival current London Mayor Boris Johnson, was earning at some points in recent years. It has been claimed that by funnelling his wages into his company, the Labour candidate may have paid as little as 18 per cent tax, which saved him up to £220,000, according to The Sun. On the campaign trail: Mr Livngstone earlier today in North London. In the run up to Thursday's London Mayoral elections, it is an embarrassing revelation for Mr Livingstone, who has previously named tax avoiders as 'rich b******s' Crucial week: Ken Livingstone walks his dog Coco as he meets voters - a poll shows Mr Johnson is beating him by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run-off . The allegations could leave the Mr Livingstone red-faced as three years ago he criticised tax avoiders, . saying: ‘These rich b******s just don’t get it. No one should be allowed . to vote in a British election, let alone sit in Parliament, unless they . pay their full share of tax.’ The figure which emerged last night is significantly higher than the £50,000 it was previously thought he had saved  -  some of the money was earned from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show. It is an entirely legal move, but has still proved controversial. It was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife. The pair are sole shareholders in their company, Silveta Ltd. Because Silveta is a small firm, it does not legally have to spell out its income and outgoings. In contrast, Boris Johnson paid the top rate, which was pushed up to 50 per cent in April 2010. Rivals: London Mayor Boris Johnson Campaigning in Bexleyheath, South London, today in the final few days before the election . Every second counts: Although it was raining when Mr Johnson left for work this morning, it had cleared up when he visited Bexleyheath this afternoon. After yesterday's gaffe when he swore live on BBC lunchtime news,  Mr Johnson was keen to impress . Silveta is a small firm, so it is not legally obligated to detail its income and outgoings. The study of Silveta’s Companies House declarations estimates it made £1,239,000 from 2008-09 to 2010-11, reported the newspaper. Over the three years, Conservative candidate Mr Jonhson declared £1,278,360 total earnings and paid £519,276 in tax. But accountants believe that Mr Livingstone managed to pay significantly less, because he was charged corporation tax. Accounts: The money was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife . Accountant Andrew Hamilton told The Sun the ploy had saved £65,000 in 2009-10 alone — meaning a tax rate of just 22 per cent. Today a spokesman for Mr Livingstone defended him and said to the MailOnline : 'He has paid all his taxes. What Londoners want to know is how they will be better off, which is why he’ll be cutting fares. Boris will hike fares above inflation.' A spokesman for Mr Johnson told the MailOnline: ‘It has taken others to expose what Ken Livingstone refused to release himself, despite promising to do so. ‘When you look at the tax rate he paid, which is so much less than the other candidates, and at the comments he has made in the past, it is no wonder he has been trying to hide the truth about his tax affairs. ‘How can Londoners trust him as Mayor when he has been caught out again saying one thing and doing another?’ The revelations angered the Taxpayers' Alliance who said: . 'Livingstone is a hypocrite, he criticised tax avoiders but it seems he has now been caught out himself. He promised voters that he would publish full details of his tax affairs over three weeks ago but has yet to deliver, it’s hard to see how Londoners can trust him on any of his other promises.' Both candidates are under pressure to . succeed from their respective parties in Thursday's elections, and yesterday Mr Johnson . launched a foul-mouthed rant at a TV interviewer. The . Tory incumbent, who opened up a 12-point lead in a new poll, let rip on . camera after a BBC journalist  questioned him about his links to the . Murdoch media empire. Time for a change?

Ken is known for taking the tube in London, but could it be that Ken is no Gentleman and does not give his seat up for a lady? Getting on famously: Boris and Ken at the Times Cycling Hustings in central London . In a sign of the pressure he is under, Mr Johnson described the line of questioning as ‘f****** b*******’. He . got a major boost last night when a Populus poll for the Times showed . him opening up a sizeable lead over his Labour rival and former mayor . Ken Livingstone after a week in which the contest had seemed on a . knife-edge. The poll showed Mr Johnson beating Mr Livingstone by 56 per cent to 44 per cent in the second round run-off. But .

Mr Johnson asked the Murdochs’ firm to sponsor a cross-Thames cable car in East London while he was chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority. At the time, the force was investigating the firm over phone hacking.Mr Johnson told the BBC: ‘I don’t know of any discussions going on about that  but what I can tell you is that I think  it’s right to work with the private sector to get contributions that will be for the  benefit of London.’ He then urged the BBC to concentrate on the money he has raised during his term of office from the private sector, rather than questions raised by BBC London political editor Tim Donovan.

Busted: Rasoul Speight was caught concealing 100 bags of heroin in his anal cavity following a routine traffic stop in New Jersey . Gary Sylak was a passenger in the car and police discovered a syringe and spoon, covered in heroin residue, in the liner of his jacket . Officers believe the men were heading to upstate New York, where the 100 bags would have been worth $2,000. This heroin haul is described by The Smoking Gun as a new record for this specific method of concealment. Bola Adebisi, a 52-year-old Nigerian woman, set the world record for amount of ingested heroin ever recovered when she was busted with five pounds of the drug in 180 pellets at Dulles Airport in March 2012. But the heroin found with Adebisi was stored in her stomach. Speight was driving north on the Palisades Interstate Parkway when police pulled the 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer over for having unclear license plates and an obstructed view. The men were pulled over in a routine traffic stop near Exit 4 of the Palisades Interstate Parkway . When officers approached the car they smelt burnt marijuana and after receiving permission to search the vehicle found 'nothing of evidentiary value.' But the outstanding traffic warrants for both men made police conduct an additional body search at headquarters, where the drugs were found. Police said they also discovered a syringe and spoon, covered in heroin residue, in the liner of Sylak's jacket. Both Speight, of Port Jervis, NY, and Sylak, from Shandaken, NY, were charged with possession of heroin with intent to sell, possession of heroin and tampering with evidence. Sylak was also charged with possessing drug paraphernalia. Both men were transported to the Bergen County Jail, where they remained on Friday awaiting arraignment.

A tear rolled down George Osborne's cheek during the early stages of the service at St Paul's Cathedral . It was one of the most memorable . moments of Margaret Thatcher’s funeral, when George Osborne was seen . with tears rolling down his cheek. Today Nick Clegg defended the . Chancellor’s public display of emotion, insisting everyone should have . ‘the liberty to cry if they want to’. A clearly emotional Mr Osborne was . seen trying to blink away tears before wiping his eyes during the . moving address by Bishop of London Richard Chartres. The Chancellor was visibly moved during the early stages of the service paying tribute to Britain's first female Prime Minister. He later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion, writing on Twitter that it had been a 'moving, almost overwhelming day'. Mr Clegg was asked during his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in if he had also cried. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘No I didn’t but it was a very powerful occasion and very full of ceremony.’ He went on: ‘You’ve got to give any . man or indeed woman the liberty to cry if they want to, I don’t think . you should criticise someone for showing emotion.’ Mr Osborne and Mr Clegg were among 32 . serving members of the Cabinet who joined prime ministers past and . present, world leaders and some of the key figures who played a role . Lady Thatcher's downfall more than two decades ago. Political friends and foes were among . the 2,300 mourners who came together to mark the passing of the longest . serving Premier for 150 years. The Chancellor hinted at his moment of emotion later in a tweet . Nick Clegg, appearing on his LBC 97.3 phone-in, said he did not cry during yesterday's spectacular ceremony but insisted it was wrong to criticise those who did . Last week Mr Osborne hailed Lady Thatcher as 'a great prime minister — probably the greatest in our peacetime history'. He added: 'We are fortunate to live in a country she did so much to transform. 'I don’t think that we in this . generation of politicians need to be unsettled by living in her shadow. We do live in her shadow and we should just embrace it. 'She was a great prime minister - . probably the greatest in our peacetime history - and we are fortunate to . live in a country she did so much to transform.' David Cameron, who gave a reading during the service, was also seen wiping his eyes. He earlier declared 'we're all Thatcherites now' as he hailed the Iron Lady's legacy as irreversible. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude appears to wipe away a tear during service while a stern-looking William Hague looks on . Prime Minister David Cameron appears to wipe away a tear as he stands with his wife Samantha and former Premier Sir John Major at the service . While the last 10 days have been . dominated by debate over Lady Thatcher’s policies and long-term impact . on Britain, Mr Cameron said that no one in mainstream politics would . argue for a return to the 1970s. ‘In a way we are all Thatcherites now . because one of the things about her legacy is that some of those big . arguments that she had everyone now accepts,’ he told BBC Radio 4. ‘No one wants to go back to trade . unions that are undemocratic or one-sided nuclear disarmament or having . great private sector businesses in the public sector.’ But Mr Clegg insisted he was not a Thatcherite. ‘He’s the leader of the Conservative . Party he’s perfectly entitled to say that.  I certainly wouldn’t call . myself a Thatcherite.  I’m a Liberal, I’m a Liberal, she wasn’t a . Liberal.  I’ve always called myself a Liberal I always will.’ Mr Osborne, seated behind Samantha Cameron and Sir John Major, raised his right hand to dry his cheek . Though only a robot can claim never to cry, no Englishman likes to do so as publicly as an emotional George Osborne did at Lady Thatcher’s funeral yesterday. We feel a sting of shame – but then catharsis, our emotional gutters having been given a good wash. The Chancellor was seen to wipe away a tear in St Paul’s Cathedral, visibly moved by proceedings. He later hinted at his dramatic moment of emotion, writing on Twitter that it had been a ‘moving, almost overwhelming day’. To water up so openly might be thought weak and womanly – histrionic, even, if we contemplate some ululating Latin ever bewailing his lot. But the rarer the tears, the more potent they can be. After all, would we really want a Chancellor who was incapable of sorrow? In my view, it can be the making of a man of a certain age to be seen ‘emoting’ in public, when the circumstances call for it. Recently my wife and I were at a school concert. Without warning our 15 year-old son clambered on stage and sang a solo with his electric guitar. He has been playing the instrument for only a couple of years and we had no idea he was capable of such a performance. Claud has had a few problems in life – he has autism, which can stifle a child’s social confidence and communicative abilities. To see our fine boy stand there and belt out KT Tunstall’s Suddenly I See, bending his spine as he reached for artistic expression, was a lip-wobbler for me. Suddenly I saw. I saw him as a success, as a lad with prospects. Tears dripped off my cheeks, raindrops off a sycamore leaf. Typical theatre luvvie, you might think. As the Mail’s drama critic I am frequently a bit damp around the optics. All those musicals. I have become as leaky as a punctured garden hose. Or is it age? Parenthood does it to you. The other Sunday my teenage daughter read the lesson in church – that passage about Doubting Thomas recognising Christ and gasping, ‘my Lord and my God!’ She read it so beautifully, with such grace, I was a-jibber. At funerals the Prayer Book’s ancient sentences as the priest enters always make the spine tingle but tears prickle when it comes to singing. Such memories can be evoked. Sunset and Evening Star, to Parry’s tune, is how we saluted my father’s silent coffin. Remembrance Day’s O Valiant Hearts is always a challenge. We may not know, we cannot tell, why George Osborne wept yesterday. Was it purely for Mrs T or had the majesty of her funeral reactivated some more personal sadness? Perhaps both. I last had to reach for a discreet hanky when at the superb West End production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time (which, as it happens, is about autism). The convenient thing about theatres, like most churches, is that the layout of the seating means only your neighbours can see that your goggles are filling with briny. Social embarrassment averted. Unless, of course, you are Chancellor and a national TV camera is filming your every moment. The former prime minister made a huge impact on the country - and thousands arrived to pay tribute to the former Conservative leader .","Chancellor welled up during emotional service at St Paul's Cathedral .

Maria ward and her supervisor Gillie Christou claim they were 'hung out to dry' by London's Haringey Council after the tragic death of 17-month old Peter Connelly nearly six years ago. But the Court of Appeal yesterday ruled that an employment tribunal was right to say the council acted reasonably in dismissing the two women in April 2009. Gillie Christou (left) and Maria Ward arriving at the employment appeals tribunal in London last year. Their claims they were unjustly fired were rejected . Sharon Shoesmith, the former Director of Social Services at the council, had previously won her own claim for unfair dismissal and is due £1m in compensation. Mrs Shoesmith had appeared in the public gallery to support Mrs Christou and Miss Ward at an earlier hearing last month. Peter had suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on an at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Peter's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker - and Barker's brother, Jason Owen - were jailed in 2009 for causing or allowing the toddler's death. Mrs Christou and Miss Ward were sacked after an investigation which discovered there was a period in mid-2007 when they did not know where the child was.

Peter's mother claimed she had taken the little boy to visit her sick uncle in Cricklewood, north west London, despite being told to return home. The pair's legal teams had claimed they suffered 'double jeopardy' because they faced two Haringey misconduct panels looking at the same allegations against them. The first simplified disciplinary procedure concluded that they only needed to receive written warnings. However later, more formal proceedings - after the criminal trial of those responsible for Peter's death - resulted in summary dismissal for gross misconduct. In their ruling Lord Justice Laws, Lord Justice Elias and Lord Justice McCombe dismissed their claims to have suffered 'double jeopardy'.","Maria ward and Gillie Christou were justifiably dismissed, says tribunal .

The craze - where fans perform acrobatics in urban settings like balconies and high buildings - has become a huge hit after appearing in action films like James Bond and The Bourne movies. Tragedy: Wang Zijian - a daredevil fan of street stunt craze parkour - died when he hurled himself off a 120ft bridge and asked friends to film him .

Risk: Mr Wang had apparently asked his friends to film him before leaping from the bridge in Sichuan province . Doomed: He gestures to onlookers as he prepares to make his doomed leap from the bridge . Authorities have raised concerns about the risk in jumping across high buildings and off of bridges as part of the parkour craze and argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves. But many practitioners of Parkour . insist the non-competitive sport is not dangerous as long as it is . practiced properly and safety procedures are put in place. There . have been several deaths across the world which are understood to have . been related to the sport, but it can be difficult for authorities to . determine whether they are suicide attempts. Efforts are being made in different parts of the world to create safe places for fans to take part in parkour. However, some fans believe this will detract from the freedom of the sport. Parkour features in films and in video games, sparking further worldwide interest. Freerunning  is believed to have developed from parkour and includes combinations of gymnastics or acrobatics moves. In June last year a 24-year-old plunged 17 storeys to her death during her first parkour lesson.

Pyongyang has threatened to destroy the United States with . nuclear weapons, bomb its Pacific bases and shell South Korea in . response. The North has also made multiple threats of an armed response to the South Korea and U.S. military drills close to its borders, which follow an artillery attack on a South Korean island in 2010. But the leader departed from such rhetoric on his latest appearance, according to state news, KCNA, which reported that he 'repeatedly praised' troops for 'doing good things for children.' Heightened tensions: The leader was reported as being 'greatly pleased' by the combat equipment . Homemade: The military equipment was reported as being 'contrived and manufactured' by the unit . Preoccupied: Independent observers say the country's army spends most of its time manufacturing . His military chiefs were also hoping to strike the right note with their by showing off musical instruments made by the country's 1.2 million strong army. Accordions, drums, guitars and brass instruments were just some of the creations laid out on a table for the high-profiled visitor. The Supreme Commander said it was important to make quality instruments so . soldiers could 'spend their worthwhile days in the army full of . militant optimism and joy', KCNA said. His father, Kim Jong Il, had been credited in North Korea claimed to have invented the oungum, a banjo-like instruments said to be popular in the country.

Plan of action: The visit came as South Korea and the U.S. signed a new military plan today . The leader also 'watched latest combat and technical equipment contrived and manufactured by the unit' and was reported by KCNA to be 'greatly pleased' by the development of the equipment 'badly needed for combat preparations'. The agency added that he 'indicated superb and preeminent operational and tactical plans to wipe out the enemies at a lightning speed by use of those equipment in actual battles'. But independent observers say the country's army, thought to be one of the largest in the world, spends most of its time manufacturing, fishing and farming, as the impoverished country struggles to feed its population.

Two months on, she took to the social networking site again – with some rather different news. Accusations: Kris Newby proposing to his then fiance Lacey Maclean, who has claimed he used her money for gambling . Happier times: Pictured on the day they got engaged, it was just weeks later before Lacey Maclean began accusing Kris Newby of taking her money . In an extraordinary series of . messages, Miss Maclean claimed her fiance had stolen £12,000 from her to . fund a devastating gambling addiction, leaving their relationship in . tatters. Last night Mr Newby, 25, publicly . apologised to his ex-girlfriend as he admitted he was seeking help for . his ‘spiralling’ addiction to high stakes slot machines, which have been . described as the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’. Mr Newby, a winger for . semi-professional East Thurrock United in Essex, proposed to Miss . Maclean in front of their friends at a black-tie dinner in January. Miss Maclean immediately posted . photographs of the moment on Twitter. She wrote: ‘Can’t believe . @Newby1988 asked me to marry him.. :-) cnt stop smiling xx I love you . kris xx.’ HEARTBREAK PLAYED OUT ON TWITTER . Lacey Maclean says the footballer is 'scum' and he has publicly apologised to her and her family . But on Sunday night, Miss Maclean . took to the social networking site again – this time claiming Mr Newby . had stolen all her money and jewellery to feed his gambling addiction. In a string of angry tweets, Miss . Maclean, who lives with her parents in Tilbury, Essex, wrote: ‘Kris . Newby is a liar, thief and gambler. He has taken over £12,000 of my . money and jewellery – be aware. ‘The man I was going to marry has . robbed me. He has gambled it all.

He is nothing but scum.’ Yesterday, Mr Newby, a promising . footballer who scored three times in the FA Cup this year, admitted he . was addicted to casino-style fixed-odds betting machines. The machines, which were introduced . in 2001 under the previous Labour government, allow players to gamble as . much as £100 at a time in games such as virtual roulette. Footballer Kris Newby has apologised to Miss Maclean, and says he was too proud to admit that he had a problem before . He said: ‘For the past couple of . years I’ve been hooked on competitive gambling. I thought I had sorted . it out but I fell back into it four or five months ago and it started . spiralling out of control. ‘I was too proud to admit I had a problem, and that did not help.’ He added: ‘I’ve hurt a lot of people . as a result, but most of all Lacey, and I’d like to publicly apologise . to her and her family and anyone else I’ve hurt. Mr Newby reportedly said he became addicted to roulette machines . 'I’ve never been addicted to drugs, but this is worse than drugs – in three seconds you have lost £100. It ruins lives.’ Mr Newby, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, said his doctor had referred him to a gambling clinic. Yesterday his grandmother, Peggy Passfield, defended the footballer –  even though she said he had stolen money from her, too. The 85-year-old said she believed his . problem began when he was a boy, and his father and grandfather would . let him play on slot machines while they watched the football. ‘With a start like that, you can understand his addiction,’ she said. ‘I don’t excuse what Kris has done, . he’s done some terrible things including the way he’s treated Lacey, but . they aren’t right in what they’ve done to him too. ‘They shouldn’t be putting it all on the internet. He needs help. ‘People may say I’m mad and to be . honest Kris has robbed me blind too but deep down he’s a good lad, he’s . just ill and he needs help. If nobody else will stick up for him, I . will.’ John Coventry, manager of East . Thurrock, said: ‘We’re trying to support Kris even though we have had . our own problems with him. We now realise the extent of his addiction . and will do what we can.’ Miss Maclean’s mother, Andrea,  said: . ‘Lacey just wants to put the whole thing behind her and move on. We do . not want to comment on it.’ Essex Police said they had not received a complaint and were not investigating.","Lacey Maclean accused Kris Newby of using her money to feed addiction .

A mother has provoked anger in New Zealand by leaving her newborn baby alone in a locked vehicle outside a supermarket with a note explaining that she had gone shopping. The message, written from the baby's perspective, included the women's mobile number and urged people to call her if necessary. A shocked passer-by had photographed the sleeping infant, visible through the window, on Saturday. Fury: A mother has sparked anger in New Zealand by leaving her sleeping baby alone in a locked car outside a supermarket with a note explaining that she had gone shopping and urging people to call her if necessary . It read: 'My mum's in doing the shopping, call her if I need anything.' The man who spotted the note after parking with his family next to the car said: 'We waited there for a little bit, wondering if the mum was just going to be two seconds and come back.' Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, he added: 'My wife said, I'm not going in without someone being here with the baby.' Two other passers-by agreed to wait by the vehicle in the Pak 'n Save car park in Porirua after one of them phoned the mother and told her to come back. The youngster was sat in a baby seat, wearing a warm hat and wrapped in a pink blanket. The picture was put on Facebook by radio DJ Polly Gillespie and attracted nearly 1,500 comments in 24 hours. Facebook user Cat Marie Horne wrote: . 'I'm sorry this is completely irresponsible! You do not leave children . under the age of 14 unsupervised at all. Left alone: Pak 'n Save in Porirua where the baby was locked alone in a parked car while its mother shopped . 'Why did she have time to write a . note?? Secondly, you do not put a capsule seat in the front of a car, . due to dashboard airbags. Also, if you are that tired you should not be . driving.' But another commentator, Linda Gill, . said: 'It's not something I would have done but I choose not to come on . here and condemn her. 'It's very easy to come on here and cast . judgement on others, because I'm sure you've never, ever done anything . wrong in your lives. Inaction: New Zealand police have not launched an investigation because it is yet to receive a complaint . 'The difference is someone took a photo this time. Aren't you all glad that someone isn't following you around with a camera. (Aimed at no one in particular, just food for thought).' The supermarket's compliance manager, Marty Fryer, said he was not aware of what happened until someone alerted him to it yesterday. He added: 'We have staff in the car park so if they saw something like a baby in a car . they would bring it to our attention.' A parent or guardian who leaves a child under the age of 14 alone for an unreasonable time or in unreasonable conditions, could be fined up to NZ$2,000 (£1,000). Police have said it was a dangerous thing to do and the women could be prosecuted but they have not received any reports of the incident. A spokeswoman for the force said: 'We don't know who the people are, we don't know the phone number, we don't know where to start. 'We would launch an investigation if we could but at this stage no one's come forward.' Plunket National Child Safety adviser Sue Campbell said there are significant risks with leaving a baby or young child alone in a car. She explained: 'Babies can dehydrate quickly and become very distressed. So for a newborn that's one of the key issues.

These heartbreaking pictures show a rural Indian girl of just 18 months old suffering from hydrocephalus, a build up of fluid inside the skull. The family of Roona Begum, from the village of Jirania in Tripura, cannot afford to pay for her to be treated. Her father Abdul Rahman, 26, works in a brick factory. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Indian labourer Abdul Rahman, 26, holds his 18-month-old daughter Roona Begum who suffers from hydrocephalus,a build-up of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling, in front of their home . Babies who are born with hydrocephalus would normally require prompt surgical treatment to avoid being left permanently disabled. But without the means to pay for a doctor, Mr Rahman and his family can only do their best to keep Roona comfortable as they watch her condition slowly and inexorably deteriorate. Sometimes misleadingly known as water on the brain, hydrocephalus is caused by a build-up of the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull, increasing pressure on the brain inside. The brain constantly produces new cerebrospinal fluid at the rate of about a pint a day, while old fluid is released from the brain and reabsorbed into the blood vessels. But if this process is interrupted, as in individuals with hydrocephalus, levels of the fluid can quickly build up and place pressure on the brain, causing headaches, blurred vision and, eventually, permanent brain damage. 'Left untreated, if it progresses very quickly, the babies usually die because their brain tissues are unable to adapt,' said Gill Yaz, health development manager for Shine, a UK charity set up to help people affected by hydrocephalus. But, she added, if the condition develops more slowly, as in Roona's case, the child adapts by growing their skulls to contain the excess fluid. However, the adaptation can only go so far. Desperately sad: Babies who are born with hydrocephalus would normally require prompt surgical treatment to avoid being left disabled. It can be caused by birth defects or as the result of an infection in the mother . The main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube, called a shunt, in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where it can be more easily reabsorbed. The shunt has a valve inside it to control the flow of fluid and to ensure it does not drain too quickly, which those treated can feel as a lump under the skin of their scalps. Ms Yaz told MailOnline: 'It's done by paediatric neurosurgeons, but its not a very demanding procedure. The operation usually lasts about 30 minutes.' Roona rests inside her house: The main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube, called a shunt, in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where is can be absorbed . A spokesman for Headway, the brain injury association, told MailOnline that shunting is very effective, but there can be complications of infections, obstructed shunts and haemotomas. 'These are avoided by another operation called a third ventriculostomy. This involves creating a hole in the floor of the third ventricle for the fluid to drain through,' he said, adding that this is only suitable for some types of hydrocephalus. Experts estimate that the congenital form of the condition affects around one in every 500 children. It can be caused by birth defects like spina bifida, or as the result of an infection that the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella. The condition can also be acquired after birth by both adults and children, often as the result of a serious head injury or medical condition such as a brain tumour. Keeping her comfortable: Hydrocephalus can be cured by surgery, but without money to pay for a doctor, Mr Rahmancan only keep Roona comfortable and watch her condition inexorably deteriorate . Without an expert medical opinion, it is impossible to know how Roona came to be affected by hydrocephalus and impossible to know what related conditions she might be suffering from. In the West, children diagnosed with the disorder and promptly treated can go on to lead normal lives. In India, things are different. In a blunt assessment of his government's failure to extend a social safety net for the poor, India's rural development minister said last year that the country's public health system had 'collapsed'. But experts say it is too late for Roona, as any surgery could be fatal. Mr Sanj Bassi, Consultant Adult and Paediatric Neurosurgeon at Kings College Hospital, said: 'It is too late to do anything now. The brain will be damaged, and  draining the fluid can cause problems by causing the brain to collaspe and bleed. 'Roona should really be left untreated. She will not make any recovery and will not ever live a life of any independence. 'Hydrocephalus is very common, and we see it to this extent very commonly in developing nations.'

Big claimer: The BBC paid for its former Chief operating officer Caroline Thomson to fly to America - a month after she lost her job . The BBC paid £4,200 for its top female executive to fly to the United States – two weeks after she left the corporation. Caroline Thomson lost her job in September when her role was axed but still collected a pension pot of £1.71million and exit package worth £670,000 – more than twice her salary. By October the former chief operating officer, who had been tipped as director general, had jetted to Phoenix, Arizona, for a junket paid for by licence fee payers. The details emerged in the latest report breaking down expenses for senior BBC executives. Taxi fares for executives earning more than £150,000 have gone up by almost a fifth in a year, it shows. Miss Thomson, 58, spent £1,178.97 on cabs in the last three months of her 37-year BBC career. BBC North director Peter Salmon claimed £150.25 for a single journey last June and BBC1 controller Danny Cohen claimed £164 for taxis over two days last August. Creative director Alan Yentob, who is paid £168,300, spent £822.88 on cars in his quarterly claim. And former director general Mark Thompson clawed back £454.89 for a two-night stay at a New York hotel last February. He later become chief executive of the New York Times Company but the BBC says the trip was not connected to his search for a job. Other significant costs included a claim of £586 for flights by £332,900-a-year ‘director of BBC people’ Lucy Adams, when she had to cut her holiday short last year to fulfil a ‘critical role’ in planning for the start of the new director general. Rising costs: Expense claims for taxi fares at the BBC have risen by nearly a fifth in the space of a year . At the other end of the scale, there was evidence of penny-pinching by senior bosses. Mr . Thompson claimed £2.50 for a tram to MediaCity in Salford and director . of global news Peter Horrocks claimed 6p for a Skype call from his . personal mobile phone. The . corporation yesterday claimed it has made ‘significant progress’ in . reducing expenditure, with total expenses down by 8 per cent in a year. ‘The . bulk of our expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a . major international broadcasting organisation,’ said a spokesman. Miss Thomson’s US trip was arranged before her departure, he added. Last night Conservative MP Jake Berry said the BBC should ‘embrace transparency’. ‘At . a time when the BBC is pledging to cut costs it beggars belief that . they are paying for former executives to go on taxpayer funding . junkets,’ he said.","Claims for taxi fares have shot up by almost a fifth in the space of a year .

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he had been 'appalled' taxpayers money was being used to allow prisoners to bring 'unnecessary legal cases' Convicted criminals would be barred from claiming millions in legal aid to fund cases involving complaints about the prison system under plans announced by the Government today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he had been 'appalled' that taxpayers money was being used to allow prisoners to bring 'unnecessary legal cases' which could be dealt with by the prison service's internal complaints system. Announcing a consultation on the plans the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said they would annually save £4 million and cut the number of cases brought by prisoners by 11,000. The proposal comes days after reforms to legal aid came into effect as the Government moves to reduce its £2.2 billion legal aid bill by £350 million. Mr Grayling said: 'I have been appalled that taxpayers pay millions of pounds every year supplying lawyers for prisoners to bring unnecessary legal cases. 'The vast majority of these types of complaint can and should be dealt with by the prison service's complaints system. 'After years spiralling out of control, the amount spent on legal aid for prisoners is being tackled. 'Legal aid must be preserved for those most in need and where a lawyer's services are genuinely needed.' The plan would cut access to legal aid for cases like a prisoner appealing against the category of prison they are held in, a decision to move them to a different section within a prison or taking legal action over issues like visits or correspondence, the MoJ said. The proposals will be included in a consultation on changes to legal aid to be published shortly, a spokesman said. Currently there is an internal prison requests and complaints system and on top of that an Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to which appeals can be made. Cases where prisoners are appealing against a sentence or where their actual detention is being reviewed - such as at a parole hearing - would still receive legal aid, the MoJ said. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'The Government's proposals to further curtail legal aid for prisoners are profoundly unfair and will have negative consequences for society as a whole. 'The misuse of solitary confinement can exacerbate mental health problems and lead to lost lives. Prisoners can currently go to an internal prison requests and complaints system as well as an Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman . 'Access to behavioural programmes or help with resettlement can mean the difference between a prisoner going on to change their life for the better or to reoffend. 'An internal complaints system is no replacement for external scrutiny by the courts, while the already stretched prison ombudsman does not have the power to provide meaningful redress. 'Without prisoners being able to access legal aid, which has already been restricted to prevent frivolous claims, we may see a collapse in justice in the very place where it should be paramount - within prison walls.' Cases where prisoners are appealing against a sentence or where their actual detention is being reviewed would still receive legal aid (file picture) But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Britain’s legal aid bill has become unsustainable and must be reformed. 'It’s important that prisoners, like everyone else, have access to justice, but this must not be abused. 'Taxpayers are sick to death of paying for frivolous legal actions by inmates who do it simply because someone else is paying. 'The Government is absolutely right to be cracking down on this - and not before time.' Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'It's important that the Justice Secretary is opening a consultation rather than, as it might sound, presenting a fait accompli. 'While no-one would support vexatious use of the law, when it comes to people deprived of their liberty and held by the State you do need safeguards to ensure that our prison system is fair, decent and open to legitimate challenge.' Reforms to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) came into effect this week. Private family law, such as divorce and custody battles, personal injury cases, some employment and education law, immigration cases where the person is not detained and some debt, housing and benefit issues will all be affected. Some law firms estimate the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent, meaning around 200,000 fewer cases, while barristers have warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced in 1949.","Justice Secretary 'appalled' taxpayers money used for 'unnecessary' cases .

The move helped ensure that Mr Osborne narrowly met his self-imposed rules on public borrowing when he delivered his autumn statement on the economy in December. 4G licences awarded: All the major mobile phone companies - EE, Hutchison 3G, O2 parent Telefonica and Vodafone - sucessfully bid for a slice of the spectrum, with Vodafone picking up the biggest piece of the pie .

The Treasury last night insisted it . was content with the sale, pointing out that the £1.2 billion shortfall . was only a tiny fraction of total tax receipts. Sources said Mr Osborne . will announce in next month’s budget how the hole in the public finances . will be filled. But Labour seized on the development as another blow for Mr Osborne’s economic strategy. Already on the market: EE was the second highest bidder paying £588.9million for its slice of the airwaves. The network already has access to 4G and was the first to it to UK mobile users last year . Shadow Treasury chief secretary . Rachel Reeves said: ‘It shows how foolish and short-termist the . Chancellor was to bank this cash in the autumn statement to make his . borrowing figures look less bad. ‘He couldn’t bring himself to admit . that borrowing was up so far this year but his trickery has now badly . backfired.’ The 4G sale is also embarrassing for the independent Office . for Budget Responsibility, which made the £3.5 billion forecast, and . which has repeatedly got its growth predictions wrong since it was set . up in 2010. Former Tory Cabinet minister John . Redwood said it was unfair to blame the Chancellor, adding: ‘He has made . an independent budget office who are meant to know about these things, . and I am afraid they have been consistently wrong. ‘They have consistently overestimated . the growth in the economy and they have consistently overestimated the . revenues.’ Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the completion of the 4G . auction six months early would produce a ‘significant economic boost’ for the country. Auction facts: Bidders in the 4G sale competed to buy airwaves in two separate bands - the higher frequency 2.6 GHz and lower frequency 800 MHz - with 28 lots up for grabs . ‘The benefits will be seen in the UK . from the summer onwards as mobile operators deliver competitive high . speed mobile broadband services,’ she said. Ofcom said that by 2030 demand for . the mobile data could be 80 times higher than today and it was planning . for a further spectrum for possible future 5G mobile services. 4G services should make it much . quicker to surf the web on mobiles, giving speeds close to home . broadband services and allowing consumers to stream high-quality video, . watch live TV and download large files. For the typical user, download speeds . of initial 4G networks will be at least five to seven times faster than . those for existing 3G networks. Faster than ever before: How 4G compares to 3G . This means a music album that takes 20 minutes to download on a 3G phone will take just over three minutes on 4G. Meanwhile, Britain’s coveted AAA . credit rating could come under yet more pressure today as the Chancellor . struggles to get the country’s ballooning debts back under control. The government borrowed £106.5billion . in the first nine months of the financial year, which runs from April . 2012 to the end of March 2013. That is £7.2billion or 7.3 per cent . more than at the same stage of the previous year.The Office for National . Statistics will today reveal how the exchequer fared in January - with . many analysts fearing the worst. January is a crucial month for the . public finances and has recorded a surplus in every year but one since . the monthly borrowing records began in 1993. It is usually boosted by the payment . of corporation tax, capital gains tax and self-assessment income tax but . with the economy struggling to recovery revenues are dwindling. The surge in borrowing has fuelled . fears that Britain will be stripped of its gold-plated credit rating in a . crushing setback for George Osborne. Martin Beck, an economist at Capital . Economics, said: ‘If the figures for January are bad, the chance of a . downgrade will increase, although the rating agencies would probably . wait to hear what the Chancellor announced in the Budget before doing . anything.’","Auction was expected to raise £3.5billion, but bids total just £2.3billion .

Jailed: Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was ordered to return to prison by the Supreme Court today and complete a reduced sentence for gun charges . Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt has been ordered to return to prison to complete a five year sentence for possessing a guns given to him by one of the masterminds behind the 1993 terror attacks in Mumbai. Dutt acquired the AK-46 automatic rifle and a handgun from Abu Salem, who was convicted for his role in the 13 bomb blasts in 1993, which killed 257 people. The actor had been jailed in 2005 for six years for the gun charges - although he was cleared of terror offences - but only served 18 months before being released in 2007 on bail. But the Supreme Court today ruled that the charges were too severe for bail and ordered Dutt to return to jail within four weeks to complete the remaining three-and-a-half years of a reduced five year term. The 53-year-old is considered Bollywood royalty and the film industry is thought to have invested more than £30 million in upcoming movies with him in the starring role. His career began when he was a child, the son of one of India's mots popular acting couples, Sunil and Nargis. Dutt regularly played policemen and gangsters, and his portrayal of a gangster in Lage Raho Munna Bhai cemented his place as a Bollywood star. Gun charges: The 53-year-old actor after he was released from prison in Pune on bail in 2007 . The 1993 attacks are widely believed to have been ordered by gangster Dawood Ibrahim and supported by Pakistan's intelligence agency. Child star: Dutt's career began as a child, the son of one of India's most popular acting couples, Sunil and Nargis . The blasts were thought to have been carried out in revenge for the death of Muslims in communal riots be in 1992. Dutt's defence team had argued that he got hold of the weapon to protect his Muslim mother. His MP sister, Priya, was in court to hear the ruling and was visibly upset. Dutt's lawyer said the actor will 'abide' by the order. The court also considered the sentences of several others convicted following the bomb attack and reduced the death penalty for 10 defendants to life sentences. It also confirmed the death sentence given to Yakub Memon, brother of 'Tiger' Memon, who is suspected to be one of the masterminds behind the bombings. Vani Tripathi, national secretary of the Hindu nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, who performed alongside Dutt in the 1998 film Dushman, told The Telegraph she was sadden by the ruling but that there should be no exceptions for celebrities. She saddened: 'I have seen how Sanjay Dutt bounced back to life after those rough years. 'The decision has come from the highest court of the land leaving little scope for any doubt about the process. I am saddened and shocked but law is blind in terms of status and emotions. This is rule of the law and it has taken its course.'","Dutt acquired the guns from Abu Salem, a mastermind behind the blasts .

Meetings: Former Downing Street chief of ctaff Sir Jeremy Heywood raised questions about Libor as early as 2008 . Britain's most senior civil servant discussed Libor rates with the Bank of England at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank’s deputy governor Paul Tucker confirmed that one of the Whitehall figures he spoke to about the issue was the then Downing Street chief of staff Sir Jeremy Heywood, who is now the Cabinet Secretary. Emails released under freedom of information laws show Sir Jeremy privately raised questions about the way Libor was being set during the 2008 banking crisis. He expressed concern that the rates for borrowing in US dollars were falling faster than those in sterling. In one email, Sir Jeremy asked Mr Tucker if he had heard that Libor is high ‘because Barclays are bidding it’. However, at no point do the email exchanges show Sir Jeremy encouraging Mr Tucker to tell Barclays to manipulate its rates artificially. Other figures Mr Tucker suggested had raised concerns about interbank borrowing rates include Gordon Brown’s private secretary Tom Scholar, another senior Downing Street adviser Sir Jon Cunliffe, and Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson. But he repeatedly denied that any Whitehall officials or Government ministers - including Ed Balls and Baroness Vadera - ever encouraged him to ‘lean on’ Barclays or any other bank to lower its Libor submissions. Lady Vadera, a Cabinet Office minister who was one of Mr Brown’s closest advisers on the economy, added comments to a note prepared by bankers at UBS entitled ‘Reducing Libor’ that was circulated in Whitehall at the time. The emails between Sir Jeremy and Paul Tucker, pictured, have been released under the Freedom of Information Act . It suggested legitimate ways of reducing the rate using government lending schemes. Lady Vadera has denied putting any pressure on banks or the Bank to lower Libor. Mr Tucker told MPs: ‘I don’t think that I spoke to Shriti Vadera throughout this whole period at all.’ Labour said Chancellor George Osborne, who claimed last week that Labour figures were ‘clearly involved’ in the rate-fixing scandal, should apologise. Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls said: ‘It is now absolutely clear that the Chancellor’s allegations last week were totally false and completely without foundation. George Osborne should now publicly withdraw these false allegations and apologise. ‘With the economy in a double-dip recession and our banks in need of serious reform, the country needs a Chancellor who works full-time in the national economic interest.’ A Treasury source said: ‘We’ve been saying all along that we don’t think Tucker or Heywood did anything wrong. 'These emails don’t answer anything about what senior Labour figures knew or were saying in conversations with the banks. 'Labour protests too much. Can they say that no Labour figure was aware of Libor low-balling? 'Can they say no Labour figure implicitly or explicitly condoned it in conversations with the banks?

Between the choice of reading one of the sweariest cookbooks you're ever likely to read and 'no coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no eggs, no sugar, no shellfish, no deep-water fish, no wheat, no meat, no soy and nothing processed at all' it seems the novice foodies of Britain have made up their minds. Bad Cook, an eBook by journalist and intrepid amateur chef Esther Walker, was released yesterday and immediately raced ahead of Gwyneth Paltrow's It's All Good in the Amazon book charts. The book is inspired by Esther's popular food blog, the Recipe Rifle, and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen . The book is inspired by Esther's popular food blog, Recipe Rifle, and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen. It also includes tales of life as a mother to her two-year-old daughter Kitty and as a wife to restaurant critic Giles Coren. Here, to celebrate the launch of her book Esther shares her top five tips for 'crap cooks' like her and a fail safe Salmon en Croute recipe to impress a date. 'You can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking or you candie of a) starvation b) boredom' 1) Don't rush . Accept . that you are a bad cook and so when you ARE cooking, make sure you're . not under any time pressure. Cooking in haste is a guaranteed way of . really making a mess of things. 2) Try things out . It . can seem like a waste to make anything more complicated than pasta when . it's just you, but you have to try new recipes out or you'll never . learn and get better - and using yourself as a guinea pig rather than, . say a dinner party of 6, leaves you less open to panic, failure and . embarrassment. 3) Don't assume that cooking is easy, because it isn't . Gwyneth's book has been trumped . At least, not for everyone. Although Jamie and Nigella and Nigel make knocking up dinner a joyous breeze on telly, it's not like that for the novice cook. So when attempting a recipe, follow it to the letter. Don't skip any steps, weigh everything properly, use the right-sized dishes and time everything religiously. 4) Keep it simple . If . you want to cook for a lot of people, don't be afraid to serve up . something homely, like spaghetti bolognese or a fish pie. Everybody will . love it. And having people over isn't just about dishing up impressive . food - just make sure there is plenty to eat and drink and have a bunch . of flowers somewhere and everyone will be delighted. 5) Salt is the key to cooking . An . extra pinch of salt can transform a dish from bland to delicious. So if . your curry is lacking a certain something, your pie seems uninspiring . or your bolognese needs a boost, sprinkle over a large pinch of salt and . see if that makes a difference. Intro taken from Recipe Rifle . 'I had Salmon en Croute once at someone's house and it was absolutely disgusting. 'The cook had failed to use any salt, because they are the sort of person . who thinks that any salt kills you stone dead within weeks. My view is . that you can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking and run . the extremely tiny risk of it doing you some damage, or you can use no . salt and die of a) starvation b) boredom. And get some mean leg cramps . in the night. 'But there's no reason why Salmon en Croute shouldn't be a delicious . thing. It's wrapped in pastry! I mentally file this kind of thing under . my 'finishing school' category of cooking. Quiches and souffles are . also filed under this category.

You can skin them . yourself, but it is tricky. 1 x packet of all-butter puff pastry1 egg, beatensalt and pepper1 small bunch dill, chopped - basil will also work here, if you don't like dill40g butter at room temperature1 tbsp wholegrain mustard .

Put the butter in a small . bowl with a pinch of salt and a few turns of the pepper grinder and then . mash in the dill with the back of a spoon. Set to one side. 3 . Take your salmon fillets and have a look at how they would fit together, . like a Yin Yang sign - this is how you are going to sandwich them . together before wrapping them in the pastry. Then spread one side of . your salmon sandwich with the herb butter and the other side with the . wholegrain mustard, then fit together and set to one side. 4 Put a baking tray in the oven to get nice and hot (this will help prevent a soggy bottom...) 5 . Roll out the puff pastry until it is about the thickness of a pound . coin (have a look at an actual pound coin, because this is thinner than . you think it is). Now place your salmon in the middle and bring the . pastry up and over it to form a neat parcel. Trim the ends so there . isn't too much of an overlap and tuck it all in, like a present. Seal . all the edges with some beaten egg to help it stick. (If you don't have a . pastry brush to distribute the egg, you can just use a finger.) 6 . Turn the salmon over, so that the seam is on the underside. Make three . slits in the top of your parcel to let steam escape and brush all over . with beaten egg (I also sprinkle some sea salt and pepper over the top . for decoration). 7 Now take your hot baking tray out of the oven . and brush with a little bit of oil to stop the salmon en croute from . sticking. You can use a folded square of kitchen towel for this. Lay . your pastry parcel on the baking tray and bake for 35 mins. Produce to gasps of awe from your date.

A shyster sports memorabilia dealer has admitted he trimmed the corners on the most valuable baseball card ever sold, but the $2.8million 1908 Honus Wagner is likely to increase in value as a result. Bill Mastro, Chicago's 'King of Memorabilia,' made the confession on Tuesday as he pleaded guilty to defrauding customers by using straw bidders to drive up the price of his rare sports merchandise. The famous card, which has a well-documented story, was famously purchased by hockey legend Wayne Gretzky after it was discovered by a small-time collector in 1985. Proud owner: This is the infamous Gretzky Honus Wagner card, being displayed by Ken Kendrick after he bought it for $2.8million . On trial: Bill Mastro was once the 'King of Memorabilia.' He is now on trial for selling fakes and manipulating prices. He admitted to doctoring the most famous card in the world . It broke baseball card-collecting records in 2007 when Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick paid $2.8million for it. Trimming the corners of the card would have given it a fresher, newer appearance and made it more valuable. Despite the alteration, the so-called 'Gretzky card' won't lose value. In fact, it could go up as a result of the news, Steve Levine, of Goldin Auctions in New Jersey, told MailOnline. 'I think in this industry and hobby, the bigger the story, the better. Also, especially if you can verify it,' he said. 'We all know that this has happened with . that card. Now it’s the infamous Bill Mastro-trimmed-Gretzky-Honus . Wagner card,' Levin said. Last week, Goldin Auctions sold a different T206 Wagner card for $2.1million. The condition of that card was three grades lower than the Gretzky card that Master altered. Most famous card in the world: This 1909 Honus Wagner baseball card is the most famous collecting card ever sold . Levin said the Gretzky card could easily fetch $3million is it were sold today. In a statement released by the . Diamondbacks on Wednesday, Kendrick said: 'As a collector of rare cards . and a fan who enjoys the history of the game of baseball, today's news . does not change my pride in owning the Honus Wagner T-206 card. Value: This card is worth so much because of its rarity - only 30 left - and its documented history . 'In fact, I've been advised that the . notoriety of this turn of events has actually increased the value of the . card and I will continue to enjoy having it as part of the . ""Diamondbacks collection.""' Despite Mastro's admission, a judge . on Tuesday threw out his plea deal and said that the two and a half . years of prison time promised by prosecutors might not be enough. In addition to artificially driving up the price of goods at his Mastro Auctions company, Mastro is also accused of selling fake collectables. Among his alleged forgeries a bogus lock of Elvis Presley's hair and a fake 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings trophy. Rumors have long circulated about the Gretzky card. It is a remarkable example of an exceptionally rare collectible. Pittsburgh Pirates star Honus Wagner is considered one of the best shortstops in the history of the game. The T206 Wagner card was larger than normal baseball trading cards and was sold in packs of American Tobacco cigarettes. Wager ordered American Tobacco to . stop printing his card after just 200 were made, objecting to the . card being sold in cigarette packs because he didn't want kids smoking. He destroyed most of the originals himself. Only about 30 are known to remain. Mastro came upon the Gretzky T206 card . in 1985 when a small-time collector from Hicksville, New York, sought . to sell it for $25,000. In 1991, Gretzky bought the card for $410,000. He sold it to WalMart in 1995 for $500,000. Legend: Honus Wagner was one the greatest baseball players of his day and is considered among the great shortstop ever. However his baseball card is so valuable because it is so rare . WalMart then gave the card away on live TV as part of a nationwide promotion to increase its baseball card sales. A Florida postal worker won the card, but had to immediately sell it because she couldn't afford the taxes on such a large gift. After being sold several more times at auction, Kendrick later purchased it in 2007. Collectors have long speculated that the card had been altered. One of the original owners, who sold it to Mastro, even publicly alleged that Mastro had cut the corners. However, Mastro had never confirmed that until Tuesday.","The 1908 T206 Honus Wanger card once owned by Wayne Gretzky is the most famous and most valuable trading card in history .

The East Yorkshire couple have been travelling the world since last summer and celebrating their love for each other by having 22 wedding ceremonies in different countries - and they still have eight to go. Alex Pelling and Lisa Grant pictured with their campervan Peggy, left, and at the ceremony that started everything in Didsbury West Manchester, right . What's more, the pair say they are now more in love than ever. So far they have been hitched among dolphins in Hawaii, dressed as vampires in LA, on an island in Honduras, in a crayfish-riddled lake in Michigan, in a vineyard in Quebec, on the beach in Mexico, on horseback in Banff and in 15 other locations around Central, South and North America. Speaking to MailOnline, the . couple - who have known each other for 11 years and been dating for six - said: 'The idea came as we looked for a place to get married . before we left our lives behind to travel around the world for two . years. 'The wedding . opportunities offered to us in the UK did not suit what we wanted, so we . decided to look for the perfect place to wed while we travelled. 'After . a glass of wine or two the idea grew, and we made a decision to have a . small ceremony in every country we visited, with the local cultures and . traditions in mind. 'At the . end of our trip (which we have just extended to three years) we will . choose our favourite place to officially ""tie the knot""!' Rose petals and romance aboard an old ship in Costa Rica, left, and in Peru, right, where the couple say the ceremony was the most emotional, touching and beautiful . Old fashioned romance at a flower market in Seattle where local professional photographer Jonas Seaman helped them capture one of their special days . Ever since their first wedding in Manchester (which Alex organised as a surprise for Lisa), the couple have kept . an online blog about the travels, and professional photographers have . helped document the trip. Anyone who wishes to attend one of their ceremonies can request an invitation on their blog. To fund the trip Alex and Lisa and sold both the car repair shop Alex owned and their home. Sticking to a strict weekly budget they have been travelling and living in their 25-year-old Dodge campervan, called Peggy, which has cut out any costs for accommodation. Alex said: 'The budget is very tight but we are . managing. Our biggest cost is . fuel, obviously, and we do a weekly shop at local markets to reducing our living . costs. 'And of course we could not even begin to afford to throw a wedding . every other week if it was not for the generosity of the photographers, . suppliers, families and people we meet on our journey. 'Everyone helps . us for free or a minimal cost as they want to help us spread the love . and to be a part of our adventure!'

When asked about any problems they . have encountered along the way, the couple say making repairs to Peggy . has been the biggest hurdle. 'Making repairs to Peggy has been our biggest hurdle,' they said. 'We bought her in Canada and have . covered over 55,000km so far. We have only had minimal problems but . they have been difficult to solve with the language barriers! 'With regards to the wedding side of the journey, everyone has been so . accommodating and we have had very few obstacles, only once were we . turned away for a ceremony for not having commited to the same religious . beliefs as the local church. 'And even then the church invited us to . attend mass and dedicated that evenings prayers to us and our travels . and commitments to each other.' The couple say their Peru wedding was . 'the most emotional, touching and stunningly beautiful; and therefore . probably their favourite, and that one of the trickiest to organise was . in Belize, where they wanted to . hold a ceremony in the . Toledo district with help from local Mayan people, but where a week-long . torrential downpour and a photographer stuck 600km away hampered . proceedings. 'We were about ready to give up when the . sun came out just in time for the wedding! It was a beautiful day and we . learned such an important lesson about the things we take for granted!'

Even more luckily, they say they are still as much in love as they were when their adventure began. 'And . probably more so! We are together 24 hours a day, seven days a week and . live in a van.

Met Police officers from the unit investigating Jimmy Savile are to meet with the Labour MP who revealed claims of an historic link between a paedophile network and Downing Street. The Scotland Yard team leading the Operation Yewtree investigation into the disgraced TV presenter is to speak to Tom Watson who last week stunned the House of Commons with claims child sex abuse was linked to a former Prime Minister’s inner circle. Mr Watson told MPs there was ‘clear intelligence’ linking a former Number 10 aide with a notorious group of sex offenders. Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe today announced officers investigating sex abuse claims against Jimmy Savile would speak to Labour MP Tom Watson after he told the Commons that evidence could exist linking a former Downing Street aide to a paedophile ring . He then wrote to Met Commisioner Bernard Hogan Howe giving more details which he had not made public. Mr Watson claimed that the police file used to convict Peter Righton in 1992 of importing child pornography from Holland needed to be looked at again. He claimed to have been contacted by a former child protection specialist who had been concerned for years that Righton’s activities and connections had not been properly investigated. In particular, files seized from Righton’s home which included letters from known paedophiles, Mr Watson claimed. Today Mr Hogan Howe told a media briefing in London on the progress of Operation Yewtree that officers were preparing to discuss the details of the Righton case with the West Bromwich East MP. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Mr Watson said there was a trail between the evidence used to convictRighton and No 10. He . told the Commons: ‘The evidence used to convict paedophile Peter . Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread . paedophile ring. ‘One of . its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime . minister who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from . abroad. ‘The leads were . not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to ensure that the . Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate . clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to . Parliament and No 10.’ Mr . Cameron said Mr Watson ‘raises a very difficult and complex case’ and he . was ‘not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to’. But he agreed to look . at the case ‘very carefully and see what the Government can do’ to give . Mr Watson the assurances he wanted. Prime Minister: David Cameron said Mr Watson 'raises a very difficult and complex case' and he was 'not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to' Today Mr Watson welcomed the news that officers from Operation Yewtree would now investigate. He told MailOnline: ‘I appreciate the Met Police taking an interest in what I think is a very important issue. 'The most important thing is that they secure the evidence seized from the home of Peter Righton. ‘If this still exists, there is intelligence that they could go on.’ Righton was 66 when convicted by magistrates in Evesham in Worcestershire in 1992 of importing and possessing pornographic material involving boys under the age of 16. He had been academic expert in child care, delivering lectures on the issue across the country. Mr Watson says he was contacted by ‘a former child protection specialist’ who . had harboured concerns for years that the Righton case was never . properly explored. Writing on his blog he added: ‘The central allegation was that a large body of material had not been fully investigated. ‘Within the material...were letters from known and convicted paedophiles. The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed one paedophile in particular was of great concern. ‘He said the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children.’","Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe says officers from Operation Yewtree will speak to Tom Watson .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 14 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:25 EST, 15 April 2013 . Mick Philpott has quit his prison job after just 35 minutes, it was claimed yesterday. The child killer was handed a £14-a-week cleaning role - his first job for a decade - at the high security Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire. But after complaining about the work, he left his mop and broom and stormed back to his cell. Philpott has just started his life sentence  after being convicted of six counts of manslaughter for killing his six children in a house fire he started deliberately. Scroll down for video . Quit: Mick Philpott, pictured with wife Mairead, stormed back to his cell after giving up his first job for 10 years . The 56-year-old, described as 'disturbingly dangerous with no moral compass', has become a hate figure and, according to reports, has also been placed on a hit list by a group of travellers. He conned them out of thousands of pounds when he appealed for cash to pay for the funeral of his children, it was claimed. A source close to the Prison Service said the travellers, disgusted to discover Philpott was responsible for the fire that caused their deaths, want him taught a lesson. In total, more than £15,000 was raised within the . devastated community of Allenton for the service at St Mary's Catholic . Church, Derby, with each casket carried on a horse-drawn carriage. The travelling community also handed over thousands, it was reported. But benefactors were rocked by claims . that Philpott wanted the cash converted to Argos vouchers and intended . to auction tributes, including teddies, placed outside his burnt-out . home last May. The prison source said Philpott is now a marked man. More than £15,000 was raised within the . devastated community of Allenton for the service at St Mary's Catholic . Church, Derby . The jobless father of 17, aided by wife Mairead, herself a member of the travelling community, and friend Paul Mosley, gambled with his own children's lives by starting the blaze at the family's three-bedroom semi. He intended to frame former lover Lisa Willis - who was embroiled in a custody battle with him - and emerge a hero by rescuing those trapped inside the property. He also wanted a bigger house. But the scheme went horribly wrong. Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, were overcome by smoke. Mairead, dubbed little more than Philpott's chattel, and Mosley were both sent down for 17 years. Mark Leech, editor of prisoners' newspaper Converse has visited Wakefield six times in the last 18 months. Philpott's new neighbours include cannibal Robert Maudsley, who ate one victim's brains, Milly Dowler's killer Levi Bellfield and Roy Whiting, who murdered Sarah Payne . He said: 'He is going to find it very difficult in prison, not because he's a child killer - there are plenty of those at Wakefield, but because he tried to fit-up two innocent people. 'He has been condemned to a living hell spent looking nervously over his shoulder, I think this is inevitable because of the prison hierarchy. 'Mick Philpott is at the bottom of the pile, down there with child-killers, paedophiles and informants. Armed robbers are at the top. He is most at risk from the mentally unstable, who believe there is a warped sense of stature in scarring the killer. 'Some will select Philpott for trying to put others in the frame for his crime. There are people in Wakefield who are in denial over their offences. They will see people like him as being responsible for their convictions.' Before being banged-up, Philpott confided to a friend that he feared being 'ripped apart' in a prison dubbed 'Monster Mansion' because of the psychopaths locked-up there. His new neighbours include cannibal Robert Maudsley, who ate one victim's brains, Milly Dowler's killer Levi Bellfield and Roy Whiting, who murdered Sarah Payne. The B-wing at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, where Mick Philpott is housed . Britain's most violent inmate Charles Bronson, who has moved prisons 120 times due to a history of attacks on staff and inmates, is also at Wakefield. Soham murderer Ian Huntley was attacked twice there and serial killer Dr Harold Shipman hanged himself in a cell. 'It is a Category A prison,' said Mr Leech. 'When he is out of his cell, there will be two officers with him. When he moves out of the cell-block, there will be two officers and a dog-handler. 'His cell will consist of a TV, bed, toilet, wash basin, some books and toiletries. He will have a prison wage of £2.50 a week. 'Because of the security issue, he won't be able to go to workshops. Because of what he's done, he won't have the support of loved ones.' Yesterday, a spokesman for Derbyshire Police said they were unaware of the threat to Philpott. She said: 'We have had no information to suggest there is any tension or anger from the travelling community following the conviction of the Philpotts. 'Derbyshire Police hasn't received any calls or complaints from that section of the community.' A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We do not comment on individual prisoners.'","Child killer was handed £14-a-week cleaning role at Wakefield Prison .

"By . Michael Zennie and Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 23:14 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:01 EST, 12 April 2013 . TechCrunch blog founder Michael Arrington has denied claims he raped and physically abused an ex-girlfriend, insisting she made up the 'impossible' accusations because she was bitter he had taken up with a new lover. Arrington, a Silicon Valley kingmaker, is demanding Jenn Allen unconditionally retract a series of 'false and defamatory' statements she made about him on Facebook in recent weeks and has threatened legal action if she doesn't oblige. He also said he has involved police. Allen, herself a tech entrepreneur, claimed Arrington had physically and emotionally abused her during their eight year relationship, culminating in the alleged rape on March 5, 2012, and said he threatened to kill her if she told anyone. In a subsequent post on a news site, she claimed that Arrington had also sexually assaulted a friend. Contact: Arrington's attorney has made public a series of sexy photos, left and right, Allen sent to her ex after the alleged rape . Arrington hit back at the claims last week, calling them 'completely untrue' and said he had contacted police because of the 'gravity of the accusations.' But yesterday he published a stern and lengthy letter from his attorney Eric George to Allen on his website uncrunched.com where the lawyer insisted his client couldn't have committed the alleged rape because 'On March 5, 2012, Michael was in Washington and you were in California.' 'Your twice-repeated allegation of rape/physical abuse by Michael is not only false, but factually impossible,' George wrote. 'Michael's whereabouts are confirmed by travel records and credit card statements in my possession, and your whereabouts are proven by a photo of you at a San Francisco party at 1:05 a.m. on March 6, 2012.' The lawyer also accuses Allen of lying when she said she only contacted Arrington once after the alleged rape. Instead, he says she sent some 292 lines worth of data to him in the form of phone calls, texts and emails. Soured: Jenn Allen says she dated Michael Arrington, deemed one of the most influential men in Silicon Valley, for eight years. She is accusing him of rape and physical abuse . Accusations: This is the post that started the allegations against Arrington. Three more abuse allegations have surfaced since then . She also sent him three sexually . explicit photographs of herself the day after the alleged rape, one of which had the subject line 'For only you,' while another included a comment 'The other (pictures) are showing too much to email. Maybe if you beg. :).' Other messages Arrington received from Allen included extensive landscaping advice and a request for him to invest in her art start-up. Then, on May 2, 2012, Allen asked Arrington to be her plus-one at a wedding two weeks later in Chicago. 'You stated that he engaged in 'physical abuse' and 'emotional abuse' of you, and 'threaten[ed] to murder you if you told anyone about the physical abuse,' George wrote in Thursday's letter. 'The foregoing statements of yours, as well as those set forth below, paint a starkly different picture; they do not portray you as a victim of abuse or murder threats, but rather as a person who is distraught at a break-up, and angered that her ex-boyfriend entered into a new relationship.' The letter also refers to later communications including a April 21, 2012, message stating '(I) feel betrayed and slighted by you, and wish I wasn't alone since you decided to be with someone else so quickly. Not sure how I'm going to teach myself how to love and trust again.' Proof: The lawyer claims a photo of Allen, pictured center, at a San Francisco party at 1:05 a.m. on March 6, 2012 shows she wasn't with Arrington on the day of the alleged rape . Contact: The lawyer also accuses Allen of lying when she said she only contacted Arrington once after the alleged rape . Emails: Instead, George says Allen sent some 292 lines worth of data to him in the form of phone calls, texts and emails, like that pictured . In August 2012, Allen allegedly tweeted: . 'Mike @arrington last chance to reconcile. I[sic] you're not feeling . what I’m feeling, with the same heart, than [sic] f*** you.' The attorney also mentioned an incident on May 18, 2011, where George claims Allen emailed Arrington to tell him she was pregnant and that she planned to have an abortion the following day. 'You subsequently told Michael that you feigned the pregnancy and abortion in order to get him to communicate with you,' George wrote in the letter. Allen came forward with public accusations of rape and physical abuse late last month on Facebook. After her claims, news sites reported another allegation against Arrington - that he threw an ex-girlfriend against her bed in 1999. Arrington, who has been named one of the . most powerful people in the Internet, denied the allegations on his website on April 7 and said that he had hired lawyers to represent him against the 'offending parties.' Only for you: on March 6, 2012, Allen sent the picture, left, and in August 2012, Allen allegedly tweeted: 'Mike @arrington last chance to reconcile. I[sic] you're not feeling what I'm feeling, with the same heart, than [sic] f*** you' The claims were never reported to police. Friends and witnesses have come forward with contradicting stories . about the incidents in question. One of the alleged victims also appears . to deny that Arrington abused her. Other ex-girlfriends have said Arrington never abused them, reports TechCrunch, the blog Arrington founded in 2005. Arrington sold TechCruch to AOL in 2011 for $25million and is no longer is charge of editorial content. The controversy began on March 29 when Allen posted to her 4,700 followers: 'I loved Michael Arrington for 8+ years starting when i implemented Eurekster search at the time on Techcrunch in 2006 and throughout the years. 'i(sic) didn't know he cheated on me multiple times, then tells people it was me immediately after he did it. 'It hurts when you love someone borderline and they can't feel anything at all for you, and threaten to murder you if you told anyone about the physical abuse - all for keeping his reputation. The emotional abuse was equally bad.' Glamorous: Jenn Allen was voted 2010's 'Sexiest Female Entrepreneur.' She is the founder and CEO of RTist.com, which helps connect artists with buyers . Relationship: Allen claims Arrington threatened to kill her if she told anyone he abused her . Allen is the CEO of RTist.com, a website the connects artists with people buying art. In 2010, she accepted an award from GetBizSavvy.com for the 'Sexiest Female Entrepreneur.' When the news site Gawker reported . on the allegations, a user later confirmed to be Allen commented: . 'His lies, abuse, threats and what he did to a friend of mine 5 months . ago was unforgivable as well. He raped her, and she told me in person he . called her to confirm he did it after the fact. 'I'll leave it up to her if she ever wants to report it or say anything. This madness needs to stop, or he needs to start controlling his rage and rape ""disorder.""' Allen's accusations led to reports of two other incidents with his ex-girlfriends that span nearly 15 years. TechCrunch wrote: 'Rumors of similar alleged abuse have circulated in previous years amongst our peers. Many tech reporters have investigated them, but no stories had been published until those based on Allen’s posts this week.' Heavy-hitter: Arrington has been called one of the most influential and powerful voices in Silicon Valley . Stress: Allen, pictured, claimed she has PTSD as a result of the mental and physical abuse she suffered at Arrington's hands . One new allegation surfaced in early April from the former human resources manger of RealNames, a start-up company where Arrington worked starting in 1997. Cecile DeSmet Sharp told Gawker she handled a complaint from an employee who said Arrington has attacked her in her hotel room in 1999 while the two were traveling for a conference. 'I believe he threw her onto the bed. And she started kicking and he held her down really hard,' Sharp said. Sharp said the incident was 'swept under the rug' by the company because Arrington was friends and business partners with the CEO. 'I was essentially told to look the other way,' Sharp said. However, Keith Teire, who ran RealNames until it went under, told TechCrunch that he ordered a full investigation of the incident by an outside firm. 'As is normal in these circumstances an outside party was hired to conduct an investigation. This was extensive and I was never directly involved in it as I was not a witness to any events. The investigation concluded that there was no behavior to answer for. Mike was never reprimanded in any way,' he said.

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze, this sea of golden daffodils should easily lift the spirits on a chilly day. The sight, however, just tells a tale of woe for their growers. Blooming too late to be picked and sold at market, this glorious vision will simply be left to rot. The freezing March conditions meant many of the flowers opened weeks after Mother’s Day and Easter, when they are traditionally in highest demand. A Daisy Among the Daffodils: Daisy Spears, 4, in a field of daffodils near Spalding, Lincolnshire, which are set to go to waste because they bloomed so late in the year . Wastage: Daisy, four, in her boots in the field of daffodils which will be left to rot because there is no longer a market for them . The warmer weather has now sparked a glut of daffodils, but shops and supermarkets are unwilling to buy stems that have already blossomed. ‘The cold weather means the daffodils are way behind this year and all the varieties have flowered late,’ said Claire Taylor, who is chairman of the British Daffodil Growers’ Association and works at Taylor’s Bulbs in Spalding, Lincolnshire. ‘A month ago we were struggling to meet demand as everyone wanted daffodils for Mother’s Day and Easter and there were none around. ‘Now they have appeared but the market has collapsed, orders have completely dried up and prices have fallen through the floor. It means there are lots of daffodils in our fields that we’ll simply leave as there is no point in picking them.’ Demand: The season of highest is around Easter and Mother's Day, but the flowers came too late . Flower power: Britain is the world¿s largest producer of cut daffodils and makes £23million per year from the industry . Although the flowers will be left to rot, they will nourish the soil in the field . Britain is the world’s largest producer of cut daffodils and makes £23million per year from the industry. It also produces half the globe’s daffodil bulbs. Miss Taylor, whose farm grows 400 acres of daffodils, said there were at least ten varieties that will not be picked this year as they have flowered too late. They stopped picking last weekend and the remaining flowers will now be left to die, so the nutrients go back in to the bulbs. Despite the poor weather the farm enjoyed a good season because the shortage of daffodils in early spring, meant they sold at a higher price. She said: ‘The trade has finished now for the year and all growers across the country are in the same situation as me. They will all have late varieties of daffodils which have only just flowered and there is no market for them. ‘The warm weather means people start wanting summer flowers now instead.’ A host of golden dafoodils: Silva Seren (left), 3, playing among the Daffodils in the belated spring weather at St James' Park in London.

Sandra Baxter, of The Daffodil Society, said: ‘It’s the wrong time of year for people to buy daffodils. 'They are out in their gardens concentrating on summer bedding flowers instead. Most growers will have stopped picking now as people just don’t want to see daffodils in their homes now.’ The next generation could struggle to see native bluebells in UK woodlands as hybrid varieties take over, experts have warned. Carpets of scented native bluebells are one of the sights of spring in ancient woodland, but the plant has bred with the non-native Spanish bluebell, which was introduced more than a century ago.

Entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease . The Forestry Commission predicts the British bluebell could be overtaken by hybrids – which have unscented lighter blue flowers – within a generation. Not only would this mean that woodlands lose their traditional scented, deep blue displays of flowers but also, if only hybrids remained, entire bluebell populations could be wiped out if the hybrid variety were affected by disease.

Businessman Andrew Priest outside Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday where he was accused of speeding, using threatening words or behaviour or causing criminal damage . A businessman unleashed a foul mouthed tirade at police in front of a class of children after he was stopped for speeding during a primary school project, a court heard yesterday. Andrew Priest, 39, who was late for a meeting, ranted at community police officers and staff when nine pupils clocked his sports car doing 37mph in a 30mph zone outside their school gates, it was claimed. The telecommunications company boss was said to have angrily performed a wheelspin into the school car park in his Audi A3 and told a PCSO: 'It’s a f****** joke, you’re PCSOs and not even proper pigs. Go and stop some more innocent people.' As the children looked on, Priest also allegedly argued about the accuracy of the speed gun and gesticulated angrily at a classroom assistant yelling: 'Is this what you f****** teach kids? What sort of school is this?' Later when told by a regular constable he would have to pay a £60 fixed penalty notice for speeding, Priest retorted: “I earn £80,000 a year so I can afford the ticket. My f****** solicitor will get me off. I’m going to f****** have you. You’re f*****, I’m going to make a complaint against you.' Priest was eventually handcuffed but he then allegedly grabbed the officer’s police hat and stamped on it before he was bundled into the back of a police van. The children were said to be so upset by his four letter outburst they had to be ushered back into the classroom at Gorsey Bank primary school in Wilmslow, Cheshire. A letter was later sent out to all parents detailing what happened. Details of the four letter rant emerged . as Priest, who lives in a £300,000 flat in Mobberley, Cheshire denied . speeding, using threatening words or behaviour or causing criminal . damage. The incident occurred in November last . year after the police officers were taking part in a 'school speed . watch' project with nine Year 6 pupils as part of Road Safety Week. Any motorists stopped speeding were . given the option of taking a fine, or explaining to children in a 'kids . court' at the school why they broke the speed limit. But . trouble began when Priest who was on his way to a meeting was pulled . over in his silver Audi A3 magistrates in Macclesfield heard. Priest was stopped by a PCSO and a group of schoolchildren involved in a project to tackle speeding . Teaching assistant Debra Barker told the hearing: 'He was very, very angry from the minute he was pulled over. He was aggressive and was using lots of ‘f’ words saying. ‘it’s not even f****** calibrated, it’s a laser’.

A police commissioner is facing an investigation for running a private security firm on the side, prompting accusations of a conflict of interest. Kevin Hurley, an ex-Scotland Yard commander, is still advertising his company’s services online with his personal mobile phone number – even though he is now responsible for governing Surrey Police, for which he is paid £70,000 a year. Inspirational Security Solutions boasts that it provides safety advice and training in undercover investigations, and that its executives are ‘politically aware’. Mr Hurley has also caused controversy by appointing a former colleague in the Met as his £50,000-a-year deputy. Kevin Hurley was a commander at Scotland Yard and is now police commissioner for Surrey but he is being accused of having a conflict of interest over his role as a director of a private security firm . He has declared his business interests online but critics insist his  second job clashes with his public role. He has the power to give contracts to his own firm or other private investigators and could share his unrivalled knowledge of force finances with business clients. It will raise fresh fears over the powers of Police and Crime Commissioners, elected last November in a bid to make forces more accountable. As The Mail on Sunday has disclosed, many have appointed friends and political cronies to well-paid posts without advertising them. Mr Hurley’s private security interests will now be investigated by the official group that scrutinises his actions, the Police and Crime Panel for Surrey. Its chairman, Councillor Dorothy Ross-Tomlin, said last night: ‘I have asked our officers to look into the rules around interests.’ A spokesman for Mr Hurley said: ‘Kevin remains the unremunerated Director of Inspirational Security Solutions Ltd. The company has not been closed, but has not generated any income since the election. The company has never worked for Surrey Police.’ Shamed: Paris Brown quit over Twitter slurs . Police have defended their investigation into shamed youth crime commissioner Paris Brown over remarks she made on Twitter. She was forced to quit  her £15,000-a-year taxpayer-funded job two days after  The Mail on Sunday revealed she had used homophobic and racist terms to refer to gays and travellers. The 17-year-old was visited at her family home by two officers before being asked to surrender her mobile phone. She was later interviewed under caution at a police station. Her lawyers have written to Kent Police, saying the nature of its investigation was ‘wholly disproportionate’. A police spokesman said: ‘We received more than 50 complaints from members  of the public and are investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident.’","Police commissioner for Surrey, Kevin Hurley, questioned over dual role .

Or cheesy garlic bread. Or Sriracha, a hot sauce often used in Thai dishes. Lay's is letting potato chip lovers decide which one of the three will be its newest flavor. All of them will be sold at retailers nationwide starting next week. After trying them, fans have until May to vote for their favorites. The flavor with the most votes will stay on store shelves. New chip on the block: Lay's Thai-inspired Sriracha flavored potato chips, along with two other flavors - Cheesy Garlic Bread and Chicken & Waffles - will be sold at retailers nationwide starting in mid-February 2013 . But if the other two flavors sell well, they may remain in stores, too, said Ann Mukherjee, chief marketing officer at Frito-Lay. 'Who knows, we don't know what's going to happen.' she said. 'Our intent is to keep the one that people vote for.' It's the latest promotional stunt that tries to engage customers through social media and direct interaction, much as Hasbro's Monopoly did with its recent contest that ended with the addition of a cat game token and the demise of the iron. Lay's Chicken & Waffles, Cheesy Garlic Bread and Sriracha were suggested by three people through the company's 'Do Us a Flavor' campaign. A panel of chefs and flavor experts looked though about 3.8 million submissions and selected about 20 flavors to prototype. From there, the judges picked the three finalists. Mukherjee said that each dish was cooked in the test kitchen and compared with the flavored chip. Fans will have three ways to vote for their favorites. They can do it though Lay's Facebook page, by texting 'VOTE' to 24477 or through Twitter using the hashtags (hash)SaveChickenWaffles, (hash)SaveGarlicBread or (hash)SaveSriracha. The person who submitted the winning flavor will win $1 million, or one percent of the chip's 2013 sales, whichever is more. The runners-up will win $50,000. Although the new flavors are not supposed to hit stores until next Tuesday, some stores have started selling them. Fans have been posting images of the bags to social networks such as Instagram and Twitter. 'We started shipping them,' said Mukherjee. 'I think some of our retailers got excited and put it out on the floor earlier.' Lay's adds about one new potato chip flavor every year, said Mukherjee. Last year it launched the Lay's Classic BLT, made to taste like the sandwich. This is the first time in Lay's 75-year history that it has let U.S. consumers choose the company's next flavor. Lay's, which is a unit of PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay snack business, has held similar contests in other countries. Frito-Lay first tried such a contest in the United Kingdom for its Walkers brand in 2008. Fans came up with Walkers Chilli & Chocolate and Walkers Cajun Squirrel. Builder's Breakfast, which tasted like a full bacon, sausage and eggs breakfast, won. But the flavor has since been discontinued.

Student debt: Greg Dash, 25, said he has taken 290 pre-orders for his £65 cameras in just one month . Student and photography buff Greg Dash was inspired to create his own tiny fish-eye camera after finding his budget wouldn't stretch to a pricey new lens. Now the Welsh PhD student's university debts look set to become a distant memory - with orders for the 25-year-old's miniscule gadgets pouring in from as far afield as Taiwan. Mr Dash said he has sold 290 of his £65 cameras - which measure just over 4cm long and 2cm high - since he began taking pre-orders last month, all but wiping out seven years' worth of student debt in just four weeks. His Lofi Fish-Eye camera - which Mr Dash has billed as the world's first digital fish-eye lens - has become a hit thanks to its ability to produce expensive-looking photographs despite having just 12 megapixels, one button and no LCD screen. 'I've always been a fan of photography from a young age, but only ever used film cameras,' said Mr Dash. 'A friend bought me an SLR camera a few years ago, and I wanted to get a fish-eye lens for it. 'However, as they cost hundreds of pounds and me being a student I had virtually given up on the idea. 'But then I thought instead to make my own one using old camera parts.' The Aberystwyth University student, who hails from Mountain Ash in south Wales, was inspired by lomography - the growing analogue camera movement - in developing his own tiny creation, which has no viewfinder or screen to view photos. It can shoot high-quality images and HD video, and has a built-in lithium battery which can be charged via a USB port. Miniscule: The student's tiny camera measures just over 4cm long and 2cm high, but still produces expensive-looking photographs . 'One of the things I first loved about it is that it doesn't have an LCD screen to preview images - so you have that element of surprise when you come to look at the photos you have taken for the first time,' Mr Dash said. 'That's something I love about using film cameras, but being a hard-up student I couldn't always afford to develop rolls. 'So that's where the idea about making it digital came in.' When friends saw the results of his labour - and the photographs the camera produced - Mr Dash found himself bombarded with requests. He launched his camera via the fundraising website Indiegogo in February, limiting production to a run of 500. 'Element of surprise': A photograph of a chimpanzee taken with the Lofi Fish-eye camera . Mr Dash, who obtained undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in Swansea and Cardiff before deciding to study for a doctorate, added: 'Since taking pre-orders a month ago, 290 people have put their money down for the Lofi Fish-Eye.' That amounts to almost £19,000 worth of pre-orders in a little over a month. 'I've even taken one order of a batch of 50 from Taiwan - which is amazing considering the camera has only been promoted via word of mouth. 'I've also had a lot of interest from airplane enthusiasts and extreme sports fans, who are looking for a cost effective way of capturing their adventures. 'I'm hoping the camera will be just the start of things,' the fledgeling entrepreneur said. 'But for now, my main focus is getting more orders processed, begin manufacturing and ultimately it's then about getting the product out there.'","Greg Dash, 25, has sold 290 of his miniscule cameras in the first month .

"Workers including police, firefighters, health employees, teachers and prison officers could strike over bitter pension row . Unions describe potential walk-out as 'unprecedented' in scale and 'the biggest fight of our lives' Unison says they will be 'vilified' for striking but urges members to 'stay strong' By . Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 04:12 EST, 15 September 2011 . Strikes will cripple the country from November right through next year, union barons said yesterday. They said millions of state workers will join a ‘long, hard and dirty’ dispute – the worst since the General Strike of 1926. Vital services will be under threat from walk-outs by teachers, prison guards, firemen, nurses, gravediggers and paramedics. Unions will coordinate their action to cause maximum chaos in their fight against the Government’s changes to gold-plated public sector pensions. Speaking in London today, Unison boss Dave Prentis announced the ballots and raised the threat of a huge walk-out, which could bring the country to a standstill . George Osborne said yesterday that it . was irresponsible to plot industrial action while negotiations on a . settlement were still taking place. ‘Everyone who is sensible accepts . that public sector pensions have to be reformed,’ said the Chancellor. But union bosses insisted a one-day walkout would take place on November 30 – with others in the pipeline. ‘We are not talking about a day out . and a bit of a protest,’ said Brian Strutton, national secretary at the . GMB union. ‘We are talking about something that is long, hard and dirty . as well. ‘This is going to require days of action, running through the winter into next year and right into the summer.’ Vice of the workers: Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis (front right) votes with members during the third day of the annual Trade Union Congress . Standing ovation: The announcement of ballots was met with thunderous applause . A wave of strikes would cause chaos in a year which includes the London Olympics and the Queen’s diamond jubilee. In strikes in June, four unions were . involved – the Public and Commercial Services union, the National Union . of Teachers, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the . University and College Union. But now ten are plotting action, . including the Fire Brigades’ Union and Unison, which represents most . hospital staff apart from doctors. Even the Prison Officers’ Association, which is not legally allowed to strike, warned yesterday it is prepared to do so. Dozens of smaller unions are also expected to join yesterday’s call to arms by the Trades Union Congress. Dave Prentis, general secretary of . Unison, said: ‘The fight of our lives may be an overused cliché but make . no mistake. This is it.’ To wild applause on the final day of . the TUC’s annual conference, 15 union bosses took to the platform to . slam the Government’s ‘sabotage’ of their pensions. They are furious at the proposed . pension changes, and have been battling with ministers since February . during increasingly hostile negotiations. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of . the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: ‘There is no case . whatsoever to make any changes to public sector pension schemes.’ However, Lord Hutton, a Labour . ex-cabinet minister who was commissioned by the Government to propose . changes, has described the system as inherently unfair. ‘It is my clear . view that the figures … make it plain that the status quo is not . tenable,’ he said. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury . pensions adviser, said: ‘Taxpayers cannot be asked to carry the burden . for the sort of pensions that they will never enjoy themselves.’ Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office . minister who is leading the negotiations, said the unions’ announcement . yesterday was extremely disappointing. Flashback: The Government is facing the threat of the biggest walk out this winter since the General Strike in May 1926 . Winter of discontent: During the strikes in 1979 rubbish was piled high in the streets as workers walked out . The disruption threatens to be . widespread, from schools forced to close for lack of staff to hospitals . made to cancel operations. It also presents a nightmare for . working parents if schools shut down. There is nothing illegal about . unions joining together to coordinate strike action on one particular . day, or days, in a bid to cause maximum disruption. They are allowed to pursue this type . of industrial action as long as they have held a strike ballot with each . employer, and their members have voted ‘yes’. Daniel Barnett, a leading employment . barrister, said: ‘In the context of the current disputes over pension . provision, every public sector worker will have a dispute over pension . rights, so they can all go on strike.’ He said the Government’s only chance . of stopping the strike was to take out an injunction if there were . ‘technical deficiencies’ in the way the ballots were held.","Workers including police, firefighters, health employees, teachers and prison officers could strike over bitter pension row .

Spreading the word: The popular hook-up app Tinder has gained a huge following among young Mormons in recent months . Tinder, the hook-up app, has gained a huge following among college students since its launch last fall. Now it's finding a more unlikely audience: Mormons. According to The Universe, Brigham Young University's student newspaper, the free iPhone app is spreading through the college like wildfire. Some have labeled Tinder the 'female Grindr' because it works in a similar way as the gay dating app. So why is it so popular among an ultra-religious student body where more than 20per cent of the student body is married by graduation? Perhaps the app appeals to Mormons because it also has a clean-cut, polite image. The app works like virtual speed dating meets 'Hot or Not': It uses Facebook profiles to . pair users up with matches within their geographical area, rating them based on shared friends, interests, and networks. Instead . of ringing a bell at the end of a seven-minute date, a user can . 'like' or reject a picture  within seconds. They can only chat with people who have . liked them back. Otherwise, they can 'keep playing' and scroll through . more pictures. Because it's totally anonymous until both users opt in, the rejection factor is low. Tinder has appealed to women in particular more than Blendr (the actual female version of Grindr . that was developed by the same company), because it offers an added . layer of authentication via Facebook. This helps avoid the creep factor . of an inbox filled with random emails from shirtless men posing in front . of their bathroom mirrors, and filter out catfish. Unlikely new audience: Tinder is commonly described as a Grindr for women, and is typically used for casual dating. Now Mormon students at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, are using it too . But many dating apps targeting members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints seem seriously heavy: One requires users to complete an in-depth questionnaire to generate a compatibility score, daters to list their thresholds and dealbreakers and . offers a Myers-Briggs personality profile as an optional feature. Tinder, unlike a lot of other dating websites, is actually fun to use. It may seem strange for a casual hook-up app to become popular at a school known for its strict honor code: In 2011, starting forward . Brandon Davies was controversially suspended for the rest of his season . for having sex with his girlfriend, violating the provision . preventing premarital sex. But dating is a huge pastime at BYU. According to official LDS dating guildelines, young people 16 or older should 'go in groups or on double . dates' and 'avoid going on frequent dates with the same person' so that . they avoid getting too serious with someone until they are old enough . for a serious relationship.

"Crown Prosecution Service ignored warnings from British police to arrest Saunders . Brit then flew to Costa Rica before killing 22-year-old student . By . Neil Sears, Vanessa Allen and Sam Greenhill . UPDATED: . 18:40 EST, 6 January 2012 . A Briton accused of stabbing a student to death in Costa Rica is an NHS mental health patient who was allowed to fly abroad despite being deeply disturbed. Interpol considered Alfie Saunders, 20, so dangerous that when it learned he was planning to travel from Britain to Nicaragua, police across central America were warned. Six weeks later, days after Christmas, he is said to have murdered Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22, in a frenzied sexually-motivated attack. Just days after Christmas, Alfie Saunders, 20, is said to have murdered Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22, in a frenzied sexually motivated attack in Costa Rica . Saunders is believed to have come to Interpol’s attention after an incident when he was travelling in China a year ago. In Britain, despite the Interpol concerns that Saunders was ‘a dangerous individual’ linked to a string of sex offences, he was free to walk the streets as a ‘care in the community’ patient. And though British police wanted to prosecute him for possessing indecent images last October, the Crown Prosecution Service refused to take action. Last night an NHS internal inquiry was under way into how mental health professionals dealt with the son of wealthy academics Professor Max Saunders, of the King’s College English department, and Catia Galatariotou, a writer and psychoanalyst who has lectured on the development of child sexuality. The inquiry began as the Czech parents of Miss Drbohlavova, who was studying at university in Florida, spoke of their anger that official warning systems failed to save their daughter. Victim: Czech student Alexandra Drbohlavova was allegedly murdered by Saunders . Her father Dusan, a senior university academic, and her mother Sarka, a journalist, issued a statement saying: ‘The usual explanation, that she was “in the wrong place at the wrong time”, simply does not work. 'How could a dangerous individual be allowed to move freely round the world when his pathological tendencies were already known? The authorities must have failed. ‘The loss of a child is the most terrible event possible for parents. When a defenceless and completely innocent victim is brutally murdered in such an inhuman way, without any warning, such circumstances cannot be understood or absorbed.’ Their daughter had travelled to the British-owned Finca La Libertad organic farm near Costa Rica’s border with Nicaragua to work as an unpaid volunteer over her Christmas holidays. Ominous: These were among Saunders's few possessions . Days later Saunders arrived . unannounced, with barely any possessions beyond CDs of violent rap songs . by Eminem, a book about a serial killer, a fitness magazine and an . ‘SAS’ guide to unarmed combat. He was offered a tent next to Miss Drbohlavova and the following night she was heard screaming. Retired architect Peter Donati, whose son Nick owns the farm, is said to have caught Saunders emerging from the girl’s tent covered in blood. She had 15 stab wounds to her face, neck and chest. Saunders will face court on Monday. The Daily Mail has discovered that Saunders, who lived with his mother in a series of luxury homes in London’s exclusive St John’s Wood and Notting Hill worth up to £3.3million, had in Britain been under the care of NHS mental health experts. Alexandra Drbohlavova died following 15 stab wounds . He appears to have been treated both as an inpatient and an outpatient. According to a source, Saunders talked of killing cats by drowning, strangling and with a chainsaw, and expressed an interest in violent pornography. While on an NHS ward, said the source, Saunders smoked powerful ‘skunk’ cannabis, often linked to psychosis, while other patients smoked crack and drank brandy. Early last year Saunders flew to China and spent two months at the spartan Maling Shan Kung Fu Academy in countryside midway between Beijing and Shanghai. Fellow martial arts student Nina Melander, 20, from Sweden, said: ‘Alfie was obsessed with Eminem, and thought you could become a Kung Fu expert in a few weeks. ‘He bought a knife and used to throw it at trees and into the ground. I got the idea he was bullied in Britain.’ Costa Rican police said they were surprised that border officials aware of the Interpol warning let him in. A spokesman for the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which is investigating Saunders’s treatment, said: ‘This individual had no criminal  convictions, was not a detained patient and was not treated on a secure ward.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Crown Prosecution Service ignored warnings from British police to arrest Saunders .

Arrests: A man and a woman have been held after Cumbria's crime commissioner Richard Rhodes' expenses claims, which included limo journeys, were allegedly leaked . The Police and Crime Commissioner who reported his staff for exposing his expenses claim for a chauffeur-driven Mercedes apologised yesterday – but says he has no regrets about calling in the police. Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes reported the whistleblowers for telling a newspaper he had charged the taxpayer £700 for two chauffeur-driven trips. He admitted yesterday he should have checked the cost of the trips before charging them to the taxpayer, but refused to apologise to the three people who face possible prison sentences if they are convicted of leaking details of his expenses claim. He went on to say that he would use his new £23,000 Hyundai crossover – another taxpayer-funded perk – in the future. Cumbria police chief Bernard Lawson said his officers will send a file to the Crown Prosecution Service so it can consider charges against the staff members who blew the whistle. Two people have been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and another on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Those found guilty of these offences commonly draw prison sentences of a year or more. MPs from all parties have condemned the police investigation that followed after the local newspaper that received the leak, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, called Mr Rhodes’ office to check the details of his expenses. Labour MP for Barrow and Furness John Woodcock said the affair was ‘alarming’ and called for new laws to protect whistleblowers. Defence: Cumbria Police say that the commissioner is driven for his safety and the trips were stopped once he saw the cost . Theresa May last night urged caution over plans for secret arrests. The Home Secretary said the Association of Chief Police Officers should be ‘very careful’ about removing the right for people to know who they detain. Under guidance being drawn up by ACPO on behalf of the judiciary, forces would be banned from revealing the names of those held on suspicion of crimes, to protect their reputation. Even families and friends would be kept in ignorance and unable to help. Mrs May told MPs: ‘These are not just black and white arguments. ‘You have to look at them very carefully in terms of the impact that they have.’ Critics say it is an assault on open justice and threatens to turn  Britain into a ‘banana republic’. ‘It is time to change the law to give explicit protection to people who . shine a spotlight on the inappropriate use of public money,’ he said. ‘Employees in wasteful organisations should be applauded, not punished, . for taking a stand.’ The scandal broke after Mr Rhodes spent £700 going to two dinners in a . hired Mercedes with a driver. The trips were from his home in the south . of the Lake District rather than from his office in Penrith, and cost . the taxpayer £385 and £313. Mr Rhodes made a partial apology at a press conference yesterday. He . said: ‘I have made two mistakes. Firstly, not checking the cost of the . car. Others had made the arrangements. Once I knew the costs, I . immediately asked the office to stop the arrangements. ‘Secondly, I apologise that my expenses were not published earlier.

The teenager, Paris Brown, stepped down after she was found to have posted a string of racist and obscene rants on Twitter which ended up being investigated by her own force. Resigned: Teenager Paris Brown . Mrs Barnes has also been criticized for spending large sums on staff and equipment, including £15,000 on a battle bus she has called Ann Force One. Other PCCs who have faced controversy include former Labour minister Vera Baird QC, who is in charge of Northumbrian police. She was criticised after saying she would not prioritise tackling low-level drug use because it would take up too much of her officers’ time. In her new policing plan she has completely ignored drug use. Elected PCCs were brought in by the Coalition to introduce democracy to policing. But the campaigns to choose the first of the new commissioners failed to generate interest among members of the public, and turnouts for elections last November were as low as 10 per cent in some areas. Critics say the system has introduced an expensive and pointless layer of bureaucracy to policing. PCCs, who earn £65,000 to £100,000 depending on the size of their force, must disclose their expenses every three months, but more than half the 45 in England and Wales have failed to.

Iain Duncan Smith is threatening a new Coalition row by demanding the immediate introduction of a tax break for married couples. The Work and Pensions Secretary wants George Osborne to make the change in next year’s Budget to show the Government is serious about promoting marriage. He is said to have warned David Cameron the public will dismiss the idea – a key Tory manifesto pledge – as tokenism if its introduction is delayed any longer. Couple: Iain Duncan Smith pictured earlier this week at the Tory conference in Birmingham with his wife Betsy . There are also fears that the pledge, which the Prime Minister has said will be honoured by 2015, could fall by the wayside altogether unless it is implemented soon. But he faces opposition from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who has accused the Tories of trying to ‘preserve in aspic a 1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother’. Mr Cameron championed the idea of a marriage tax break when in opposition, although the proposal was watered down to the point where it would be worth only about £150 a year to most. He said encouraging marriage would help more couples stay together and produce greater stability for children. The move is bitterly opposed by the Lib Dems, who argue it is wrong to favour marriage over cohabitation. The Coalition agreement allows them to abstain on any vote on the issue, and gives priority to their tax plan of raising the income tax threshold to £10,000. Mr Duncan Smith received heavyweight support yesterday from the Bishop of Chester. Peter Forster said recognition of marriage in the tax system would send a ‘powerful symbolic message from government into society – and say something important about the wider importance of marriage to society’. Asking the leader: Iain Duncan Smith is said to have warned David Cameron the public will dismiss the idea - a key Tory manifesto pledge - as tokenism if its introduction is delayed any longer . ‘Good marriages are not just a benefit for the couple themselves, and their children, but serve to strengthen the wider society of which they are a part,’ he said. ‘A strong respect for marriage  will actually support single parents, and others who have the care  of children.’ 'Good marriages are not just a benefit for the couple themselves, and their children, but serve to strengthen the wider society of which they are a part' Bishop of Chester, Peter Forster . Speaking in a House of Lords debate on child development, the bishop urged ministers to act without delay, adding: ‘Given the associated IT changes which would be required, if it isn’t introduced in the next Budget, I fear it will be left as an unfulfilled pledge when we get to the next election.’ Former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern also urged the Chancellor to act swiftly in the interests of children. ‘There is plenty of evidence that the institution of marriage is the best possible environment for bringing up children,’ he told peers. ‘But time is running out. It is highly important that the Government should fulfil the commitment.’ Ministers have not specified exactly how the pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system by 2015 will be implemented.","Work and Pensions Secretary wants tax break for married couples now .

"By . Gerri Peev . UPDATED: . 18:13 EST, 18 July 2011 . Britain should freeze immigration to stop foreign workers taking jobs from Britons, according to one of Ed Miliband’s key policy gurus. Lord Glasman, who was appointed to the House of Lords by the Labour leader, said the country was not a United Nations ‘outpost’. The peer also called for the UK to renegotiate rules allowing the free movement of migrant workers within the EU – a proposal that Mr Miliband insisted his close friend had not discussed with him. Voice of reason: Glasman is leading calls for British workers to be given priority over migrant workers . Lord Glasman told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We’ve got to re-interrogate our relationship with the EU on the movement of labour. ‘Britain is not an outpost of the UN. We have to put the people in this country first. The EU has gone from . being a sort of pig farm-subsidised bloc to the free movement of labour . and capital.’ Lord Glasman, a politics lecturer and . social thinker, said it may be necessary to stop immigration for a . while to put British workers at the front of the queue for new jobs. Such a move would also make it easier . for the genuinely deserving to be let into the country if they had . in-demand skills, he suggested. Influx: EU passport holders wait to enter the UK . Lord Glasman said: ‘We should be more . generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be . more generous, we have to draw the line.’ As founder of ‘Blue Labour’, which . mixes the principles of faith, flag and family with socialism, he has . admitted his views can be ‘more conservative than the Conservatives’ and . has accused Labour of lying over immigration. Taking a stand: Cameron (centre) has pledged to tackle immigration . Yesterday, Mr Miliband tried to play . down the significance of his comments, adding: ‘I’ve said in the past . we’ve underestimated the impact of Polish migration to Britain. It’s . quite hard to negotiate the terms of free movement of labour.’ He said the right solution was to . ‘have a firm immigration policy, also to provide people with the . guarantees that they need in relation to wages and conditions which is . one of the biggest worries that people have about some of the migration . that we’ve seen’. But he was urged to heed Lord . Glasman’s advice by Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch . campaign group, who said: ‘It’s quite clear that Ed Miliband still . doesn’t get it if he’s talking about Polish migration when 80 per cent . of net migration under Labour was from outside the EU. The public are going to get very tired of continuing Labour evasion on a matter of deep and widespread concern.’ However, Sir Andrew admitted: . ‘Although Lord Glasman understands the depth of public feeling on . immigration, renegotiating the free movement of people is over the top. It is simply not practicable.’ Ministers want to cut immigration to . tens of thousands a year.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:52 EST, 10 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:53 EST, 10 September 2012 . Shake-up: Michael Gove plans to replace GCSEs with a more rigorous, O-level style of exam . Michael Gove will this week press ahead with reforms designed to fix the ‘broken’ exam system as he vows to replace GCSEs with a more rigorous, O-level style of exam. The Education Secretary is expected to unveil plans to introduce a new qualification before the next election in 2015, arguing that GCSEs ‘haven’t worked’. There has been a bitter row within the coalition over Mr Gove’s proposals, with Liberal Democrats vowing to oppose any return to a ‘two-tier’ system that would see less gifted children sitting different exams. The Education Secretary has conceded that the ‘overwhelming majority’ of students should sit the new qualifications - but insists they must properly recognise the best students. In a little-noticed move, the new Conservative education minister Elizabeth Truss has been handed responsibility for exam reform following last week’s Government reshuffle, rather than Mr Gove’s new Liberal Democrat number two, David Laws. The proposals will be put out for consultation before the new examination is introduced in 2014. ‘I think one of the things that’s important to stress is that the O-level is an examination which in the past used to be sat by a minority, which is why when people have discussed its potential return they’ve automatically assumed it would be a minority exam,’ Mr Gove said. ‘But in fact, in other jurisdictions, in countries like Singapore, there are examinations which are set which are very reminiscent of the old O-level, but a majority... 80 per cent of students can pass them. ‘I think what we need to do is to have an examination that has all the rigour of the old O-level but which is sat by a majority of students, so that we can ensure that everyone is treated fairly. ‘It’s the aim is that it should be sat by the overwhelming majority. It’s not the case at the moment that every child sits a GCSE. But we want to make sure that this is an examination that can be sat by all children and cover the full range of abilities.’ The Education Secretary has conceded that the 'overwhelming majority' of students should sit the new qualifications - but insists they must properly recognise the best students . The Education Secretary says the Government will consult experts, teachers and parents on what the new examination, and its grades, should be called. ‘The aim is to ensure that we have an examination that recognises the genuinely academically gifted by making sure that top grade, an A or whatever it might be called, is clearly a sign of someone who is a high flier, but at the same time, this examination, we hope, will ensure that all children - we hope the majority will take it at 16, some may take it at the age of 17 or 18 - that all children can have their fluency in English, mathematics and other subjects like history and physics recognised. ‘I think it’s important that there’s an appropriate discrimination between the top grades and then a lower pass grade, but the precise details of how that should be done is something that we need to agree collectively.’ The latest figures show that hundreds of state schools are already turning away from the traditional GCSE and offering pupils a tougher international exam based on O-levels. The number teaching the international GCSE (IGCSE) has soared by 300 per cent since Mr Gove allowed them to start doing so. Two-thirds of public schools already enter students for the ICGSE, regarded as more challenging and similar to O-levels. Unlike GCSEs, the exams are also favoured because they do not focus on coursework. Labour banned state schools from adopting IGCSEs in key subjects amid fears they would undermine the domestic version, with schools which sought to get around the ban facing official warnings. But in June 2010, Mr Gove reversed the ban, insisting schools which believed the international exams would better stretch pupils should be allowed to offer them.","Liberal Democrats have vowed to oppose any .

President Obama's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage today sent shockwaves through the political world - and a boatload of cash into his campaign war chest. After Obama's shock announcement last night, his re-election crusade saw a massive spike in donations as gay donors lined up to pour money into his campaign. BuzzFeed reported that Obama's campaign collected an astonishing $1million within 90 minutes after the ABC News interview aired. But while gay rights advocates applauded Obama's announcement on Wednesday, Republicans . accused the commander-in-chief of pulling off a cynical political . manoeuvre. Scroll down for video of the interview . Change of heart: President Barack Obama said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples, but he no longer believes that . Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus accused Obama of placating to voters. Priebus said in a statement: 'While President Obama has played politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have been clear. 'We support maintaining marriage between one man and one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that.' Obama's announcement yesterday opened up the first major battleground in this year's election campaign. Romney himself did not swipe at Obama directly, but affirmed his own views on same-sex unions during an Oklahoma campaign stop, saying: 'I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.' Historic: Obama is the first sitting U.S. President to publicly support gay marriage. President George W Bush opposed it and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act into law . Obama was also rebuked by Log Cabin Republicans, who also accused the president of playing politics and questioned the timing of his remarks. Log Cabin Republicans Executive Director R. Clarke Cooper said in a statement: 'That the president has chosen today, when LGBT Americans are mourning the passage of Amendment 1, to finally speak up for marriage equality is offensive and callous. 'Log Cabin Republicans appreciate that President Obama has finally come in line with leaders like Vice President Dick Cheney on this issue, but LGBT Americans are right to be angry that this calculated announcement comes too late to be of any use to the people of North Carolina, or any of the other states that have addressed this issue on his watch. 'This administration has manipulated LGBT families for political gain as much as anybody, and after his campaign’s ridiculous contortions to deny support for marriage equality this week he does not deserve praise for an announcement that comes a day late and a dollar short.' 1996, running for Illinois State Senate: 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.' 2004, running for U.S. Senate in Illinois: 'My religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a civil right.' 2008, running for U.S. President: 'I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman. As a Christian it's also a sacred union.' 2010, after Republican wave election: 'My feelings with this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.' 2012, running for reelection: 'I think same sex couples should be able to get married.' Others, like House Speaker John Boehner, said there are more pressing issues at hand. Boehner told the Fox Business Network: 'I have always believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. But Republicans here on Capitol Hill are focused in on the economy.' The president appears to be banking . on the gay marriage issue, which is heavily supported by younger Americans, to . mobilize the youth vote, which has become disaffected during his term in . office. Obama had long been suspected of . holding this view, but was thought to be afraid to make it public . because of the political backlash. The . revelation comes the day after voters in the key battleground state of . North Carolina approved a strict new ban on same-sex marriage. The measure, which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples, passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote. 'At a certain point I’ve just . concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and . affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,' the . president said. Obama claims the change is a personal . one only, and that he he still believes the issue of gay marriage . should be left up to the states. Currently, six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it. Obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage. 'You know, Malia and Sasha, they have . friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where . Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re . talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it . wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be . treated differently,' he said. 'It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.' Obama had been under intense pressure . to clarify his view toward gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden publicly announced he supported it on Sunday. Family affair: Obama said talking to his daughters, Sasha and Malia, about their friends who have gay parents made him believe gays should be allowed to get married . The White House sought out the interview with Robins Roberts, the 'Good Morning America' host, to explain himself. Parts of the interview will aired . tonight on 'World News Tonight' and will also appear on Thursday . morning's 'Good Morning America.' Roberts, herself, has never married. Obama . seems to be making an election-year political gamble by directly . challenging Romney, his likely Republican opponent in November. 'When these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,' he told KDVR-TV in Denver. 'My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but the others are not.' It could be that Obama is hoping to use the issue to energize young voters, who support gay marriage by way margins. The president, himself, acknowledged the issue is a generational one. 'You know when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or, you know,  believe in equality. They are much more comfortable with it,' he said in the interview. Last week, Romney's spokesman for foreign policy, Richard Grenel, quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay. Recent . polls show 50 per cent of Americans support gay marriage, but also . reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions. This . could explain plain why North Carolina's Amendment 1, which changes the . state constitution to prohibit gay marriage and partnership benefits to . gay couples, won by such a wide margin among voters. Biden's remarks on Sunday set the stage for Obama's announcement. 'I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual - men and women marrying - are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don’t see much of a distinction beyond that,' Biden said on Meet the Press. The president signaled that he was open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his feelings on the issues were 'evolving.' 'I struggle with this,' he famously said. Since 2004, Obama has opposed gay marriage, saying his beliefs were based on his Christian faith. As a presidential candidate he supported civil unions. However, this isn't the first time Obama has changed in mind on the issue. In . 1996, as an Illinois State Senate candidate, he told a gay newspaper in . Chicago that he was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and 'would . fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.'

Chevonea spoke to him three times on the phone in the hour before she fell 60ft to her death. Months before the tragedy, her mother Amanda Kendall wrote to her daughter's school to ask if anything was being  done to tackle a group of boys who were bullying her daughter. She wrote: 'Will  it take a tragedy to happen  before the school actively stops…[this] bullying?'. Yesterday, coroner Bernard Richmond QC, who recorded a narrative verdict at Westminster Coroners' Court, criticised the girl's secondary school for failing to deal with complaints of bullying. Addressing the circumstances of Chevonea's death, he said: 'From her texts, it is clear she believed him (the boy) to have a video which she begged him delete. 'She was highly distressed. I am satisfied that Chevonea felt so desperate and hopeless that, at about 8pm, she decided to do something dramatic to try to force E6 into doing what she wanted. 'Chevonea climbed out on the window ledge and attempted to demonstrate to him she would jump if he did not do as she asked.' But he added that he did not believe the youngster meant to die, saying 'on the balance of probabilities, she lost her balance and fell'. He added: 'If she jumped, I do not accept that she formed any settled intention to kill herself.' The coroner criticised Saint Cecilia's School and Wandsworth Council's children's services team for 'a catalogue of failings'. The pupil had told teachers she had been sexually assaulted twice by different boys in February 2011, a month before her death. The court was told she claimed 18-year-old Benn Miebaka had forced her to perform a sex act on him following a half-term party. She said a second boy – E6 – then threatened to smash Chevonea's windows if she did not repeat the act on him the following day. The fall: A coroner today ruled that Chevonea's 60ft fall from her bedroom window on the top floor of this block of flats in Battersea was a 'ghastly' accident and not intentional . Chevonea did not realise that this . second episode was being filmed. She discovered a sex tape had been made . and was being passed around the school only four hours before her . death, the court heard. Mr Richmond accepted Chevonea did have sexual encounters with both men. He said: 'Whether she was intimidated . to comply, or out of her depth and unable to process what to do to . extricate herself from the situation, is less than clear.' Tragic: The girl's mother Amanda Kendall, left, has spoken of her heartbreak at the death of Chevonea, right . Both boys – neither of whom went to . her school – testified at the inquest but denied engaging in sexual . activity with the teenager. The coroner said parts of their testimonies were evasive but he did not believe E6 intended Chevonea to die that day. The inquest heard the teenager  had . been targeted by bullies since she was 11. Mr Richmond said there had . been 'clear failings' at the school and by social services to give her . the support she needed. He added: 'Chevonea's was a case which . slipped through the net and exposed a hole in otherwise good practices . at the school and social services.' Chevonea died from multiple injuries . after suffering a fractured skull in the fall. Her mother was in court . to hear the verdict but declined to comment. Nicky Pace, of the Wandsworth . Safeguarding Children's Board, said an investigation had found that the . support given 'could have been improved and communication between the . agencies could have been better'. Head teacher of Saint Cecilia's, Niall Gallagher, said that they  had learned 'a number of valuable lessons'.

"By . Daniel Miller . UPDATED: . 06:45 EST, 17 February 2012 . Nerves of steel: Nik Wallenda will be the first to tightrope walk over the falls for a century . It may not have been the most appropriate choice of phrase. But when Nik Wallenda was told he was to be allowed to attempt a tightrope walk across Niagara Falls, he said: ‘I’m thrilled to death.’ If the 33-year-old daredevil survives his 1,800ft-long walk on a two-inch thick rope over the famous site, he will become the first to ever achieve the feat. After months of campaigning, Mr Wallenda was yesterday given permission by Canadian officials to attempt the death-defying stunt this summer. He had already secured support from the American side of the falls last year. Mr Wallenda, who comes from a long line of circus performers, will walk across the most powerful waterfall in the world on a wire rope without a safety net. The stunt will take up to 40 minutes through mist and spray, 220ft above the bottom of the gorge. It is the first time anyone has attempted to walk on a tightrope over the actual waterfall – in 1859 the acrobat Charles Blondin crossed the gorge on a tightrope, but his stunt was downstream from the actual waterfall. Stunts over the iconic attraction, which forms the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York, have been prohibited for more than 100 years. After giving Mr Wallenda permission to perform his stunt, the Niagara Parks Commission insisted it could be attempted only once every 20 years. Last night Mr Wallenda, from Florida, said: ‘It’s been a dream of mine since I was six years old. I haven’t had a chance for it to settle in yet. I’m thrilled to death. 'This was a dream many told me was impossible. I’m blessed, that’s all I can say.’ Don't look down: This will be the first time anyone has tried to walk over the falls themselves rather than downstream in the gorge . Mr Wallenda, who lives with his wife Erendira and their three children, has been tightrope-walking since he was two. In 2008 he walked and then cycled across a high-wire suspended from skyscrapers in Newark, New Jersey. The feat won him a place in the Guinness Book Of Records for the longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire. He currently holds six Guinness World Records. His great-grandfather Karl founded the Flying Wallendas, the family’s daredevil circus act. However, he fell to his death aged 73 from a tightrope in high winds in Puerto Rico in 1978. His great-grandson said: ‘My family has always been taught to never give up. We’ve gone through it all, triumph and tragedy. So at no point did I think I would throw in the towel.’ Delight: Daredevil Nik Wallenda has finally been granted permission to attempt to tightrope walk across the Niagara Falls . Mr Wallenda will wear suede shoes designed to grip the wire in the wet and will train on a full-scale high-wire rig on an airport runway in Pittsburgh, with simulated mist. ‘I’ll be walking through the mist thrown off by the falls,’ he added. ‘I’ve done walks further and higher. This will be the most iconic.’ Last September New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill giving him one year to perform the feat. Feat: Maria Spelterini walks across a suspension bridge on a tightrope . Very high wire: Wallenda tightropes 12 stories above a street in Newark with no safety net in 2008 before riding a bicycle on the way back . Yesterday Janice Thomson, chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission, said: ‘This decision was approved in part in recognition of the role that stunting has played in the history and promotion of Niagara Falls. ‘We have made it clear that this is a very unique one-time situation. It’s not an everyday activity and will not be allowed to become an everyday activity.’ The area around the falls has suffered from a decline in industry and struggles to attract visitors despite its world famous centrepiece featuring in films such as Superman II and 1953’s Niagara, starring Marilyn Monroe. French acrobat and tightrope walker Charles Blondin was the first ever person to cross a section of Niagara Falls on a 1000 foot long tightrope in 1859 .","Nik Wallenda faces a 1,800ft-long walk on a two-inch thick rope .

Aslan Usoyan, one of Russia's most notorious criminal bosses, has been shot dead in a street in Moscow . One of Russia's most notorious crime bosses has been shot dead by a sniper in broad daylight in central Moscow. Aslan Usoyan, 75, who has survived time in Soviet jails and previous assassination attempts, is thought to have been murdered in a war between two mobs. He was shot in the head yesterday outside a restaurant on a snowy street about half a mile from the Kremlin in the middle of the afternoon. Georgian-born Usoyan, also known as . 'Grandpa Hasan', is said to have been the head of one of the region's . most powerful criminal gangs . The federal Investigative Committee said an unidentified gunman hit Usoyan with a single bullet and he died shortly afterwards in hospital. It said a woman at the scene also suffered two gunshot wounds. A committee statement said six 9mm bullet casings were found on a stairwell in a building across the street from where Usoyan was hit. Authorities, it said, were conducting ballistics tests and considering potential motives 'connected to the criminal activity of the victim and possible conflicts with other representatives of the same milieu.' After the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, there were almost daily killings across Russia as criminal gangs battled to gain control of lucrative businesses and carve up territory. According to Russian media reports, Usoyan headed a crime network in the years after the Soviet collapse. Since 2006, he had been at war with another criminal group, according to organised crime experts. Russian media said the battle between the two clans had intensified in recent years. Usoyan survived a contract hit in September 2010 when a gunman shot him in the stomach as he got out of his car near his apartment on Moscow's main street. Media reports at the time linked that shooting to a conflict between crime groups. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

An executive at the world’s second-biggest consumer goods company told a conference that food is 'too cheap' and far too much is being wasted as a result. Jan Kees Vis, the global director for sustainable sourcing development at Unilever said that half of the food that is purchased in the city of London is never eaten. He added that consumers and catering firms do not put enough value on the food that they buy, even though the cost of meals and snacks in supermarkets, takeaways and restaurants, The Daily Telegraph reported. Waste: An executive at Unilever says food is 'too cheap' and is being wasted, driving up production needs as the global population grows . 'Places that offer food for lunch – chilled, day-fresh [food] - have made incredible growth, but the result is a lot of food is wasted,' he said. 'A big factor in why we waste so much food is that food has become too cheap. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t waste so much of it,' said Mr Vis. WRAP, the food waste group, said Britons throw away 7.2 million tonnes of household waste each year, around £680 of food per family. The group adds that around 4.4 million tonnes of this is edible food. Mr Vis, speaking to the CropWorld Global 2012 conference in London, said that food waste usually takes place in restaurants or people’s homes. As prices rise, driven by a growing global population, Mr Vis said that if people could bring down levels of waste the increase in production required would slow down. Recent research by Unilever, which makes brands including Flora margarine, Marmite and Hellman’s mayonnaise, found that people throw away food primarily because it goes off too quickly, leftovers are not eaten, and too much food is prepared in the first place. British families throw away 7.2 million tonnes of household waste each year - roughly £680 of food per family . Andy Dawe, WRAP’s head of food and drink, told the newspaper: 'Food waste is a serious issue, increasingly so. Although the percentage of consumer income spent on food has fallen for decades, more recently there has been significant food inflation. 'UK households currently throw away 4.4 million tonnes of food which could have been eaten, costing around £680 a year for the average family with children. 'This is money that could be saved if we made the most of the food we buy.' The good news is Britons are actually throwing away less than they were. Between 2007 and 2010, households reduced their food waste by 1.1 million tonnes. Earlier this year fast food restaurants, pubs, hotels and catering firms, such as Greggs and McDonalds, agreed new voluntary targets to cut food waste over the next three years.","Sustainability chief at Unilever says low prices encourage waste .

Rick Stein, the celebrity chef with a business empire worth more than £30million, has insisted British customers should pay more for the food they eat. The restaurateur and television presenter called for the cost of food to increase and urged people to 'eat less, moan less and value what we eat more'. And the 65-year-old dismissed any potential backlash to his remarks, claiming that he was entitled to make them even though he was wealthy. Food for thought: Television chef Rick Stein, pictured while filming in Spain, says Britons should stop moaning and pay more for what they eat . He made the comments during a radio discussion about whether the cost of food could ever be too low, in the wake of a protest by dairy farmers over cuts to milk prices. Mr Stein told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme: 'Of course people are going to turn on the likes of me, (other celebrity chefs) Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, saying we have got plenty of money and we should not be saying that food should cost more. 'But frankly I think it should cost more. I don’t feel it is a valid argument to say just because I can afford to pay more I should not be saying it.' The chef said cheap food came at a cost, warning that the lower prices were the more likely it was that animals would be treated cruelly. Protests: Farmers blockade the Arla milk processing plant in Ashby De La Zouch, Leicestershire, demanding an increase in the price of milk they receive from dairies and supermarkets . He said: 'Simply we should prepare (to pay more) because I don’t think people really understand the implications of something like milk costing more than less.' Mr Stein added: 'I am afraid we are all complicit in it. It is no good turning around and blaming the supermarkets, we are all to blame. 'We all don’t really value our food enough. I think we should generally eat less, moan less and actually value what we eat more.' He went on: 'I don't think people stop to realise what it means to get cheap pork, cheap chicken and cheap milk.' Mr Stein's empire of restaurants, shops and hotels is worth a reported £32million and employs about 450 people.","Restaurateur, 65, claims cheap food comes at the cost of animal husbandry .

Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder, assault and a string of other offenses in the massacre of Afghan villagers as they slept, a U.S. official said today. The charges were revealed as it emerged today that the soldier was accused of forcing a woman to grab his crotch, and beating up her boyfriend, in a second drunken assault in 2008. The charges against Bales include 17 counts of murder, six counts of attempted murder, and six counts of aggravated assault, as well as dereliction of duty and other violations of military law, the official said on condition of anonymity because the charges had not been announced. Accused: Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder, assault and a string of other offenses in the massacre of Afghan villagers . The 38-year-old soldier and . father-of-two, who lives in Lake Tapps, Washington, will be charged with . going on a shooting rampage in two villages near his Southern . Afghanistan military post in the early hours of March 11, gunning down . nine Afghan children and eight adults, and burning some of the victims' bodies. The charges are to be read to Bales on Friday. He is being held in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and faces trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The killings were yet another blow to U.S-Afghan relations, following a series of missteps, including the accidental burning of Qurans, which prompted violent protests and revenge killings American troops in the war zone. The brutal shooting rampage also prompted renewed debate in the United States about health care for the troops, who have experienced record suicide rates and high rates of post-traumatic stress and brain injuries during repeated deployments over a decade of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'Killer': Sgt Robert Bales (right) was pictured showing off cash but in reality he was more than $1million in debt . Bales was on his fourth tour of duty, having served three tours in Iraq, where he suffered a head injury and a foot injury. His civilian attorney, John Henry Browne, has portrayed his client as a patriot, loving father and devoted husband who had been traumatized by a comrade's injury and sent into combat one too many times. But details of a second incident . involving alcohol and violence surfaced today in the background of . the Army staff sergeant. A . Pierce County Sheriff's Department incident report obtained by The . Associated Press quoted a woman claiming that an 'extremely intoxicated' Bales told her she was beautiful, then 'pulled her hand to his . crotch' outside a Tacoma, Washington, bowling alley in 2008. Myra . Jo Irish told the responding officer that when her boyfriend demanded . an apology, Bales began punching and kicking him. When the boyfriend . raised one leg to stop the kicking, Bales grabbed the leg and pushed him . to the pavement. The report indicates that Irish, her boyfriend and Bales were drunk, to the point of mumbling and slurring their speech. Tears of grief: An Afghan youth mourns for his relatives, who were allegedly killed by the U.S. service member . Horrific: The bodies of an elderly Afghan man and a child killed in the Alkozai village of Panjwayi district are shown wrapped in blankets . Disbelief: Two grief-stricken Afghan men . look into the van where the body of a badly burned child is wrapped in a . blue blanket following the shooting last weekend . Details of the incident follow a report this week that Bales had been arrested in 2002 for a drunken assault of a security guard at a Tacoma casino. U.S. military officials say Bales was drinking on a southern Afghanistan base before he crept away to two villages overnight March 11 and shooting his 17 victims - eleven of which belonged to one family. The charge stemming from the casino incident was dismissed after Bales completed 20 hours of anger management training. Records show that Bales was not charged in the 2008 incident at the Paradise Bowl. Irish today denied that she and her boyfriend were intoxicated at the time of the brawl. 'I was just basically in shock that some stranger would walk up and do that,' she said. Irish added that Bales was with a group that pleaded with her not to file charges. They told her Bales was drunk and if she 'could be so kind' not to file an official report. 'His friend said he was married and in the service, and it would destroy him,' if she filed charges, Irish said. Empty: The couple's Bonney Lake, Washington home was put on the market for $229,000 this Monday, more than $50,000 less than what they paid for it in 2005. Bales' wife and two children have been moved to Joint Base Lewis McChord in Tacoma . Disarray: Boxes on the porch of Bales's home after his family was moved to a military base for their protection . Also in 2008, Bales . was involved in a hit-and-run accident in which records show he ran . bleeding in military clothes into the woods. He told police he fell . asleep at the wheel and paid a fine to get the charges dismissed, . according to court records. In 1998, Bales was cited for possessing alcohol at a Florida beach, though the citation was later dropped. It also emerged today that the U.S. military attempted to erase all references to the staff sergeant from the internet after his arrest – but failed. The army waited six days before identifying Bales, while it tried to delete all mentions of his combat service – including photographs and a battle account - from the web, according to McClatchy Newspapers. ‘Protecting a military family has to be a priority,’ a Pentagon official told McClatchy. ‘I think the feeding frenzy we saw after his name was released was evidence that we were right to try.’ Bales joined the Army in 2001 after a Florida investment business failed and after he had worked with a string of securities operations. Bales and a broker at one company were hit in 2003 with a $1.5 million arbitration ruling after an elderly couple charged that their holdings were decimated.","Accused of killing 17 civilians, including nine children, in an Afghan village .

Internet shoppers could be unfairly charged higher prices because of the sites they visit and even the gadgets they own, it has been claimed. So-called ‘personalised pricing’  is now under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and their counterparts in the US amid fears it could become widespread. The system could be misused, allowing retailer to target shoppers using an iPad or other expensive gadget and give them higher prices. Fears are growing that retailers could use browsing history and even the gadget used to adjust pricing . Consumers visit a site and search for a particular product. Their interest is recorded in a 'cookie', a small file on their computer, and may be shared with other sites. As . more online research is done, data is collected on offers or . alternative products looked at, along with what device the user is . shopping from. The data is then used to calculate a 'personalised price' for each user. Amazon is among those to have tried personalised pricing, although it dropped the idea after complaints, and CEO Jeff Bezos admitted the experiment was 'a mistake'. The fears have prompted the OFT to launch an investigation, and it is already working with the US FTC. 'Some businesses monitor consumer behaviour online, collecting and recording information about individual shoppers' purchasing habits, websites they have visited and the items and services they have looked at, as well as the type of device or internet browser they use,' the OFT said. Clive Maxwell, OFT Chief Executive, said: 'Innovation online is an important driver of economic growth. 'Our call for information forms part of our ongoing commitment to build trust in online shopping so that consumers can be confident that businesses are treating them fairly. 'We know that businesses use information about individual consumers for marketing purposes. 'This has some important potential benefits to consumers and firms. 'But the ways in which data is collected and used is evolving rapidly, and it is important we understand what control shoppers have over their profile and whether firms are using shoppers' profiles to charge different prices for goods or services.' The OFT has called for consumers who believe they may have been a victim of the problem to get in touch . A cookie is a text file that typically holds a website name and a user ID. When you first visit a site the cookie is downloaded to your PC. It can note information such as how many times you have visited . Knowing how many times you have visited, the website can then tailor the . information it displays to you on the website. You can clear cookies from your computer, usually from a menu option. The OFT has also said it may call for changes in law if the practise is found to be widespread. 'We will also consider enforcement action against firms that we may identify as breaching consumer protection law and we can also make recommendations, such as changes to data law.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, welcomed the inquiry. 'Companies are not just seeking to profit from targetted advertising when they collect data about us. 'One clear issue is when that data is used to change the prices of products we see and the OFT is absolutely right to be investigating this area. 'It's yet another incentive for companies to track us online and for more unscruplous business a way to profit from privacy infringements. 'It highlights why privacy isn't just an important issue for individuals, but an essential part of markets. 'Privacy is an essential part of competition and as companies seek to gain an unfair advantage by exploiting the data they hold or collecting more data without permission, they should be taken to task under both data protection and competition law.'

Google today admitted that it had received - and complied with - a record number of requests from governments to reveal information about its users. The latest edition of the search giant's Transparency Report shows governments around the world made nearly 21,000 requests to access its data in the first six months of 2012. The U.S. government made the most demands, asking for users' details 7,969 times between January and June this year. The UK came sixth - behind Germany and France - with 1,425 requests. What does Google know about you? The latest Transparency Report from the search giant showed it had received more requests than ever before to share information about its users with governments . 'This is the sixth time we’ve . released this data, and one trend has become clear: Government . surveillance is on the rise,' Dorothy Chou, a senior policy analyst for . Google, said in a blog post. 'In . the first half of 2012, there were 20,938 inquiries from government . entities around the world. Those requests were for information about . 34,614 accounts.' In . common with other technology and communications firms, Google is . regularly asked by courts and government agencies around the world to . hand over information about its users. As . well as search histories, it holds data on users' contacts and . communications through Gmail, viewing preferences on YouTube, photos on . Picasa, documents stored on Google Drive, and information about authors' identities on Blogger. 'Government surveillance is on the rise': This graph shows how the number of requests Google has received from governments has steadily increased since it began releasing its bi-annual reports . The . company has published its Transparency Report twice a year since 2009 . and each time has revealed a steady rise in government demands for data. In its first report it revealed 12,539 requests. Google does not always comply with . demands to reveal user data, and its report also revealed what . percentage of requests were accepted. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. again topped this list, with Google complying with 90 per cent of requests from agencies in its home jurisdiction. The company was notably less cooperative with UK authorities, accepting 64 per cent of requests. Google also revealed a spike in the number of requests by governments to remove content from its services, after this figure remained largely flat from 2009 to 2011. In the first half of 2012, there were 1,791 requests from government officials around the world to remove 17,746 pieces of content from Google-run services, up from 1,048 requests in the second half of 2011. Google revealed the number of requests by UK authorities in particular had nearly doubled since its previous report, with many relating to criticism of the police. The most frequent reason authorities worldwide offered in requests to take down content was that it was defamatory, with privacy and security coming in second, and the catch-all 'other' coming in third. Censorship: This graph shows how the number of requests to take down content from its services has spiked in the past six months after staying largely flat for the past two years .

'And . in Brazil we get a lot of requests to remove content during elections . because there is a law banning parodies of candidates.' This pair of bar graphs breaks down the requests to remove content by source and by reason. Defamation was the most popular reason given for content to be removed, followed by privacy and security . Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It should trouble everyone that as the Home Office is trying to justify monitoring all our emails, website visits and social media messages there are hundreds of requests for data every year being refused by Google. 'The existing system is failing to . provide proper checks on when our personal information is handed over to . the authorities and it is madness to take a bad system and massively . increase the amount of data being captured without first fixing the . existing rules and protections. 'Other companies should follow Google’s lead and publish details on the requests they have to establish the true scale of the current surveillance powers. 'It highlights how governments already access data from these companies, making it even more suspicious that they are seeking to make it easier to be able to snoop on us under the current proposals.' In her blog post commenting on the report, Ms Chou added: 'The information we disclose is only an isolated sliver showing how governments interact with the Internet, since for the most part we don’t know what requests are made of other technology or telecommunications companies. 'But we’re heartened that in the past year, more companies like Dropbox, LinkedIn, Sonic.net and Twitter have begun to share their statistics too.

"Film made in 1901, 31 years after Dickens' death . Thought to have been inspired by Dickens' novel Bleak House . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 06:09 EST, 9 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 9 March 2012 . The oldest surviving film based on the works of Charles Dickens has been discovered. The Death Of Poor Joe, inspired by Bleak House, dates back to March 1901 but lay unnoticed in an archive for decades. The minute-long clip, made by British film pioneer G.A. Smith, was given to the British Film Institute in 1954 by a collector, but was catalogued under the wrong name and date. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The death of Poor Joe: Joe the sweeper collapses in the arms of a watchman in the film thought to have been inspired by Dickens' Bleak House . BFI curator Bryony Dixon found it last month – 200 years after Dickens’s birth and 111 years after the film was made, 31 years after Dickens died. ‘It’s wonderful to have discovered . such a rare film so close to Dickens’s bicentennial,’ she said. ‘Not . only does it survive, but it is the world’s earliest Dickensian film. It . looks beautiful and is in excellent condition. 'This really is the icing on the cake of our current celebration of Dickens on Screen.' The film beats the previous record . holder, Scrooge; or, Marley’s Ghost, by several months. It depicts the . crossing-sweeper from Bleak House – played by Smith’s wife Laura Bayley – . being found by a nightwatchman as she freezes to death in the winter . snow. Discovered film: The severe-looking watchman appears to shoo Joe away as the snow falls around them . Suffering from the cold: Ragged-looking Joe collapses and is caught just in time by the watchman . Tragic death: As he takes his final breaths, Joe holds his hands up in prayer to heaven . Landmark year: Across the world people are marking the bicentenary of Charles Dickens . The snow is falling heavily at night as Jo appears in tattered clothes against a churchyard wall, struggling against the cold. A . watchman shoos him on, but then captures the boy just as he falls to . the ground dying. The watchman holds Jo as the boy puts his hands . together in prayer before taking his final breath. In Bleak House, Jo did not die in the snow, but rather died of pneumonia . and was led in prayer before his death by a character called Woodcourt. However, the name 'poor Jo' would have been recognisable to English . audiences as he was such a popular character among readers from the time of the . novel's publication in 1853 and so it is thought likely the Dickensian . character was the inspiration for the film. Crossing sweepers were a common sight in London and other large cities throughout much of the nineteenth century. Their . job was to sweep a path through the often dirty streets ahead of people . – particularly the more affluent – for a small fee. Dickens describes Jo as a homeless boy who ‘fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum’. The film will be screened as a special late addition to the programme of Dickens: Pre-1914 Short Films this month at the BFI Southbank in London.","Film made in 1901, 31 years after Dickens' death .

If you want to help an elderly relative cope with ageing and illness, give them a tablet – of the hi-tech variety. For using an iPad, smartphone or computer can be a boost for older people, researchers say. Becoming a silver surfer on Facebook, Twitter and other online social media networks helps combat disease and loneliness, a study found. Going online via an increasing range of easy-to-use devices gives access to a valuable source of support. It allows the elderly to use social networks, join discussion boards to beat loneliness, find out information about illnesses or exchange experiences. Researchers from the University of Luxembourg found that merely using a computer or similar web-enabled device successfully helped older people feel better about themselves. But using social media provided even greater benefits, said researcher Dr Anja Leist. Dr Leist, who aims to design websites that are easier for the elderly to use, said: ‘Older adults can use social media to access health-related information and engage in patient-to-patient or patient-doctor conversations. ‘There are many online forums where people in difficult life situations, such as informal caregivers of a spouse with dementia or individuals with depression, can exchange thoughts as well as receive and provide support.’ Besides the potential for clinical practise and other positive consequences in everyday use of social media, the researchers also addressed the possible negative consequences of social media use. Although more research was needed, adverse affects could include access to harmful information and misuse of personal data. Other negative effects have been shown to be unfavourable social comparisons due to overly positive self-representations of others displayed in online social networks. The study ‘Social media use of older adults - A mini-review’ is published by the university’s research unit INSIDE.","Researchers from the University of Luxembourg found that using a computer helped older people feel better .

Mari Muench, a mother-of-one from south London, met Patricio Jipa, a Kichwa tribe shaman, during a trip to Ecuador in 2008 where he wooed her with a poisonous frog. The couple immediately felt they were 'destined' to be together and settled down in his ancestral home where they now run an eco-tourism lodge. But the rainforest is under threat from . PetroAmazonas, Ecuador’s state-owned oil company, which recently offered . £400,000 for access to the 170 acres of land. Forest fighter: Londoner Mari Muench and her Ecuadorian husband Patricio Jipa, a Kichwa tribe shaman, are fighting to save their tribe's rainforest from oil company . Ms Muench and her husband are two of 400 members of the Kichwa tribe living on the banks of Ecuador’s Napo River, where the 49-year-old and . her husband married in 2010.

Despite their ecotourism project . currently relying on Ms Muench's life-savings, the pair are heading a . campaign to save Mr Jipa's ancestral territory, travelling by canoe from home to home to try and convince the members of their community to turn down the offer. In exchange for access to the land, PetroAmazonas has . promised the community a new school, grant funding . for their children to go to university, healthcare, jobs and lump sums of cash, a lucrative deal for the struggling tribe.

Under threat: Petroamazonas, an oil company owned by the Ecuadorian state, have offered £400,000 for the access to the picturesque forest . Trying to convince the community to turn away from these promises is no mean feat, Mr Jipa wrote in The Guardian last year, especially with the current financial state of the Sani Isla lodge, but the pair are determined to save the forest.

So perhaps it is only fitting that the Duke of Edinburgh now has one of his own phrases immortalised in the Oxford English Dictionary. The latest edition is expected to say that Prince Philip introduced the term 'blue-arsed fly', after he was recorded publicly scolding a photographer in 1970. The colourful expression will now be . attributed to him, unless anyone else can provide evidence that another . person used the phrase in public. The Duke of Edinburgh will make it into the Oxford English Dictionary's pages for his choice of language . The Duke was apparently annoyed by a . group of reporters and tourists and questioned a photographer who was . taking pictures of him whether he was getting enough shots. When the photographer said that he . hoped so the Duke snapped: 'You should do. You have been running around . like a blue-arsed fly.' The Times reported the phrase - which . describes someone in a constant flurry of activity - on April 22, 1970, . and since then it has become a common phrase. The OED's search for earlier uses of the word comes as part of their public online appeal to help trace the origins of words. Launched yesterday, the compendium's . editors need help in unearthing new information about the history and . usage of English, including the earliest examples of particular words. They suspect that the phrased attributed to Prince Philip has earlier roots. They said: 'The r-less blue-assed fly, however, is attested from at least 1932.  Why such a discrepancy? 'Since our original OED entry was published in 2005, we’ve discovered an earlier example of blue-arsed fly in a dictionary of slang from 1949, but we suspect there may be evidence out there that is earlier still.' Prince Philip is credited with the phrase after becoming annoyed . They are also seeking help from anyone who knows the origin of 'in your dreams', 'Bellini' and 'come in from the cold.' In their appeal, Chief Editor of the OED, John Simpson, explains how the OED Appeals initiative will help the team to revise the OED: 'When researching and revising entries, our team of editors use the OED’s famous citation files, gathered over more than a century, as well as the latest digitized databases and Corpus evidence. 'Nonetheless, the very first recorded usage of many words can be difficult to track down. 'We can trace certain words and phrases back only so far with conventional tools. 'An old takeaway menu, a family letter or album, or an obscure journal might hold the key to solving one of those mysteries.”OED editor Katherine Connor Martin also said: 'The OED’s record of the history of English was relying on input from the public more than a century before the term ‘crowdsourcing’ was even coined. 'James Murray launched an appeal to the public as far back as 1879, and the OED Appeals continues this long tradition of asking the public for help in our quest to record the origins of our vast, fantastic, ever-changing lexicon. 'After all, when it comes to the words we read, write, speak, and hear each day, every one of us is an expert.' Prince Philip admits that he has a unique way of expressing himself. He described as .

"Rush of chemicals released in specific brain locations after drinking produce feelings of pleasure and reward . By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 23:09 EST, 11 January 2012 . Drinking alcohol releases feel-good chemicals in an area of the human brain often referred to as the 'pleasure centre' Scientists have discovered why alcohol can make us feel good. For the first time it has been shown that drinking alcohol releases feel-good chemicals in an area of the human brain often referred to as the ‘pleasure centre’. The rush of chemicals released in specific brain locations after drinking produce feelings of pleasure and reward. Previously scientists had deduced from animal studies that the pleasurable effects of alcohol come from the release of endorphins in the brain. But new research used scanning technology to ‘light up’ the brain regions of drinkers, showing where it has the biggest impact. A study from the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Centre at the University of California marks the first time that endorphin release in two regions of the brain, the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex, in response to drinking alcohol has been directly observed in humans. Research leader Jennifer Mitchell, assistant professor of neurology, said: ‘This is something that we’ve speculated about for 30 years, based on animal studies, but haven’t observed in humans until now. ‘It provides the first direct evidence of how alcohol makes people feel good.’ The researchers used PET imaging (positron emission tomography) to observe the immediate effects of alcohol in the brains of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 matched ‘control’ subjects who were not heavy drinkers. Drinking led to a release of endorphins in all those taking part. The more endorphins released in the nucleus accumbens, the greater the feelings of pleasure reported by each drinker. However, as levels of endorphins released in the orbitofrontal cortex went up, heavy drinkers felt more intoxicated – but not those in the control group. Prof Mitchell said ‘This indicates . that the brains of heavy or problem drinkers are changed in a way that . makes them more likely to find alcohol pleasant, and may be a clue to . how problem drinking develops in the first place. ‘That greater feeling of reward might cause them to drink too much.’ Before drinking, the volunteers were . given injections of radioactively tagged carfentanil, an opiate-like . drug that binds to sites in the brain called opioid receptors, where . endorphins also bind. Researchers said the results indicated that the brains of heavy or problem drinkers are changed in a way that makes them more likely to find alcohol pleasant, and may be a clue to how problem drinking develops in the first place . This allowed researchers to map what happened in the brain as the receptor sites ‘lit up’ on PET scans, says a report in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Volunteers were then each given a drink of alcohol, followed by a second injection of radioactive carfentanil, and scanned again with PET imaging. As the natural endorphins released by drinking were bound to the opioid receptor sites, they prevented the carfentanil from being bound. By comparing areas of radioactivity in the first and second PET images, the researchers were able to map the exact locations - areas of lower radioactivity - where endorphins were released in response to drinking. The researchers found endorphins released after drinking bind to a specific type of opioid receptor, the Mu receptor, which they claim could be a target for developing drugs to treat or prevent alcohol addiction. Senior study author Howard Fields said the result suggests a possible way to improve on existing medication. Although it is effective, the drug naltrexone – which prevents binding at several opioid receptor sites - is not widely accepted as a treatment for alcohol dependence since it can make people feel depressed. He said ‘Some people stop taking it because they don’t like the way it makes them feel. 'Naltrexone blocks more than one opioid receptor, and we need to know which blocking action reduces drinking and which causes the unwanted side effects. ‘If we better understand how endorphins control drinking, we will have a better chance of creating more targeted therapies for substance addiction.’ Researchers say low to moderate doses of alcohol release feel-good chemicals, while high doses appear to fail to release them and may stimulate other systems in the brain leading to anxiety and depression.",Rush of chemicals released in specific brain locations after drinking produce feelings of pleasure and reward .

Its producers admitted the film, released in the UK a fortnight ago, is set for losses of more than £120million. Colossal flop: Science-fiction action film John Carter has made about $184million in ticket sales worldwide so far. But box office receipts are split roughly in half with cinema owners and it cost $250million and a further $100million to promote .

But the company has now projected that it will lose millions after it failed to impress critics and the public alike. Audience reviews have branded it ‘dull’, ‘pointless’ and ‘too long’.

BBC reviewer Mark Kermode said: ‘The storytelling is incomprehensible, . the characterisation is ludicrous, the story is two and a quarter hours . long and it’s a boring, boring, boring two and a quarter hours long.’ Disney said John Carter had brought in about £116million in ticket sales . worldwide so far but it retains only £58million of that as the money is . split equally with cinema chains. A spokesman confirmed: ‘In light of the theatrical performance of John . Carter, we expect the film to generate an operating loss of . approximately $200million (£126million).’ He added that its failure would mean the studio itself will lose up to . £76million for the quarter as the profits from other films and  ventures . are not enough to break even. Disney would not confirm the total budget of the film as it has held the . rights since 2007 and spent additional money on developing the idea. But industry sources have said it may need to gross more than £380million for the film to make all its money back. The poor performance of the film is a surprise, because its director, . Pixar’s Andrew Stanton, had previously achieved acclaim with Finding . Nemo and Wall-E. John Carter is based on a series of books written by Edgar Rice . Burroughs, who also created Tarzan. The stories follow a war veteran who . finds himself transported to Mars and battling to save the planet’s . inhabitants.

Most couples dream of a traditional romantic white wedding, but one wacky couple literally created their own unique fairytale wedding. The Jersey couple tied the knot dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona from the Dreamworks animated film. Devoted Paul Bellas, 42, painted himself green and wore monster ears and eyebrows for the movie-themed big day. Paul Bellas, 42 and his wife Heidi Coxshall, 30, made the unusual choice of getting married dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona . Heidi transformed into ogre Fiona for the reception, in lien with the film in which the beautiful princess is cursed to turn an ogre when the sun sets . The couple literally had a fairytale wedding with the magical theme running throughout the day's celebrations - including a Shrek cake . Bride Heidi Coxshall, 30, dressed as . Shrek's sweetheart Princess Fiona for the couple's wedding - which . featured a cast of characters from the animated film. Their four-year-old son Leo dressed as Donkey, Shrek's best pal, while Heidi's brother John gave her away as Muffin Man from Shrek 2. Other guests turned up as fairytale characters Snow White, Cinderella and Belle from Beauty and the Beast. The happy couple tied the knot on Saturday at the Radisson Blu Hotel in St. Helier, Jersey. Heidi made the couple's costumes herself, says she was determined to give their 60 guests a memorable time . The wedding guests got into the spirit of the day, dressing as various fairytale characters such as Robin Hood, Minnie Mouse, Snow White and Cinderella . Their four-year-old son Leo, who inspired the strange wedding theme, dressed as Donkey on the day . Heidi said she wanted a beach wedding originally but that 'they won't let you have one of those in Jersey' and so chose Shrek as the theme . Paul, a groundworker, said the couple, of Jersey, had been together for five years when Leo's love of Shrek inspired them to finally tie the knot. Paul said: 'Leo was watching his Shrek DVD, which he absolutely loves, and Heidi said wouldn't it be nice if we had a little Shrek wedding. 'The message behind Shrek is that it doesn't matter what you look like or who you are, it's all about true love - I thought it sounded absolutely perfect. Paul and Heidi's green make-u took hours to apply, with Paul also sporting eyebrows, ears and even rubber 'Shrek gloves' Guests young and old dressed up for the event as fairytale characters . Registrar Sue Groves said she had to see the couple before the got their make-up applied as she can't marry people who aren't recognisable . 'All the guests embraced the idea and thoroughly enjoyed themselves - there were times when we fell about laughing.' Heidi, who made the couple's costumes herself, says she was determined to give their 60 guests a memorable time - even if it meant an hour and a half applying green make-up. The care assistant said: 'I wanted a beach wedding originally but they won't let you have one of those in Jersey. Heidi Coxshall became emotional during their special day, which was inspired by their son Leo . Paul was forced to wait around after the ceremony as Heidi was transformed into Ogress Fiona for the reception . Guests really got into the spirit of the day and went all out with elaborate costumes and make-up . The wedding party must have looked a little odd to outsiders . 'The Shrek idea basically came about through Leo and it made sense. I'm not the skinniest lady in the world so I thought I would make a pretty decent Fiona. 'Paul's hasn't quite got Shrek's podgy face - but I thought he made a really handsome ogre on the day.' Heidi Coxshal, seen before and after her ogre transformation, said 'I'm not the skinniest lady in the world so I thought I would make a pretty decent Fiona' Paul's incredible transformation in Shrek led Heidi to describe his as a 'very handsome ogre' Registrar Sue Groves said she had carried out many novelty weddings in her time - but never married two ogres. She said: 'I had to see them before the got their make-up applied as I can't marry people who aren't recognisable.' Heidi actually tied the knot in human form then returned in green to the reception - mimicking the way Princess Fiona transforms into an ogress at night.","Heidi Coxshall, 30, and Paul Bellas, 42 from Jersey, married as Shrek and Princess Fiona from the Shrek animated films .

Emily Hartridge’s quirky ’10 reasons why’ videos cover a variety of issues affecting young people in modern life, and have propelled her to internet stardom. Her YouTube channel now has over 35,000 subscribers enjoying her frank and funny approach, complete with sketches, on topics as diverse as siblings and Christmas, to sexual experiences. Her latest video gives 10 reasons why her male fans should date an older woman, or ‘cougar’. Scroll down for video . Emily Hartridge tells her You Tube viewers exactly why they should date a cougar in this weeks installment of her video blog . Reason one: A technically naive cougar won't be able to check up on you . Reason three: A cougar will chase you . Confessing that she herself was once a cougar (by two years) and using her friend George as her pretend boyfriend to help her illustrate each reason, Emily, referencing the silly America Pie movie, explains: ‘Dating a cougar is every guys dream. I mean even I would have had sex with Stifler’s mum.’ Reasons for this idolisation are, according to Emily, a great deal to do with the confidence older women often possess in comparison to their younger counterparts. This self-assurance means not only will there be less tantrums and insecurities in the relationship, but that a cougar is more likely to be assertive - which is sexy - and to be more independent. Emily's faux boyfriend George suffers with Emily as a non-cougar girlfriend who heavily relies on him . Emily uses an online aging app to show that not everyone keeps their good looks . Not only is a cougar unlikely to lean on her man for emotional and financial support, she might actually take care of him. 1. Older women probably aren’t going to be tech savvy, so they cant check up on you . 2. They are more experienced in the bedroom . 3. Older women are independent – they won't depend on you for financial and emotional support . 4. There will be less tantrums and insecurities in your relationship . 5. You won’t need to chase them, they’ll chase you . 6. A cougar will never drag  you to see a Twilight movie . 7. They are wise, and so a cougar will take care of you . 8. Older women have enough life experience to know what they want . 9. Cougars are past stage of having children . 10. Your friends will be jealous . They are also less likely to ‘check up’ on you using your phone or Facebook, as a cougar probably wont be that tech savvy. Another reason behind the cougar's allure for a man is that they will pursue you. As Emily explains: ‘A cougar is actually a big cat that likes to hunt, rather than be hunted. So if you detain a cougar, you won’t need to do the chasing, she’ll get her man.’ And of course, another reason men should date a cougar is their additional sexual know-how and skills. As Emily points out: ‘What’s better than a hands on lesson?’ ‘Let’s say you’re the cougar and you’re dating a younger guy who doesn’t really know what he’s doing in the bedroom, think how much you’ll be helping him with future women he'll have sex with,’ she says. However, while a cougar having grown . up in a different era may have benefits, it also of course means that . they are older – and Emily uses an online ageing app on herself to show . that this is not always such a good thing.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:37 EST, 2 November 2011 . As a sexual harassment case threatens to derail Herman Cain's White House hopes, more details emerged last night about his alleged accuser and possible holes in his story. In a debacle that the 2012 presidential hopeful claims is nothing but a 'witch hunt' to stifle his surging popularity, two possible cases against Mr Cain have popped up from his time as CEO of the National Restaurant Association. Last night, The New York Times reported that one of the accusers was paid $35,000 - a year's salary - in a settlement as she departed following claims that the ex-Godfather's Pizza boss made her feel uncomfortable. Husband and wife: Herman Cain announced that his wife of 43 years, Gloria - who has not been seen with him on the campaign trail since he launched it in May - will soon take part in an exclusive interview . However, the number is way more than Mr Cain claimed she was paid in a Fox News interview Monday night. Mr Cain told host Greta Van Susteren: 'We ended up settling for what would have been a termination settlement, maybe like three-months salary.' In the same interview, he also inflated the woman's salary, saying he believed she made $40,000 - $50,000 a year. The Times report comes as his unidentified accuser said she wishes to come forward to tell her side of the story. A lawyer for one of the women who complained about Cain's behaviour told The Washington Post on Tuesday she wants to talk publicly about it. According to that report, Joel P. Bennett, a Washington lawyer who specializes in employment cases, said he asked the National Restaurant Association to waive his client's confidentiality so she can respond to Cain's claims that the complaints were 'totally baseless and totally false.' A spokeswoman for the restaurant association, Sue Hensley, said Tuesday night that the group had not been contacted by Bennett. Bennett did not immediately return messages seeking comment from The Associated Press. Mr Cain today claimed he never changed his story about bombshell sexual harassment allegations against him in the 1990s while he was the head of the National Restaurant Association. Reputation management: Herman Cain claimed he never changed his story about sexual harassment allegations against him in the 1990s while he was the head of the National Restaurant Association . This is despite the 65-year-old Republican presidential candidate giving a series of conflicting statements in the two days since the sensational accusations were disclosed by Politico. Mr Cain had said he was unaware of a financial settlement given to a female employee over allegations he sexually harassed her - but later acknowledged he was aware of an ‘agreement’. ‘It was an agreement,’ Mr Cain told CNN. ‘So it looked like I had changed my story. I didn't change my story. The difference between settlement and agreement - it makes a difference to me.’ Meanwhile Mr Cain announced that his wife of 43 years, Gloria - who has not been seen with him on the campaign trail since he launched it in May - will soon take part in an exclusive interview. ‘You will meet my wife publicly, in an exclusive interview that we are currently planning and anticipating,’ Mr Cain told Fox News. ‘She will be introduced in terms of some limited exposure. ‘But it’s not her style for her to be with me on every campaign stop. My wife represents that calm and tranquillity that I look forward to seeing when I get home.’ Over the past two days, Mr Cain has admitted he knew of one agreement between the National Restaurant Association and a woman who accused him of sexual harassment. He has said the woman initially asked for . a large financial settlement but ultimately received two to three . months' pay as part of a separation agreement. Mr Cain also acknowledged remembering one of the woman's accusations against him, saying he stepped close to her and told her she was the same height as his wife. ‘You will meet my wife publicly, in an exclusive interview that we are currently planning and anticipating. She will be introduced in terms of some limited exposure. But it’s not her style for her to be with me on every campaign stop. My wife represents that calm and tranquillity that I look forward to seeing when I get home' Herman CainRepublican presidential candidate . He has said he is not aware of any other agreements or settlements with any other women, though Politico - which first disclosed the allegations on Sunday night - said there was another. The political website reported that the trade group had given financial settlements to at least two female employees who accused the entrepreneur of inappropriate sexual behaviour. But it’s not all bad for Mr Cain, as the media frenzy over the accusations helped the campaign enjoy one of its best fundraising days so far, his chief of staff Mark Block said. Around $250,000 has poured in since the story broke on Sunday, reported the National Journal. The Georgia businessman, who is near the top of national polls in the Republican presidential race, was in his second day of damage-control mode as he looked to blunt the fallout of the accusations. They surfaced just two months before . the leadoff Iowa presidential caucuses - and he spent Tuesday much like . he did Monday, hopping from interview to interview to defend himself. His story: Mr Cain had said he was unaware of a financial settlement given to a female employee over allegations he sexually harassed her - but later acknowledged he was aware of an 'agreement' Mr Cain has repeatedly has denied that . he sexually harassed anyone, and has said he was falsely accused. He . also has argued that the allegations are part of a ‘witch hunt.’ And he said ‘there's nothing else there to dig up’ - all but daring opposition researchers to dive into his lengthy business career. The immediate political fallout was . unclear, although the harassment allegations - and Mr Cain's response to . them - have the potential to reshuffle the GOP race. 'I think the left is totally and completely terrified of a conservative black man coming to power and prominence. They are trying to do the same thing to him that they did with Clarence Thomas' Debbie DooleyAtlanta Tea Party Patriots . Conservatives rallied around Mr Cain, likening the attacks to what they describe as the ‘high-tech lynching’ of another prominent black Republican - Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They were referring back to Justice Thomas' divisive Supreme Court confirmation hearings two decades ago, where he was confronted with sexual harassment allegations from a one-time employee, Anita Hill. The forceful early reaction to the latest firestorm - fuelled by racially charged rhetoric - suggests Mr Cain’s attempt to cast himself as a victim of the media and liberals could be paying dividends. ‘I think the left is totally and completely terrified of a conservative black man coming to power and prominence,’ said Debbie Dooley, a leader of Atlanta Tea Party Patriots. ‘They are trying to do the same thing to him that they did with Clarence Thomas.’ Comparisons: Conservatives rallied around Mr Cain, likening the attacks on him to what they describe as the 'high-tech lynching' of another prominent black Republican - Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . Pundit Ann Coulter fumed: ‘It's outrageous the way liberals treat a black conservative.’ ‘This is about blacks and Hispanics . getting uppity ... (Liberals) cannot have a black Republican running for . office, can't have a Hispanic. The Left owns those minorities, those two groups can't be seen rising on their own' Rush LimbaughTalk show host . Radio show host Rush Limbaugh said: ‘This is about blacks and Hispanics getting uppity ... (Liberals) cannot have a black Republican running for office, can't have a Hispanic. ‘The Left owns those minorities, those two groups can't be seen rising on their own.’ But there is no evidence of liberal involvement in the disclosure of Mr Cain's allegations, and, in the fact, the revelations could end up benefiting his Republican opponents in the short term. The accusations against Mr Cain, an untested newcomer on the political scene, could give more moderate GOP voters pause and could cause would-be donors to shy away. Politico reported that at least two women who complained about sexually inappropriate behaviour while working for Mr Cain at the National Restaurant Association. Past times: Herman Cain is pictured on the day he married his wife in 1968, whom he says 'represents that calm and tranquillity that I look forward to seeing when I get home' They had signed agreements with the restaurant group that gave them five-figure financial payouts to leave the association and barred them from discussing their departures, Politico claimed. 'It is deeply insulting that this is being called political. Sexual harassment allegations are always about a woman who is simply trying to go to work' Erin MatsonNational Organization for Women . The report was based on anonymous sources and, in one case, what the publication said was a review of documentation that described the allegations and the resolution. Politico said the politician’s spokesman J.D. Gordon told the publication that Mr Cain himself had indicated to campaign officials that he was ‘vaguely familiar’ with the charges. Erin Matson, a vice president for the National Organization for Women, said the women in question should be given the benefit of the doubt. ‘It is deeply insulting that this is being called political,’ she said. ‘Sexual harassment allegations are always about a woman who is simply trying to go to work.’","Cain claimed in interview that she got three months salary .

Despite being considered one of Britain's fashion icons, it seems Sienna Miller isn't a fan of the her home nation's style. Describing English fashion as 'scruffy', the 31-year-old spoke out about how she considers French fashion to be in a 'different league' to her fellow countrymen. The actress - who is the face of chic French brand Caroll - says she prefers the way women dress on the other side of the Channel, adding that their 'classic, timeless' look is much more flattering than London girls' mismatched clothes. It is easy to see why Sienna is considered a British fashion icon as she attended the Vanity Fair party for the TriBeCa Film Festival on Tuesday in a chic black floral dress teamed with a red bag for a pop of colour . Asked what she thinks of French style in an interview with newspaper supplement Madame Figaro, she replied: 'So chic, so timeless... You French are in a different league in terms of elegance. Also, you're naturally slim. 'English girls are so much scruffier, especially in London where people really wear absolutely anything, in any old way. 'French girls manage to look desirable even when they're not making an effort.' Sienna, 31, also revealed she is a big admirer of urban streetwear and wishes she was daring enough to pull off the look she believes is one of the most unique to hit the runway in decades. She explained: 'I've been intrigued by the influence of hip-hop in fashion recently and girls who play with a new aesthetic. Sienna is known for her edgy and adventurous style but believe she couldn't pull off the new trend for street-wear which she describes as 'not my style' Sienna will no doubt have delighted her French fans with her comments praising their effortless style . 'I've always thought fashion was a constant cycle, that looks from the 40s, 50s or 60s were repeated in a loop. 'But the arrival of streetwear is something really fresh. 'Unfortunately it's not quite my style... I would have loved to have been able to wear completely crazy outfits covered in graffiti.'","Sienna Miller said in an interview she prefers the style of French women .

A 46-stone woman is said to be in a critical condition in hospital after a dangerous skin infection left her fighting for her life. Previously named Britain’s fattest teenager, Georgia Davis, 20, was admitted to the hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, on Friday suffering with the skin infection cellulitis. Georgia is said to be drifting in and out of consciousness on a resuscitation ward, and requires assistance to breathe. Georgia Davis was admitted to hospital on Friday suffering from a severe skin infection . Georgia Davis, now aged 20,was previously named Britain's fattest teenager, having battled with her weight since childhood . Georgia, who currently weighs about 46st after re-gaining 4st of the 16st she lost in a 9 month hospital stay, is said to be seriously ill, and requiring help with her breathing after cellulitis spread around her body . Stepdad Arthur Treloar, 73, told The Sun: ‘We've been told it's bad — really serious. ‘She was put on the ward on Friday and now she's having to be helped to breathe. We've been told she might not make it.’ Georgia had lost nearly 16 stone during a nine month hospital stay, dropping from 56st to 40st 6lb, but has returned to her unhealthy diet since her release, piling on four stone in just five months. She contracted cellulitis, a usually easily treated skin infection, in her leg, which left her unable to leave her armchair. Georgia was dramatically admitted to hospital last summer after a desperate call to her mother Lesley, seen here with her daughter, when she become unable to stand . The infection, which is caused by bacteria entering the skin through a cut or abrasion, worsened and spread around her body. Obese . people are at increased risk of cellulitis due to skin breaking and . becoming thin at fat folds and decreased circulation which allows the . bacteria to enter and spread. If the infection enters the blood stream it can cause sepsis and become life threatening. A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of her house so that the emergency services could remove Georgia when she was admitted to hospital last year . Extracting Georgia from her house, v, to take her to hospital last year, cost an estimated £100,000 and took 50 emergency workers eight hours . Georgia first hit the headlines aged 15, when it was revealed she was flying to the US to enrol in a fat camp in a desperate attempt to shed some of her 33st girth. Georgia seen here aged 15 after she shed weight at a US fat camp, however she soon began to gain back the pounds . She successfully lost 15 stone at the camp, however the teen began to gain weight again when she moved back into her parent’s home when her step father was diagnosed with lung cancer. The teenager used to order up to 20 . kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on . chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola, causing her weight . to balloon to 56st. Georgia was dramatically admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales in June last year, after a terrifying call to her mother from her bedroom to tell her she couldn’t stand up. Her size meant that the emergency services were unable to extract Georgia from her bedroom, and eventually were forced to demolish the walls of her house. It cost an estimated £100,000 as emergency workers spent eight hours cutting her free as two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, were demolished to remove her from her first-floor bedroom. By the time the 50-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months. The then 19-year-old lost weight during her stay in the Prince Charles Hospital, going from 56st to 40st 6lb, after being placed on a strict diet. At the time she vowed to lose weight and get her life back on track, saying: ‘I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back.’","Georgia Davis, 20, admitted to hospital with skin infection cellulitis .

"By . Paul Bracchi and Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 24 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 27 August 2012 . Not so long ago, Tom Inskip was cruising along the freeway in California in a flashy convertible sports car. Nothing out of the ordinary about that, you might think. Except for one revealing detail: he was stark naked, his modesty preserved only by the steering wheel. How do we know this? Because a picture of him in the nude subsequently appeared on a Facebook page. Perhaps, then, we should not be too surprised to learn, then, that ‘Skippy’ — as he is known to his friends — featured prominently in recent scandalous events in Las Vegas involving Prince Harry. Harry's 'wingman': Tom Inskip, right, seems to feature prominently in Prince Harry's recent scandals as seen here in a swimming pool in Las Vegas . Last August Tom Inskip and Prince Harry were photographed partying on the island of Hvar, off the coast of Croatia, where the prince jumped into a pool fully-clothed . For Skippy is Harry’s best friend. Where Harry goes, ‘Skippy’ is usually not far behind. And vice-versa. He is often called Harry’s ‘wingman’. It is a misleading description. A ‘wingman’, in flying terms (Harry is a an Apache helicopter pilot), is a pilot who protects his colleague on dangerous missions by watching his back. But Inskip seems often to perform the opposite role, enthusiastically accompanying, if not leading, his friend into trouble. He was with Harry on his ill-fated trip to Croatia in August last year, when they got drunk on vodka, whisky, beer and tequila, and were photographed jumping into a pool fully-clothed at a nightclub on the party island of Hvar. He was with him on a skiing trip to Verbier in November when they amused themselves by childishly hurling snowballs at unsuspecting passers-by from a balcony. He was with him at a party in 2010 when Harry was seen inhaling ‘hippy crack’ — otherwise known as nitrous oxide or laughing gas — a recreational drug which, although perfectly legal, has been associated with a number of fatalities. And, of course, Skippy ‘Inskip’ — who at 25 is two years Harry’s junior — was in the thick of the action in downtown Vegas. He may not have appeared in those embarrassing shots of Harry playing ‘strip billiards’ in Room 2401 at the Encore Wynn Hotel. But he was undoubtedly there — off camera — with other members of Harry’s entourage, of which more in a moment. Inskip, in between falling out of this or that nightclub in various parts of the world with Prince Harry, works in the City. His father is Owen Inskip, a field-master of Prince Charles’s favourite hunt, The Beaufort, who has made a fortune over the years from a number of businesses, including ‘managing’ thousands of council homes for local authorities and upmarket estates. The family’s nine-bedroom country pile, Alderley Farm, near Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, was sold for more than £7 million in 2007. ‘Skippy’ and sister Victoria — ‘Tor’ to her friends — have known Princes William and Harry since childhood. The Inskips were regulars at Club H, the ‘nightclub’ William and Harry set up in the basement of Highgrove. Victoria has been a fundraiser for Sentebale, the African charity set up by Prince Harry (ironically, it was holding a fund-raising event in California while he was ‘letting off steam’ in Vegas). Her brother attended Eton with Harry and co-owns a race horse with him called Usain Colt. He is credited with organising Prince William’s stag party before his wedding to Kate Middleton. Earlier this year, Inskip was said to be dating flame-haired literary agent the Hon Lara Hughes-Young, 24, daughter of Lord St Helens. The couple recently jetted out to South Africa — without Harry — to stay with Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. It was a rare excursion without the Prince because, for the most part, Harry and Tom are inseparable. The following episode perhaps illustrates this. Back in the days when scandal arrived at breakfast with the News of the World, the paper ran a front page ‘exclusive’ about Prince Harry. The gist of it was that he had a one-night stand with a foreign  student on a trip to the Swiss skiing resort of Klosters. The ‘revelation’ seems tame by comparison with recent events in Vegas. Afterwards, however, sources discreetly suggested it was ‘Skippy’, not Harry, who had bedded the girl. So much for being his ‘wingman’. Tom Inskip is also believed to have . been in the group that accompanied Harry on a less well-publicised trip . to Las Vegas late last year after a week of military training in . California. The royal ‘hangover crew’ spent three days partying and . gambling in Vegas. Needless . to say, it was Harry who appeared on the gossip websites. Photographic . evidence of him flirting with a nightclub waitress was posted on the . internet. Then, as now, . Harry and his pals stayed at the Encore Wynn Hotel, a gleaming back . edifice in the heart of the Strip which houses four miles of bars, . gambling halls, pole- dancing clubs and neon lights. Little wonder Vegas is also a favourite destination for many of our Premiership football stars. On a ski trip to Verbier, Switzerland, last November, Harry and 'Skippy' were shown throwing snowballs at passers-by from a balcony . So who else is in Harry’s drinking and partying gang? Arthur Landon is certainly one of them. Landon, 30, inherited more than £200 million on the death of his father in 2007. Brigadier Tim Landon, an adventurer and arms dealer in oil-rich Oman, was known in life as the ‘White Sultan’. Before flying to Vegas, Landon, Skippy and Burberry model Cressida Bonas, Harry’s most recent girlfriend, joined him for an equally wild tequilla-fuelled week on Richard Branson’s private island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands. They certainly didn’t hold back during the 27th birthday celebrations of the tycoon’s son, Sam Branson. Mr Landon offered friends a look inside his suitcase as he packed for the trip, which included Captain  Britannia and storm-trooper costumes, a gas mask and what appeared to be a purple bong — a device that can be used for smoking drugs. The contents were photographed and posted online. The accompanying caption read: ‘2x flip flops, 3x board shorts, 8x fancy dress outfits, 1x toothbrush, 10x awesomeness. Then he wrote: ‘Let the good times roll, let me roll, let me roll!!!’ Three days later, Ampleforth- educated Mr Landon posted another picture on Facebook of one of their group, who was wearing a pair of Bermuda shorts similar to those worn in Vegas by Prince Harry, apparently passed out in the sand, captioned: ‘The perfect start.’ Meanwhile, Miss Bonas provided an insight into the group’s riotous holiday, uploading a picture of  herself wearing a bright yellow bikini top and neon pink shorts, and matching pink wig. Some members of the group, including Miss Bonas, returned to London. But a handful, including Skippy, Landon and Adam Bidwell, went with Prince Harry to ‘Sin City’. Keen Rugby player Bidwell was photographed in the Jacuzzi at the MGM Grand hotel with the Prince the following day and is a close pal of Harry’s one-time rumoured love interest, TV presenter Natalie Pinkham. He went to Natalie’s wedding in Portugal recently, which was also attended by Princess Eugenie and Zara Phillips. Hours after Harry’s entourage arrived on Friday last week, they were to be found in the aptly-named Surrender nightclub — part of the Encore Wynn resort where they were staying, and where they invited a group of girls they met back to the ‘royal’ suite on the 63rd floor. Letting his heir down: Prince Harry relaxed poolside surrounded by . bikini-clad girls in Vegas before his naked antics came to light . At the centre of proceedings, of course, was Prince Harry. Or should we call him ‘Harry Prince’? That is the name he jokingly used, by all accounts, during his now notorious 72 hours in Las Vegas. The pictures revealing what had taken place appeared on TMZ, the American showbiz gossip website, which has now made a video poking fun at Prince Harry and the Queen, who is depicted in cartoon form chastising her grandson. ‘Poor show,’ her caricature screams, before ordering Harry to ‘apologise to the kingdom.’ It would be difficult to imagine a more embarrassing — or avoidable — fiasco in Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee year in which Prince Harry, who will shortly celebrate his 28th birthday, represented the Royal Family at the Olympics closing ceremony just a fortnight ago. Speaking for the first time about the Vegas trip, Landon insisted none of Harry’s friends would have taken the photographs. ‘I obviously think it is really despicable that someone would accept Prince Harry’s hospitality and then take these pictures,’ he said. ‘I know it has put a real dampener on everybody on that holiday. ‘Some people have been hinting it was one of his friends who took the pictures. But this is absolutely not true. None of his friends would ever do that. We are really careful.’ Either way, the game of ‘strip billiards’, was the prelude to non-stop drinking, flirting, and partying in which Harry’s friends attended two decadent pool parties, downed cocktails as they watched go-go dancers in skimpy bikinis gyrate around stripper poles, played dice game craps in the casinos and ran up a £30,000 tab in the process. Perhaps the only welcome news is that it didn’t cost taxpayers back in Britain a penny. The drinks, as they say, were on the house, courtesy of billionaire Steve Wynn, who owns the hotel. Last Sunday morning, Harry could be spotted in the one of the lobby bars nursing three Bloody Marys. By his side, as ever, was Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip. He is Prince Harry’s ‘wingman’, after all.","Harry's best pal Tom Inskip has been photographed along side the prince as he jumped into a pool fully-clothed, chucked snowballs as passers-by and was there in Las Vegas as the latest scandal took place ."

And few brands have had caused as much of a storm as Spanx. Loved by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Garner and Julia Roberts, as well as the less famous (and less toned) among us, Spanx has fast become the biggest name in shapewear across the globe. But with prices of £34 for a pair of Power Panties shorts or £109 for a slip, prices for the mainline Spanx range can be prohibitive. Now that is set to change as Spanx launches an offshoot collection in the UK in an attempt to make the brand accessible to a wider market. The Featherweight Firmer half slip, £44, left, and the focused firmers high-waist panty, £49, right . Assets Red Hot Label, launching exclusively into Debenhams, is priced from £29, with no item costnig more than £62. Initially launched in America in 2006 where it was met with huge success, the fashion-inspired silhouettes and design details make concealing imperfections more affordable. The brand say that the new range is more suited to a younger market, with lower price points, altered structures and shorter lengths offering support for the mini dress and bodycon trends. Sleek Slimmers slip £52, which can even be worn as outerwear, and the Cheeky Control Tummy Tamer, £29 . Pieces are designed to go with every outfit and styles can be flipped inside out for a new colour or turned around to offer a second neckline option. The range features light slips, shapers with lace and slimming tops as well as the full body shapers and the favourite high-waisted pants. The collection is available in three levels of so-called 'power', depending on the wearer's needs: Medium for subtle slimming and smoothing, Super for a high level of slimming and shaping, and Ultra for what the brand say is 'targeted taming and maximum control'. Nude silhouette open-bust mid-thigh bodyshaper, £62 (right), and the Mid-Thigh Flipside Firmers, which can be reversed to reveal the pants in black (£44) While the Medium range is made of a lightweight fabric for ‘comfortable firming’, the Ultra level unsurprisingly is made of what are called 'super powerful yarns’ that they claim will combat trouble zones. The most expensive piece in the range is the full-body open-bust bodyshaper costing £62. The cheapest piece in the range is the tummy tamer brief, £29, which features a slimming waistband that flattens the tummy. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian (left) and Julia Roberts have openly spoken about their love for Spanx . Spanx founder Sara Blakely comments: 'We launched the Assets brand to help more women experience the power of shapewear. 'Women in the UK will love Assets' for its value, but also for its comfortable results. Now with Assets Red Hot Label, we’re giving women even more ways to look and feel their absolute best in their clothes.'

Holidaymakers were shocked to see a monster rise from the deep - a giant anchor which has been buried under sands for hundreds of years. Visitors to the Welsh beach saw the 12ft high anchor, which is estimated to be 170 years old, rise up out of the sands overnight, after a strong tide moved the shifting sands. The one tonne anchor was recovered from Cefn Sidan Sands in Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, and tests will now be carried out it to discover where it came from. The massive anchor was uncovered by the shifting sands in Carmarthen Bay, West Wales after remaining buried for 170 years . Visitors to the beach were stunned to find the 12ft anchor had been uncovered by the tide in a matter of hours . A tractor was required to lift the massive anchor, which weighed in at one tonne, from the sand and transport it for testing. The anchor, while a significant piece of maritime history, is by no means the first large piece of debris to have been discovered at Cefn Sidan Sands. The beach is known as Wales' equivalent of Africa's Skeleton Coast as over 300 ships have been wrecked at the picturesque beauty spot in the past. Carmarthenshire Council spokesman Ron Cant said: 'Many wrecks floundered on Cefn Sidan before detailed records were made. 'Over time stormy weather and the shifting of vast tonnages of sand, the beach has given up scores of wrecks and jetsam and flotsam artifacts - including many anchors. A tractor was required to lift the massive anchor, which weighed in at one tonne, from the sand and transport it for testing . 'Wreck provenance only started to be recorded in some detail when newspapers started to record in the first decade of the 19th century the misfortune of hapless mariners. 'Little if anything is known about the names of more than 300 vessels thought to have floundered there.' The beach, part of the Pembrey Country Park leisure and nature complex, is often the resting place of the washed up skeletons of steel and wood vessels. The mysterious debris is washed in on spring tides which often send the sea two miles up the shore. Cefn Sidan Sands in Pembrey, is known as Wales' equivalent of Africa's Skeleton Coast as over 300 ships have been wrecked there . As the sands levels rise and fall artifacts can be shifted or buried deeper, and many remain undiscovered for years. Nature reserve rangers make daily sweeps of the beach to check for washed up items. Senior Ranger Gavin Hall said: 'Finds have varied from lost cargoes of sun tan oil to coconut trees with coconuts that are washed up on the tide. 'But it is what is revealed from under the sand or storm ripped dunes that is of more interest. 'It is a veritable treasure trove of maritime ages past - Items can lie buried for several hundred years before being given up by the sands.'","12ft high anchor was recovered from Cefn Sidan Sands in Pembrey, Carmarthenshire .

The Australian DJs who made a prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital will not face any charges despite the apparent suicide of the nurse who took the call. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was no evidence to support a manslaughter charge against DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who posed as the Queen and Prince of Wales to call  the King Edward VII's hospital in central London when Kate was being treated for a rare form of pregnancy sickness. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred them to a colleague who then described Kate's condition in detail, was found hanged a few days after the incident. Following a global backlash against the two hoaxers the case was investigated but Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of special crime at the CPS, said any potential prosecution would not be in the public interest. No charges will be brought against Australian DJs Mel . Greig and Michael Christian over hoax calls to the hospital treating the . Duchess of Cambridge, the Crown Prosecution Service said today . He said: 'As is . well known, on December 4 2012 Mel Greig and Michael Christian, both . radio presenters in Australia, made a telephone call to the King Edward . VII's Hospital in London, where the Duchess of Cambridge was receiving . treatment, in which they pretended to be members of the Royal Family. 'During the . course of the call, private information about the Duchess's health was . given, in good faith, to Ms Greig and Mr Christian and the call was . later played on a radio station in Australia. 'Subsequently, . Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at the hospital who had initially taken the . call but who had not herself passed on the information, tragically took . her own life.' He said Scotland . Yard provided the CPS with a file of evidence on December 19 and asked . advice on whether a prosecution should be brought. Tragic: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate's ward, was found dead in nurses' housing three days after the call . 'Having . carefully reviewed the evidence currently available, we have concluded . that there is no evidence to support a charge of manslaughter and that, . although there is some evidence to warrant further investigation of . offences under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Malicious . Communications Act 1988 and the Communications Act 2003, no further . investigation is required because any potential prosecution would not be . in the public interest,' he said. Mr McHaffie said . the CPS had taken into account, among other matters, that it is not . possible to extradite people from Australia on the potential offences in . question. He also said it considered that 'however misguided, the telephone call was intended as a harmless prank'. 'The consequences in this case were very sad. We send our sincere condolences to Jacintha Saldanha's family.' The Australian was this week permanently  taken off air this week - but the two presenters will be given other roles at the station. Mel Greig and Michael Christian of . 2Day FM in Sydney went into hiding and received death threats following . the phone call last month to King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, . central London. Their Hot 30 . show has been axed, but the presenters are still employed - and network . Austereo is looking at them ‘returning to work when the time is right, . in roles that make full use of their talents’. Jacintha . Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate’s . ward, was found dead in nurses’ housing three days later, prompting a . huge backlash against Miss Greig and Mr Christian. Austereo is today launching a new . programme called The Bump, in place of Hot 30, which will be hosted by . presenter Angus O'Loughlin, but Miss Greig and Mr Christian are still on . leave. ‘We look forward to . Mel and MC returning to work when the time is right, in roles that make . full use of their talents,’ Austereo chief executive Rhys Holleran told . Agence France-Presse. He added that the network will discuss future roles with the presenters ‘when they are ready’. Miss Greig and Mr Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in the call, which led Austereo to suspend prank calls by all of its radio stations and saw both presenters make a tearful apology on TV for their actions. Ms Saldanha's grieving husband and two teenage children clutched each other last month as they gathered with hundreds of mourners in a small town in India for her funeral. William and Kate pictured leaving the King Edward VII hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness . Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.' The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'. In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy. Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life. 'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through. And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.' Mr Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected. Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened. 'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.'

A retired doctor is fighting to have her great uncle's name spelled correctly on a village memorial nearly a century after he was killed in France at the age of 20 during the First World War. Alison Corfield says the mis-spelling of Private George Samuel's name as 'Samuels' on the memorial at Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, caused 'great distress' to his parents after the 1914-18 conflict ended. She says authorities refused to correct the mistake after the memorial was erected and Private Samuel's family had tried to hide the extra 's' by covering it with mud. Shepreth war memorial in Cambridgeshire, where, nearly a century after he was killed in France at the age of 20 during the First World War, Private George Samuel's name is still spelled incorrectly . George Samuel's family used to try and cover the extra 's on his misspelt name up with mud on the memorial . Mrs Corfield, 67, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, hopes that the 'wrong can be righted' as Britain prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of hostilities. She has written to local councillors in Shepreth asking for the spelling to be changed. Shepreth Parish Council says it is 'actively pursuing' the issue and will have discussions at a meeting later this month. A county councillor who represents Shepreth says there could not be a more 'fitting time' to change the spelling. 'The inscription of 'Samuels' on the war memorial is incorrect with the extra 's',' said Mrs Corfield, . Private George Samuel was killed in France at the age of 20 in WW1 . 'This caused the family a lot of distress after the war and the authorities refused to alter it. The family tried to cover the extra 's' with mud.' She added: 'I'd like to get the wrong righted. It would mean be a lot to me and my family and I think it would appropriate as the centenary approaches. I doubt it can too difficult to hide or erase the extra letter. 'We are not talking about one letter or a spelling mistake. We are talking about a young soldier who died in the First World War. Someone's son. 'His name was George Samuel not George Samuels. I think it matters that George Samuel's sacrifice is remembered. And I think the mistake should be put right.' Mrs Corfield said Private Samuel was a soldier in the London Regiment. She thinks that he fought in the Battle of the Somme - which began in July 1916. 'He was killed on September 30 1916. He died of wounds and is buried at St Pierre cemetery in Amiens,' said Mrs Corfield. 'There is a family story that when he joined up he said: ""I'm going now and I don't expect to be back.""' Shepreth Parish Council clerk Charles Cook said he had received a letter from Mrs Corfield and the issue was on the agenda for the next parish council meeting on April 11. Private Samuel's name sits with others who fell during the 'great war', as Britain prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of hostilities . Mr Cook said: 'We are actively pursuing getting this changed for her.' Susan van de Ven, a Liberal Democrat member of Cambridgeshire County Council who represents Shepreth and surrounding villages, said she thought that locals would empathise with Mrs Corfield's fight. 'The names inscribed on the Shepreth war memorial are familiar to all who pass by it every day, and I knew George's name when I first heard this story. As in villages everywhere, the young men lost have not been forgotten,'  she said. 'Shepreth villagers I'm sure will empathise with George Samuel's family's wish and there could not be a more fitting time to put things right.'","Family have been trying to have the memorial at Shepreth, Cambridgeshire corrected since  WW1 .

The dozen rocks of various shapes and sizes were uncovered in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama. They are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of shamanic rituals in that part of Central America, according to researchers. Charcoal found directly underneath the geological stash in the back of a small, prehistoric cave was carbon-dated to 4,800 years ago, while a second fragment of charcoal above the stones was dated to 4,000 years ago, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama reported Monday. Stones: Archaeologists have unearthed nearly 5,000-year-old shaman's stones, pictured, in a rock shelter in Panama . The findings were published online December 27 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, LiveScience reported. The 12 rocks were found clustered tightly together, suggesting that several millenniums ago, they were brought by a healer or shaman in a bag, which had since long disintegrated. The rock shelter where the find was made has been known to researchers since the 1970s. In 2006, Ruth Dickau, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the UK, took another look at the location and determined that contrary to previous beliefs, it had been used by people as a shed for cooking and tool-making for over 9,000 years. Sharmen: The stones are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of the rituals of the healers, as illustrated left, in that part of Central America . Discovery: The 12 stones were found in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter, pictured, in the Isthmus of Panama . It was during a dig at the site that Dickau stumbled upon the mysterious pile of stones, among them translucent quartz, pyrite, magnetic rocks. Some of the rocks contained grains of iron and showed magnetic properties by deflecting a compass needle. Study co-author and consulting geologist Stewart Redwood said in a statement that the shamanic stones originated from a remote, gold-rich region of Panama known as the Central Cordillera up to 3,000 years before gold prospecting began there. 'We will never be entirely sure how the ancient people used the stones in the past,' Dickau wrote. To this day, shamans in Costa Rica chant and blow tobacco smoke over crystals to make contact with spirits or diagnose an illness.","A dozen rocks of various shapes and sizes were uncovered in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama .

Mitt Romney has taken a potentially decisive step towards securing the Republican presidential nomination by coasting to victory over Rick Santorum in the Illinois primary. With nearly 90 per cent of the vote in, the former Massachusetts governor was on 45 per cent, 12-points ahead of his main rival, with Ron Paul on eight per cent and Newt Gingrich languishing ignominiously in fourth. The victory was an important one because it was in a Mid-Western state, it followed a double loss to Santorum in the Deep South last week and it extended Romney’s delegate lead making it all but mathematically impossible his rivals achieve the 1,144 needed for outright victory. Scroll down for video . Hand on heart: Mitt Romney has taken a potentially decisive step towards securing the Republican presidential nomination by coasting to victory over Rick Santorum in the Illinois primary last night . Looking ahead: Romney makes a victory speech in Schaumburg, Illinois, where he kept his focus on Barack Obama rather than his Republican primary opponents . It was also symbolic that Romney won . the home state of President Barack Obama, the man he will almost . certainly face in November, though in a general election Illinois is a . Democratic stronghold. With . the Louisiana primary on Saturday marking the half-way point in the . Republican race, Romney has well over 500 delegates and now enters a . phase when he has the opportunity to rack up some big delegate hauls. In a victory speech in Schaumburg, Illinois, Romney kept his focus on Obama rather than his Republican primary opponents. 'Three . years of Barack Obama have brought us fewer jobs and shrinking . paychecks, but many of us believed we were in danger of losing something . even more than the value of our homes and our 401(k)s,' he said. 'After years of too many apologies and . not enough jobs, historic drops in income and historic highs in gas . prices, a president who doesn't hesitate to use all the means necessary . to force through Obamacare on the American public, but leads from behind . in the world. It's time to say these words, this word: enough. We've . had enough.' Victory lap: Romney celebrates with his wife Ann. He won Illinois by a wide margin - his third big industrial state victory against Rick Santorum . Distant second: Rick Santorum spent the last week defending himself against gaffes and self-inflicted injuries . Despite big losses on Super Tuesday and in the South last week, Mitt Romney retains a massive advantage in the number of convention delegates. If he continues at this pace, he will reach the 1,144 needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination at the GOP convention in August. (All numbers exclude Tuesday's win, which offers 59 delegates awarded by Congressional district.) Mitt Romney: 522 . Victories: New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Arizona, Wyoming, Washington, Ohio, Virginia, Massachusetts, Idaho, Alaska, Vermont, Guam, Northern Marianas, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, American Samoa and Puerto Rico . Rick Santorum: 253 . Victories: Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi . Newt Gingrich: 135 . Victories: South Carolina and Georgia . Ron Paul: 50 . Victories: None . Exit polls found that Romney, whose staunchest base of support was in Chicago and its suburbs, performed well among graduates, Catholics and voters who see the economy as the most important issue facing the country. In a comprehensive victory, he also had an edge over Santorum among those describing themselves as conservative. Only among white evangelicals and those identifying as 'very conservative' did Santorum, a hard-line Catholic, prevail. Romney, the long-time party establishment favourite and undisputed frontrunner since his six-out-of-10 victories on 'Super Tuesday' this month, was helped in Illinois by a huge spending advantage over the other candidates. Also helping Romney was the belief that he has the best chance to defeat Obama in November. Exit polls indicated that 60 per cent thought Romney was the most electable candidate, compared to 23 per cent for Santorum. Romney will take most of the 54 delegates up for grabs in Illinois. Santorum was ineligible for 10 delegates because of campaign disorganisation. Neither Paul nor Gingrich nor Paul seriously contested the state. Before the vote Santorum said he was hoping for a surprise victory driven by the more rural, conservative voters in the southern and western part of the state. That outcome, he insisted, would 'really send shockwaves' through the Republican establishment. He held four rallies and conducted 19 interviews in Illinois on voting day in a last-ditch effort to boost turnout among his downstate supporters before heading to his home state of Pennsylvania, which votes on April 24. Key win: While Romney's victory in Illinois will not end the GOP primary, his wide margin has greatly bolstered his status as front-runner . All eyes on Illinois: The primary in the heavily-Democratic state boiled down to a contest between Romney and Santorum . Acknowledging defeat, Santorum was notably less combative in attacking Romney, perhaps a sign that he was beginning to accept that his rival would be the party’s nominee. He touted his blue-collar roots, contrasting them with Romney’s Wall Street credentials. 'I learned everything about freedom and opportunity and hard work growing up with folks who worked in the mills and mines,' he said. Vowing to stay in the race, he told his supporters to 'saddle up like Reagan did in the cowboy movies,' reassuring them it would be 'five weeks to a big win and a big delegate sweep in Pennsylvania.' As well as Pennsylvania, Santorum expects to win in the Louisiana and then Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22. He has also set his sights on a big win in Texas, which offers 155 delegates and which holds a primary on May 29. But in the short term, Romney hopes to score April wins in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island. A Romney win in Pennsylvania could seal Santorum’s fate.","Romney's lead now more than double of nearest rival Rick Santorum .

Assortment of cheeses: A new study shows the art of cheese making dates back at least 7,000 years to Poland . The art of cheese-making dates back at least 7,000 years, archaeologists have concluded after finding traces of an ancient vintage. Chemical analysis of fragments of pottery believed to have been specially designed for creating cheese has shown that it was being made in about 5000BC. But far from coming from regions like Somerset in Britain and Brie in France that are famous today for their cheeses, the earliest vintage comes from the Polish region of Kuyavia. By analysing fatty acids extracted from unglazed pottery pierced with small holes excavated from archaeological sites in the area, the researchers showed that dairy products were processed in these ceramic vessels. And the nature of the sieves, close in shape to modern cheese-strainers, provides compelling evidence that these specialised vessels have been used for cheese-making. Before the study, milk residues had been detected in early sites in north-western Anatolia (8,000 years ago) and in Libya (nearly 7,000 years ago). However, it had been impossible to detect if the milk was processed to cheese products. Researchers from the Organic Geochemistry Unit at the University of Bristol, together with colleagues from the U.S. and Poland studied unglazed pottery from the region of Kuyavia dating from around 7,000 years ago. Researchers examined preserved fatty acids trapped in the fabric of the pottery and showed that the sieves had indeed been used for processing dairy products. Milk residues were also detected in non-perforated bowls, which may have been used with the sieves. The pit where the cheese traces were found: Far from coming from regions like Somerset in Britain and Brie in France that are famous today for their cheeses, the earliest vintage comes from the Polish region of Kuyavia . The processing of milk and particularly the production of cheese were critical in early agricultural societies as it allowed the preservation of milk in a non-perishable and transportable form and it made milk a more digestible commodity for early prehistoric farmers. Milanie Salque, a PhD student from the University of Bristol and one of the authors of the paper, said: 'Before this study, it was not clear that cattle were used for their milk in Northern Europe around 7,000 years ago. 'However, the presence of the sieves in the ceramic assemblage of the sites was thought to be a proof that milk and even cheese was produced at these sites. 'Of course, these sieves could have been used for straining all sorts of things, such as curds from whey, meat from stock or honeycombs from honey. Detective work: By analysing fatty acids extracted from . unglazed pottery pierced with small holes found there, the researchers showed that dairy products were . processed in these ceramic vessels . 'We decided to test the cheese-making hypothesis by analysing the lipids trapped into the ceramic fabric of the sieves. 'The presence of milk residues in sieves (which look like modern cheese-strainers) constitutes the earliest direct evidence for cheese-making.' The leader of the Bristol team, Professor Richard Evershed, added: 'It is truly remarkable the depth of insights into ancient human diet and food processing technologies these ancient fats preserved in archaeological ceramics are now providing us with.' The findings were published in the journal Nature.","Earliest cheeses dating back to 5000BC found in Polish region of Kuyavia .

An 'extremely rare' Iron Age helmet that was later used as a vessel to hold human remains following a . cremation has been discovered. The British Museum revealed the helmet, that resembles those worn by German troops in the Second World War, was unearthed by a metal-detectorist near Canterbury, Kent, . last month. A brooch found with the helmet is thought to have once fastened a bag containing human bones. The . person who owned the helmet, possibly a British mercenary, may have . fought against the Romans in Gaul (now France) or alongside them, . eventually bringing the object to Britain. Spoil of war? The rare late Iron Age helmet found near Canterbury, Kent. Experts say it may have belonged to a mercenary who fought in France and eventually brought it back to this country . The British Museum's curator of Iron Age objects Julia Farley said: 'This is a very rare find. 'No . other cremation has ever been found in Kent accompanied by a helmet and . only a handful of Iron Age helmets are known from Britain. 'Therefore . we think this example was probably made on the continent and it is . fascinating to speculate how it came to be in a grave in Kent.' The museum also revealed metal-detectorists have also found a boar mount, which could have belonged to Richard III, and a Viking hoard. The . copper-alloy mount, which shows a boar, chained, collared and wearing a . crown, with a crescent above one of its legs was found on the Thames . foreshore, near the Tower of London. The news comes as tests take place on a skeleton that was found in September underneath a Leicester car park, to discover whether it was Richard III. The boar mount associated with Richard III found on the Thames foreshore: Experts believe it might have decorated an item of leather once owned by his supporters, or possibly even the king himself . The second largest hoard of Roman gold coins ever found in Britain: The finds were announced today at the launch of the Portable Antiquities and Treasure annual reports at the British Museum . He took the white boar as his emblem, while badges in the form of the animal were ordered for the king's cremation in 1485. It is not know where the mount, found in October, came from but experts believe it might have decorated an item of leather once owned by his supporters, or possibly even the king himself. 'Given the renewed interest in Richard III, after the apparent discovery of his remains in Leicestershire, it is wonderful to have a London find associated with the king,' said Michael Lewis, deputy head of the British Museum's department of Portable Antiquities and Treasure . Archaeologists in September announced they had unearthed what appear to be the remains of Richard III, which have been lost for 527 years. Using historic maps, they traced a friary where he was rumoured to have been buried after being killed in battle – underneath a social services department car park in Leicester. And after only three weeks of digging, they found the skeleton of an adult male who was well-built and clearly of noble descent. His injuries – a metal arrowhead embedded in his back, and a severe blow to the head – are consistent with reports of his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Even more persuasive is the fact that the man has a severely curved spine; Richard was famously nicknamed Crookback. Richard III, the last of the Plantagenet kings, ruled for only two years before dying in battle aged 32. It marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the victory of Henry Tudor, the first of the new dynasty. Experts stressed that the remains must be subjected to rigorous DNA testing, currently underway, to be sure if it is him. But lead archaeologist Richard Buckley said: 'I'd be very surprised if someone else was buried at this same spot with critical injuries.' 'The mount is very similar to a number . of boar badges which have been reported Treasure over the past few . years, which were made for followers of Richard III (of York), as Duke . of Gloucester, during the Wars of the Roses. 'Richard took the white boar as his sign. 'Bore' may have also been an anagram of Ebor, the Latin for York.' A hoard of Viking Age gold and silver metalwork were also discovered in May, on farmland near Bedale, north Yorkshire. The hoard consists of an iron sword pommel inlaid with gold foil plaques, four gold hoops from the hilt of the sword, six small gold rivets, four silver collars and neck-rings, a silver arm-ring, a silver ring fragment, a silver brooch, and 29 silver ingots. The hoard, thought to be Viking bullion, obtained in trade or plundered from enemies, was discovered by metal detectorists Stuart Campbell and Steve Caswell, who work in the animal feed business. Whoever buried the material would have intended to come back for it, to exchange or melt it down and reuse for jewellery. At the time when the hoard was deposited the north of England was largely under Viking rule and some of the objects are decorated in late Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Scandinavian and Viking art styles. The finds were announced today at the launch of the Portable Antiquities and Treasure annual reports at the British Museum. It was announced earlier this year that a metal-detectorist near St Albans, Hertfordshre had discovered the second-largest hoard of Roman gold ever found in Britain. Some 97,509 finds were recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme in 2011, an 8 per cent rise on the previous year. Under the Treasure Act 1996, finders have a legal obligation to report all finds of potential treasure to the local coroner.","Recent finds announced by experts from the British Museum in London .

Microsoft will release the Pro version of its Surface tablet on February 9 with a price tag of £630 - making it the most expensive tablet computer in the world. The North America launch marks a new phase in Microsoft's global battle against arch-rival Apple, which sells its top of the range iPads £108 cheaper. The new Surface Windows 8 Pro is powered by an Intel chip and can use the full version of Windows 8 - meaning programs such as Photoshop can be used. The updated tablet is set to hit U.S. and Canadian shops on February 9, with a starting price of US$899 (£568) for a 64GB version, and $999 (£630) for the 128GB . version. This compares to $829 for Apple's top 64GB iPad - it does not make an equivalent with 128GB. Beefed up: Microsoft's new Surface Pro, which comes with a laptop-style Intel processor, runs the full version of Windows 8 and can use fully featured Windows software like Photoshop and Microsoft Office . However, it still lacks mobile network connectivity, meaning that users will have to be within range of a WiFi network to access the internet on the device. The Surface Pro will come packaged with the Surface Pen, which allows users to write or draw on the device, but will not include the Soft Cover Keyboard, which will set users back a further $129 (£82). Prices for Britain, which would include VAT, have not been released. Add the extra keyboard and, since it is able to run Windows software like Photoshop, Microsoft Office and even resource-hungry video games, the Intel Core i5-powered tablet could easily be a fully featured laptop replacement. Its ARM chip-powered little brother runs Windows RT, a slimmed down version of the operating system, and only works with apps bought on the Windows store and a modified version of Office that Microsoft includes with the device. The pro version of Surface does not come with Office installed. 'Surface Windows 8 Pro provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package,' Microsoft said in a release. 'Perfect as your one device — at home, in the office, or on the road — it can run Windows 8 applications, as well as current Windows 7 desktop applications.' Laptop replacement: Microsoft say the Surface Pro offers the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet-shaped package - although the keyboard is not included as standard . Panos Panay, general manager of Microsoft's Surface division, added in a blog post: 'Whether you’re a road warrior, a student or someone who just wants a flexible and powerful Intel PC, the Surface Windows 8 Pro will deliver. 'It’s the perfect complement to the Surface Windows RT and delivers hours and hours of entertainment with plenty of power and productivity to get your work done as well.' At its launch, two versions of the Surface Pro will be available. The $899 version will come with 64GB of solid-state storage, while a 128GB version will set buyers back a rather steep $999. Intuitive interface: The Surface Pro comes packaged with the Surface Pen, which allows users to write or draw on the device. Combined with Windows software like Photoshop it has exciting potential . As well as the x86-type Intel processor, the Surface Pro comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and a sparkling 1920x1080 high-definition display, compared to the Surface RT's 1366x768 screen resolution. The screen also supports 10-point multi-touch, double what its little brother can offer. However, because of the power demands of i5 chip it also has a shorter battery life, managing closer to five hours against the ten hours more typical for rival tablets. It's also a little bit heavier than the earlier version, at 2lbs rather than 1.5lbs. In the same release yesterday, . Microsoft announced it will make available three new limited edition .

Tory Cabinet Minister Iain Duncan Smith has risked a diplomatic row by predicting that French immigrants will pour into Britain if a socialist president is elected today. The Work and Pensions Secretary warned that Left-wing candidate Francois Hollande’s high tax policies would drive hard-pressed French taxpayers across the Channel. Mr Hollande, favourite to beat French President Nicolas Sarkozy in today’s final round of the presidential election, has pledged to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent. Slim hope: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, was just four points away his rival Francoise Hollande in the final opinion poll . But former Tory leader Mr Duncan Smith . said: ‘If Hollande comes in now to spend huge amounts of money, raising . it from taxpayers, he will put a further burden on the taxpayers of . France. ‘London is already one of the largest . French cities in Europe and I think an awful lot of French people will . want to come to London.’ The capital is often referred to as . France’s sixth city due to its huge expatriate population, including . more than 70,000 French voters who were courted by Mr Hollande on a . campaign trip in February. Warning: Iain Duncan Smith believes French presidential candidate Francoise Holland would 'put a further burden' on French taxpayers if voted in . Estate agents in London are already reporting increased interest in properties from French clients. Mr Duncan Smith also seized on Mr . Hollande’s desire to promote spending over austerity and renegotiate the . Brussels pact imposing budget discipline on eurozone countries. He said: ‘Francois Hollande says he’s . going to come out and spend money. He’s going to raise tax and do . everything he says that will suddenly change the French economy. ‘That will have a shockwave effect in . Europe. It could cause major ructions with Germany, and the European . Central Bank could find itself in difficulty.’ Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention comes . amid suggestions that David Cameron will have to build bridges with Mr . Hollande, if he wins, after failing to meet him during a campaign trip . to London. Ahead of today’s contest, all polls . suggested Mr Hollande, a self-proclaimed ‘enemy of finance’, is set to . beat Right-wing rival Mr Sarkozy. The latest poll showed the socialist’s . lead narrowing at 52-48, but those four points would be enough to see . the 57-year-old become France’s first socialist head of state for 17 . years. Mr Sarkozy has said Mr Hollande ‘would . lead France to bankruptcy’ and branded him ‘a liar’ during a live TV . debate last week. In return, Mr Hollande has portrayed the President as . an increasingly extreme Right-wing opportunist who is interested only in . looking after the rich. Mr Sarkozy, also 57, was today at the Paris . home of his wife, Carla Bruni, with their six-month-old baby, Giulia. Close: Mr Hollande, pictured visiting a street market in Tulle with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, is tipped to be the first Socialist leader in two decades after 46million people cast their vote today . Hope: Mr Hollande is greeted by a florist as he visits a street market in Tulle, where he served as mayor . Nervous: Mr Hollande said he was anxious for victory as he wandered though the market . Popular: A cheese seller greets Mr Hollande in the town where he is popular . Mr Hollande, meanwhile, was in his . constituency, Tulle, central France, with his girlfriend, Valerie . Trierweiler. She will become the first unmarried Premiere Dame in French . history if Mr Hollande is elected. Mr Hollande won the first round of the . election two weekends ago, with 28.63 per cent of the votes compared . with 27.18 per cent for Mr Sarkozy. Voting begins: French citizens living in Canada arrive to vote Saturday at a polling station in Montreal. Polling stations in France opened this morning . Eager: A queue for the polling station in Montreal, which has the largest French population in North America, with 44,000 registered voters . Overseas effort: A French citizen living in Uruguay votes at the French consulate in Montevideo. French citizens living in the UK will have the chance to vote today in London and Edinburgh . International presence: A woman leaves a polling station in Remire-Montjoly, French Guyana . Since then, Mr Sarkozy has desperately . been trying to win over six million voters who backed far right . National Front candidate Marine Le Pen. At his last rally on Friday in the . southern city of Toulon, Mr Sarkozy repeated his view that there are . ‘too many immigrants in France’ and that ‘integration was not working’. Mr Hollande said he wanted a big win so his Left-wing programme would have a clear mandate. Support: President Nicolas Sarkozy greets supporters as he leaves his last campaign rally in Les Sables-d'Olonne, western France, on Friday . He added: ‘If the French people must . make a choice, they should do so clearly, overwhelmingly, so the winner . has the capacity and means to act.’ Mr Sarkozy, who became the first . sitting president of modern times to finish second in a presidential . first round vote, must overcome high disapproval rates because of his . abrasive style. If he did win, it would be a political . sensation after a whirlwind campaign by the man many voters blame for . stubbornly high unemployment, running at a 12-year high of nearly 10 per . cent, and France's stagnant economy. Mr Sarkozy was due to spend today at . home in Paris with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, while Mr . Hollande visited a market in Tulle, the town in central France where he . was mayor for seven years.

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was willing to travel to Portugal to see first hand how the 'depenalisation' of drugs has worked in practice . Ministers are to examine Portugese laws to ‘depenalise’ drugs after a damning report said the government’s current strategy is not working. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was ready to visit Portugal to see first hand how the removal of criminal penalties for people caught with small amounts of drugs could help tackle the problem in the UK. He insisted the government was ‘open to new ways of thinking’ after the Commons home affairs select committee asked for a royal commission to examine . whether possession of drugs – even heroin and crack – should cease to be . a criminal offence. The committee said it was 'impressed' by the Portugese system and 'alternative strategies should now be considered'. Mr Browne said today: 'There are interesting new ideas. The report says we should look more carefully at the model that’s happened in Portugal. 'I’m certainly happy to go to Portugal as the report recommends and see what they’re doing there. So we should be open to new ideas and fresh thinking but we should also acknowledge that we’ve made a lot of progress in the last five or ten years.' Mental health campaigners warned the link between cannabis and mental health should not be ignored. But the committee said was clear from other countries that the British approach was not working, and alternative strategies - such as those developed in Portugal - should now be considered. 'We were impressed by what we saw of the Portuguese depenalised system. It had clearly reduced public concern about drug use in that country, and was supported by all political parties and the police,' it said. 'Although it is not certain that the Portuguese experience could be replicated in the UK, given societal differences, we believe this is a model that merits significantly closer consideration.' Ministers should, it said, open discussions with the United Nations Commission on Drugs on new ways tackle what it called the 'global drugs dilemma' - including 'the possibility of legalisation and regulation'. Legalise it: Some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit Britain whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs . However Mr Browne said so-called legal highs now posed a 'mutating threat' after an 'explosion' in their use in recent years. 'We have a growing problem with the . drugs that are legal, so called legal highs and we have a diminishing . problem with drugs that are illegal like heroin and crack cocaine. So I . don’t think that it automatically follows that making drugs legal . reduces harm.' Mr Browne was forced to repeatedly deny the report would be shelved, as a senior Tory appeared to back a major . shift in drugs law by suggesting legal bans should be . replaced by education for users. On Twitter, Michael Fabricant, who is a Tory party vice-chairman, wrote: ‘Have often said: Prohibition in US didn’t work. Created crime & black market. Home Affairs Committee is right to ask if drug prohibition works. ‘If we spent the money on educating people that drugs are dangerous instead of attempting & failing to ban them, I suspect more effective.’ The committee’s conclusions were undermined however by detailed minutes of its meetings that showed three of its five Tory members voted against the recommendation to call for a royal commission. Drug support: Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant, pictured at a 2008 protest, said money is better spent on education about the dangers of drugs than enforcing bans . The panel also split evenly on whether cannabis should be given a lower classification. That recommendation was included on the casting vote of the chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz. The report sparked fury among drugs campaigners – and ministers immediately ruled out major changes to the law. Mary Brett, of the charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘A royal commission would cost the earth, and we do not need it to tell us what we already know: legalisation would open the floodgates and drug use would increase. It will also do nothing to help Colombia.’ Marjorie Wallace, of Sane, a mental health charity, said: ‘If the report is to be responsible, it must take account of the specific damage that cannabis can do to the developing brain. ‘Not only because recent studies have shown it inducing irreversible cognitive deterioration but in around 10 per cent of cases triggering severe psychotic illness.’ The MPs took evidence from comedian and former heroin addict Russell Brand, who said drug bans didn’t work, and Sir Richard Branson who said the sale of drugs should be permitted and taxed. They visited Colombia to see the effects of the drugs trade, and met the country’s president. The report said the MPs ‘recognise and sympathise with the immense suffering and slaying of innocent people which tragically has taken place over the years in Colombia and other Latin American countries, as a result of the murderous rivalry between drug gangs.’ The MPs called for cannabis to be reclassified as a Class C drug from Class B. The report also claims the lack of a ban on cigarettes and alcohol can send a ‘confusing message’ to drug users. A Government spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis. A royal commission on drugs is simply not necessary.’","Home Affairs select committee says government strategy is not working .

An Illinois man who was shot and wounded after he walked into a police station and pulled out a BB gun early this morning claimed he was dying of cancer and wanted officers to kill him because he 'couldn't do the deed' himself. Howard R. Lazarus, 53, entered the Vernon Hills station just after midnight and told officers he wanted to file a report regarding an accident he'd been involved in. But when an policeman walked into the lobby to talk to him, he pulled out an apparent 9mm handgun, refused orders to drop it, and moved toward the officer. The officer responded by firing two rounds, hitting Lazarus in the abdomen and shattering two glass doors in the station's lobby. The gun was later found to be a replica and a suicide note recovered from Lazarus' pocket revealed he had wanted officers to end his life, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'I apologize for placing your officers in this position,' he wrote in the note. 'I am dying from cancer and couldn't do the deed myself.' Lazarus was taken to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville where he remains in fair condition. He has been charged with aggravated assault, a Class 4 felony. According to police, Lazarus told the . officer that he had been in an accident in nearby Mundelein, where he lives, before pulling the gun from his pocket.

She said the officer tried to negotiate with Lazarus but had no choice other than to fire when the man pulled back the slide on the weapon. 'The suspect made moves to actually fire the weapon and the officer had no choice,' she said. The officer, a 14-year-veteran, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, according to the Daily Herald.

'Becoming a vegan gave me another opportunity to live a healthy life,' Tyson told ABC. New leaf: Mike Tyson, pictured here in 2007 (left) and earlier this year (right) has raved about the health benefits of a vegan diet . 'I was so congested from all the drugs and bad cocaine, I could hardly . breathe'. But Tyson's health . overhaul seemed to be as much about clean living as clean eating. He told The Today Show that he adopted the diet after 'too many . prison cells, too many jails, too many lawsuits, too many bankruptcies, . too many women, too many venereal diseases, too many everything.

Former president Bill Clinton was one of the first high-profile public figures to do a 180-degree turn from omnivore to plant-eater. He made . headlines in 2011 after a second heart health scare prompted him . to replace beef with broccoli. 'A vegan diet saved my life,' he . said at the time, adding that he was enjoying eating veggies, fruits and . beans and didn't miss fast food. Clinton's healthier eating was an inspiration to Reverend Al Sharpton, who also cut out meat and lost 50 pounds. Healthy and happy: Both Bill Clinton (left) and Alec Baldwin (right, pictured with daughter Ireland and wife Hilaria) had health scares that led to changes in diet . Alec Baldwin stopped eating meat and narrated a video for Peta called 'Meet Your Meat' in 2009.

Dozens of Instagram and Facebook users have been left frustrated and alarmed after both sites locked them out of their accounts this week and demanded copies of Government-approved ID to allow them to regain access. Online comment threads were inundated with questions from concerned users on Tuesday who thought the approach was a phishing scam, CNET reported. However, yesterday it was confirmed the request was official and users would need to follow the strict instructions in order to get their accounts reactivated. ID grab: Facebook and Instagram have angered users this week by demanding they send in copies of their government ID. Under fire: Users have hit out at heavy-handed security tactics employed by Instagram and parent company Facebook this week. Dozens of users were locked out of their accounts and had to provide official ID . Facebook, which is the parent company of photo-feed site Instagram, said the request was within their rights and would have been sent out due to a suspected violation of their terms of service by the account user. A spokesman for Facebook told Talking Points Memo: 'This is just a general practice for both Facebook and Instagram to request photo IDs for verification purposes depending on what type of violation may have occurred.' Facebook's terms of service guards against suspected fake accounts while both sites threaten to bar users thought to be under the age of 13 or who harass others amongst other conditions. Facebook wouldn't comment on the specific violations taking place this week and also failed to explain why so many notifications seemed to have taken place in one go. Instagram updated its terms of service . on January 19 which could account for the sudden number of accounts . being disabled there, according to TPM. 'We reserve the right to modify or . terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, . without notice, at any time, and without liability to you,' the new . terms state. Other instances of requests for official ID from Facebook date back to 2010. To the frustration of many users . disrupted this week not all IDs were being accepted, with both sites . sending follow up emails requiring more documentation. The email said ID must include 'your . full name and date of birth' and without a Government ID users would . need to upload a copy of a photo ID from a company or university plus a . copy of their birth certificate. ID request: Users of photo-feed website Instagram received this message this week - causing many users to fear they had been hacked . Notice: Facebook users received this message. Many expressed frustration that their ID was not accepted or that it took days for Facebook to respond . Demanding: Facebook and Instagram say they need official government ID, like a passport or driving licence, or users need to submit a photo ID plus a copy of their birth certificate . Some users who have been targeted said they were later told by Facebook that it had made a mistake or have been left waiting days without access to their account or response to their emails. One user wrote: 'I was a bit wary about sending such confidential information on the Internet, but ended up sending an ID...About 8 hours later, I received an e-mail from a person addressing themselves as ""Frank"" from the Facebook Team, telling me that after investigating my case further, they came to the conclusion that my Facebook was restricted for NO REASON, and the service has made a mistake.' Another user wrote on Yahoo Questions: 'The EXACT same thing is happening to me and TONS of other people, we're not alone...For Facebook this has been an issue going on for a couple years but for Instagram, it's pretty recent and I'm going to wait to turn in my ID for them, tons of people are complaining and they better do something about it.' Another added: 'I have also been locked out of both Facebook and Instagram ... with no explanation and no status update. I uploaded my Id but I don't get a response back.

"By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 03:15 EST, 3 February 2012 . Patients admitted to hospitals at weekends are far more likely to die than those taken there on weekdays, a major study has confirmed. Chances of recovery are jeopardised because senior doctors are absent and tests and scans are not immediately available. A study of over 14million NHS admissions found that Sunday patients are 16 per cent more likely to die within the next 30 days than those brought in on a Wednesday. Worrying: Patients admitted to hospitals at weekends are far more likely to die than those taken there on weekdays, a major study has confirmed . Patients admitted on a Saturday are 11 per cent more likely to die in 30 days. Alarmingly, the researchers warned that patients who go to hospital at weekends tend to be sicker – making it crucial that they receive the highest standard of medical attention. This is due to a higher number of road accidents, drink-related injuries and poor out-of-hours GP care that means patients’ deteriorate while treatment is delayed. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ordered a ‘fundamental rethink’ of how hospitals are run at weekends. Responding to this study Mr Lansley said: ‘It is unacceptable that patients admitted to hospital on a Saturday or Sunday stay longer and have worse results. ‘Much of the rest of the country continues to be open for the public’s needs at weekends – an NHS that revolves around patients should be the same. ‘By opening some services seven days a . week, more patients will get the care and treatment that they need when . they need it. In some parts of the NHS, this is already happening. Concerned: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said it is unacceptable that patients admitted to hospital on a Saturday or Sunday stay longer and have worse results . 'On Saturdays and sometimes Sundays, some services have scanners open to provide tests, are doing operations, and have more senior staff around.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The NHS exists to ensure that its users are given the best possible care, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is simply not acceptable for somebody to face an increased risk of death just because they were unfortunate enough to suffer an injury or get sick on a Saturday or Sunday as opposed to any other day of the week.’ Researchers from University College London – whose work was commissioned by the Department of Health – looked at 14.2million hospital admissions in 2009/10. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the researchers concluded: ‘There may be aspects of care associated with weekend admissions which disadvantage patients. ‘Some urgent conditions require prompt treatment and in some cases the way weekend care is organised may lead to delays which can adversely affect the outcome.’ The study backs up a report in November by Dr Foster Intelligence linking a higher death rate at weekends with poorer staff levels. Most consultants tend to work office hours and at weekends the wards are left in the hands of junior doctors. In addition, departments responsible for certain scans and blood tests are shut until Monday. The researchers pointed out that patients admitted at weekends may be more seriously ill. Some who become seriously ill on Friday try and hang on until Monday, during which time they deteriorate further and end up needing urgent treatment. There are also more injuries from road accidents, alcohol and self-harming at weekends. Dr Andrew Goddard, of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘This study is further evidence that patients admitted at weekends are more likely to die following admission than patients admitted to hospital during the week. ‘There are many reasons for this, but the two most important are that the patients are more ill and there are fewer doctors available.’ David Stout, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation said: ‘There is no doubt that this is something the NHS has to improve. 'Patients should never have to worry about what is the ""right"" time to visit their local hospital.’","Chances of recovery are jeopardised because senior doctors are absent and tests are not always available .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:54 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:12 EST, 1 May 2012 . A Sikh advocacy group launched a free mobile application on Monday that allows travelers to complain immediately to the government if they feel they've been treated unfairly by airport screeners. Launched at midnight on Monday by The Sikh Coalition, the FlyRights app had fielded two complaints by 10am the same day. The first complaint came from a woman who said she felt mistreated after she disclosed to a screener that she was carrying breast milk. Hi-tech: Launched at midnight on Monday by The Sikh Coalition, the FlyRights app had fielded two complaints by 10am EDT the same day . A Sikh man filed the second complaint, saying he was subjected to extra security even though he had not set off any alarms. The woman's complaint was based on gender and the man's on religion, said coalition program director Amardeep Singh. Singh said the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration were notified of the app before its launch. The agencies agreed to allow the app to use the agencies' system for submitting the complaints. TSA said in a statement that it does not profile passengers on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion and is continually working with communities, including The Sikh Coalition, 'to help us understand unique passenger concerns.' The agency said it supports 'efforts to gather passenger feedback about the screening process.' Pat-down: The app is intended for everyone who feels they are racially profiled or subjected to other unfair treatment by the TSA . The app, available for iPhone and . Android phones, was conceived in response to complaints from Sikhs in . the U.S, who since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks are . routinely subjected to additional inspection, Singh said. Some are made . to remove their turbans, which Sikhs wear for religious reasons, Singh . said. The app is . intended for everyone who feels they are racially profiled or subjected . to other unfair treatment. It is also intended to provide better data on . how often such incidents occur. In light of the shooting of Trayvon Martin, immigration laws in Alabama and Arizona, and the anniversary of the Rodney King trial, 'it has never been more readily apparent how the practice of racial profiling impacts all Americans,' said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The conference helped launch the app. After completing screening, a person can go to the app and click on the 'report' button. The app will automatically fill in the person's name, phone number and email address. The app asks questions such as race and name of airport, as well as the basis of the complaint, such as religion or gender. It has 'submit' and 'share' buttons to post on social media that a complaint was filed. The app also contains information on rights of passengers and TSA procedures. The Sikh Coalition gets hundreds of complaints of unfair treatment and profiling, Singh said. By contrast, he said, the Department of Homeland Security said in its last report to Congress on civil rights and civil liberties that 11 people in the U.S. submitted complaints in the first six month of 2011. 'My hope is that this app will exponentially increase the number of complaints filed with the TSA, flood the system so they get that this is a problem. For too long the Transportation Security Administration has been able to tell Congress this is not an issue, nobody's complaining,' Singh said. Passengers can ask to speak to supervisors or customer support managers at an airport, contact the TSA Contact Center, submit feedback through 'Talk-to-TSA' online or file a civil rights complaint through its website, the agency said. Prabhjit Singh, a motivational speaker, said he has been profiled 30 times, starting in February 2007 when he was taking an early morning flight from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport to Alabama. In that incident, he was told he had to go through a mandatory pat-down of his turban, even though he had not set off the detector. But after asking for information on the TSA policy, a supervisor told him he could not fly, he said. 'Out of those 30 incidents, I have not yet been able to take myself and write down all the information I needed to and been able to convey that to the Sikh Coalition. This app will allow me to do that,' said Prabhjit Singh, who is not related to Amardeep Singh. 'When I sat down on that airplane, after that experience, I looked around at everybody else ... and I thought, they did not have to go through what I had to go through to get on this airplane,' he said.","FlyRights conceived in response to complaints about racial profiling and unfair treatment .

A homeless man in Kansas City, Missouri is facing a windfall of more than $100,000 for his kindness after he returned a diamond engagement ring to its rightful owner, which she had accidentally dropped into his donation cup. Billy Ray Harris, who is homeless and often sleeps under a bridge, was shocked to find that a diamond ring had been dropped in his collection cup while begging last Friday. ‘The ring was so big I knew if it was real it had to be expensive,’ he told KCTV. Rather than pawn it, Harris had a hunch that the owner would return for it and so he stored it in a safe place. Human kindness: Billy Ray Harris returned a diamond engagement ring to owner Sarah Darling after she mistakenly dropped it in his collection cup . Darling had put her engagement ring in her purse for safekeeping, but then emptied the contents into Harris' collection cup . The ring belonged to Sarah Darling, who was devastated the next day when she realized she had lost it. ‘It was horrible. It was such a feeling of loss,’ said Darling. ‘It meant so much to me beyond just the financial value.’ Darling rarely takes the ring off, but that day had put it in her purse for safe keeping after she had developed a slight rash on her finger. She went back to look for Harris on the Saturday, but couldn’t find him. She tried again the next day and fortunately he was in the same spot. ‘I asked him ... “I don't know if you remember me, but I think I gave you something that's very precious to me,” and he says, “Was it a ring? Yeah, I have it, I kept it for you,'"" said Darling. She described finding the ring again as a miracle. Billy Ray Harris, who is homeless and often sleeps under a bridge, was shocked to find the ring had been dropped in his collection cup while begging last Friday . To show their appreciation, Darling and her husband set up an online fundraising page on giveforward.com for Harris. So far more than 3,800 donations have been made, totaling over $100,000. The money will be given to Harris at the end of a 90-day campaign. ‘In life what goes around comes around... Billy - your sweet actions, despite being in dire straits yourself, prove that there is humility in the world... you are one shining example. Lots of love from across the pond,’ wrote Chris and Mel, from Brentwood, England, who gave $20. ‘Several years ago, my mother's ring was stolen from my house. To this day, I recall the empty feeling in the pit of my stomach. Hopefully, your honest example will encourage others to pay it forward. Kudos to you, Billy Ray!’ wrote Tero Sturges who gave $10. Darling and husband Bill Krejci who set up the fundraising page for Harris and who is helping him to open a bank account . ‘Mr. Harris, Thank you for being a model of honesty for others. You are obviously a decent man. I am sorry that you have had to live under a bridge,’ wrote Robert in Miami, who gave $20. The response has been described as ‘unreal’ by Darling's husband Bill Krejci, who posted an update the site on Saturday. Krejci said he had met with Harris to tell him about the flood of donations and to get to know him better. They went together to make some repairs to Harris' bike. 'We talked about a lot of things related to my family's ring and the many donations. We talked about one day in the future the ring may one day be passed down to my daughter,' Krejci wrote on the website. 'We talked about how insanely positive all this has been.'

Darling has said she is just grateful that Harris was so honest as many others might have kept the ring or sold it. 'I actually feel like I'm especially lucky to have this ring now.

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 20:08 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:10 EST, 27 October 2012 . Police forces across Britain are being forced to deal with petty squabbles on Facebook, Twitter and other social network sites every day when  they could be tackling more serious crimes. Officers say they are wasting valuable time and resources tackling internet users directing abuse at each other. In most cases, police simply tell victims to delete their tormentors from their networks, but the Crown Prosecution Service says a ‘few dozen’ more serious incidents have led to court, with the figure growing rapidly in recent months. Internet trolls made sick comments about pop singer Adele’s baby boy within hours of his birth, and Tom Daley and  diving partner Peter Waterfield were called ‘team HIV’ on Twitter by Welsh Premier League footballer Daniel Thomas, who was arrested but escaped prosecution because the duo did not press charges . New figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that at least three arrests are being made every day for sending offensive messages via phones and computers, including  people harassing ex-partners by text message and making hoax threats as well as comments on social media. An officer from Essex who asked not to be named said: ‘I dread to think how many hours are spent on Facebook jobs. If you don’t do at least one a day it’s been a very quiet day.’ He told how one man repeatedly called to claim that his ex-girlfriend was setting up fake accounts pretending to be him on Facebook, which has 900 million members worldwide. Attacked: Teenager Kara Wright was attacked by 3,000 trolls from across the world and called a ¿whore¿ and a ¿disgrace to women and her family¿ after she posted a mildly titillating picture of herself on Facebook. Some users said she deserved to die. When officers told the man  to simply stop using Facebook,  he replied: ‘But then I can’t see what they are saying about me.’ A young woman told police in Dorset she had received death threats on Facebook. But when officers investigated, they found she had actually threatened to spread malicious rumours about another woman, who had replied: ‘I hope you die then.’ An officer from the West Midlands told how he had advised someone complaining of Facebook abuse to ‘unfriend’ their abuser, only to be told: ‘But I won’t have as many friends.’ Others expected police to have a ‘magic wand’ allowing them to access all Facebook accounts and find out who was behind offensive messages. An officer from North Wales said: ‘You will always have one or two serious incidents of  harassment and bullying on Facebook and the like but for the most part it’s petty stuff. It takes up a lot of time and the normal result is advice from us to all parties to grow up.’ Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘We have concerns that we don’t have the resources to police everything that’s said on the internet. We can’t have people getting upset in a one-off situation and involving the police. I do think this could be the thin end of the wedge. If we show too much willingness and get involved in every squabble, we’re setting ourselves up to keep doing this because it will be expected.’ He said it was right for police to investigate cases involving homophobia or racism, but added: ‘We shouldn’t be dealing with individual squabbles.’ Storm after Rio retweets: Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand retweeted a message from a fan that referred to Chelsea¿s Ashley Cole as a ¿choc ice¿ ¿ a derogatory term meaning a person is black on the outside and white on the inside . The laws most commonly used to prosecute anyone who posts offensive material online, or ‘trolls’ who goad public figures and victims’ relatives, make it illegal to send a grossly offensive or obscene message using an electronic network, and apply even if it is sent privately to only one person or just repeats what another has said. Statistics from 22 out of the  43 police forces in England and Wales show there were at least 4,098 arrests under the relevant laws between the start of 2009 and the middle of 2012, averaging three a day. More than 2,000 people were either charged or given an out-of-court fine or caution.","Statistics from 22 out of the 43 police .
