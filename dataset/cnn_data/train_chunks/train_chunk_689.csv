Violent: Michael Bennison, 28, who stabbed ex-girlfriend Amy Evans six times in a terrifying daylight attack in York, could be released in 12 months . A man found guilty of a frenzied knife attack on his ex-girlfriend could be freed in months after investigators lost vital evidence which could have convicted him of attempted murder. Michael Bennison, 29, could have faced life behind bars after stabbing the woman once in her side and five times in a broad daylight attack on a street in York. But the charge of attempted murder would not stick after forensic teams misplaced DNA evidence from two knives. As a result prosecutors were forced to accept the 28-year-old's plea to a lesser charge of unlawful wounding, which carries a maximum sentence of just five years. Newcastle Crown Court heard that on December 14 last year Bennison, of no fixed address, was travelling in a car in York with the female victim, Amy Evans, 27, and another man. Nick Adlington, prosecuting, said Bennison, of no fixed address had been in a volatile, on-off relationship with Miss Evans and an argument broke out in the car. When they arrived at their destination they got out and Miss Evans produced a knife. But Bennison took the knife from her and stabbed her six times, once in the side and five times in the back. He then ran off down an alleyway and went into hiding before he was found two days later. Describing how the evidence came to be lost by North Yorkshire Police, Mr Adlington said: 'The swabs went missing from the forensic science service in York. I have been told there has been a full internal review.' Mr Adlington said as well as the lost evidence, the attempted murder trial faced other problems, including the refusal of an expert witness to come to court. Jailing Bennison, who has previous convictions for domestic violence on different partners, for a total of four years, Mr Justice Bennison told him he posed a high risk to all women. After already spending a year behind bars on remand, Bennison could be eligible for parole within just 12 months. The judge said: 'Originally you faced a charge of attempted murder but because vital evidence had been lost a plea to section 20 was accepted. 'You pose a high risk of harm to the victim and to all women. There is clearly a significant risk to female members of the public. 'There was an intention to commit serious harm.' The sentence also included a guilty plea for assaulting a man outside a flat in November last year after they got into an argument over noise. After falling to the floor, the victim was kicked in the head by Bennison before he jumped with both feet onto his back. The court heard that he had 14 previous appearances at court for 27 offences, that included battery and affray. John Gregg, defending, said Bennison had 'wrestled with his own demons', which included drug abuse, but that he has made progress in prison.","Michael Bennison could have faced life in jail for stabbing his ex six times .

David Cameron is ‘clueless’ about the winter crisis facing the NHS, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed today. The two party leaders clashed over warnings that A&E departments across the country are already struggling to cope, with the number of patients waiting up to 12 hours on trolleys almost doubling in two years. Mr Miliband claimed the NHS ‘isn’t safe’ in Mr Cameron’s hands, and blamed the government’s reorganisation for diverting health funding to pay for six-figure pay-offs for managers. Clash: Labour party leader Ed Miliband tore into the government's record on the NHS, claiming David Cameron was 'clueless' about warnings of a new winter crisis . The latest figures from NHS England, the body in charge of the health service, show there were 87,186 trolley waits of between four and 12 hours from April to October 2013. This figure is up from 47,644 for the same period in 2011. And the numbers having to wait up to four hours in A&E - the Government’s target time - has increased by 43 per cent in two years. Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned this week: ‘All the worrying indicators are up already. And they seem to indicate that this winter will probably be worse than last winter, which was the worst we have ever had. It’s a tipping point for the NHS’s delivery of acute care. ‘It’s not chaos in emergency departments, but it is a crisis.’ At Prime Minister’s Questions today, Mr Miliband sought to pin the blame on Mr Cameron’s government for the NHS’s problems. Criticism: Mr Miliband condemned six-figure pay-offs for senior NHS managers at a time when the number of nurses had been cut . The Labour leader said: ‘What the whole country will have had heard today is a Prime Minister complacent about the A&E crisis, and clueless about what is actually happening in the NHS. ‘What the British people know is the NHS is heading into this winter with fewer nurses, a lack of senior A&E doctors and a shortage of beds. ‘He promised he’d protect the NHS, but it’s now clear the NHS isn’t safe in his hands.’ He claimed Mr Cameron had broken his promise not to ‘go back to the days when people had to wait for hours on end in A&E’. Mr Miliband added: ‘Across the medical profession they are saying there is a crisis in A&E departments and we have a Prime Minister saying “crisis, what crisis”. How out of touch can he be? ‘In the last year a million waited more than four hours in A&E. A&E waits are up, patients kept waiting on trollies up,  delayed discharges up, ambulance response times up.’ He blamed the coalition’s ‘top-down reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody voted for’. Warning: Accident and emergency units across the country are at 'tipping point', senior doctors have warned . Mr Miliband said 2,300 managers have received six-figure pay-offs, and 2,000 had ‘been fired, paid off, and then re-hired’. ‘He is giving P45s to nurses and six-figure pay-offs,’ the Labour leader added. been fired, paid off, and then re-hired? The numbers turning up at A&E departments has soared by more than a third during the past decade and last year there were 21.7 million arriving in need of help. But Mr Cameron insisted that that the number of NHS admisnitraos had been cut by 20,000. ‘We will do everything we can to make sure the NHS continues to perform in the excellent way that he does today.’ He said the average waiting time in A& is now 50 minutes, compared to 70 minutes under Labour. Mr Cameron contrasted the NHS in England under the coalition to Wales, where Labour is in power. ‘There won’t be a winter crisis in the NHS in Wales where Labour are in control because there is a crisis every day of the week in Wales,’ he said. ‘They have been running the Welsh health service, they have cut the budget by 8.5 per cent, they haven’t met a cancer target since 2008, they haven’t met an A&E target since 2009. ‘We are saving £4.5billion by reducing the number of managers in the NHS and for the first time anybody reemployed has to pay back part of the money they were given. That never happened under Labour.’","Leaders trade blows over claims A&E departments are struggling to cope .

Child killer Mark Bridger - convicted murderer of schoolgirl April Jones - has reportedly launched a bid for compensation after he was attacked in jail . Child killer Mark Bridger - convicted murderer of schoolgirl April Jones - has reportedly launched a bid for compensation after he was attacked in jail by another inmate. It has been revealed he could be paid as much as £15,000 after he was slashed with a razor. The parents of the murdered five-year-old look set to receive just £11,000 in compensation for their daughter's death. Juvinai Ferreira, 22, pleaded guilty to wounding Bridger, 47, with a makeshift knife in Wakefield Prison, in July. The Sun reports that Bridger has informed his lawyers he wants a payout for the 'emotional and physical distress' he suffered after the attack. He is not believed to have outlined a set amount, but similar cases have been awarded £15,000 in compensation. But April's parents Paul and Coral Jones can expect a maximum of £5,500 each for their own distress. Mrs Jones, 41, told the paper: 'It's disgusting that Bridger could get money after what he has done. Where's he going to spend it anyway?' Father-of-six Bridger snatched . April near her home in Machynlleth. He was given a whole-life tariff by a . judge in May at Mold Crown Court. The five-year-old's body has never . been found. A Prison Service spokeswoman said it 'robustly defends' all compensation claims from prisoners. Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old just months after Bridger was jailed for life for abducting and murdering April, in Machynlleth, Wales last year.

Juvinai Ferreira used a makeshift knife to attack the 47-year-old at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, in July . He was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched. Judge Batty told Ferreira he needed a pre-sentence report to assess his level of dangerousness and decide whether a second life term was appropriate. Ferreira was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court in 2009 of murdering Elaine Walpole in Dereham, Norfolk, in April 2008. At the time police said Ferreira moved to Dereham in 2007 with a relative after escaping civil war in Africa. He befriended 47-year-old Miss Walpole, an alcoholic who lived alone, after they met at a shop and she bought him cigarettes. Post-mortem tests showed that Miss Walpole, a former hotel worker who had three children, had been stabbed three times and bitten. Detectives and forensic experts spent nearly a year carrying out checks to show Ferreira was an adult as he said he was 16. Once it was proved he was an adult, Ferreira was given a life sentence and told he must serve at least 22 years before being considered for parole.","He could be paid as much as £15,000 after he was slashed by inmate .

A Czech family who abused Britain’s benefits system by flying in foreign nationals to fraudulently claim £750,000 have been jailed for 12 years. Julius Ziga, 34, his then partner . Magdalena Ferkova, 33, her sister Iveta, 32, their aunt Alena Lackova, . 39, and her husband Jan Lacko, 39, ran a two-year scam swindling the tax . credits system. The court heard Nottingham-based gang flew or drove vulnerable foreign nationals from Slovakia and the Czech Republic  people into . the UK where they had the right to work and claim benefits. Ringleaders: Julius Ziga, left, 34, and Magdalena Ferkova, right, 33, brought Czechs and Slovaks to claim child tax credits in Britain then continued collecting the cash after the foreigners returned to Eastern Europe . Also jailed: Iveta Ferkova, 32, left, and Jan Lacko, 39, right, were part of the gang which managed around 50 fraudulent child tax credit claims to pocket up to £33,000 a week, much of which was gambled away . Ziga . and his then partner Magdalena Ferkova led the fraud, with Ziga at . times driving to Eastern Europe to bring foreigners into the country via . the Channel Tunnel. Others were flown into the country by Ziga and housed at 14 addresses across Nottingham. The group . arranged housing and National Insurance numbers and even posed as . interpreters for the workers to help them open bank accounts and have interviews at job . centres. Once applications for tax credits and child benefits were processed the gang would send the foreign nationals home and then continue to collect the cash. In this way the they managed to access a steady supply of cash from the fraudulent bank accounts which used to fund life of luxury. Between January 2008 and April 14, . 2010, the four pocketed up to £33,000 a week, using the cash to gamble . in casinos as well as splash out on luxury cars, including a Mercedes . and BMW 5 series. Motley crew: Iveta Ferkova, Alena Lackova and Jan Lacko, pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court on Monday stole benefits worth £700,000 . Incriminating: A list found on Magdalena Ferkova when she was arrested where she had written out pin numbers and days of the week to draw out tax credit money from the gang's various accounts . Nottingham . Crown Court heard the gang managed around 50 false claims to steal . £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC - and would have gone on to steal a . further £500,000 had they not been caught. Sisters Iveta and Magdalena Ferkova were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations in September alongside their aunt Alena Lackova and her husband Jan Lacko. Ziga . who was Magdalena’s partner at the time, pleaded guilty to the same . conspiracy. They all denied having roles in the conspiracy but these claims were over-ruled by Judge James Sampson. Sentencing Iveta Ferkova to five years in prison he told her: 'You and your sister were both fully engaged in all aspects of this conspiracy, from first to last.' Lacko was given three years in prison and Alena Lackova was handed a two year suspended sentence on the same charge. Ziga was jailed for four years but Magdalena was not sentenced as the court was told she has fled the country in an effort to escape punishment. An international arrest warrant has been issued. CCTV footage of the HSBC in Arnold, Nottingham, shows Magdalena Ferkova with Julius Pesta: . The gang got National Insurance numbers for the workers and posed as . interpreters in interviews at banks and Jobcentres . All the jailed defendants have been recommended for deportation. Sentencing three members of the gang . to jail for a total of 12 years, Judge James Sampson told them: 'You . have all been convicted of conspiracy to defraud the HMRC. 'Beginning . in 2008 you four, together with Magdalena Ferkova and others, in effect . used by you, stole approximately £750,000 in tax credits by making and . managing some 50 or so false claims. 'You . are all related and you are all from the Czech Republic. You cynically, . greedily and dishonestly exploited the tax credit system by bringing to . this country friends and family. 'With . the connivance of these people who supplied their passports and birth . certificates for their children you claimed tax credits in their names. 'They . were then transported back while you managed their claims and bank . accounts in their names. You kept most of the money for yourselves, . sending some, a very limited amount, back to those claimants.' The judge added: 'This was fraudulent from the outset. It was well organised and the sums obtained were considerable.' The gang, including Elena Lackova and Jan Lacko, left, managed around 50 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC, using the cash to buy cars like the 5 Series BMW pictured left with Magdalena Ferkova . Prosecutor Luke Blackburn told the . court the fraud was uncovered 'by chance' when a boarder agency staff . stopped Ziga at random before he got on a Channel Tunnel train to . Europe. He added: 'When his . phone was analysed they found texts welcoming him to France and Germany . and in a Lidl bag found at an address was documents relating to flights . and trips to Europe. 'In that bag were many original documents, passports and forms relating to benefit claims. 'Ziga’s fingerprints were found on that bag and several articles in the bag. 'The Crown can never know exactly how much money was gambled away in cash. 'But we can say that both Magdalena Ferkova and Iveta Ferkova had active gambling habits. 'Some of the money was used with casino accounts, but we can never know how much was gambled in cash at the casinos. 'When . HMRC investigated the 14 addresses they found a total of 66 claims, 48 . were still outstanding, of which only four were found to be true claims. 'This . was a complex fraud, carried out by a professional organisation dealing . with the movement of people on and international scale. 'The close to the public purse is huge. The proceeds have all gone, either out of the country or gambled.' Innovative filing system: Paperwork is stashed in a microwave at a Nottingham home controlled by the gang . As the foursome were jailed family members who had packed the public gallery stormed out of the court room. Gary Lampon, assistant director of criminal investigation for HMRC, said after the case : 'This gang was extremely well organised and ruthless in their ambition to steal vast amounts of public money at the expense of the British taxpayer. 'They exploited the many individuals they lured to the UK from abroad with the promise of legal employment, but then manipulated and discarded them.' Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s deeply worrying that our soft-touch welfare system was so easily exploited by criminals.'

A DJ who murdered his girlfriend's 'outgoing, chatty' three-year-old daughter when he was supposed to be looking after her was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years today. Delroy Catwell attacked Lylah Aaron because he was jealous of the attention she was receiving from her mother. When Lylah died she was found to have bruises on her body from being punched, kicked and slapped, and had three broken ribs. Catwell, 31 was told by Mrs Justice Nicola Davies: 'It is difficult to conceive of a greater abuse of trust than that which you perpetrated in killing this vulnerable and defenceless young girl.' He had denied murdering Lylah, but was found guilty by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday. Jailed: Delroy Catwell (left) was sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter Lylah Aaron (right) Ms Chibanda, who found it too upsetting to attend much of the trial, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out. The court had heard from medical experts that the force used to break Lylah's ribs was similar to that seen in a car crash or a fall from a tall building. As well as a 'sustained and forceful attack' on Lylah hours before she died, the jury was told that Catwell also slammed the tot’s head . against a bedroom wall damaging the plaster three weeks previously - . claiming he hit the wall because he was trying to kill a spider. Seven months before she died, Lylah was found with a bruised neck which . Catwell said was caused when she banged her head on a sink. Paramedics were called on February 8 when Ms Chibanda found Lylah was not . breathing when she returned from work at Derby Royal Infirmary. She asked . Catwell to help but he did not respond. She said: 'He looked like he . was in shock. He was just frozen.' Paramedics . discovered Lylah’s body was rigid and attempted resuscitation. She was . rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hosptal but later died. Public shock: Floral tributes were left outside the toddler's Sheffield home after the murder in February . Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC said: 'There . were numerous bruises over her body. 'There was . substantial bruising to her head and fractures to her ribs. 'The injuries . indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that . had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital.' Mr Cox had told the court: 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.' 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.' Det Supt David Barraclough . Catwell, an unemployed DJ, told police the girl was full of energy and he found it hard to deal with her demands while trainee nurse Miss Chibanda said 'he at times mentioned that I perhaps smothered her.' Lylah’s mother had gone to work on the day her daughter died but Catwell failed to take Lylah to nursery where staff described her as 'bright' and a 'confident, bubbly little girl'. He claimed the girl was tired and had been ill for a few days so after watching cartoons he put her to bed that afternoon. He told police: 'I have never hit Lylah. I didn’t cause any injuries whatsoever.' Experts said he must have inflicted the fatal injuries before Miss Chibanda returned from work at about 4.30pm. Hunt for clues: A forensics officer enters the Sheffield home of Lylah Aaron. Scientific evidence suggests that her head was banged off a wall in the main bedroom of the house . A pathologist reported that the bruises to Lylah’s head were 'typical of non-accidental injuries' and bruising in and behind the left ear 'suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface.' He went on: 'Other bruises could have been caused by kicks, slaps or punches.' All the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death. Medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three-week-old injury and four rib fractures, one of which was about three weeks old. The other three fresh breaks had been caused by 'squeezing or compression'. The medics concluded Lylah died from repeated impacts causing fatal bleeding to the brain. The court was told that Catwell had a previous conviction for sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in August, 2005 . Andrew Robertson QC, defending, said the attack on Lylah was not pre-meditated and although he admitted there were as number of impacts the court could 'never be sure in this case that there was an intention to kill.' Judge Justice Nicola Davies, heard pre-sentence submissions from both barristers who agreed that Catwell will receive a life sentence with a minimum term to be fixed by the judge. Both lawyers also agreed the judge's starting point for fixing the minimum term was 15 years but she could increase this by taking into account aggravating factors. Mr Cox said these factors should include the vulnerability of the victim, the abuse of a position of trust, the previous violence towards Lylah, the fact he tried to blame his partner for the murder and his previous conviction. Life sentence: Delroy Catwell, who murdered his girlfriend's toddler daughter, was told be will serve a minimum of 20 years in prison by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court today . After the verdict investigating officer . Det Supt David Barraclough said: 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl. 'It was both . deliberate and violent and perpetrated by Catwell the man who should . have been caring for her. 'It is clear his vicious acts left Lylah with . injuries that later were to prove fatal.'","Lylah Aaron suffered brain injury in 'sustained attack' by Delroy Catwell .

Tributes: Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) Ian Michael Fisher from the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) who was killed in a suicide blast while on patrol in Afghanistan . A ‘hugely experienced’ British . soldier killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan was named last night . as Sergeant Major Ian Fisher. The married father of two died when a vehicle packed with explosives rammed his Warrior fighting vehicle on Tuesday. The . 42-year-old officer had been deployed to the warzone in August. He was . on his second tour of  Afghanistan and had also served in Northern . Ireland and Iraq. Warrant Officer Class 2 Fisher, 42, was on the final day of a two-day operation to disrupt insurgent activity near Kamparak, 25 miles north east of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah when the attack took place. He was taken to the military hospital at Camp Bastion but later died from his injuries. Yesterday, his widow Emma paid tribute to the father-of-two. She said: 'Ian will always be the centre of my . life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a . true professional soldier. 'He loved being a soldier, that's what he lived for. We are all so proud and always will be.' His death takes the number of UK . service members who have lost their lives since operations in . Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 446 and he is the eighth to die this year. WO2 Fisher, who worked as a Sergeant Major for a company of Warrior fighting vehicles, was a physics and geology graduate, who was born in Barking in Essex. He joined the Territorial Army in February 1993 with B Company, 3 Staffords, based in Stoke-on-Trent. He completed four previous operational tours from 1999 - once to Northern Ireland, twice to Iraq and a previous tour of Afghanistan in 2011. As well as his wife Emma, he leaves behind two sons, James, seven, and William, five, and his parents, Simon and Helen. The Ministry of Defence said that WO2 Fisher's colleagues described him as 'the epitome of an Infantry Sergeant Major, straight talking and obsessive in his pursuit of excellence and gaining the most from his subordinates while ensuring their wellbeing'. Casualties: The latest death takes the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 446 and he is the eighth to die this year (file picture) Lieutenant Colonel Chris Davies, Commanding Officer of WO2 Fisher's regiment, said: 'To lose a soldier in combat is a tragedy that hits any unit hard but to lose a warrant officer of WO2 Ian Fisher's calibre and standing in such a tight knit family regiment is a huge blow that has left the whole battalion numb. 'Qualified in both light role and armoured iInfantry, it was his expertise on Warrior fighting vehicles that set WO2 Fisher apart from his peers and for which he was widely respected as one of the best of his generation across the Army. 'Ian will always be the centre of my . life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a . true professional soldier.' Emma Fisher . 'His reputation as a tough-talking, no-nonsense sergeant major belied his quick wit and mischievous sense of humour and his men loved him for it. 'A larger-than-life character, he played a pivotal role in battalion life, always at the forefront where there was fun to be had. 'His nickname of ""the Colonel"" epitomised him. He was the consummate professional, never happier than when leading from the front and making things happen. Hugely popular, he is already sorely missed.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of Warrant Officer Class 2 Ian Fisher.

A British couple are to become parents of two sets of surrogate twin babies created from the same batch of embryos - a phenomenon known as 'twiblings'. The children, due in March next year, are being carried by two Indian women after a deal was arranged at a Mumbai clinic. The 'professional' couple, from Bedfordshire, do not want to be named. They decided to embark on fertility treatment in India after a series of failed treatments in the UK and two miscarriages, according to the BBC. A British couple are to become parents of two sets of surrogate twin babies created from the same batch of embryos - a phenomenon known as 'twiblings' The number of twiblings has grown in line with the surrogacy industry in India - where multiple embryos are often implanted from the same batch. In the UK, embryos from the same batch would not be implanted into two surrogate mothers in the same cycle. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority . (HFEA) guidelines recommend that only one embryo is transplanted. This is because having twins or multiple pregnancies is more dangerous and carries an increased risk of complications such as miscarriage and stillbirth. The 35-year-old husband of the couple explained to the BBC that he and his 36-year-old wife had been struggling with fertility problems for 10 years - and didn't want to waste more time. Once at the Corion clinic in Mumbai, their eggs and sperm were fertilised and then implanted into two surrogates. He said: 'We had six embryos in the fridge and . typically you would use one surrogate, but I thought ""get me two . surrogates and implant three in each"".' A month passed before the couple received two phone calls from India just days apart - explaining that both surrogates were pregnant with twins. The odds of this happening are so rare that the clinic had never seen it before - but the couple plan to keep all four children. The children, due in March next year, are being carried by two Indian women after a deal was arranged at a Mumbai clinic . The amount they have paid the clinic isn't clear - but the average surrogacy package in India costs around £20,000. They also have no plans to meet the women carrying their children - seeing it purely as a business transaction. 'She'll get paid…we don't need to see her. As long as she's healthy and delivers my babies healthily, she's done a job for us,' the wife of the couple told the BBC. Dr Kaushal Kadam, medical director of the Corion clinic, added that using two surrogate mothers in the same cycle isn't unheard of, especially if a couple is desperate to conceive. The 'twiblings' were conceived after IVF treatment. This means the mother's eggs were harvested from her ovaries and were then fertilised in a lab with her husband's sperm before being implanted into the Indian surrogates. Six embryos were implanted - three into each woman. Assuming the babies have each developed from two of the three embryos in each woman, those being carried by the same woman are the equivalent of non-identical twins. This is because they are from different eggs but are being carried at the same time, in the same womb. Biologically, they are the non-identical siblings of the babies the other surrogate is carrying.","The unnamed couple had IVF in India after struggling with fertility problems .

The feline, named Kick Buttowski after the cartoon stuntman, held onto a ladder which was attached to the roof of an electrician's van during the high-speed journey down the M1. The pet has now been reunited with his owners after escaping unhurt from his spontaneous motorway ride. Daredevil: The cat, called Kick Buttowski, clung to the roof of the van as it hurtled down the M1 in Leicestershire at 70mph . The van driver, Helen Stevens, pulled over to check what was wrong after another motorist flashed her a warning, and was gob-smacked when she found the 18-month-old cat clinging to her roof. The 30-year-old electrician said: 'The cat was on the roof rack, which had some stepladders on it, and was just clinging on for dear life. He was wide-eyed and looking terrified. 'It had to have got on at the petrol station we stopped at in Melton and we’d already gone all the way down the A46 and the M1 and were probably doing up to 70mph.' She took the cat to Bell, Brown and Bentley veterinary clinic in Stoneygate, Leicester, where he was found to be uninjured but appeared very shaken by the ordeal. Together again: Ellise Pepper and her son Connor Russell, five , are reunited with their pet after vets published an online appeal to find its owners . The vets put an appeal online where it was spotted by Ellise Pepper, mum of Kick’s owner, five-year-old Connor Russell. Connor, who was reunited with Kick on Saturday, said: 'He held on and he didn’t fall off, but I bet he was scared.' The family began to worry about their pet's whereabouts when he did not return for dinner on Friday evening. His mother said: 'He’s never done anything like this before, although he does hate to be on his own and likes to follow the children to nursery!' She was astonished to see his photo which was accompanied by a story about his adventure. 'I was on Facebook and my friend shared the link and I thought: ‘That’s our cat!’ 'I was overwhelmed and quite upset about it, but then I read that he wasn’t hurt. 'He’s usually a pretty laid-back cat.' Amanda Walker, a nurse at Bell, Brown and Bentley, said: 'It’s miraculous that he didn’t fall off the roof because the car was going quite fast at times. 'To have been clinging onto the van since Melton is just amazing. He’s a nice boy and although he was shaken up, he was very friendly. 'Before the owners got in touch on Saturday we looked after him at the vet and named him Batman because he’s black with a white face and big ears. And he’s certainly a superhero.'

Strong words: Natacha Bouchart said the number of people trying to make it across the Channel was becoming 'untenable' Calais is becoming a lawless town with ‘no security’ because of masses of migrants seeking to cross the Channel into Britain, the port’s mayor says. Natacha Bouchart blamed British activists from the anarchist group No Borders for helping migrants set up illegal squats in unoccupied flats, houses and commercial property in central Calais. The group, which campaigns for an end to immigration controls, is trying to give  the migrants shelter in France before they attempt their illegal entry into the UK. Mrs Bouchart, 50, has previously blamed Britain’s asylum and benefits system for ‘imposing’ hundreds of illegal migrants on her city. She said the number of people trying to make it across the Channel was becoming ‘untenable’ and radical action was needed. In a move that has caused controversy in France, she made a plea to residents to report squats used by UK-bound illegal immigrants so that they can be shut down. She has offered an email address which can be used anonymously to pinpoint groups of immigrants – as well as the British activists who help them – so police can visit the buildings and clear them out. She called the dozens of squats ‘a plague which is spreading to the town centre, disturbing the peace of residents and tarnishing the town’s image’. She added: ‘It is scandalous that we live in a state where foreigners come here to disturb our town and our residents. Signs of the times: Migrants in Calais wait for a chance to cross the Channel into Britain . Hunger strike: Some of the Syrians occupying a footbridge at the Calais ferry terminal earlier this month . Stand off: French CRS riot police stand guard as Syrian asylum seekers hold their position behind a banner on a footbridge at the ferry terminal in Calais . 'The migrants fight among each other and we do not feel there is any security at all.’ Mrs . Bouchart, who was born in France to an Armenian father and a Polish . mother, complained to Spanish-born Interior Minister Manuel Valls that . she lacked powers to take direct action against squatters and asked for . Calais to be declared a high-priority security zone. On her Facebook page, the mayor asked people to report squatters and No Borders activists who helped them find squats. She . wrote: ‘Do not hesitate to email if you see No Borders or migrants . settling illegally in a house. In this way the police can act by way of a . procedure which can be enacted 48 hours after an intrusion property has . been reported.’ Many have travelled from countries like Syria and Eritrea, and often pay people smugglers thousands of pounds for a place on a lorry or train across the Channel. Xavier . Bellynck, a supporter of Mrs Bouchart, wrote on her Facebook page: ‘The . idea of launching an email address to report the squats is a good idea. 'It’s necessary to know that the migrants are being manipulated by No Borders and by the  people smugglers. ‘They are being used for political purposes, to the detriment of the people of Calais.’ But opponents have accused Mrs Bouchart, a member of the opposition UMP party, of pandering to the far-Right. They . say she is trying to stir up hatred of the hundreds who are on their . way to Britain to try to claim asylum, or else to start working in the . black economy. The brutal war in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it started in early 2011 . Seventeen countries are liaising with the United Nations to receive quotas of refugees fleeing war . Marie Levy wrote: ‘Terrifying to read all this hate. Is this the future for Calais?’ Mrs . Bouchart, who was elected mayor in 2008, was instrumental in the . destruction of ‘The Jungle’, a massive open-air squatters’ camp close to . the ferry terminal, populated by hundreds of Afghans and Iraqis heading . for the UK. Afterwards, . migrants scattered, squatting in makeshift camps and occupying WW2 . German bunkers along the Channel coast. In recent months they began . targeting the centre of Calais. No Borders is a shadowy group of activists campaigning for an end to immigration controls across Europe. Motivated by an anarchist ideology, the British branch seeks to help migrants get around immigration rules and prepare them for life after illegal entry into the UK. Activists tell illegal immigrants not to answer any questions if they are stopped by the UK Border Agency (pictured) The group has been recruiting volunteers from throughout Britain, most of them ex-students. Once recruited, they make regular trips to France to give would-be migrants food, sleeping bags, books and even phones and bikes, as well as helping them to find squats in towns such as Calais. They are also trained to advise on means of illegal entry into the UK and what to do once a migrant arrives here. The group’s website describes itself as the UK branch of an anarchist network that began in Europe in 1999. It says it has no organised central structure, and is instead a loose collection of individuals who want to erase the borders created by ‘capitalist elites’. The UK website for No Borders lists email addresses and phone numbers for several groups in the country, and details regular meetings in cities including Leeds and Cardiff. One piece of advice they give illegal immigrants is not to answer any questions if they are stopped by the UK Border Agency. They tell migrants that officers have no right to stop them on the basis of race, and advise that the worst course of action would be to give away their name and date of birth – from which other biographical information could be easily traced. The manifesto for the group urges members to avoid ‘symbolic stunts’, and instead focus on ‘direct action’.","Natacha Bouchart said the number of people trying to make it across the Channel was becoming 'untenable' and radical action was needed .

Jones has been held at the Teller County jail since his September conviction for menacing his now-estranged wife. He . is due to be sentenced November 4 for beating his wife and holding her . captive in their Divide home during a March fight over what The Gazette . reports was finances. Jones' wife, April Jones, filed for divorce three weeks after the assault. Court records show that Jones resigned his $82,000 a year job as a Colorado Springs contractor when his conviction threatened his government security clearance. After April Jones filed for divorce, Earl Ray Jones (no relation to the actor of the same name) stayed temporarily at Value Place, a weekly-rate motel. All that glitters: Jones can prove he converted $500,000 into gold, but he has no proof he threw it away . It is here that he says he disposed of the gold in a trash bin behind the motel. Jones . said he raided the couple's retirement and investment accounts and . converted them into gold through Phoenix-based CMI Gold and Silver. April Jones' divorce attorney, John-Paul Lyle told The Gazette, 'We say that when people are divorcing, they enter a state of temporary insanity. But on a scale of 1 to 10, this is my 10.' Jones told Lyle that if he could have withdrawn the money in cash, he 'would have been walking around giving people $100 bills.' According to Lyle, Jones' wife April Jones has been left 'destitute' and unable to work in her profession as a teacher due to injuries she sustained in the March assault. Buried: If Jones has indeed tossed out his own fortune, it would now be buried under tons of rubbish . Value Place's trash is handled by Waste Connections of Colorado Springs. That company dumps its trash at Fountain landfill, which Ken Manzo, dictrict manager, told The Gazette accepts 30,000 tons of trash per month. Each load is dumped, compacted and covered with dirt. While anything dumped at the landfill is technically the property of the landfill's owner, Jones disposed of his wife's share of the gold unlawfully, so she should still be entitled to it if it were ever recovered. Colorado Springs attorney Phil Dubois told The Gazette that it's unlikely Jones would have sacrificed the money. 'Based on normal human conduct, one would believe that it's out there somewhere, and that he knows where it is,' Dubois said.","Earl Ray Jones, 52, claims to have thrown away $500,000 worth of gold into a dumpster .

The 7.3 magnitude tremor hit at 2.10am on Saturday (5.10pm GMT today) near the crippled Fukushima nuclear site. Despite striking 170 miles off the coast, it was reportedly felt in Tokyo - at least 300 miles away.

Workers at the Fukushima power station, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), have been told to leave the waterfront and move to higher ground, according to local reports. However, there has been no reported damage to land or people along the coast. Only two of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors have been online since the country was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, causing a devastating tsunami, in March 2011. Carnage: Only two of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors have been online since the country was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, causing a devastating tsunami, in March 2011 . The quake - which claimed the lives of about 19,000 people - triggered multiple meltdowns and massive radiation leaks at the Fukushima site, which is situated about 160 miles north-east of Tokyo. In the days and weeks following the tremor, reactors flung radioactive substances into the air, soil and sea as part of a clean-up operation. Since then, the power station has been beset with power outages and other problems. This had led outside experts to question whether Tepco is . qualified to handle the cleanup, which is unprecedented due to the . amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location. Earlier this year, the company lost power to cool spent uranium fuel rods at the plant after a rat tripped an electrical wire. And . just last month, Tepco employees found that 430 litres of highly . radioactive water had leaked from one of the hastily built storage . tanks.","The powerful tremor struck at 2.10am on Saturday (5.10pm GMT today)

But the Kit Kat is about to have its recipe changed – as part of the new phase of a public health drive. The Department of Health will today announce the details of a campaign called the ‘Responsibility Deal’ - a partnership with the food industry aimed at reducing the nation’s consumption of saturated fat. As part of the scheme, Nestle has signed up to change the oil used to make the wafer filling in its best-selling Kit Kat. The move will cut out 3,800 tonnes of saturated fat from more than a billion bars every year. Changes: The Kit Kat is getting a revamp, with a more healthy recipe . But despite the alteration, which will see saturated fat levels in a standard four-finger chocolate bar come down from 7.2g to 6.4g, manufacturers Nestle are insisting that the new recipe is not going to compromise the product’s taste. Managing director Ciaran Sullivan said: ‘Improving the nutritional profile of Kit Kat does not come at the expense of quality and taste - consumers will continue to enjoy the same Kit Kat as they have for over 75 years.’ He added: ‘This is the next step on the journey where we are improving the nutritional profile of our products. ‘Kit Kat is our biggest confectionery brand and therefore the obvious choice to identify a saturated fat reduction.’ The deal will also see Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons reduce fat in their products including some of their own-brand spreads, cheese and breadsticks. Mondelez International, which is part of Kraft and owns the Cadbury brand, will reformulate products such as Belvita breakfast biscuits and Oreo chocolate cookies. Subway will cut the amount of saturated fat in their ‘Kids Pak’ children’s meal by more than 70 per cent, and catering giant Compass – which serves more than a million meals a day across their 7,000 sites - will promote healthier menus as part of the pledge. Crisp and creamy: The Nestle snack will change the oil it uses to make the biscuit's wafer - but the manufacturers insist that taste will not be compromised . As well as this, Unilever and Aldi have promised to reformulate products and look at reducing portion sizes. And the nation’s 10,500 fish and chip shops are being encouraged to switch to healthier oils, such as Omega 9, which contain less of the fat. Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘One in six male deaths and one in nine female deaths are from coronary heart disease - this is why it is critical that we challenge the way we eat and that we all make changes where we can.’ She added: ‘It’s hugely encouraging that companies providing almost half the food available on the UK market have committed to this Responsibility Deal and are leading the way to give their customers healthier products and lower fat alternatives.’","The Nestle snack will now be made using different oil .

South African Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius will face two additional gun-related charges at his trial for the murder of his girlfriend due to start in March next year, prosecutors announced today. Pistorius, who is on bail, says he acted in self-defence mistaking his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot and killed her on Valentine's Day at his upmarket home in February.

Rachel Poole, 31, gave birth to a daughter named Isabella at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas by caesarean section. Poole has been in hospital since Wednesday evening when she was brutally attacked by Corey Bernard, 19, while she was in her kitchen speaking to her husband Justin Pele Poole - who was deployed overseas but has since returned - via FaceTime. Bravely speaking with KFOX14 via phone from her hospital bed, Poole assured well-wishers both her and her daughter are going to be alright. 'I think the recovery is going pretty well, we have an amazingly strong daughter who is absolutely gorgeous,' Rachel said. 'It means the world, just being able to see her and know that, through everything, she's doing just fine.' 'Pillar of strength': New mother Rachel Poole cannot see out of one eye, has a collapsed lung, a displaced vertebrae and is unable to hold her newborn baby, but has bravely chosen to give her first interview to assure well-wishers she is recovering.

Moss then attacked her from behind with a knife, beating her as well . Baby Isabella was born quite sick due to the strong doses of medication her mother had been given to stay alive. However she has since recovered and will soon be taken out of the NICU and moved in with the other babies. Sadly Rachel hasn't been able to see her daughter. 'I haven't personally gotten to see her yet, until I make my recovery I'm not going to be able to, but all the reports I have on her are really good,' she said.

In court: Mingdong Chen, 25, is arraigned in Brooklyn criminal court on Monday after allegedly butchering his cousin's wife and her four children, aged one to nine, in Brooklyn on Saturday night . Quiet: Chen, whose lawyer said suffered two bruises to his forehead with in police custody, stayed silent . His attorney, Danielle Eaddy, said her client had been injured while in police custody and appeared to have two bruises on his forehead. She did not immediately request a psychiatric hearing. Chen was held without bail and his next court date was set for Friday, where a grand jury was expected to determine whether to indict him in the gruesome deaths. Police said Chen stabbed and slashed the victims in their necks and torsos. The one-year-old boy was so badly butchered that he was decapitated, according to reports. The family was found in various rooms in their apartment on the first floor of a two-story brick house. Some were hospitalized and pronounced dead; others died at the scene. 'It's a scene you'll never forget,' said Chief of Department Philip Banks III. The children's father and Chen's . cousin, Yi Lin Zhuo, was working . at a Long Island restaurant when the grisly murders unfolded in his home.

He was a transient and illegally in the United States, Assistant District Attorney Mark Hale said. An immigration hold was also placed on him.

Nigerian-born Abiola Kumoye and Ayodeji Abbis have been jailed after admitting their part in the elaborate plot to keep fellow Nigerian and University of Hull masters student Jayeola Abiola in the country by holding a sham wedding held in Hull, East Yorkshire. Law student Abbis agreed on the . morning of the wedding to be best man for £1,000, yet had never met the . groom until they arrived at the wedding venue. Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes (far right) at a BHS store in Leeds in November last year when the defendants purchased a wedding dress . The . 27-year-old denied knowing it was a sham or that he was paid £1,000, . claiming the money was owed to him by an associate of Abiola. Prosecutor Edward Bindloss said: 'Was it a coincidence the money was paid in to his account on the same day of the wedding? 'This . was his reward for being a valued and important part of that sham . marriage. He was the best man for a complete stranger and there to make . money.' Not the best men: Ayodeji Abbis (left) and Abiola Kumoye (right) have been jailed for his part in an elaborate plot to keep fellow Nigerian Jayeola Abiola in the country . Abiola faced being booted out of Britain because his visa was running out and had planned to pay others £5,000 for organising the wedding at Hull’s Guildhall. He even picked Celine Dion’s The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face as the wedding song for the big day. Father-of-two, Kumoye, 34, was paid £2,150 by Abiola for 'luring' the bride, Portuguese-born Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes and providing her with his ex-wife’s passport. Kumoye and Pinheiro-Fernandes . then travelled in convoy with Abbis from Leeds to Hull on the day of . the wedding, stopping off at British Home Stores to pick up her wedding . dress and tiara. Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes was jailed for eight months for being a fake bride.

Kumoye and Abbis were arrested and charged with conspiracy to breach immigration laws in January. The bride and groom were jailed for eight and 12 months respectively in July. Abbis was sentenced to eight months while Kumoye was jailed for 16 months. Judge Singh said: 'If it wasn’t for the eagle-eyed registrar, it would have gone ahead, everything was planned. 'The groom had even chosen the rather apt song of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.

"By . Associated Press and Catherine Townsend . PUBLISHED: . 14:52 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 22 August 2013 . Google Play has been forced to remove a Boyfriend Tracker app from sale in Brazil in response to complaints about privacy abuses, as well as its potential to be used for extortion or stalking. Brazilians were outraged when they learned their country was a top target of the . U.S. National Security Agency's top secret overseas spying operation, but it seems that all bets are off when it comes to catching cheaters. Tens of thousands managed to download the software before it was pulled off the market. Boyfriend tracker: Google Play has taken the controversial app off the market in Brazil . 'Brazilians are a jealous people, what can I say? Of course it's going to be . popular,' said Marcia Almeida, a 47-year-old woman in Rio whose marriage ended . seven years ago in large part because of what she said was her husband's . infidelity. 'It's a different type of spying,' she said of comparisons to the NSA . surveillance program. 'You're checking up on somebody you know intimately, not . some stranger.' The app, called Rastreador de Namorados - Portugese for Boyfriend Tracker - . promises to act like a 'private detective in your partner's pocket.' Functions include sending the person doing the tracking updates on their . partner's location and forwarding duplicates of text message traffic from the . targeted phone. Spyware that works via GPS is marketed as a way to keep . children safe or find lost phones, but a growing number of apps claim users can conduct NSA-level surveillance for less than a . cup of coffee. There . are now apps available that allow you to read a partner's text messages, . listen in on calls, and check calendars. Some even remotely turn on a microphone so users can listen in to what their lover is doing at any time. For $8 per month, Stealthgenie promises to deliver all of the above functions and be  undetectable. Other apps, like Spy Your Love, ironically claim to work on a 'trust system'. The idea is that each member of a couple agrees to constant mutual . monitoring of call histories, SMS and Facebook . communication. Others are more brazen. Cheating Boyfriend  bills itself as 'great for . suspicious boyfriends or the stalker on the go.' Then there are technologies like GPS Tracking Pro that are, in theory, marketed to parents. But in practice, who knows whether the person installing the app is watching her son after school or her boyfriend after work? Almost all websites . for products have disclaimers warning people not to use their products . for illegal purposes. The definition of 'consent', it seems, is crucial. In . 2011 Japanese company Manuscript was forced to modify their Boyfriend . Log app after complaints that the app ran in the . background without users knowing. In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled that . police attaching GPS devices to cars was 'unreasonable search and . seizure,' and some states have laws against cyberstalking. But for private citizens, GPS on phones remains a legal grey area. It's the subject of a federal bill to close the loophole, but companies that create the apps insist that the technology is meant for legal monitoring. So the husband listed on your family plan or the boss who gave you the . company smartphone may be within his rights to keep tabs on you. The . app market saw record growth in 2013, and there are now a number of anti-spyware options as well. There is even a command that allows a user to force the target . phone to silently call their own, like a pocket dial, so they can listen in on . what the person is saying. Similar apps are marketed for smartphone users in other countries, including . Europe and the U.S., but Boyfriend Tracker is the first that has made any impact . in Brazil, a country still irate as it learns more about Washington's snooping. Brazil has sent a government delegation to meet with U.S. leaders about the spy . program that was revealed by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who has . been on the run since May and was recently granted asylum in Russia. Google spokeswoman Gina Johnson said by email that as a policy the company . doesn't comment on why apps are removed. Critics say even as advertised, apps like Boyfriend Tracker can violate . privacy rights, and they warn that in the wrong hands they could be used for . more sinister purposes, like stalking. Some in Brazil argue it breaks an . anti-online harassment and hacking law in place since April. The law is named . after Brazilian actress Carolina Dieckmann, who had nude photos of herself . leaked by hackers in 2012 after she refused to pay about $5,000. However, similar apps popular on Google Play market themselves to parents as . a means of monitoring how teenage children use the phone and where they are at . any given moment. Matheus Grijo, a 24-year-old Sao Paulo-based developer behind Boyfriend . Tracker, says it has attracted around 50,000 users since its launch about two . months ago. Mr Grijo insists his lawyer vetted the app and determined it does not violate . any Brazilian laws. Despite being removed by Google, it is still available via . direct download from his company's website. A disclaimer on that website stipulates the app is for 'social and recreational use' and absolves the developer of responsibility for any misuse. The first line of the download instructions says a woman installing the tracker . on her boyfriend's phone should do so ' with his consent'. 'We are waiting for Google's position on the removal of Boyfriend Tracker . from Google Play, which we consider an error,' read a posting on a Facebook page . Grijo set up for the app. To install Boyfriend Tracker, suspicious partners have to get their hands on . their loved one's smartphones and upload the app. A free version leaves the . app's icon visible on the target's phone, while a version that costs $2 a month . masks the icon. Mr Grijo said the app began as a joke between him and his girlfriend but the . idea quickly caught on among their friends. 'In Brazil, we have this culture of switching partners really quickly, so . this is a way of dealing with that,' said Grijo. 'People really appreciate . having a tool to help them find out whether they're being cheated on.' He acknowledged that 'of course some people are against it, but on balance . the response from users has been positive.' He said he's received messages of . gratitude from around 50 people who used the app to ferret out their partners' infidelity. While cheating in Brazil cuts both ways, the app is clearly marketed to women . suspicious of their male partners, right down to the name. Postings on the app's . Facebook page exhort: 'Girls, share this.' Still, Mr Grijo insisted he personally has never given his girlfriends any . reason to worry. 'I've had three steady girlfriends until now but I've never had these kinds . of issues,' he said.","The Brazilian app, called Rastreador de Namorados - Portugese for Boyfriend Tracker - .

Covered in glitter under the glare of show lights, the Fama circus troupe perform to an audience of one in the middle of nowhere. For these Chilean transgender performers, this is just another day in the office. The vaudeville group, who market themselves as a circus, have been touring the country for 10 years performing musical numbers and dirty jokes. Though audience numbers range from 0 to 400, the group puts on all the bells and whistles every night without fail. Another day in the office: Dulce Lafferti performs for an audience of one. The performers in Chile's transgender Fama Circus always act as if the stadium is full . Take a bow: Ten of the 15 members of Fama, a Chilean transgender circus, conclude their show of musical numbers, jokes and flame-throwing for their small audience . Rain or shine, summer or winter, the girls stick to their sparkling bikinis and worn-out stockings all year round. To complete the line up, stiletto-clad Susan Brown eats flames as the main attraction. The conventionally striped Big Top has been customised with stars, and they have set up colourful lights to swirl across the ceiling. They pack and carry the tents . and the wooden planks used for seating. Their . tent, set up on the dirt, has a capacity for 400 people. Mobile home: Sasha Star applies her make up in for her performance in the capital, Santiago. She earns around £75 a month but is happy for a protective home . Carnival: The lively show is one of many to pop up across South America as the transgender scene booms. Here drag queen Francoise jokes with the audience . Acts: Susan Brown spits flames as the show of musical numbers and double-entendre jokes crescendos. Shows like this have sparked a wave of LGBT tourism . It is a protective home for the 15 stars in a country which did not legalise gay sex until 1999 - in a predominantly catholic South America. Brutal attacks on homosexuals still fill the headlines of Chile's newspaper - just last week a young man was beaten into a coma. The transgender performers are often mocked and some of them have suffered violent attacks. 'The . verbal aggressions and attacks continue, even after the passing of the . anti-discrimination law,' said Vero, 40, who is one of the founding . members of the show. Packed: Sometimes they have just one person in the stadium fit for 400. Tonight drag queen Susan's act is a hit with dozens of people gathered for the show . Make up: Warra Montano applies foundation. The show go on all year round, even in the harsh winter with performers wearing small bikinis and worn out stockings . They . earn between £75 and £150 a month - well below Chile's monthly minimum . wage of £240. But they say they don't mind the pay because they enjoy . their job and have few expenses. 'It's the only work I have. Elsewhere they don't give me work because I am a homosexual,' said 34-year-old Sasha. However, with the surgery industry booming and the gradual introduction of hate crime laws across the continent, Fama's troupers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly. Work: Drag queen Lupita would not work in an office where she would have to dress as a man. The continent is becoming more LGBT-friendly but backlash remains . Movement: As hate crime laws are brought into the catholic country, the performers are slowly harbouring the confidence to express themselves publicly . On October 10, Argentina granted a six-year-old transgender girl a female ID card. The nation, which has similar underground performance acts to Fama, is currently obsessing over top-ranking television show La Pelu (Hair Salon), which reeled in viewers with transvestite host Florencia de la V. And, after legalising gay marriage in 2009 - three years ahead of the UK - a same-sex wedding fashion show is a cultural highlight of the year. Transgender operations are also on the rise, as the lucrative plastic surgery industry casts their net wider. Unlike in Britain, cosmetic surgery is available to people of all social and economic classes. Fama: They call it a circus but it's more like a vaudeville show put on by transgenders and drag queens, who have been an act for over a decade . There is no stigma - it is viewed as an oppourtunity to fix unfortunate biological flaws. In Colombia and Brazil, universities run programmes to offer operations to the lowest on the economic spectrum. As a result, acts like Fama are now spreading out of the metropolitan hubs such as Buenos Aires and into the rural towns. It has sparked a wave of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) tourism in South America, as people from similarly hostile states in America or regions of Europe come to experience the groundbreaking transgender scene.","Transgender performers and drag queens of Chile's Fama circus have audiences ranging from 400 people to nobody .

If so, you've fallen prey to Collective Fatigue Syndrome. But this is no cry for help. Instead, it's about emphasising how tired you are in order to show that you're in demand and having it all. According to a report in Grazia magazine, this has come about because of a desire to emulate modern power-women such as Facebook chief Sheryl Sandberg, who live immensely successful lives but never seem to pause to draw breath. Tired: Women are taking on too much in an attempt to prove they can keep up with the likes of Sheryl Sandberg . In Sandberg's case, she juggles life at the top of one of the world's biggest tech firms with motherhood and a secondary career as an inspirational speaker. Not only did she find time to write a book, she's also found a few minutes to write the foreword to another. In short, there's little she can't do. Inspiration: Sheryl Sandberg agrees that it's time for men to pull their weight at home . The message Sandberg and co give us is that you really can have it all - but you'll have to work extraordinarily hard for it. And yes, that does mean enduring terminal tiredness. You might need a nanny too, as Sandberg has, to her credit, admitted. But is it really possible to follow in their super-charged footsteps? According to Professor Jim Horne, author of Sleepfaring: A Journey Through The Science Of Sleep, women need to disengage from time to time in order to perform at their best. 'On average women need 20 minutes more sleep than men,' the professor told Grazia. 'Because women tend to multi-task, they use more of their actual brain than men do during the day, so their need to go into recovery mode and disengage from the senses is greater.' But though women's need for sleep is greater, pressure to emulate Sandberg and 'have it all' means most are getting less sleep than ever before - with disastrous results for their health. 'Women are still working what is known as ""The Second Shift"",' says occupational psychologist Almuth McDowell. 'They're often the ones who have to do the little things - remembering birthdays, paying bills, booking holidays. 'Research shows there are genuine gender differences in who takes care of these tasks within the home.' A recent survey, which found that women did 70 per cent of chores in the home, would appear to back Dr McDowell's claims. Among female breadwinners, more than half (55 per cent) say they still do the lion's share of the housework - even if their partner has been at home all day. Second shift: Dr Almuth McDuwall says women are doing too much in an attempt to have it all . Not surprisingly, the beginnings of a backlash are on the horizon, starting with the new book Getting To 50/50: How Working Parents Can Have It All by a pair of former executives Sharon Meers and Joanna Strober. The duo say that splitting chores is the key to a happy household - a view shared by Sandberg who penned the introduction to the book. Nevertheless, female one-upmanship is proving equally problematic for the UK's hordes of sleep deprived women, many of whom are obsessed with keeping up appearances. 'Women are often their own worst enemies because our expectations of ourselves are so high,' adds Dr McDowall. 'It can be useful to think that things don't have to be perfect - just good enough.' And that means acknowledging that being tired all the time is neither healthy nor a sign that you're having your cake and eating it.","Tiredness is seen as proof that you can pull off having it all .

'A spiritualist was called to this morning by the factory owners to get rid of the suspected ""jinns"" but as soon as he began reciting different verses, the workers began falling unconscious while others ran out shouting and screaming for help.' Emergency services were called to the Casual Sports Wear factory, in Landhi Export Processing Zone, to take the employees to Jinnah hospital. The rescue workers say there was no supernatural presence in the building and the staff's illness was down to a gas leak which caused the workers to faint.

MailOnline can reveal that writer Kevin Goldman has been flown to London to interview associates and friends of both Nigella and her ex-husband Saatchi, 70. However, Nigella has refused to take part in the article - following in the same vein as Gwyneth Paltrow - and has advised friends to steer clear. Charles Saatchi, pictured here with Trinny Woodall at Scott's, is threatening to sue his ex-wife Nigella Lawson for $800,000 in an explosive case where he wants to reveal 'the truth' about their break-up . After being photographed with his hands around the celebrity chef's throat outside an exclusive restaurant in June, the advertising guru accepted a police caution and then went through a divorce with Miss Lawson . Nigella, who is currently in London filming The Taste UK for Britain's Channel 4, follows in the footsteps of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, who emailed all friends telling them not to partake in a tell-all Vanity Fair article. This prompted Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter to retort the article would be published, adding: 'Well, she sort of forced my hand, . 'We started a story on her.

And speaking about the Nigella piece, a source said: 'No stone has been unturned, Vanity Fair wanted to get to the bottom of such an abrupt breakup and why the end of the marriage was agreed so quickly. 'Kevin has spoken to a lot of associates of both Nigella and Charles.'

But sources . close to Saatchi have revealed that despite his formal admission of . assault he is now furious he has been widely reviled for the incident . and is determined to publicise ‘the truth’ about the ‘strangling’ pictures taken outside Scott’s in  London’s Mayfair. The full details of his allegations about Nigella's behaviour cannot be made public for legal reasons, but have been strongly denied by her spokesman and her lawyers. But Saatchi’s claims could now be revealed at London’s High Court after his lawyers sent a legal letter to his former wife’s solicitors warning that he was poised to sue her for around half a million pounds in a bid to clear his name. The chillingly formal letter lays out serious allegations against the popular cook and claims her actions have cost her former husband a fortune. It warns that if she refuses to settle the matter voluntarily, legal action in court will ensue. Saatchi, who was Nigella's second husband, initially attempted to dismiss the shocking photographs that killed off his ten-year marriage as a ‘playful tiff’. He then went on to say ‘my actions were not violent’ and that he was ‘disappointed’ Nigella had not publicly said he had ‘never abused her physically in any way’. Given that he has an estimated $161million fortune thanks to his successful career and extensive art collection, the sum of $800,000 involved in his dispute with Nigella is negligible.

But a source close to Saatchi said: . ‘Charles has been painted as the villain in all this – millions of . people are convinced he was assaulting Nigella outside the restaurant. ‘But there are very genuine reasons for why he was holding on to her. ‘She has never given a public account of what was happening. ‘He has just been damned by the photographs, her silence, and his acceptance of a police caution – which he did only to protect her from a lengthy probe by officers. But he has never been able to explain the truth about what was going on.’ The couple’s marriage ended in a brief hearing just seven weeks after the incident at Scott’s. Miss Lawson, who has a £20million fortune of her own and two teenage children from her first marriage, had petitioned for divorce on the grounds of Saatchi’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’, saying the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’. The couple had married in 2003 following the death of Miss Lawson’s first husband, broadcaster and journalist John Diamond, from throat cancer in 2001. Divorced: Nigella Lawson and husband Charles Saatchi were divorced on the grounds of his 'unreasonable behaviour' at London's High Court in July . On a ‘statement of truth’ she signed as part of the separation from Saatchi, in reply to a question about how her husband’s behaviour had affected her health she answered: ‘Not applicable.’ Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night refused to comment on the latest development in the saga. But a source close to the television chef and bestselling food writer said: ‘The seriously defamatory claims are, of course, denied.’ Since their separation, Miss Lawson has been living in rented accommodation in Central London, and has been busy filming The Taste for ABC. Saatchi, who lives in London, has been married three times. In recent months he has been doing his best to forget his marital woes by repeatedly dining out with glamorous journalist and television fashion expert Trinny Woodall – which has included repeated trips to Scott’s restaurant.","Vanity Fair will publish report on Domestic Goddess's marriage split in January .

Devastated: John Halliday, pictured, had to have part of his leg amputated after doctors failed to notice the spread of a serious infection . A grandfather whose leg had to be amputated after a series of hospital blunders had been awarded £1.5m in compensation. Health and Safety consultant John Halliday, 59, is now confined to a wheelchair in the wake of failures by doctors and has been warned his life expectancy is likely to be shorter. Medics at Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to diagnose a serious infection which later spread to other parts of his body including his spine, leaving him with ‘devastating’ injuries. He has been forced to give up work and is now heavily reliant on help from carers in adapted accommodation. He has been warned a combination of earlier and more recent illnesses is likely to cut his life short. In . an out-of-court settlement, he has been awarded compensation after the . hospital admitted liability for negligence in delays in diagnosing and . treating septic arthritis which would have avoided the amputation. Mr Halliday, from Retford, Notts, said he felt he had been ‘abandoned’ by the NHS. There . had been a ‘catalogue of errors’ in his care but it was only a year . after he first fell ill that he realised mistakes had been made. He said: 'It’s unbelievable, it really . is. I’m in a wheelchair. I have carers in every day and they have to do . most things for me. I’m not able to work - and can make a cup of tea . and a sandwich and that’s about the limit nowadays. 'At first I was very angry but I’ve had to accept what’s happened and make the best of the hand I’ve been dealt. 'It is a large sum of money but it doesn’t bring back the life I had.' The father-of-two, a former . psychiatric nurse before setting up his own business, had suffered from . gout attacks for years which left him bedridden but had never needed . hospital treatment until 2008 when he began suffering serious problems . linked to his left ankle. Payout: Patient John Halliday says he felt abandoned by the NHS while receiving treatment at Bradford Royal Infirmary . He . was examined by doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary who wrongly told . him he was suffering from cellulitis and an allergic reaction to . medication. He was given . antibiotics but did not undergo an early surgical washout of the ankle . to eradicate the infection which can damage vital cartilage. Trauma: John Halliday, from Retford, pictured before mistakes at Bradford Royal Infirmary led to him losing part of his leg due to an infection . It . was not for another 10 days that he was given the correct diagnosis of . septic arthritis which had led to toxic shock syndrome and kidney . failure. Despite the joint . being washed out four times and again two months later, the efforts . proved too late and he was told he needed a below-the-knee amputation. But before the operation could take . place, he was readmitted to the hospital in January 2009 where tests . showed the infection had spread to his lungs and spine. His leg was amputated two weeks later but his other problems continued, leaving him with severe curvature of his spine. Owing . to the back problems, he was unable to walk using a prosthetic leg and . cannot even move short distance on crutches. He suffers from severe back . pain and phantom pain in his missing leg. He . has now had to move from his home in Clayton, Bradford, where . he was a regular spectator of the city’s rugby league and football teams . and a keen fishermen, to live closer to his family in Retford, .

Expectant mother Zara Phillips has admitted she has been bored since giving up horse-riding – so she has turned to baking instead. The Queen’s granddaughter, who is due to give birth in the new year, was reluctant to abandon riding when she first announced that she was having a baby. But now that she has stopped, the professional three-day eventer revealed that she is finding the lack of activity difficult and has turned to the kitchen to fill her time. Baby on board: Zara Phillips, pictured at the Brightling International Horse Trials in July, was reluctant to  abandon riding when she first announced her pregnancy, but has turned to baking instead . The 32-year-old said: ‘I have been a bit bored. I’m used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it’s quite different. So, yes, I’m baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.’ And her new culinary interest has been welcomed by her rugby player husband Mike Tindall. He said: ‘She’s a very good cook and cooks me everything.

'They want people to question whether I am gay. Allow me to save them the trouble with a simple, honest answer: “Yes, I am. But why should it matter?”' he wrote. Coming out: Congressman Mike Michaud, 58, announced that he is gay in an op ed that he wrote for two local newspapers and a national wire service . The six-term Congressman made the announcement in an op-ed provided to The Associated Press and two Maine newspapers. Michaud, 58, wrote that he wanted his political foes to know that, in his word, 'I am not ashamed of who I am.' He acknowledged that it 'may seem like a big announcement to some people.

Jailed: Kurt Delves, 23, was sentenced to three years and nine months for the unlawful killing of his daughter, two-month-old Harli Reid . A young father who shook his baby daughter to death when she wouldn’t stop crying has been jailed for three years. Kurt Delves, 23, was sentenced today at Birmingham Crown Court for the unlawful killing of two-month-old Harli Reid on December 17 2010. The court heard how Delves, from Birmingham, West Midlands, had been Christmas shopping with Harli's mother Donnika Reid, 30, when he returned home alone with the child. Delves became frustrated with his daughter when he bathed her before bed. When Harli would not stop crying Delves shook the child, causing her 'catastrophic' brain injuries. The baby was taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, but died the following day. Devles originally tried to fabricate a . cover story about Harli falling ill while in the bath. He said the child flinched and became floppy after he splashed water in her face. The man told police that he only shook the child lightly in an attempt to rouse her. But detectives were . able to prove through expert analysis that the baby had been shaken with . sufficient force to cause her fatal brain injuries. Delves changed his plea to guilty to manslaughter on the second day of his . trial. Sentencing Delves, Mrs Justice Thirwall, . said: 'Babies are vulnerable and defenceless, we all know that. 'They can often be noisy, they can often be demanding, but they are always vulnerable and defenceless. 'As you know, it is the duty of every parent to protect their tiny little baby. Harli was a very loved and very well looked after child. 'Her mother did most of the caring but it is true that you were keen to be involved and were involved, changing her nappies, giving her a bottle. Death: Baby Harli, left, was shaken to death by her father Kurt Delves, right, pictured outside court today . 'I accept that you wanted to be a good father. But on December 17 2010 you didn’t protect Harli, on the contrary, you lost your temper and shook her repeatedly. 'For a short time, you shook her violently, it was clear this would cause her injury. As a result, she suffered brain damage from which she later died, she lost her life, a mother has lost a baby, and her grandparents, including your mother, have lost a grandchild. 'Her brother born to you and her mother in January 2012 will never know her. 'By your plea of guilty you accept you lost your temper and shook her in a way I have already described. 'I accept this was for a short time, but the injuries to her brain were catastrophic and there were injuries to her neck, which in any case with a nine-week-old child, was violent.' Sentence: Justice Thirwall jailed Delves for three years and nine months at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured . Mrs Justice Thirwall sentenced Delves to three years and nine months in prison. Defending, Tim Raggat said: 'This is a . tragedy for all concerned from doctors reports, it shows that he is a . very vulnerable man who will be very vulnerable in prison.' Detective Constable Lyndsey Yates, who worked on the inquiry, said outside court: ‘Delves was said to be very hands-on with his baby and would often take the lead when bathing, feeding and changing nappies. ‘But, in what appears to have been a momentary loss of control, he snapped and shook his daughter in frustration at being unable to stop her crying. ‘He caused fatal injuries - injuries he then tried to cover up by inventing a story about how she’d fallen ill whilst in the bath. ‘We were able to expose those lies and Delves was eventually left with little option but to admit his actions.’","Kurt Delves was sentenced at .

High ambitions: Yonas Admasu Kebede, 21, from Ethiopia, will train at taxpayers' expense . Taxpayers face a bill of tens of thousands of pounds so a failed asylum seeker can train to be a pilot. Yonas Admasu Kebede will be given flying lessons costing £10,000 even though the Government says he must leave the UK next year. The 21-year-old from Ethiopia will also get up to £10,000 in living expenses. A council is being forced to pay up after a court ruled it must meet Mr Kebede’s education costs after leaving school. Critics called the decision a ‘blank cheque’ which is ‘deeply unfair’ on taxpayers and questioned whether learning to fly should be paid from the public purse. The council is also funding Mr Kebede’s younger brother, Abiy, 20, to start a degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. The Kebedes came to the UK with their older brother and father in 2004. Their asylum application was refused but they were granted discretionary leave to stay in the UK until November 2014. Shortly after their arrival, they were abandoned by the older family members. They were placed in council care in Newcastle and attended a local comprehensive, where they attained GCSEs and A-levels. By law, local authorities have a duty to help meet training costs of those with no parents so that they can enter the workplace. Usually, these costs are living expenses for apprenticeships and college courses – not the enormous sums associated with a degree or professional qualification. Victory: Yonas Admasu Kebede, who will train for a year to become a pilot, sits at the controls of a plane . But the brothers’ lawyers argued that the council should pick up the bill as their immigration status barred them from applying for a student loan. Labour-controlled Newcastle city council fought the claim in the Administrative Court and the Court of Appeal, but lost, in a ruling likely to set a precedent for other claims. It now faces providing loans of up to £20,000 per year to each brother, with the amount to be repaid once they start work. The brothers plan to apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK but there is no guarantee it will be granted. They may be able to transfer to a normal student loan arrangement if their application is successful – which could see them repaying some of the cost of their education. Mr Kebede is taking the lessons at Flight Training London at Elstree Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, and hopes to then apply for a degree in aviation. The training for a private pilot’s licence involves a minimum of 45 flying hours and seven theoretical exams as well as a flight test. The flying school charges £165 per hour-long training session, while a flight test costs £185. Aerial view: Mr Kebede is taking the lessons at Flight Training London at Elstree Aerodrome (pictured) in Hertfordshire, and hopes to then apply for a degree in aviation . Yesterday Greg Stone, a Liberal Democrat councillor, said: ‘I can see why the council should support them going to a local college and so on but this seems over and above what people would expect. The public would be surprised that the council is obliged to pay for flying lessons. ‘We haven’t budgeted for this. Is this a blank cheque to give them whatever they ask for?’ If Yonas Kebede seeks to pursue a degree after his flying lessons, the council fears it will have to foot the bill for that too – up to £30,000 in fees and a similar amount in living costs. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This judgment is absolutely farcical and deeply unfair on the taxpayers footing the bill. 'We haven’t budgeted for this. Is this a blank cheque to give them whatever they ask for?' - Greg Stone, Liberal Democrat councillor . ‘Lots of parents scrimp and save to provide their children opportunities for further education, yet now they’re also paying for this young man’s flying lessons. The brothers were granted leave to remain, not a free ride.’ Tory North East MEP Martin Callanan added: ‘I find this totally bizarre. The council are in a difficult position if the Court of Appeal has ordered it but most taxpayers will be appalled that they are funding flying lessons for a refugee, however well intentioned he is. It is absolutely incredible.’ The brothers both applied for courses beginning last autumn, but when they discovered the funding was not available they deferred their places. They then instructed lawyers to pursue a claim with Newcastle Council to provide the funding. Paul Heron, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘We are thrilled that the Court of Appeal found in favour of our clients. They will now be able to go on to higher education, where they plan to complete their studies, secure a career here in the UK and repay their student loans in full to Newcastle city council.’ The case came about after the Government changed the rules in 2011 as to who could apply for a student loan. The new rules stated those with discretionary leave to remain were no longer eligible for a loan.","Yonas Admasu Kebedemm will also get up to £10,000 in living expenses .

They say an Englishman’s home is his castle – but billionaire businessman John Caudwell seems more intent on building an urban palace. For the mobile phone tycoon plans to turn two mansions in one of the most upmarket parts of London into a single dwelling the size of Westminster Cathedral. An ‘iceberg’ extension will be created by excavating beneath the existing properties to make space for a vast games room, swimming pool, sauna, kitchen, salon, media room, plant room and car park. Extension: John Caudwell wants to link the town house (left) to his mansion (right) via a 14,000 square foot subterranean extension . Mayfair mansion: John Caudwell's plans for a £250million mega home which will be created by linking his two existing central properties with a 14,000 square foot underground extension . Redevelopment: A cross section of the smaller Mayfair property with the new basement kitchen underneath marked up in the plans submitted to the council . It will be about 180ft long, stretching under each house and joining  them beneath their gardens, which back on to each other in Mayfair. The result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft, while other  mansions in Mayfair are from 10,000 sq ft. The ‘iceberg’ extension alone will cover 14,000 sq ft. Once complete, the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms – there are five in each house already and the plans include two more in the underground extension. With property prices for super-prime homes in Mayfair at around £5,000 per sq ft, the finished home  could be worth £250million. Mr Caudwell, 61, who is worth £1.5billion, bought the two properties last year for a total of £81 million and has submitted his plans to Westminster Council. The bigger of the two houses, built in 1877, is Grade II listed. At 22,000 sq ft, it has marble floors and a ballroom thought to be the largest of its type outside the Crown Estate. Super home: John Caudwell wants to link these two properties he owns in Mayfair with an underground extension which is not visible in this image submitted to Westminster Council . Extension: The new lower ground floor will feature a games room, kitchen, pool, sauna, changing room, media room, plant room and a car lift . In the 1960s it was a members club and, according to its history, was frequented by ‘dubious  gangland characters’, footballers and celebrities. It was bought  by Prince Jefri, brother of the Sultan of Brunei, in 1992 for a reported £18million. He spent millions decorating it and sold  it to an investment group a  decade later. Mr Caudwell grew up in a working-class background in Stoke-on-Trent and was a second-hand car dealer before forming Phones4u, which he sold in 2006 for £1.5billion. He is thought to be Britain’s highest income-tax payer, personally contributing more than £200million over the past five years.

Billionaire John Caudwell who founded Phones 4u is planning the remarkable extension to his two central London homes . Yesterday a statement on behalf of Mr Caudwell said: ‘The new works are intended to reinstate its quality and make it a fitting Mayfair house. ‘The application... makes  significant efforts to correct  poor alterations and to reinstate elements of heritable significance. Mr Caudwell is also seeking minor alterations to the roof and the construction of an orangery.’ Iceberg homes, a trend among the super-rich, involve digging down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions. But they are controversial because of the inconvenience they can cause to neighbours during the building work. Mr Caudwell, who is divorced and lives with long-term partner Claire Johnson, may have a battle to get his plans approved. The annual number of iceberg extension applications in Westminster has more than doubled from 79 in 2008/09 to 181 in 2011/12 and local government chiefs are threatening a crackdown. Robert Davis, Conservative deputy leader of Westminster council, said recently: ‘It is about restricting developments akin to the decks of a nuclear submarine that are too large and cause real disruption for our residents.’ But leading Mayfair estate agent Peter Wetherell said: ‘It’s wonderful news that one of the biggest investors in Mayfair is British and the plans should be applauded. Some complain about iceberg homes because of the amount of work involved but there is also a lot of work when building new homes. ‘It is catching up with modern-day living and they are going to be restoring one of Mayfair’s finest homes.’ Billionaire: John Caudwell, 61, who sold his Phones4u business for £1.5billion in 2006, with his partner Clare Johnson .

With prime real estate in London's most upmarket areas in short supply and going for an enormous premium, the capital's billionnarires are increasingly going underground in their bid for a bigger house. The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. In the past the majority of homeowners have extended upwards over fears of causing permanent structural damage. But the trend for so-called 'iceberg homes' is growing. Ten years ago, the number of planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea was just 64. Last year, the number had soared to 307. However, extending underground comes at a premium. In August, multi-millionaire hedge fund manager Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses. He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'. One-off levies are not the only downside to extending underground. Goldman Sachs director Christoph Stanger had to apologise to his furious neighbours in Kensington last summer after his £1million basement excavation — built to fit a playroom, guest room, gym, wine cellar and cinema into his £7 million house — left cracks in neighbours' properties. However, despite the issues, the wealthy continue to dig underground. Estate agents Our Property says: 'The main reason basement conversions are really growing in popularity is because, unlike loft conversions, basements are normally closer to other communal areas and can be more versatile living spaces that suit modern lifestyles, not just extra bedrooms, bathrooms or studies.'","John Caudwell, 61, is planning a 14,000sq ft underground extension to link his two Mayfair mansions .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:32 EST, 27 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 28 January 2013 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are determined to keep the education of their 11-year-old son 'out of politics' Nick Clegg yesterday defended the possibility he may send his children to private schools as it emerged he and his wife Miriam have not even visited their local state school. He said the education of his 11-year-old son Antonio, who starts secondary school this year, should not be used as 'a political football' and that the couple would do 'what's best' for their children although he was braced for criticism. Last week the Liberal Democrat leader told listeners to his radio show he would send his son to a private school if he failed to find a place in a good comprehensive, saying he would use the state system 'if it works out', but that there is 'huge competition' for places in London. But Mr Clegg, who attended Westminster public school, has apparently not looked around nearby Ark Putney academy in south-west London, it was revealed yesterday by its headmaster Mark Phillips. Mr Phillips who has turned the school around since he was hired three years ago, said the school which was once in special measures but is now lauded by the Government for its improvements, could provide an 'exceptional' education for any child and that there was no need to pay fees for schooling. Unless the Cleggs had visited 'under cover' he had not seen them, he said.'I am always very clear that all parents living locally are welcome to choose our school and it is important that every parent comes with their child and takes an objective look to see whether what we offer will meet the needs of their child', he said. 'It wouldn't claim to be the answer to every child and every parent. But I hope that if a parent does come, and sees an environment their child will thrive in, they will pick us...I am confident they will do exceptionally well. I don't believe you have to pay for it.' Mr Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he and his wife will do whatever is in the interests of their son . If he chooses to educate his children . privately, Mr Clegg is likely to be accused of hypocrisy after using a . speech last year to attack 'the great rift in our education system' caused by many of the best schools being fee-paying and said it had a . 'corrosive' effect on society and the economy. In . an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I accept that it's a . dilemma for anyone in public life, particularly in politics, how do you . balance that with the fact Miriam and I have small children, and the . approach Miriam and I took right from the outset was to keep our . children completely out of politics. 'We . never put them in front of the camera or to make them or their . education a political football. 'I totally accept that when we make a . decision that'll be subject to public commentary, criticism and so on, . but in the meantime we want to protect the privacy of an 11-year-old boy . and make the decision that we as parents think is best for our son.' The deadline for applying for entry to Ark Putney for 2013-14 was last October. The school is part of the Ark academy chain, set up in 2004, whose chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats' biggest donors. Last year 62 per cent of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs, prompting schools minister Nick Gibb to write to Mr Phillips to congratulate him on the 'excellent results' saying the school was in the top 100 best-performing, based on sustained improvements every year since 2008. However Michael Gove last year approved the sale of five acres of playing fields at the school including six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground, to developers to fund refurbishments, after a £40million revamp under the Building Schools for the Future programme was cancelled. Alumni of Ark Putney, which used to be Elliott School, include actor Pierce Brosnan, and 1960s England bowler Geoff Arnold. Former Welsh secretary Peter Hain sent his children to the school, which was the scene of the Christmas play in the film Love, Actually. David Cameron has said his children will attend state school, but George Osborne has been criticised for sending his to the fee-paying preparatory school in Kensington that he attended.","Deputy PM insists son's education is not 'political football'

Wal-mart heiress Alice Walton is requesting a 2011 driving while intoxicated arrest to be expunged from her record, and prosecutors say she's likely to get her way. The charges against Walton, 63, were dropped last month since the arresting officer wouldn't be able to testify. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, the state trooper that arrested Walton has been suspended pending an internal investiation into allegations of misconduct. The two-year statue of limitations on the charges expired on October 7. Like it never happened: 63-year-old Walmart heiress Alice Walton is requesting that a 2011 DWI arrest be taken off her record, and Parker County, Texas prosecutors say she will likely get her way . 'The case is not that credible, which is probably a reason it was laying around for a while,' said Fred Barker, assistant prosecutor for Parker County. Mr Barker wouldn't elaborate on specifics of the case and it's credibilty. He did say however, that by next month, it can't be used against Walton. 'It will cease to exist for us in any way - literally,' Barker said. 'We would not even acknoledge it ever existed nor that it was expunged, or that we ever talked to you about it. Alice Walton's mugshot after the 2011 arrest in Texas . 'There's really no way to stop it,' he said. 'Once that's done, it's gone, gone, gone.' Walton was arrested on her 62nd birthday when she was stopped at an Intestate in Parker County Texas for a traffic violation. Texas Highway patrol Trooper Gary Rozzell said at the time: 'Through an investigation at the scene, Walton was determined to be intoxicated during a field sobriety test.' He also said she refused a breath test, according to the Weatherford Democrat. She was booked and released on $1,000 bond. A statement from a family spokesman said: 'Ms Walton was pulled over by a patrolman with the Department of Public Safety for driving 71 mph in an unattended 55 mph construction zone. 'She was returning home from a birthday dinner with friends at a Fort Worth restaurant. She accepts full responsibility for this unfortunate incident and deeply regrets it.' The DUI arrest was not Walton’s first. According to information from the Springdale District Court in Arkansas, Walton was convicted of driving under the influence in a 1998 case. According to the UK's Independent, she hit a gas meter and told the responding police officer: 'I'm Alice Walton, bitch!' She paid a several hundred dollar fine in that case, according to other news reports and served no jail time. No previous conviction showed up on her criminal history so Walton was charged Friday with a first offence DWI, according to Rozzell. Alice Walton, Jim Walton (left) and Rob Walton (right), chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., speak at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in June 2012 . Previous news accounts state Walton was also involved in a 1989 wreck in Arkansas that resulted in the death of a 50-year-old woman. No charges were filed at that time. In October 2012 Walton was worth about $27 billion, making her the second-richest American woman, tenth-richest American and 14th richest person in the world. Walton purchased her first piece of art when she was about ten years old and this interest led to her spearheading the Walton Family Foundation's involvement in developing Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. She has spent over $300million building an American art museum in Arkansas, and the facilities alone cost over $100mllion.","Charges were dropped against the heiress last month when it was announced that her arresting officer wouldn't be able to testify .

Reputation trashed: Dr Edouard Yaacoub said he was driven to poverty after being struck off as a GP . A doctor has attacked the General Medical Council for 'ruining his life' when they struck him off over false sexual assault claims. Dr Eduoard Yaacoub, 50, was struck off in 2011 after a disabled woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, accused him of a variety of sexual offences including rape. The GP, who has now been cleared of any misconduct, said the four-year ordeal caused by the allegations ruined his reputation and career, leaving him in poverty. The GMC ruling which led to Egyptian-born Dr Yaacoub being struck off was quashed by the High Court last year, but he was forced to attend another hearing over the case. The panel concluded on Friday that his relationship with the patient had included 'a departure from professional standards' when he made a home visit and gave the patient a gift. But it did not take any action over the finding, and it also did not apologise for the original mistake in striking him off. The lack of repentance from the GMC also prompted an attack from Dr Yaacoub's lawyer, who called the panel 'bad losers'. Speaking outside the hearing in Manchester, Dr Yaacoub said: ‘It has ruined my life for four years. ‘I didn’t rape the patient and didn’t do anything sexual. ‘They [the GMC] are now saying I breached the doctor/patient relationship by offering a blessing,’ he added. ‘This . is ridiculous. My profession was ruined, my reputation was ruined, my . family was ruined and after four years, instead of saying sorry, they . are saying you are breaching relationships by offering a gift.’ Mary O’Rourke QC, Dr Yaacoub's defence lawyer, added: ‘As a result of these . false allegations by this witness he has suffered a loss of reputation, . profession and income. ‘His . children are living on the poverty line, he is unable to put fuel in his . car, he is unable to stay in a hotel in Manchester.’ ‘He thinks it is a conspiracy against him and you can understand why he may think that. ‘This man’s life has been ruined and I don’t see that as an understatement in any way. ‘Has the GMC offered an apology? No. Is it a case that should not have come back? Yes.' ‘I’m . asking now [for an apology], but I know he’s not going to get one because although the . GMC tells its doctors to admit when they get it wrong, it never admits . when it gets it wrong.’ It was originally alleged that Dr Yaacoub had made a visit to the patient's home uninvited after visiting earlier in the day. He was said to have forced open the legs of the patient, who suffers from spastic paraplegia, and performed a sex act in front of her. The . woman gave a number of different versions of events, and eventually told the GMC in 2011 that she had been raped. She . later repeated the claims in public when the case was re-heard in June, . telling the panel she was left feeling ‘physically sick’ by the alleged . assault. Quashed: The GMC verdict was overruled earlier this year by the High Court, which sits in The Royal Courts of Justice, pictured . During the hearing, Dr Yaacoub admitted making the initial visit on 17 January 2010, during which he offered her a small religious picture as a gift, but nothing more. The panel accepted his evidence, but said the visit was ‘a departure from professional standards’, although they decided not to impose a warning. Panel chair Gill Mullen told the doctor: ‘You have said in evidence that in your culture if one visits someone one should take a gift, but it was neither necessary for you to return to her, nor necessary for you to offer her a blessing of a religious nature. ‘Your offering of a blessing to Patient A in these circumstances was never part of the sexual allegations which the panel have rejected. ‘The panel does not regard your behaviour as amounting to misconduct which is serious or deplorable. ‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that your fitness to practise is not impaired by reason of misconduct. ‘In the panel’s judgment, however, your conduct was not merely unwise: it was a departure from standards properly expected of a doctor.’ It was after the hearing that Dr Yaacoub launched his attack on the GMC after the hearing, saying that he could have got divorced or committed suicide as a result of the ordeal. He estimates that he has also lost at least £100,000 in earnings. However, the GMC defended its role in the case, saying it 'had a duty to protect the public'. Tom Kark, QC, for the GMC, said: ‘Comments have been made by Ms O’Rourke that the GMC should apologise. ‘She spoke about the basis being poor losers and spoke about wickedness and a conspiracy. ‘The GMC has a duty to protect the public. The reasoning given by Mr Justice Kenneth Parker did not say the patient’s evidence was incredible. ‘The failure was the failure of the panel to give sufficient reasons [for the findings]. ‘Once the patient indicated a willingness to give evidence, the GMC acted absolutely appropriately in bringing the case before you and allowing you, an experienced panel, to make a decision on it.’","Dr Edouard Yaacoub, 50, was struck off in 2011 by the General Medical Council .

The tens of thousands of individual pieces, painstakingly gathered over four decades, have taken over his four-bedroomed house in Eastbourne, Sussex - much to the annoyance of his long-suffering wife Jane . But now - much to the relief of his long suffering wife Jane - the unusual haul of goods will go under the hammer on Friday, and is expected to bring more than £100,000. 'She’s never been a fan of it because it takes over the house,' Mr Burchmore said. 'She likes watching the films, but that’s as far as it goes.' Many of the 600 lots, some containing several items, were originally children’s playthings, and Friday’s sale is being handled by specialist toy auction house Vectris, of Stockton on Tees. And although individual items seem modestly priced - a rare edition of Goldfinger’s vintage Rolls Royce estimated at about £400 - it is the sheer scale which makes the collection unique. Auctioneer Andy Reed said: 'This reflects one man’s passion for collecting over about 40 years, and he has amassed everything he could related to James Bond. 'It’s unbelievable what some people will collect.' There are posters, autographs, costumes, toys, sweets, cinema tickets, movie premiere programmes, brochures, Easter eggs, bubble bath and even a pair of branded 007 shoes and ladies tights. Mr Burchmore is even selling a couple of cans of John West tuna fish - bought because the label bears a competition promoting Die Another Day. The father-of-two said he became 'hooked' on Bond at the age of eight. The bizarre haul contains posters, autographs, costumes, toys, sweets, cinema tickets, movie premiere programmes, brochures, Easter eggs, bubble bath and even a pair of branded 007 shoes and ladies tights .

'When I came out, I was hooked - the music, the action, it got my pulse racing,' he said. Later, when he left school, he said he blew his first meagre £25 pay packet on branded goods. But two . years ago, the 51-year-old was made redundant as a senior custodian . with English Heritage, and he has been able to find only part time work . since. Mr Burchmore, who has met all six Bond stars several times and became a personal friend of ‘Q’ actor Desmond Llewelyn, said: 'There are a few reasons why I’m selling - I’m 51, I can’t take it with me, and I’ve got two kids and a mortgage to support. 'I also I lost my job two years ago and I’m only in part time work at the moment, that’s how bad its been. 'Just before I was made redundant we bought a new house and I had an idea that I was gong to turn the fourth bedroom, which is like an annexe, into a private museum. 'But that’ll never happen now and I want to knock a hole in the mortgage.

Two medical marijuana patients in Michigan have won a legal battle to have their infant daughter returned to them. Maria and Steve Green's 8-month-old daughter, Bree, was placed the custody of Child Protective Services in September after it was determined that the couple could potentially be exposing the baby to marijuana. The Greens, however, are medical marijuana patients registered with the state, and are legally allowed to possess small amounts of the drug to treat various illnesses. Reunited: A Michigan couple got their daughter back after CPS took her away because they use medical marijuana . Happy: CPS was concerned that the baby might be exposed to marijuana - even if it's for medicinal use . Proud papa: The Greens have been fighting to get Bree back since she was taken in early September . On Friday, an Ingham County judge signed off on a deal that would allow the baby to be returned to the Greens. 'I'm ecstatic,' Maria Green told reporters outside of the courtroom. Steve Green added, 'Bree will be in her own bed tonight. We’re going to hug her and read to her and love her.' The deal acknowledges that the couple are legal medical marijuana patients - a big deal in a state that has been polarized over the issue since medical marijuana was legalized in 2008. The deal also requires the couple to attend parenting classes. Steve Green, 34, is a former auto mechanic who suffers from severe epileptic seizures. After trying dozens of other medications, he found that t he only thing drug that helped him manage his seizures is marijuana. Medicine: Steve Green says marijuana is the only thing that helps his severe epileptic seizures . Maria Green, 31, is a former teacher who suffers from multiple sclerosis. Both she and her husband are state-approved medical marijuana users. The couple was charged earlier this year with manufacturing marijuana, which is a felony punishable by four years in prison, after authorities found marijuana plants growing in their home. Friday's ruling grants the couple permission to continue growing the plants. The charges against the couple have since been dropped. 'We said we’re going to let the parents medicate (with marijuana) but . not around the children, just what they’ve been doing all along, and . allow some type of regular testing of the baby, maybe a mouth swab,' to . prove that Bree was not being exposed, the couple's attorney, Joshua Covert, told the Detroit Free Press. Bree was taken from the Greens on September 13, when CPS caseworkers came to their home and stripped her from her mother's arms. Sick: Maria Green, a former teacher, uses marijuana to treat multiple slerosis . Cutie pie: Baby Bree has become a symbol in the ongoing debate over medical marijuana in Michigan . 'I was there and I have to tell you - that was hard to watch,' Covert said. The baby's removal sparked protest from medical marijuana advocates across the country. The 'Free Baby Bree' movement began as attention to the case began to mount.

'Take responsibility': Brandon Lewis MP, pictured, said that it was not the Government's place to ban fast food . Britain’s struggling high streets need fast food restaurants which are ‘massively important’ to millions of shoppers, a Tory minister has claimed. Brandon Lewis, the new high streets minister, said it would be ‘wholly wrong’ for the Government to try to ban junk food from town centres. Instead people had to take responsibility for their own diet, and not eat junk food ‘three times a day’. The coalition has faced repeated criticism for opting to strike voluntary ‘responsibility deals’ with food and drink firms instead of imposing bans or levies. Three years ago David Cameron suggested he could enforce a ‘fat tax’ on products like pizza and processed food to limit the impact on the nation’s health. But Mr Lewis warned it would be ‘socialist’ to force the fast food chains off Britain’s high streets. The likes of McDonald's and Burger King are big employers and have come to dominate high streets because people choose to eat there, he added. ‘Labour kept having a go at fast food places when actually McDonald's, Burger King… those kind of places, whichever your fast food place of choice is, are massively important,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘They are massive employers, they are not coming to the high streets to annoy us. They are coming to the high streets because we all go to McDonalds, or whatever our personal taste is.’ Individuals had to be ‘responsible’ for what they eat, he added. ‘I’ve got to take responsibility for . me and my family and actually McDonalds or Burger King is fine now and . again but we shouldn’t be eating it three times a day.’ ‘If we want to get people eating more healthily then we have to educate people around that and the obesity issue.’ 'Massively important: Brandon Lewis said fast-food chains like McDonald's and Burger King are good for Britain . It would be ‘wholly wrong’ for ministers in Whitehall to ‘to try and dictate’ where people eat. ‘They are employers. They are valuable businesses,’ he said. Last week the government faced criticism over a ‘responsibility deal’ to cut saturated fat levels in food. Morrisons, Subway and Nestle were among the firms to sign up to the commitment. But Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the approach ‘lacked credibility’.","Brandon Lewis says it would be ‘socialist’ to dictate firms opening in town centres .

The son of a British submariner who died in 1933 has claimed Chinese authorities dug up his father's grave and used the headstone for building walls. Charles Sells Jr, from Plymouth, is demanding to know what has become of his father's remains after learning the former graveyard in Weihaiwei, north of Shandong province, has become nothing but an overgrown corner of a Chinese naval facility. His father, Charles Sells Sr,  was buried at the site which sat on British-leased land alongside dozens of military personnel who died aboard navy vessels. The headstone of Charles Sells Sr has been removed by Chinese authorities from a graveyard in Shangdong and used to build walls, his son, Charles Sells Jr (right) has claimed . His son is now calling for a full account of what happened to the former servicemen and their graves. 'These people want an explanation or an apology and I support them. After all is said and done it is British military personnel who died . there.' The Petty Officer was on board HMS Proteus when he was crushed to death by a torpedo against the submarine's bulkhead . The news was brought to Mr Sells attention when a British television crew travelled to Shangdong last year to film a documentary, but found there were no headstones at the site when they arrived. 'If there was a memorial for Naval and military personnel who died over there I think that would be nice. 'I thought people in this area should be aware of the situation in . China - I can't be alone in having someone whose remains are out there. 'Some of the crew members who died may have relatives in Plymouth. 'I would like to know what has happened to my father's remains, the 81-year-old added. Mr Sells never met his father who was a Petty Officer on HMS Proteus when he was crushed to death after one of the submarine's torpedos slammed his body against the bulkhead. The weapon was being loaded on to the submarine using a new type of strapping which snapped, causing the fatal accident. The scandal surrounding the graveyard - . which was seized back by Chinese forces during the Communist revolution . - comes four years after it was revealed Chinese authorities had raised . the  HMS Poseidon. It is thought some of the 21 British servicemen who died when the vessel sank were also buried at the cemetery. Secretary of the Royal Naval . Association in Plymouth, Arthur Gutteridge, said: 'I wasn't a submariner . but I'm sure all submariners throughout the Royal Navy will be totally . disappointed. 'It's completely out of order. 'It's sacrilege and bad news. It's a question of who is telling the truth. 'The fact is headstones won't be lying on the ground if there wasn't anything underneath them. The graveyard's sat on land that had been leased by British authorities but was reclaimed during the Communist revolution . 'Chinese . culture is different to us in the West, but I thought everybody across . the world has the same respect for military graves. 'It is disappointing news.' A spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said the site was declared 'unmaintainable' in the 1930s. HMS Proteus was the longest surviving Parthian-class submarine and the only one of its kind to survive the war . Charles Sells Jr was never able to meet his father who died at the age of 36. The 81-year-old is calling for a full account of what happened to his father's remains . Following the cultural revolution in China it 'simply wasn't possible for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to get into the country, and a decision was made to do an alternative commemoration in Hong Kong,' he added. The Royal Navy had a large presence in China from the late 1800s to the 20th century. The city of Weihaiwei was part of the British leased territory known as the Weihai Garrison, and was a regular port of call for Royal Navy ships and submarines. HMS Proteus was the longest surviving Parthian-class submarine and the only one of its kind to survive the war.","Charles Sells Sr was buried at the site in Weihaiwei, Shangdong, after being killed on board HMS Proteus .

"Three former Penn State administrators . await trial in Harrisburg on charges they engaged in a criminal cover-up . By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:24 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:31 EST, 28 October 2013 . Penn State is paying $59.7 million to 26 young men who endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, they announced today. The university said it had concluded negotiations that have lasted about a year. The school said 23 deals are fully signed and three are agreements in principle. The school faces six other claims, and the university says it believes some do not have merit while others may produce settlements. Penn State said the day Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 of 45 criminal counts that it was determined to compensate his victims. Payout: Penn State said 23 deals are fully signed and three are agreements in principle. Sandusky, 69, is serving a 30-to-60-year prison sentence at a state prison in southwestern Pennsylvania . The settlements have been unfolding since mid-August, when attorneys for the accusers began to disclose them. Penn State followed a policy in which it has not been confirming them, waiting instead to announce deals at once. Penn State has spent more than $50 million on other costs related to the Sandusky scandal, including lawyers' fees, public relations expenses, and adoption of new policies and procedures related to children and sexual abuse complaints. Sandusky, 69, has been pursuing appeals while he serves a 30-to-60-year prison sentence. Three former Penn State administrators await trial in Harrisburg on charges they engaged in a criminal cover-up of the Sandusky scandal. Former president Graham Spanier, retired vice president Gary Schultz and retired athletic director Tim Curley deny the allegations, and a trial date has not been scheduled. Eight young men testified against Sandusky, describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling, oral sex and anal rape when they were boys. Sandusky did not testify at his trial but has long asserted his innocence. He has acknowledged he showered with boys but insisted he never molested them. The abuse scandal rocked Penn State, bringing down football coach Joe Paterno and leading college sports' governing body, the NCAA, to levy unprecedented sanctions against the university's football program. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky (shown in June 2012) will not get a new trial after being convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys . Victims who had not come forward with their . allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 have been granted . settlements by the Pennsylvania university . Among those who reached settlements were some who testified at Sandusky's trial last year. Harrisburg attorney Chuck Schmidt confirmed his client has settled, as did Williamsport attorney Clifford Rieders. 'He is a very responsible, . thoughtful, intelligent man,' Rieders said of his client. 'His reaction is that this was a terrible tragedy and he'd like to move . on with his life and get the help he needs for a meaningful life.' Rieders said his client was paid Sept. 30. Schmidt said his received a check about two weeks ago. Philadelphia attorney Tom Kline . previously announced his client had settled, as did the Philadelphia . firm Ross Feller, which represents seven. Settled: Matt Sandusky, right, the adopted son . of former Penn State University assistant football coach settled with . the university over sex abuse claims on Friday . Three former Penn State . administrators are awaiting trial in Harrisburg for what prosecutors say . was a criminal cover-up of complaints about Sandusky. Former president Graham Spanier, . former vice president Gary Schultz and former athletic director Tim . Curley have all denied the allegations. Last month, the convicted pedophile was denied a new trial. The unanimous decision by a . three-judge Superior Court panel on Wednesday came barely two weeks . after they heard oral arguments by Sandusky's lawyer and a state . prosecutor. Defense lawyer Norris Gelman said he planned to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case. Sandusky had argued his trial lawyers . did not have sufficient time to prepare, a prosecutor made improper . references to him not testifying on his own behalf and the judge . mishandled two jury instructions. The opinion by Judge Jack Panella . said trial judges have discretion about whether to allow pretrial . delays, and that in Sandusky's case the judge carefully considered the . continuance requests. 'The . decision does not reflect a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in . the face of Sandusky's request; it was not an arbitrary denial,' Panella . wrote. Sandusky had wanted . the trial judge, John Cleland, to give jurors an instruction about the . amount of time it took for nearly all of the victims to report their . allegations. A sad ending: Legendary Penn State football . coach Joe Paterno was fired before the end of the 2011 season amid the . scandal and died only months later . Panella . wrote that Cleland should have evaluated the need for such a jury . instruction based on each victim's age and maturity, but Cleland's . failure to do so did not harm Sandusky. 'The trial court specifically instructed . the jury that they were to consider any possible motives of the victims . in coming forward,' Panella wrote. 'The vigorous cross-examination of . the victims and arguments by defense counsel, when combined with the . trial court's instructions on credibility, clearly defined the issues . for the jury.' The issue related to Sandusky not testifying was not properly preserved for appeals court review, Panella wrote. The appeals court also turned down . another jury instruction claim, related to weighing a defendant's good . character against the allegations. Messages left for a spokesman for the attorney general's office were not immediately returned.","The university said 23 deals have been fully signed and three are on their way .

That report led investigators to discover a more serious incident in which a student claims McCullough raped her. Scroll down for video . Shop teacher arrested: 29-year-old shop teacher Todd McCullough was arrested yesterday morning at Saltsburg High School, where he allegedly raped a student last spring . Scene of the crime: According to the criminal complaint against McCullough, the rape happened in a Saltsburg High School classroom . The 16-year-old victim says McCullough sexually harassed her on several occasions last spring, culminating in the rape. At first, it started with touching and compliments. According to the criminal complaint, McCullough 'physically touched the (16-year-old) victim's hips from behind with both hands, massaged the victim's shoulders and complimented her on her appearance'. On another occasion, McCullough 'told the victim that she was looking ""hot"" and that his girlfriend was going to be away this weekend'. At one point he lured her into a small isolated back room off the shop area and exposed himself to her. The school bell rang and she fled the room, avoiding class for a week. Days later he apologized but that didn't stop him from continuing to her harass her. Unrelenting: McCullough's 16-year-old victim says he made several unwelcome advances on her and even apologized for his behavior before eventually raping her in a classroom's back room last spring . After apologizing, he asked her on several occasions to show him her breasts - which she refused. Then he asked her to stay after class and again led her into the back room. This time he raped her. After that, she says he attempted to keep her quiet by threatening her reputation. 'I hope you are mature about this, it's not only my (expletive) on the line, it's your (expletive) too,' he said.

Officials have announced that Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, a Minnesota couple who perform as folk duo Flora Cash, were the couple questioned at Pompeys Pillar several weeks ago after setting off a silent alarm. It wasn't until a week later that a staff member inspecting the grounds noticed that the monument, inscribed with Captain William Clark's signature in 1806, had been vandalized. Officials have not named the man arrested in connection to the crime, but all evidence points towards Cole Randall, who visited the monument with his partner Shpresa Lieshiaj. Crazy in love: Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, aka Flora Cash, visited Pompeys Pillar and left an inscription of their names on it . 'Senseless vandalism': A man has been arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark . The carving, which reads ‘Cole + . Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart, was found by shocked deputies at . the famous monument in Montana. Ignoring . the warning signs, security cameras and railings, a man from Minnesota . admitted to the crime, which has been described as a ‘senseless act of . vandalism’. The man now faces charges under federal law which protects national monuments. The 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the western region of America. Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com: ‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to something that has historical and cultural importance.’ National monument: Deputies were alarmed to find the carving so close to this historical etching, one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition . A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10. A man and a woman were questioned and their contact details recorded but it was not until a week later that the love message was found by an employee. Reviewing security footage, the suspected culprit was soon found according to Peart. He said: ‘These National treasures should be treated with respect and those who don't need to be punished.’ The man is yet to be officially identified as the BLM continues to investigate. According to WDEF.com, Montana/Dakotas BLM spokesman Melodie Lloyd said that the suspect had been apprehended and charges are yet to be filed. Consequences: The couple were questioned after setting off a silent alarm but when the vandalism was discovered officials sought a more serious response . Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley . To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar. The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature. Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago. The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001.

A Victorian action hero who chased volcanoes around the world more than a century ago is honoured in a new exhibition featuring the photographs he risked his life to take. Tempest Anderson was the . world's first volcano-chaser, scaling the world's most dangerous slopes in his quest to photograph volcanoes as they erupted. Born in York in 1846, Anderson's extraordinary derring-do took him to the mouth of the most famous volcanoes: he saw Vesuvius, Krakatoa, and, in 1902, the 20th century's worst volcanic eruption. La Soufrière, which devastated the islands of Martinique and St Vincent in the West Indies. Tempest Anderson, the world's first volcano-chaser, risked his life to get photographs like this, of Vesuvius erupting, long before the days of health and safety rules . Smoke and lava billowing out of its angry mouth, the volcano on Stromboli in Italy couldn't frighten Tempest Anderson, who got close up to photograph it . Anderson put his life on the line time and again to take pictures of fire-spewing volcanoes - resulting in an astonishing collection of 5,000 photographs and artefacts. Now, a century after Anderson died on a boat on his way home from an exploration, the Yorkshire Museum is displaying the works of a brave Yorkshireman whose exploits captured the hearts and minds of the residents of his home city. The museum's curator, Emma Williams, said: 'Tempest Anderson was one of York’s pioneering figures and made valuable contributions to medicine, photography and volcanology. 'It was the latter for which he became well known and he travelled all over the world to see the latest eruptions - sometimes risking his life.  He was one of York's most colourful characters.' Born when Queen Victoria was just a few years into her reign, Anderson attended St Peter's School in York and then University College London where he trained as a doctor and specialised in ophthalmology. Returning to his home city, he worked as an ophthalmic surgeon at York County Hospital while developing interests in the then-emerging field of photography and also glaciers.  This developed into a fascination with vulcanology, and as his knowledge grew, he set off on trips around the world - always involving long boat journeys - to see the volcanoes at first hand. Anderson, an eye surgeon, was also fascinated by the volcanic aftermath: this image shows the island of St Vincent after it was destroyed by a volcano in 1902 . A community torn apart: Anderson, who never married, took this picture of St Pierre, Martinique, after the massive eruption there . Devastation on St Vincent: Anderson was the first to discover how the eruption and resulting devastation occurred - he worked it out by studying avalanches . His love of volcanoes and incessant thirst to see them erupting, as well as to photograph the aftermath, meant that by 1900 Anderson had visited and photographed most European volcanoes as well as those of Iceland and the US. He made his name in scientific circles with his clear descriptive and photographic records of a ‘pyroclastic flow’ (or ‘nuie ardente’) - terrifyingly rapid and destructive flow of gases and hot rock that flows out of volcanoes. Anderson witnessed this at first hand in 1902 as he watched the hot blast of gases from Mont Pelie that destroyed the port town of St Pierre, on Martinique. He worked out the physics behind this phenomenon and found that it was not dissimilar to a particular type of avalanche that he had seen the devastating effects of in the Alps. The exhibition at the Yorkshire Museum showcases a selection of photographs taken from his vast collection and artefacts similar to those Anderson took on his trips around the world, such as a magic lantern, a pinhole camera, pocket watch and his telephone, which was the first ever telephone in York. Tempest, who never married, died in 1913 on the Red Sea on the way home from his last trip, and was buried at Suez. Anderson never married, devoting himself instead to a life filled with death-defying trips to see the world's deadliest volcanoes - this is Vesuvius near Naples in Italy . Scorched earth: This picture, taken in 1902, shows the ruined landscape on St Vincent in the West Indies after the Soufrière volcano erupted there . This photograph, one of thousands taken by the Victorian explorer, shows the devastation wreaked by the 1902 eruption which devastated St Vincent and Martinique . Around 5,000 photographs, artefacts and maps make up the exhibition about the life and discoveries of York's own action-hero, Tempest Anderson, born there in 1846 . Tribute to an action hero from a century ago: The exhibition at the Yorkshire Museum is being staged to mark 100 years since Anderson's death .","Tempest Anderson, who was born in York in 1846, was a fearless explorer who discovered how volcanoes erupted .

A child killer was allowed to work in a charity shop before he went on the run from prison. Alan Giles, 56, had a row with a woman charity shop worker while on day release before he absconded from jail and it was recommended that he be removed from open conditions, a whistleblower at the prison has claimed. He was serving two life sentences for the kidnap and murder of 16-year-old Kevin Ricketts when he went missing from HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, last week. Alan Giles (left), 56, who kidnapped and murdered 16-year-old Kevin Ricketts (right) in 1995, was allowed to work in Sue Ryder charity shops before escaping from HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, last week . The 56-year-old had been deemed ‘low risk’ and was being held in open conditions. And he was allowed to work at Sue Ryder charity shops in Alcester and Leamington Spa on a community work programme before he went on the run. A spokesman for the shop said they decided to end Giles' placement in August after liaising with the prison. A whistleblower claimed that Giles had a row with a woman who worked in the Alcester shop. He further claimed that a recommendation was made to remove Giles from open conditions five days before he absconded. He said that there are also concerns that Giles disappeared last Sunday night, but that guards only discovered he had gone at Monday lunchtime because had been staying in an annexe that had not been checked. The revelations come as West Mercia Police step up patrols to find Giles, warning the public not to approach him, but to dial 999 or 101. Posters have been put up in shop windows across Alcester, where he is thought to have been spotted. Officers have also been travelling in a TV advert van through the Warwickshire towns of Alcester, Inkeberrow, Studley and Wixford during the search. Specialist search teams with dogs and helicopters are also scouring the local areas. Police believe Giles may be sleeping rough in woodland or farm buildings. Officers have also visited caravan sites and made further house-to-house inquiries for information. Giles had a row with a woman charity shop worker while on day release before he absconded from jail . Giles, originally from Oldbury, murdered Kevin, from Quinton, Birmingham, after kidnapping him as he made his way home from a college woodwork class on January 31, 1995. Months earlier, Giles had split up acrimoniously with Kevin's older sister, leaving her with their young child. He murdered Kevin in revenge and was jailed in 1997 while Kevin's body still hadn't been found. After serving 12 months, Giles rang detectives from his cell to reveal that he had buried Kevin's body in a house in Edgbaston. It was three-and-a-half years since he had murdered him. The Ministry of Justice said it was investigating the escape and could not comment on the claims. Giles was being held in open conditions at HMP Hewell along with other killers, sex offenders and offenders locked up for arson with intent, the whistleblower alleged. He claimed that housing such dangerous offenders at the lock-up where Category B and Category D prisoners are kept was putting staff and inmates at risk. He also said there were barely enough prison officers to cover night time patrols because of budget cuts. Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty . He added: ‘There is no way that a schedule one offender like Alan Giles would have been placed into open conditions in the past. ‘But Alan Giles is just the tip of the iceberg. It used to be very strict, but that is not the case now. There are sex offenders, killers and arsonists walking around in open conditions and nothing can stop them walking down the road and catching a bus. ‘The result is that people like Giles are free to walk straight out of the front doors. We have a situation at night where the staffing has been cut from five down to three when it is at its most vulnerable.’ The whistleblower said the merger of what was Hewell Grange with HMP Blakenhurst to form the new Hewell Complex also led to a massively diluted criteria for prisoners being accepted into open areas. He added: ‘We are now seeing the direct results of these changes and increased staff cuts on the ability of staff to properly monitor prisoners. ‘This is not about trying to scare people - it's about letting the public know what is really going on behind those walls. ‘There are prisoners in there who have serious convictions for some really heinous crimes. ‘I am amazed that they have been put in open conditions - it's unbelievable. There are other establishments in the country who are far more capable of coping with these kinds of offenders. ‘When staff raise concerns the big stick that is used is that the prison could be privatised, but we probably already have lower levels of staff than in the private sector.’ A spokesman for the Prison Service said an investigation into the absconding of Giles was ongoing and that all prisoners in open conditions were 'rigorously risk assessed' and approved to transfer by the Parole Board. HMP Hewell - which is governed by . Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a . scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said . it was unacceptably dirty. The . report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were . high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs . and some staff seemed to lack motivation. It . also said: ‘Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been . “cleaned” by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the . exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.’ The . prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender . Management Service said the management team had been strengthened. He added: ‘This is now a matter for the police and we are supporting them in their investigation. ‘The number of absconds from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began, and all those located in open prisons have been rigorously risk assessed and deemed suitable for open conditions. ‘We are not complacent about this issue and are looking at ways in which the risk of absconding can be reduced further. ‘For the vast majority of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, which includes those on life sentences, transfer to open conditions follows a recommendation by the independent Parole Board. Anyone who does abscond will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges.’ Tracy Mealing, head of volunteering at Sue Ryder, said: ‘For the past six years, Sue Ryder has successfully been running a prisoner volunteer programme. ‘This is with risk-assessed prisoners, who are eligible to work out in the community. This partnership with the prison service has helped raise vital funds from our shops, whilst also supporting the prisoners' resettlement.’ She said Giles worked in its Alcester shop in June this year and in July was transferred to the Leamington Spa shop. ‘In August, a decision was taken in consultation with the prison to end Mr Giles volunteering with Sue Ryder,’ she said. ‘All prisoners that volunteer at Sue Ryder have been through a robust and rigorous risk assessment process to ensure the safety of Sue Ryder staff, our volunteers and shoppers.’ Detective Inspector Leighton Harding said: ‘If anyone spots Giles we would ask that they call us immediately so that we can respond to the call straight away - any delay in contacting us, even if it's just to take a little time to get home, may mean we lose the opportunity to capture Giles if it is actually him who has been spotted. Please do not approach him, call us on 999 or 101 as soon as possible.’ Redditch Conservative MP Karen Lumley said she was meeting the prison's governor to discuss Giles' disappearance. She said she expected to be given a full account of what happened in ‘this very serious case’.","Alan Giles, 56, was serving two life sentences for the murder of 16-year-old .

When Hollywood celebrities start planning to build their extravagant mansions and perfect faux palaces, there is one person they all turn to: Richard Landry. The famous architect to the stars is currently putting the last touches on his most recent Hollywood project for actor Mark Wahlberg, who head-hunted him two years ago to create his dream home on his 6-acre piece of prime Beverly Hills property in Beverly Park. The Quebec-born architect has designed houses for an abundance of celebrities, including Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Adrienne Maloof, Sugar Ray Leonard, Michael Bolton and Rod Stewart, among many others. He also designed the house where Michael Jackson spent his last days before he died. Architect to the stars: Architect Richard Landry, right, recently finished Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg's, left, French manor-style mansion in Beverly Hills. Landry has designed many celebrity houses . Almost done: Mark Wahlberg's new 30,000 square foot French manor-style mansion is getting its final touches by architect Landry . In a rare interview, he shares his secrets of success in Tinseltown and why all the stars go to him. He says he never makes the same house twice and cookie-cutting is just not his style. And he would never dream of repeating a floor plan. ‘I never copy myself. Nobody else has a Gisele house, even if they wanted it.’ Wahlberg's house is a $14 million French manor-style mansion with a home theatre, wine cellar, large-scale gym, a double-height, wood-paneled library, a putting green and a large, rock-scaped pool with a waterfall and diving rock that Landry had built into the hillside location. There is also a 2,200-square-foot loggia with coffered ceilings, limestone floors and a fireplace. The only thing the outdoor room will lack, Landry says, are glass windows, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The project, which has been under construction for nearly two years with builder John Finton, emcompasses 30,000 square feet of indoor space, including the main house and the guest buildings. It is a step up from Wahlberg’s former Beverly Hills residence, which sold in October for $12.995 million and measured a mere 11,500 square feet. Landry’s last project was supermodel . Gisele Bundchen and footballer husband Tom Brady’s eco-manse in . Brentwood, which is almost half the size of Wahlberg’s new home.

Eco-manse: Landry's last project was supermodel Gisele Bundchen and her footballer husband Tom Brady's mansion in Brentwood, which is almost half the size of Wahlberg's new home . But for Landry, it is not about the bigger the better. ‘My goal always has to go with finding the right proportions. It is not about building bigger and bigger homes,’ says Landry to the Hollywood Reporter. In the case of Wahlberg’s house, he says there are ‘no ginormous rooms’. ‘There’s no ballroom, no bowling alley, no indoor basketball court. I've done most of those kinds of things in other projects, but here it's really a good traditional family house with no craziness to it.’ The architect is also doing projects around the world, including a 32,000-square-foot contemporary in Bahrain, a 200,000-square-foot French-style single-family home near Shanghai and a 250,000-square-foot, eight-building, hypermodern compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Rod Stewart certainly didn't hold back when he asked Landry to design his house . Then there's the high-end subdivision in Qingdao, China, that will include 40 homes that will be 25,000 square feet each. ‘For all of these, I'll be using the same materials I use here -- French limestone, bronze windows, Vermont slate. Those are the kinds of products going into these homes,’ he says. Countless other projects in China, Malaysia and Japan also are being developed by Landry, along with his staff of 45. He says he is very passionate about smaller projects. Same designer: Football player Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bundchen also had their house designed by Landry . ‘We just finished a 4,000-square-foot guest cottage in Malibu. It was just a little folly, and that is just as fun for me.’ Landry has been on the Architectural Digest's AD100 list four times since 2000 and in 2004 he was presented with the prestigious Stars of Design award from the Pacific Design Center. In 2007 he became a part of the ‘Robb Report Recommended’ list of best architects, and in 2013, a bluffside 23,000-square-foot mansion he designed in Malibu with views of Lake Sherwood and the Santa Monica Mountains, was selected by Robb Report as their Ultimate Home in 2013. Landry also designed the home of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, who ended up selling it for an astounding $20 million dollars. Extravagant: Landry also designed the home of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof which had a purple staircase in the lobby . Many homes: Landry designed the house that Michael Jackson, left, spent his last days while preparing for his tour. The architect also designed the home where Maloof, right, lived, which was sold for $20 million . The French chateau-style estate was purchased for $12.708 million in 2004. The eight bedroom, 11 bathroom estate had been featured often on her hit reality show, and it boasts a wine cellar, gym and screening room, a pool, and a guest house. Landry also famously designed the house in which Michael Jackson spent his last days before his death in 2009.

Freya James, eight, who died after bumping into another child at school and suffering internal bleeding . An eight-year-old girl who died after a playground game of British Bulldog had such a ‘massive’ liver rupture it was as if she had been punched by a boxer, an inquest heard today. Freya James suffered a four-and-a-half inch tear to her vital organ after she was hit by a boy playing the traditional game and fell on an ornamental playground feature made from a recycled railway sleeper, an inquest into her death heard. A pathologist told a jury at West London Coroner's Court that Freya, a pupil at Trafalgrar Junior School in Twickenham, south west London, died of internal bleeding caused by the huge tear on her liver. Freya was playing a different game during her lunch break when she was hit by the boy playing British Bulldog on Valentine's Day this year. Despite her serious injury, the schoolgirl had to walk between five and 10 metres to a first aid room. Paramedics arrived at the school within 15 minutes, but Freya died in hospital two hours later without her family having the chance to say goodbye. A post-mortem found Freya’s injury was consistent with ‘blunt force trauma.’  As a result she suffered a ‘large liver laceration which caused massive internal bleeding,’ the jury at West London Coroner’s Court heard. Pathologist Dr Andreas Marnerides said after the collision with the 11-year-old boy on Valentine’s Day this year Freya would have deteriorated ‘within minutes.’ Freya's parents Anekke and Nick James, pictured outside West London Coroner's Court, want Bulldog banned . Jurors heard her eyes began to open and close, her limbs started to stiffen and she turned pale and clammy. Asked if it would have been obvious she was seriously injured, Dr Marnerides said: 'It would have been clear to a trained paramedic or at least highly suspicious that there was something seriously wrong.' The inquest heard the boy was running at a speed of ‘eight out of 10’ when he crashed into her and had to swerve to avoid another boy moments before. Coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said that at the time he was playing the rough tag-based game Bulldog, while Freya was playing another running game called Jails, where players pretend to be policeman and catch burglars. He said: 'At about 1.15pm, there was a collision between a boy who was playing Bulldog, and Freya.  They were in different years, and may well not even have known each other to talk to. School: Freya was playing in the playground at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham when she was injured . 'As a result, she fell, and in falling struck one of the sleepers that was in the playground.' When asked if the injury could have been caused by the boy himself rather than the sleeper, the pathologist replied: 'No.The kind of trauma I saw here required a very high impact, like a boxer throwing a punch.' Dr Marnerides, of St Thomas' Hospital in south London, who carried out the post-mortem, was also asked if Freya would have suffered the same injury if she had just fallen on the playground. He said: 'If the velocity was the same but the surface was different the impact would have been different.' Asked if such incidents were common . in playgrounds, he said: 'I’m not aware of the exact statistical . numbers, but I’ve seen it before.' The jury at West London Coroner's Court heard that Freya died before her parents could say goodbye to her . The inquest heard that a teaching assistant noticed Freya sitting . on the floor surrounded by other girls.  She approached her and Freya told her she 'hurt her tummy', the coroner said. Teaching assistant Caroline Seabrook said it was not apparent that day that Bulldog was being played. Asked if it had been identified as an inappropriate game, she said: 'I don't really know.' She added: 'When very large groups of children charge across the playground, that's when we intervene.' Ms Seabrook told the jury that the boy had come up to her and told her he had 'accidentally banged into her'. She said she took Freya to a classroom where another woman, Annabelle Hogg, helped her.  Ms Seabrook said Freya was sick and looked as if she was about to pass out. The women tipped Freya's chair back to raise her feet higher, but said her 'legs failed'. 'I was holding her hand and stroking her head.  She wasn't talking but she would look at us, she was going in and out of consciousness.' - teaching assistant Caroline Seabrook . She said: 'I ran to the office to get them to call an ambulance, and ran back again, and Mrs Hogg had put her in the recovery position. I was holding her hand and stroking her head. 'She wasn't talking, but she would look at us, she was going in and out of consciousness.' Detective Inspector Andrew Dunn told the inquest that the boy who ran into Freya had been open in his answers to police after the accident. He said: 'I have found no sign of malice or criminal intent, and haven't submitted a file to the Crown Prosection Service.' The inquest heard that the first paramedic arrived at 1.30pm, and an ambulance 10 minutes later.  Oxygen was given and she left in the ambulance at 1.50pm, arriving at West Middlesex Hospital at 2pm. However despite intense efforts to save the little girl's life, she died just before 4pm that afternoon, before her parents were able to reach her bedside. The conclusion of the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem on Freya was that she died as a result of internal bleeding from the liver laceration. Since her death, Freya’s parents Nick and Anekke James, from Twickenham, have called for a nationwide ban on British Bulldog in playgrounds. Mr James, 42, said : ‘I hope our daughter’s death will lead to a more widespread ban.’ The inquest, which is expected to last three days, continues.

Former vicar Stephen Brooks, who was jailed for carrying out 19 sex attacks in Swansea, South Wales, during the 1980s and 1990s, quit his job as a director at Santander after the truth about his abusive background came to light. The 59-year-old preyed on young boys over a seven-year period while working as a clergyman at St Paul's Church in Sketty and was given a four-year prison sentence in 1994. Scroll down for video . Shamed: Stephen Brooks, pictured judging the 'responsible small business of the year award' resigned after he was exposed as a convicted paedophile . Eight of his victims are said to have suffered mental problems and one 38-year-old is said to have attempted suicide and turned to alcohol as a result. Santander told The Sun they were 'shocked' to learn of his criminal history and confirmed he had quit his role after taking 'immediate steps' to resolve the matter. Brooks moved to London to get away from the people he had abused and rose to become regional director of education, healthcare and communities at the bank.

Cooladdi was originally named 'Yarronvale', and was changed to its present name in 1913, . Cooladdi, being aboriginal for 'Black Duck'.

She said: 'He said to me, ""If it came down to a fight with Alex Ferguson, I'd beat him"". 'I asked why. He said, ""Because I'm a faster runner"". He thought that was funny. To me it's the words of a coward.' Miss Jonsson also said Eriksson often moaned his £4million England job was boring as they were only playing one game a month. She described making love with Eriksson as 'devoid of passion' but said her fellow Swede loved to ‘talk dirty’ in broken English when they were in bed together. Speaking in response to Mr Eriksson's . tell-all book, serialised in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, Miss . Jonsson said Eriksson lived in fear of his ‘feisty fruitcake’ girlfriend . Nancy Dell’olio who slapped him when their secret affair was exposed. But she claimed the Italian should be grateful for the scandal because it made her famous. Sven-Goran Eriksson (right) apparently 'hated' Sir Alex Ferguson (left) according to the former England manager's ex-lover Ulrika Jonsson . Miss Jonsson’s affair with Eriksson began in January 2002, a month after they first met at a party. Eriksson acknowledged his affair with Miss Jonsson for the first time in our excerpts from his autobiography. He revealed that it started when they met for the second time at a function in Manchester. He . wrote: ‘I was there with some people from the FA. For some reason, . Ulrika was also invited. We met at the hotel the evening before and . ended up spending the night together. ‘After that, Ulrika and I met when we could. Not daily, but now and then. It got to be more and more serious. ‘Nancy . did not suspect anything. She was travelling to Italy a lot during that . time. Once, Ulrika and I went to Portugal for a few days. Mostly we met . at her house outside London.’ Mr . Goran Eriksson said that that his then girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio . regarded Miss Jonsson as 'little more than a prostitute' in an extract . from his book serialised by the Daily Mail this week . He said Miss Dell’Olio was livid when she found out about the secret relationship when it was revealed by a Sunday newspaper. ‘To Nancy, Ulrika was little more than a prostitute who was not worthy of being on the same planet as Miss Dell’Olio,’ he wrote. ‘Nancy’s mother called from Italy. She had read the story online — Italy was an hour ahead of England. ‘Nancy was livid, she said: “Was it true?” I said it was nothing to worry or get upset about, or something to that effect.’ Mr . Eriksson, now a football coach in China, said he did not feel he had . anything to apologise for and claimed he received a positive reaction . from the public. ‘I got . a lot of “thumbs up” from young men who laughed and said they wished it . had been them getting together with a beautiful woman like Ulrika.'","Ulrika Jonsson said Eriksson and Ferguson had 'explosive rows'

"Thorsten Heins to be replaced as CEO as company expects to lose $1bn . By . Reuters  and Andy Milne . PUBLISHED: . 09:31 EST, 4 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:49 EST, 4 November 2013 . Struggling cell phone manufacturer Blackberry today fired its CEO and announced that the sale of  the company to a billionaire's investment group has fallen through. The Canadian pioneer of the smartphone industry expects to make a loss of a billion dollars this year after disastrous sales of its new handsets and plans to lay off 4,500 staff. Directors had been trying to rescue the firm with a sale to its largest shareholder Canadian investment consortium Fairfax, headed by billionaire Prem Watsa. But Fairfax reportedly struggled to finance its $4.7bn takeover, and Blackberry now plans to replace its CEO Thorsten Heins and raise about $1 billion from institutional investors. German-Canadian Heins had been CEO of the firm since January 2012 and oversaw the release of a new series of poorly-received handsets running the Blackberry 10 operating system. Axed: Blackberry President and CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured, attempted to boost the Canadian firm's poor sales over the past year through a series of releases, including the Q10, pictured. But it wasn't enough. It is another dramatic development in . the decline of the cell phone manufacturer, which has seen its devices . eclipsed by smartphone Apple and Samsung. Shares . of BlackBerry dropped 19 percent to $6.33 in premarket trading. Fairfax . announced a tentative $9-a-share offer for the Waterloo, Ontario-based . company in late September. But Reuters said on Friday that Fairfax was . struggling to finance the $4.7 billion bid. They never had any money beyond the Fairfax money,"" BGC analyst Colin Gillis said. ""It's an under $5 billion market cap company with $2 billion in cash, you put up a $1 billion and you couldn't get the rest?"" Heins will be replaced temporarily by John Chen who was formerly CEO of Sybase, a database software company while the company searches for a new CEO. BlackBerry . began trading in 1999 as an arm of Candian firm Research in Motion. The . company changed its name to BlackBerry earlier this year. It . carried out a high profile launch of two new handsets at the start of . the year - the much delayed Z10 touchscreen and Q10 with a qwerty . keyboard. A new phone, the touchscreen Z30, was unveiled  in September. BlackBerry announced its new Z30 handset, pictured, in September before announcing losses of a billion dollars and plans to lay off 4,500 - or 40 per cent - of its workforce. They . were designed to see it catch up with Apple, Samsung and other . smartphone makers after falling behind in terms of new technology after . the launch of the iPhone in 2007. But the new handsets failed to win over critics and sales were far below what the firm was hoping for. Its market share in the first quarter of this year was 2.9 per cent, according to analysts, down from 41 per cent in 2007. Commenting . on the news, Nic Bulois, director of Added Value said: '  It all went . wrong for Blackberry when they tried to go away from their core business . of providing simple, reliable and safe Business to Business mobile . communication and ventured into the world of personal communication with . subpar technology. 'The hardware and software that ran on Blackberry devices was simply left behind. 'This . is a sad story of a brand trying to stretch too far from its core and . losing it all – it probably could have stayed the expert of professional . mobile communication and shut down the Samsungs and Apples from this . part of the market. Knowing your segments of the market and delivering . to it well is what makes brands strong.'","Thorsten Heins to be replaced as CEO as company expects to lose $1bn .

Shooter: Ahmed Dirir walks back in to the office after leaving to get a gun from his car . Dirir's victims were his relatives Saeed Abdulla, 29, and Khadra Muse, 44, who he worked with, and another employee Bernice Solomon-Redd, 54. According to the police report, Dirir was angry because his relatives were about to start a new company without him and had already viewed another potential office. The landlord told police Dirir knew about the plot because he'd been asking, 'Tell me when my relatives are going to leave,' KTVI News reported. Abdulla and Muse gave notice one week before the killings. Redd's husband, who was in his doctor's waiting room where he had arranged to meet his wife the day of the shootings, has described the moment he learned of her death on TV. 'She always goes to the doctor with me. She was supposed to meet me at the V.A. at 2 p.m.,' Jesse Redd told KTVI. '(Then . I heard) we have breaking news that they had this shooting down there . on Cherokee. And I thought I'd better drive down there, because I kept . calling my wife on her phone. I didn't ever get no answer.' She . told him she had a meeting at midday and Mrs Redd can be seen on the . tape walking into work at 2715 Cherokee Street, tragically for the last . time.

Scene: The three victims were tragically killed on June 13 at the office on Cherokee Street, St Louis . 'The good lord blessed me with her because with my health and everything, she made sure that I eat right, took my medicine, she did everything for me,' he said. Mr Redd, who has played out the killings in his mind repeatedly, believes his wife never had a chance. 'When (Dirir) shut the door, he pulled his pistol out and bang, that's how close when he hit my wife in the head,' he explained. 'Bang — hit her, then his brother . couldn't get out. He chased her then he killed them in there. Then he . killed himself. That's the way I figured it how he did 'em. Cause I know . my wife. If she had a chance, because she had a black belt you know... that's how fast he did it. She didn't get a chance to get up.' Two people upstairs heard shots and climbed out onto the roof to escape.

Argument: Prior to the shooting, Dirir, pictured left earlier ion the day and right minutes before the shooting, appears to be arguing with someone in the office . Second shot: A second puff of smoke is faintly visible at the bottom right of the above shot near the trash bag . Dirir was a Somali immigrant, described by friends as an intelligent man who was quick to reach out to other new-arriving Somalis. They also said he had lingering anger years after the divorce from his first wife. Dirir, Muse and Abdulla were all from Somalia, said Omar Jamal of the Somali mission to the U.N. Jamal at the time, after speaking with several friends and relatives of Dirir and the victims, including the men's wives. The home health agency was headquartered in a small business incubator building in a former movie theater on Cherokee Street, a revitalizing mixed-race neighborhood about five miles south of downtown St. Louis. Police Captain Michael Sack said Dirir used a semi-automatic handgun. A records search found no previous criminal record for Dirir except a couple of speeding cases. There was no record that he had a permit to carry a firearm. Michael Graff, an attorney with an office in the incubator building, said he heard loud arguments from the home health agency from time to time, but that he hadn't known those disputes to become violent before.","The shooter, Ahmed Dirir, 59, an employee of AK Home Health Care in St. Louis, Missouri, can be seen in surveillance tape waving his arms in the air .

Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova is expected to claim up to £5million in compensation after claiming sexual harassment at an employment tribunal . A high-flying banker nicknamed ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ during a smear campaign by male colleagues has won an employment tribunal after claiming she faced sexual harassment. Cambridge graduate Svetlana Lokhova worked in the London office of Russian firm Sberbank and said she had been subjected to victimisation before being unfairly dismissed. Last night it was unclear how much the 32-year-old can expect in compensation, but it was believed she was planning to claim as much as £5million. The tribunal heard that colleagues referred to her as ‘mad Svetlana’ and told her to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to ‘calm her down’. Other phrases male co-workers used to describe her included ‘crazy’, ‘mental’, ‘totally unstable’, ‘quite likely clinically bonkers’ and a ‘MAJOR car crash’. Miss Lokhova claimed she had been targeted because she had previously reported a senior trader for insider dealing. He was later dismissed. The tribunal also ruled that her main tormentor should have been fired from the bank for gross misconduct. David Longmuir, Miss Lokhova’s former manager at Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd, not only sent a host of emails but also made remarks behind her back that were ‘offensive and derogatory and often personal in nature’. He referred to Miss Lokhova as ‘Miss Bonkers’, said she had ‘unfortunate natural brain chemistry’ and described the daughter of a Russian shipping broker as ‘living in a flat that Daddy bought’. Mr Longmuir told the tribunal he regretted making some comments but claimed Miss Lokhova had insulted him. He has since reportedly left the bank by ‘mutual consent’. The tribunal rejected 19 of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova but found in her favour on the substantive areas of harassment and intimidation on the grounds of her gender. Judges said there was no evidence over claims that she was put under surveillance by the bank, that she had not been paid the relevant sick pay while off work and that she had been put on a list of ‘underperformers’ because of her poor relationship with Mr Longmuir. Miss Lokhova worked in Sberbank's Fleet Street office where she claimed she was victimised before being unfairly dismissed . Miss Lokhova made her allegations . after a second term of working at Sberbank’s London office in 2011, when . she was earning a six-figure salary alongside a guaranteed annual bonus . of £200,000. However, in . January 2012 she went on leave because of stress, claiming there was a . ‘hostile environment’ on the male-dominated equity sales desk. On the day she resigned senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin said in an email to a colleague that Miss Lokhova should visit Nigeria. He . wrote that he ‘knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria … proper alpha . male … she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months. These guys would help’. Miss . Lokhova’s barrister, Andrew Stafford, QC, said many comments showed a . ‘demeaning and offensive attitude towards women in general and to Miss . Lokhova in particular’. Mr Longmuir said he now accepted that describing Miss Lokhova as ‘Crazy Miss Cokehead’ was both untrue and defamatory of a woman who had never taken drugs. The Central London Employment Tribunal heard that prior to leaving the bank, Miss Lokhova had generated £20million in profits during two stints with the company and on one occasion had even been awarded a £600,000 cash bonus. Paolo Zaniboni, who was in charge of the London office, 'failed to manage properly the severity of the situation as it developed' Sberbank, the former Soviet savings bank, has been transformed under Herman Gref, a former economy minister for Russian president Vladimir Putin. The bank is Russia’s largest lender, held almost half of the nation’s deposits last year and has diversified into investment banking and asset management. The resources of Sberbank and its subsidiary Troika Dialog UK, where Miss Lokhova worked, have  now been integrated under  Sberbank CIB (UK) Ltd. The tribunal ruled that Paolo Zaniboni, who was in charge of the London office, also ‘failed to manage properly the situation as it developed with Mr Longmuir’. It added: ‘His lamentable  inaction caused detriment to the claimant and amounts in our view to victimisation . ‘What he should have done was to suspend Mr Longmuir and ensure that a proper disciplinary process was taken against him.’ Damages awarded by the tribunal are normally capped at £70,000 but they are unlimited in discrimination cases. Miss Lokhova is the second woman to win a sexual discrimination lawsuit in London this year. Isabel Sitz, a former stock broker at Oppenheimer Europe, won her claim for unfair treatment after managers discussed cutting her £95,000 a year salary to the UK legal minimum wage before she was then fired. The 32-year-old was called a 'car crash' and 'mentally unstable' by male colleagues, the tribunal heard. Nineteen of the 22 complaints made by Miss Lokhova were rejected by the Central London Employment Tribunal . Last night Sberbank’s spokesman Paul Marriott said in a statement: ‘Sberbank CIB and the management team in London are committed to equal opportunities and promoting diversity in its workplace, and did not expect this decision. ‘Although pleased that the tribunal found no wrongdoing on the part of the firm or its employees in relation to 19 complaints made by the claimant, we are disappointed that the tribunal upheld a small number of allegations. Miss Lokhova claimed she was unfairly dismissed from the Russian firm Sberbank, the largest bank in Eastern Europe . ‘We cannot comment further on the specifics of the judgment, which we are reviewing closely with our legal team, but we are committed to take on board any lessons to be learned.’ Miss Lokhova was unavailable for comment yesterday.","Svetlana Lokhova launched employment tribunal claiming sexual harassment .

And now experts say that soaring numbers of men are suffering from the curse of stretch marks. New research shows almost a third of all customers buying anti-stretch mark products are men - with the rise in men trying to get buff in the gym largely to blame. He's got the X Factor: Soaring numbers of men are suffering from stretch marks as they try quick-fix gym plans to emulate Hollywood stars such as Hugh Jackman, who bulked up for his role as Wolverine in X-Men . There has been a growing move by men - . inspired by the likes of Hollywood actors such as Hugh Jackman - to look . more masculine and beefy by pumping iron, with fitness magazines advocating 'quick bulk up' workouts to get speedy results. Now sales data analysed by pharmacists at ChemistDirect has revealed that over the last 12 months, 30 per cent of customers buying products aimed at reducing stretch marks are men - up by 10 per cent on the previous year. The pharmacy says it has received an increase in calls from  men asking about stretch marks because they have bulked over a short space of time. The biggest demand was in London, followed by Birmingham and Leicester, with an average age of 36. Stretch marks, also known as striae, are reddish or purplish fine lines that are caused by the overstretching of skin. The . skin has three layers - the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis - and . stretch marks are created when there is excessive stretching of the . middle layer of skin over a short period of time. Arm envy: Men trying to emulate Hugh by working out are most likely to get stretch marks under the arms, where their upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect . They . commonly occur during pregnancy, or as a result of rapid weight gain or . weight loss, muscle building, or due to growth spurts during puberty. ChemistDirect pharmacist Omar El-Gohary said: 'It’s common knowledge that women often suffer from stretch . marks during pregnancy, but it’s less well known that men can also be . affected when they start working out. 'The most susceptible area for men to . get stretch marks when they work out is under the arms, where their . upper chest and front shoulder muscles connect.

Pharmacists recommend regularly moisturising with products, which contain Vitamins A and E, as they play an important role in healing the skin.

"By . Siam Goorwich . PUBLISHED: . 16:38 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 10 October 2013 . Lap of luxury: Siam Goorwich is 30-years-old and still living at home . My name is called and I make my way to the dining room. As I've requested, there are sweet potatoes to accompany the chicken - breast meat only. Even better, there's apple crumble - just this side of tart with a hint of cinnamon, and a choice of custard or creme fraiche. No, I'm not in a country house hotel. I'm at home with my doting parents, and home-made meals like this come as part of my all-inclusive package. When I tell people I'm a 30-year-old woman who still lives at home, they pity me. They tut-tut about rising house prices and I nod in agreement, explaining that my meagre earnings as a freelance makes leaving home any time soon a financial impossibility. I am part of a generation who can't get well-paid jobs, can't afford houses and as a result can't even leave home. But it's a little more complicated than that. The truth is that living in the comfortable luxury of my family home, a warm, cheerfully decorated, four-bedroom, semi-detached house in North London - a property way beyond my means as a single woman - means that I have no impetus to leave. Why should I? Where could I live this well, with three meals a day, a laundry service, full use of the garden and all utilities - all completely free? Where is the incentive to strike out on my own? I know my friends feel the same. No wonder a survey by Saga magazine revealed that there are nearly three million 20 to 34-year-olds living with their parents. We are known as the boomerangers - the generation who have come back to live off the wealth created by our baby boomer parents, now in their 60s. I admit I do get the odd stab of shame when I think that my parents had left home by my age. Like most people of their generation, it was unthinkable that they would still be living with their parents in their 30s. Traditionally, you lived at home until you married, at which point you set up home with your spouse. When most people married in their early 20s, that made perfect sense. But times have changed. In Europe, it's normal to remain in your childhood homes into your adult years, and sometimes even after marriage. It's now happening in Britain. Boomerang: Siam returned home because, as a freelancer, it didn't make financial sense for her to live independently . While sociologists warn of the creation of a stunted generation unprepared for the responsibilities of adult life, I don't see it that way. Why should I leave a home I'm happy in just to conform to social norms, when my parents are still happy for me to live here? In fact, my younger sisters, who are in their 20s, still live at home, too. Furthermore, I know the dire nature of the alternative. In a foolish bid for independence, I moved out of home for a year in my mid-20s, renting a room in a shared house in East London with five other young people. I hated it. The kitchen sink was permanently over-flowing with dirty crockery (yes, some of it was mine) and the house was freezing because we couldn't afford to heat it. After a year, I'd had quite enough of having to queue for my morning shower as if I was at a campsite. From the cheap furniture to the bland decor, living in rented accommodation was absolute misery. Then there were my housemates. While two are still friends, if I never see the others again it will be a blessing. When my contract was up, I happily moved back home. Months later I was still furious with myself for spending £600 a month to live in a dirty house with people I couldn't stand. Of course, there are times when my parents, sisters and I fall out, but because we love each other, things blow over quickly. 'In fact, like me, most of my friends are still living with their parents. Not . only does it make  financial sense, but we recognise we'd be stupid to . suffer in discomfort and penury just to prove a point.' Occasionally, other people will make snide comments about my 'poor parents' and muse on how desperate they must be for me to flee the nest, but this couldn't be further from the truth. My parents have worked hard to build a comfortable family home and are only too pleased that I still want to live in it. When I moved out in my 20s, Mum was indignant; she took it as a personal insult that I wanted to leave her lovely home and castigated me for frittering away my hard-earned money on paying a greedy landlord's mortgage. Now I'm back home, some other people assume my living situation would make me a social pariah among my peers. In fact, like me, most of my friends are still living with their parents. Not only does it make  financial sense, but we recognise we'd be stupid to suffer in discomfort and penury just to prove a point. Other friends say they would still be at home given the chance. Even the ones who wear their domestic independence like a badge of honour run home to mummy and daddy at the first sign of a cold or after a break-up. The truth is nothing will ever be as comforting as a home-cooked meal followed by a TV marathon on your parents' sofa, no matter how old you are. The fridge is always well-stocked  and we never run out of milk or toilet roll - which can't be said about the homes of friends who live by themselves. But not everyone agrees that my set-up is a lifestyle nirvana. I've been accused of holding myself back and missing out on the freedom of being young and single. And while I admit that living at home means you can't invite a long line of boyfriends back to stay or host wild parties, I can live with that. If I want to sit up drinking all night, I can do it at the home of one of my friends who rents. Enduring love: Siam pictured with her doting family . Best of all, after a weekend of partying, I can always return to a warm, clean house. It really is the best of both worlds. Meanwhile, I'm not expected to contribute to the running of the house, financially or otherwise. While my dad, who owns a shop, works six days a week to pay the bills, my stay-at-home mum spends her days cleaning, washing and tidying up my mess. Yes, I may have to sleep in a single bed, but I never have to wash the sheets myself. That said, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't conscious that I'm not pulling my weight. For my part, I live by my parents' rules, work hard and try to make them proud. I'm also an enthusiastic cook and make a family meal at least once a week. It's not much, but it's heartfelt on my part and appreciated by them. It's not always plain sailing, though. On occasion, my parents have rebelled. More than once Mum has thrown in the tea towel, and the pair of them have demanded that my sisters and I do more to help out. In fact, a note outlining our household responsibilities - including putting dirty crockery straight in the dishwasher and keeping our rooms tidy - is stuck on the fridge door as testament to one such row. But actually, nothing really changes. After years of living together, we're stuck in our ways, regardless of the rights or wrongs. Spoilt? Quite possibly. Cosseted from the harsh realities of the world? Almost certainly. Living in a state of suspended adolescence? All of these things may be true. And I'd ponder them deeply, honestly I would. But right now Mum is calling me down for dinner.","Siam is 30-years-old, but she and her sisters still live with her parents .

Two men wearing 'Scream' masks and armed with a knife and an axe shouted 'trick or treat' outside a Bedford flat before barging inside and carrying out a violent robbery. Inside they bound a 26-year-old man with tape and then tortured by being cut on his head, his legs and face to make the woman who lived at the property, hand over money. Grange Road: The man was tortured so the woman inside the Bedford flat would hand over cash she had from selling a car . Scream: The masks, made popular by the Scream film series, were worn by two robbers who tortured a man for money . They also stole two iPhones. Bedfordshire Police say the robbery happened at about 9.30 pm on Thursday evening at the flat in Grange Road. Detectives have described the attackers as two Asian men. They were wearing dark clothes and hoodies as well as the Halloween masks. Police said the 24-year-old woman had money in the flat after recently selling her car. Police say they will not be disclosing how much cash was taken but are looking at the possibility the attackers knew there was cash in the house. Det Con Mike Armstrong, said the two attackers would have been noticeable as they would have been considerably taller than most trick or treaters out on Thursday. He said: 'The injuries to the man are very nasty and obviously this was a very frightening incident for both people involved. 'Officers have made extensive searches, forensic examinations and knocked on doors in the area, but there are bound to be people who were around at the time that we haven't yet spoken to.' The two men left the block of flats on foot but police are still trying to establish which direction they went after that. It is possible they got into a car parked further up the road or in a nearby street. The distinctive masks, worn by the killer in the popular Scream film series, are white and are usually worn with a black hood and cloak. American slasher films, Scream, are based around murderers that dress up as the character to stalk their victims. The four films have broke box office records when they came out in the late nineties and star Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette.

The Texas city may not be particularly well-known outside the southern U.S. state, but it now has a claim to fame after being revealed as the safety city in America. The city of 278,000 just outside Dallas is home to a junk food HQ and a retail giant, but also boasts the lowest crime rate of U.S. cities in a recent study. Plano also has the sixth-lowest traffic fatality rate, which helped it top a Forbes study of America's safest cities for the second year in a row. Plano, Texas, was crowned America's safest city for the second year in a row . The Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, and Honolulu in Hawaii come in second and third, respectively. A sound economic footing is one of the factors which makes cities safe, according to experts. Scott B. Clark, president of the New York-based Risk and Insurance Management Society, said: 'One of the underlying things, in terms of a city’s safety, would be a very strong tax base, as there are a number of services that are reliant on it. 'That includes an effective, well-staffed police department, fire department and school system. The median household income in Plano is $79,234, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 60 percent above the national average, and 8.1 percent of residents are below the poverty line, compared to a national rate of 15.1 percent. The city is also home to a number of Fortune 500 companies. 1. Plano, Texas . 2. Henderson, Nevada . 3. Honolulu, Hawaii . 4. Santa Ana, California . 5. Lincoln, Nebraska . 6. San Jose, California . 7. Mesa, Arizona . 8. Colorado Springs, Colorado . 9. Aurora, Colorado . 10. New York City . John Worrall, head of the criminology program at the University of Texas at Dallas, said: 'Plano is a very clean, affluent suburb with no inner city per se. 'Plus it has one of the few police departments in the U.S. that require four-year degrees. I don’t know that there is research to back up its making things safer, but it makes Plano unique.' Henderson, Nevada, toko second spot despite its location within the Metropolitan Statistical Area of Las Vegas-Paradise, which ranked ninth this year on Forbes’ list of America’s Most Dangerous Cities. That may be because Henderson has a relatively high median income of $61,861, a low poverty rate (seven per cent) and higher median home prices than Las Vegas, points out Tamara Madensen, a criminology professor at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. She adds: 'Casinos in Henderson cater mainly to local residents, which reduces traffic and the number of tourists moving about in the city.' Henderson, Nevada, took second place in the study . Honolulu, Hawaii, took third place in the Forbes study to find America's safest city . In third place on our list is Honolulu, which ranks fourth lowest for violent crime and seventh lowest for traffic fatalities. The city is relatively well off, with a median household income of $54,828, above the national average of $50,046, and a below average poverty rate of 10.5 percent. Hawaii has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, and that famous relaxed aloha spirit may play a role in keeping accident and violence rates low.

It may be called 'Scotchy Scotch Scotch' but, alas, there is no actual alcohol in the new Ben & Jerry's that has both cult comedy lovers and sweettooths alike licking their lips. In celebration of the long-awaited release of Will Ferrell's Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (released in theatres Dec. 20), the iconic ice cream makers today launched a special flavor dedicated to San Diego's most hapless TV anchor, Ron Burgundy. The latest in a recent spate of special edition releases, the creamy concoction is described as 'butterscotch ice cream with ribbons of butterscotch swirl' and is completely whiskey-free. Fans of the original, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy - which has become one of the most-quoted comedies since its release in 2004 - will be quick to recall the name  of the dessert comes from a memorable scene from the gag reel where Ferrell's beloved character is drinking on-air. Scroll down for video ... A nice cold pint: The new butterscotch flavor Ben & Jerry's pays homage to Anchorman character Ron Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell - right) and his well-known love of whiskey . Stellar return: The whole cast including (L-R) Paul Rudd, Will Ferrell, David Koechner and Steve Carrell will be reunited in Judd Apatow's Anchorman 2, released on December 20 . 'I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly,' Burgundy says. Officially unveiled this morning at New York City's Pier 36, Burgundy 'himself' is quoted on the press release as saying he hopes Ben and Jerry's consider his other suggestions. 'Malt liquor marshmallow, well liquor bourbon peanut butter and cheap white wine sherbert,' the release said. The launch event featured a performance by Nutty The Water-skiing Squirrel, another standout from the original movie, followed by the appearance of a ice cream truck that had been converted into a Channel 4 news truck. 'You stay classy, San Diego': About 20 Ron Burgundy lookalikes launch Ben & Jerry's new 'Scotchy Scotch Scotch@ at New York's Pier 36 today . Inside the truck were a scrum of Ron Burgundy lookalikes that served samples of the ice cream. 'We especially enjoyed the sampling process over the last several months to find the perfect Scotchy Scotch Scotch flavor,' said Ben & Jerry's marketing head, Lisa Sholk. Ben & Jerry's are no strangers to bringing out limited batches, although their most recent efforts have been based on enforcing civil rights. Earlier this year in Australia, the company renamed their legendary Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough to 'I Dough, I Dough' as a stance on marriage equality. Since their launch 35 years ago, Ben & Jerry's have become known for such advocacy. Making a statement: Earlier this year Ben & Jerry's Australia renamed their Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough - arguably the company's most-famous flavor - to 'I Dough, I Dough' as a stance in support of same-sex marriage rights . In 1989 they were one of the first companies in the US to extend full benefits to unmarried partners of their partners, including those of the same sex. In 2009 the flavor known as 'Chubby Hubby' was renamed 'Hubby Hubby' to celebrate gay marriage legalisation in Ben & Jerry's home state of Vermont. Then last year in the UK they launched Apple-y Ever After' to support same-sex marriage legislation. 'As a social justice company, we’re immensely proud to support an issue that embodies so many of our core values,' Ben & Jerry's brand champion Kalli Swaik said at the time. 'We champion equality above all else, believing that everyone in a loving relationship should be able to mark their commitment to each other in marriage, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.'

Complaints: Gabriel Pakpourtabrizi, 25, is fighting to stop her council sending gifted son Christian Farrington, 7, to a special school . With his photographic memory and an IQ of 168, Christian Farrington is top of the class. The eight-year-old – who taught himself to read at 18 months – has the academic ability of a child twice his age. But Christian has been told that he will have to move from his primary school to a special school because he has autism. Despite his brilliant progress at school, the local education authority has decided it is too costly for him to have teaching assistants there. His mother, Gabrielle Pakpourtabrizi, 25, is taking legal action. Miss Pakpourtabrizi, from Ely in Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Taking him out of the school he loves and putting him in a special needs school will pull the carpet from underneath him and completely ruin him. ‘He has surpassed everyone’s expectations and no child deserves to be taken away from a school that is working for them.’ Christian has attended Ely St John’s Community Primary School since he started school. His mother first noticed her son’s abilities when he picked up a children’s book in a doctors’ waiting room as an 18-month-old toddler and read it aloud. Experts say Christian has the academic ability of a 15-year-old but he has high-functioning autism, which means he can struggle with some social situations. He has had a one-to-one teaching assistant at his school to help him deal with loud environments and busy classes.

Happy chap: Christian, pictured as a baby, taught himself to read and began reading out loud at 18 months . She said: ‘What the council wants to do simply isn’t on and they would be depriving Christian of his opportunities. ‘The only reason they’re doing this is . to save money as they don’t want to have to pay to support Christian as . he progresses through mainstream school. What he’s achieving at his . current primary school is priceless. ‘He will not be intellectually . stimulated there (at a special school). 'I will be willing to back a . change, but only if it is the correct one for my son.’ Miss Pakpourtabrizi has launched . tribunal proceedings against Cambridgeshire County Council’s decision to . move him to Gretton School in Girton.

Although this week's broadcast was intended as a show of strength and unity with her husband, it is unclear when the footage was actually recorded.

Barack Obama faces Judgment Day as the Supreme Court is set to announce today  whether his healthcare reform will be struck down and Attorney General Eric Holder faces being held in contempt of Congress. Having spent his first 14 months in office on achieving Obamacare, for the former constitutional law lecturer to see his signature reform declared unconstitutional would be a humiliating blow. In ramming the bill through Congress, Obama failed to secure a single Republican vote, thereby shedding his campaign image as a bipartisan uniter. Although passing the bill was a legislative victory, the reform itself has proved to be a political millstone. The censure of Holder, in which a . number of Democrats are poised to join Republicans, would also be a . major embarrassment because Obama has claimed executive privilege, . something he blasted his predecessor George W. Bush for doing. Republicans on Capitol Hill have pursued Holder tenaciously over the botched ‘gun walking’ sting operation in which thousands of weapons were allowed into Mexico and into the hands of drug criminals. Two of the weapons were found at the murder scene of border agent Brian Terry. With the Supreme Court Justices peppering Obama’s lawyer with hostile questions about Obamacare and Republicans united and in control of the House of Representatives, the White House is bracing itself for a dismal day. Scroll down for video . Pending outcome: Obama, walking with his wife, has a long road ahead of him as the White House is bracing itself for a dismal day on Thursday . 'Catch-22': If the healthcare legislation is upheld, presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney can run on repealing it - a sure-fire crowd pleaser . Obama faces a Catch-22 situation over . the Supreme Court ruling. If the legislation is upheld, presumptive . Republican nominee Mitt Romney can run on repealing it if he’s elected – . an almost sure-fire crowd pleaser. But if Obamacare – formally named the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – is struck down in whole or in part then Obama will look like a failure as well as a President who has exceeded his powers. A split decision might be the worst outcome for him as full rejection would force Republicans to come up with an alternative plan and full support would hand Romney a popular rallying cry for repeal. Obama’s planned strategy for the . reform being struck down was to condemn the Supreme Court justices as . being controlled by a partisan core of Right-wingers. But that has been undermined by this . week’s split ruling over the Arizona immigration law in which . conservative Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a majority opinion that . largely backed the Obama administration. Under pressure: The censure of Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured), in which a number of Democrats are poised to join Republicans, would also be a major embarrassment for Obama . Deep in discussion: Holder with Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Patrick Leahy the day before a ruling on his role in withholding documents in a weapons crackdown . Judgment . Day for Obama comes at a perilous moment for him. He faces a brewing . rebellion among Democrats who are refusing to attend the national . convention in September where he is due to be crowned as his party’s . nominee. At least three . Democratic senators and eight members of the House of Representatives . have said they will not attend the party festivities in Charlotte, North . Carolina – a clear sign that they view the Obama brand as toxic. Among those who will stay at home is Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who was virtually attached to Obama’s hip on his campaign plane in 2008. Representative Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, urged all democratic candidates to stay away, saying: ‘If they want to win an election, they need to be in their district.’ Although Obama leads nationally by three per cent in the RealClearPolitics national average, undecided voters tend to break decisively against incumbents and there are a number of alarming underlying factors for the President. Outlook: House Speaker John Boehner (right) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (left) are seen together on Wednesday a day before historic U.S. decisions are to be made . In the latest NBC/WSJ poll, 49 per . cent felt less optimistic about the economy as a result of recent news, . 53 per cent disapproved of Obama’s handling of the economy and a . whopping 61 per cent felt the United States was moving in the wrong . direction. Although . Obama retains some strength in swing states and has boosted himself . with Latino voters because of his recent decisions to allow up to . 800,000 young illegal immigrants to stay in the US, his number sin each . of those key categories have slipped since the last NBC/WSJ poll. Obama faces criticism from the Left over his aggressive drone strike policy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Jimmy Carter, the former President who backed him over Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries, this week wrote that the US under Obama was ‘abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights'. Decision: Having spent his first 14 months in office on achieving the healthcare reform, it would be a humiliating blow to Obama if his signature reform is declared unconstitutional . 'Strategy': It'll be hard for Obama to blame right-wingers for Supreme Court decisions after this week's ruling over the Arizona immigration law as conservative Chief Justice John Roberts mostly backed the President . Carter charged: ‘Revelations that top officials are targeting people to be assassinated, including American citizens, are only the most recent, disturbing proof of how far our nation's violation of human rights has extended.’ The unusual criticism from a former President comes just weeks after Bill Clinton stated that Romney had a ‘sterling’ business record and that the work of Bain Capital, Romney’s former private equity firm, was ‘good work’. Clinton’s words undercut the centrepiece of Obama’s attacks on Romney – which have led to his campaign vastly overspending, even as Romney outraises him – which have been that he is a corporate predator who has made profits out of cutting jobs. Senior Romney officials, however, believe that the attacks only emphasise that the Republican was a hugely successful businessman whereas Obama, who has never held a job in business, has presided over an economy in which unemployment has just risen to 8.2 per cent.

Route: George Osborne is facing a row over claims he helped secure a detour in his constituency for the controversial HS2 rail line . David Cameron has been forced to defend George Osborne amid accusations he helped secure a £600million detour for the controversial High Speed Rail line to avoid losing votes. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Chancellor should concentrate on the economy rather than 'worrying about how to divert high-speed rail routes away from his constituency'. But Prime Minister David Cameron said the route, unveiled earlier this week, would go 'right through the middle of the Chancellor’s constituency'. The Labour leader said during Prime Minister's Questions: 'I have to say to the part-time Chancellor, he should spend more time worrying about the economy and less time worrying about how to divert high-speed rail routes away from his constituency.' Mr Osborne’s Tatton seat in Cheshire lies along the route taken by the line to Manchester. MailOnline has revealed that Michael Jones, the leader of Cheshire East council, issued a press release saying: 'Your MPs, George Osborne, Edward Timpson and I, have fought hard to keep the line away from Knutsford and Tatton, which we have been successful in achieving.' Mr Miliband began to read Mr Jones’ comments but was cut off by Speaker John Bercow as the volume of heckling from Tory MPs threatened to drown out the Labour leader. Mr Cameron said: 'Let me say on high-speed rail, which goes right through the middle of the Chancellor’s constituency, we are proud of the fact that it’s this Government that has taken the decision to invest.' The Chancellor has insisted he played no part in the siting of the route – which runs through his seat in Tatton, Cheshire – before reaching Manchester Airport. But critics have pointed out that there is a ‘bend’ in the line which means it avoids some of the more affluent parts of the constituency. Yesterday – in a press release issued by Tory-run Cheshire East Council – its leader Michael Jones suggested that Mr Osborne had fought to keep the line away from the eastern side of the seat. This avoids Tatton’s so called ‘Golden Triangle’ of Tory-voting Prestbury, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge. But within hours the council had retracted its statement – saying that it had made a mistake. Mr Osborne sold his £900,000 constituency home near Macclesfield last January, two months before an interim report seen by the Daily Mail considered – but then rejected – running the disputed line far closer to the town than is now planned. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Detour: This map shows the government's proposed route for the HS2 line (in blue) which was announced this week passing through the west of George Osborne's Tatton constituency (highlighted in red). An earlier route (in black) which has been discounted would have passed straight through the affluent 'golden triangle' of Wilmslow, Knutsford and Alderley Edge . Diversion: Critics claim the route, pictured, features a 'bend' which means it avoids some of the more affluent parts of the Chancellor's constituency . Influence: A spokesman for Mr Osborne said: 'We have made clear throughout the process that George has never sought to influence the route' Critics are furious that the . ‘preferred route’ now takes a £600million ‘dog-leg detour’ around . upmarket Alderley Edge, Knutsford, Wilmslow and Prestbury. Protesters . have spoken of ‘high-speed hypocrisy’ – pointing out that no such . consideration was shown to residents in the Tory heartlands around the . Chilterns, Buckinghamshire and Warwickshire. Mr . Jones added in his release: ‘This is great news for Cheshire East and . for Crewe in particular. This decision firmly demonstrates the . Government’s belief in Crewe and puts Crewe firmly at the centre of the . North West’s growing economy. HS2 consolidates Cheshire East at the most . connected area in the UK.’ A spokesman for Mr Osborne said: ‘Cheshire East put something out but corrected it when they realised they were wrong. We have made clear throughout the process that George has never sought to influence the route.’ Hilary Wharf of the HS2Action Alliance said: ‘What a high-speed fiasco. Everyone knew the Government was desperate to avoid more opposition but it’s shocking if the Chancellor is both abusing his position and actually denying it.’ A report by HS2 Ltd delivered to the Government on March 29, 2012, makes clear that Whitehall advisers did consider a high-speed route going slightly to the west of Macclesfield. The route eventually chosen and announced on Monday goes well to the west of Macclesfield. Insisted: Mr Osborne has said he played no part in the siting of the route - which runs through his seat in Tatton, Cheshire - before reaching Manchester Airport . The Transport Department said the Chancellor could not have known of the other route options until the full reports were published. A spokesman said: ‘The design of the route through the Chancellor’s constituency followed the same process as it did everywhere else. ‘The initial preferred route has been chosen to provide the best possible service to Liverpool, Manchester Airport and West Coast Main Line links to Scotland. As elsewhere, the route balances passenger demand, cost, engineering and sustainability.’ In its ‘retraction’, the council said yesterday: ‘In a press release Cheshire East Council stated that George Osborne had fought hard to keep the HS2 rail link out of his constituency in Knutsford and Tatton. ‘In fact, this is not the case and MP George Osborne had no say whatsoever over the proposed route of the HS2 link.  We are happy to set the record straight.’ Green fields: The route avoids Tatton's so called 'Golden Triangle' of Tory-voting Prestbury, Wilmslow (pictured) and Alderley Edge .

Mike du Toit was found guilty in July last year after witnesses testified that the group planned to assassinate Mr Mandela . Five leaders of a plot in South Africa to assassinate Nelson Mandela and drive non-whites out of the country were sentenced to 35 years in prison after a trial lasting more than 10 years. A Pretoria High Court handed down shorter sentences ranging to some of the other 21 defendants who were members of the ‘Boeremag’, a rag-tag militia of apartheid loyalists accused of a botched 2002 coup attempt. Nine of the accused walked free after being held for 11 years behind bars during the trial. In the course of the prolonged case, witnesses testified that the Boeremag planned to assassinate anti-apartheid hero Mandela, who was South Africa’s first black president, by planting a bomb along a route he was due to travel. Their plans however were thwarted when the statesman, now aged 95, travelled to his engagement by helicopter. Several of the Boeremag members were charged with causing nine explosions at various sites in October 2002, with most blasts taking place in the sprawling township of Soweto, south of Johannesburg, where one woman was killed. Racial tensions persist almost 20 years since the first democratic elections ended apartheid rule in South Africa. But groups like the Boeremag and the . Afrikaner Resistance Movement of murdered far-right leader Eugene . Terre’blanche have little backing from the country’s almost 5 million . whites.

The RSPCA risks becoming a ‘political prosecutor’ rather than an animal welfare organisation, a senior Tory warned yesterday. Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general, said the costs of a recent case involving David Cameron’s local hunt were far too high. And he called for the charity’s cases to be taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service. MPs clashed over the the Heythrop hunt, which Prime Minister David Cameron has ridden with, after it was the subject of a £327,000 private prosecution by the RSPCA . The RSPCA prosecuted the Heythrop hunt . in Oxfordshire last year at a cost of £327,000 following covert . filming. The hunt was fined £4,000 after admitting four offences. Although . two of its members pleaded guilty and were fined, their supporters . claimed the case was politically motivated to target the Prime Minister. ‘If they continue to prosecute at such . huge expense in such a disproportionate way, they will be open to . public criticism... by the judge, as they were, or by MPs, or by . ordinary members of the public,’ Sir Edward said. Speaking at a Westminster debate, he said the CPS would be more dispassionate. He added: ‘This is not to say the . RSPCA should not investigate, but it needs to be careful that it does . not move away from being an animal welfare organisation and become a . political campaigner, using the state prosecuting system as a weapon.’ The well-attended debate was triggered by Tory MP Simon Hart, a former head of the Countryside Alliance. Former solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier warned the RSPCA would face more 'public criticism' if it pursued cases against hunts . He claims that the charity is pursing . an ‘aggressive political agenda’ against pet owners which is ‘at odds . with animal welfare’. Pointedly avoiding the subject of . hunting, Mr Hart called for ‘absolute clarity and accountability’ about . the charity’s role as a prosecutor. He said it pursued only ‘tantalising’ cases and that some defendants pleaded guilty because they feared crippling legal costs. But Dominic Grieve, speaking for the . Government, told MPs the charity had the right to bring private . prosecutions and that it performed a ‘valuable role’ bringing cruelty . cases which might otherwise go unprosecuted. The Attorney General said the Crown . Prosecution Service had the power to take over RSPCA cases, or stop them . if they do not meet standards for evidence or public interest. Mr Grieve said this had happened in only four of the thousands of cases the charity has brought. The RSPCA says it spends £5million a . year prosecuting cruelty cases, which it insists accounts for just 5p in . every pound donated. It said the prosecutions department was independent of its campaigning work and that it had a 98 per cent success rate in cases. Mr Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and . South Pembrokeshire, said the RSPCA was ‘not an arm of the law’ and . claimed its relationship with police in offering to investigate such . cases was ‘deeply troubling and part of the problem’. But Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport . West, accused Mr Hart of representing the ‘hunting lobby’ and trying to . help ‘rich, powerful Tories’ break the law. Cheryl Gillan, until recently Mr . Cameron’s Welsh Secretary, praised a £2.3million prosecution that the . RSPCA brought in her Buckinghamshire constituency.","RSPCA spent £327,000 prosecuting the Heythrop hunt in Oxfordshire .

On trial: Martin MacNeill remained stone-faced throughout the testimony on Tuesday (pictured) which included questions from his former mistress, her mother, his wife's sister and a taped interview of his daughter . Several times on the tape, she said she didn't want to talk about the day her mother died. She later expanded on her memories after investigators asked one of her sisters to question her. The judge, however, ruled those accounts were tainted and defense lawyers declined to call the now-12-year-old girl into the courtroom for cross-examination. 'She doesn't have a credible memory to question,' Randy Spencer, one of Martin MacNeill's defense lawyers, later told reporters outside court. 'It's pointless to try.' One woman who has spoken to the court at length is Gypsy Willis, the woman who MacNeill was having a sexual relationship with for more than a year before his wife's death. On the stand: Gypsy Willis, who had an affair with a doctor accused of killing his wife, testifies on Tuesday, explaining that she moved into the couple's home just nine days after his wife's death . Counter intuitive: Willis said that her relationship with the doctor was 'casual' but then went on to say that she moved in with him and his family just eight days after his wife died . Willis conceded that a photo of her bare buttocks that she sent Martin MacNeill on April 12, 2007 - the day after his wife Michelle died - was a 'little bit suggestive'. Then just eight days after the image was sent, Willis moved into the couple's home and three months later, she received a marriage proposal and a $7,000 diamond ring from MacNeill, she testified. MacNeill is accused of hounding his wife to get a face-lift, then administering a lethal combination of drugs for her recovery and helping her into a tub of water in 2007. Shortly after the death, in late June, MacNeill and Willis were looking for wedding rings online, prosecutors said on Tuesday. Then during a trip to Wyoming in July, MacNeill proposed to Willis at a restaurant with a four-and-a-half carat diamond ring - but Willis claimed she could not remember the details of the proposal. 'It's been so long. This relationship has been over a very long time,' she said. A mother's point of view: Vicki Willis, Gypsy's mom, told the court that MacNeill told her 'he never loved his wife' and went on to say he 'loved her like a sister... not like how I love Gypsy' The judge allowed prosecutors to aggressively question Willis as a hostile witness after they argued she was trying to protect MacNeill with less than truthful answers. 'Are you telling us you don't know anything more about Michele's death?' prosecutor Sam Pead asked. 'That is correct,' Willis replied. More... Young mother found dead in trunk of car that was parked at Greyhound station for several DAYS after 'masseuse boyfriend snapped her neck' Husband, 31, 'confesses to killing his wife with a single blow to her throat after she wanted a divorce' - but he won't say where her body is . Willis' mother testified that the doctor tried to win over her family on visits to their home. At a lavish engagement party in early July 2007 at a Cheyenne restaurant, MacNeill 'made a public show of dropping to a knee and asking her to marry him,' Vicki Willis said. She recalled how he pulled her aside and said some disparaging things about his recently deceased wife. 'He said to me he never loved Michele... he amended that to say 'Well, I did, I loved her like a sister but never like I love Gypsy,'' she told the court on Tuesday. In previous testimony, Willis said she made the married father-of-eight online in November 2005 and their affair became sexual the following January and continued for the 15 months before the death. Amused: Willis, pictured leaving court in Provo on Tuesday, said MacNeill proposed to her shortly after . Willis, who called the relationship casual, said the doctor set her up in a duplex, gave her a debit card for . expenses, and helped pay for her schooling as a nursing student. On the day his wife died, she traded text messages with the doctor 30 times that day and later attended his wife's funeral - again, keeping in contact with him over texts. She was previously asked about a family interview arranged by the doctor, who was looking for someone to care for his four youngest daughters. 'Was there any question you were going to be hired as a nanny?' prosecutor Chad Grunander asked. Family: MacNeill, a former Mormon Sunday school teacher, and his wife Michelle had eight children . Accused: Prosecutors said he wanted to kill his wife so that he could continue his affair with Willis . Willis smiled before saying she understood that she needed the approval of MacNeill's grown children. Two have testified that they suspected she was a mistress and didn't want her in the house but were overruled by their father. A drug expert testified last week that Michele MacNeill had four nervous system depressants in her blood that would have had a powerful knockout effect. A cause of death was never established. Defense lawyers argue she had a heart attack and fell into the tub. Willis was testifying under a deal with prosecutors that kept her out of jail on identity-theft charges. She was accused of taking the identity of one of MacNeill's adopted daughters to escape a debt-heavy credit history .","Gypsy Willis and Martin MacNeill had a 'casual' 15-month affair before his wife Michelle died in their bathtub in April 2007 .

In the Grandstand enclosure women may wear both fascinators and full-length trouser suits, but no strapless dresses, shorts, branded clothing or fancy dress. Sheer strap dresses and tops are not permitted, and if jackets or pashminas are worn the dresses underneath must adhere to guidelines. Midriffs must be covered. In the Royal Enclosure rules are even stricter, with women forbidden from wearing fascinators. Hats must be worn at all times, but only 'a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches (10cm) or more in diameter is acceptable'.

Art-lovers will be able to see two of the most recognisable and much-loved paintings in the world at a museum in London for the first time in 65 years. The National Gallery will reunite two of Vincent van Gogh's iconic ‘Sunflower’ paintings next year, allowing visitors the chance to compare and contrast these much-loved masterpieces side-by-side. The historical exhibition, which will also showcase new research about the way the artist worked, was made possible thanks to a deal with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Two versions of Vincent van Gogh’s iconic 'Sunflowers' are being reunited in London for the first time in 65 years in 2014 . The paintings are two of the five versions of ‘Sunflowers’ that are now spread around the world, with the others currently residing in Tokyo, Munich and Philadelphia. They are worth an estimated £100m each and were last exhibited in London together 65 years ago. The series dates from 1888, when Van Gogh left Paris to paint in the brilliant sunshine of the South of France, inviting Paul Gauguin to join him. Self portrait of Vincent van Gogh. He completed the five sunflower paintings in autumn 1888 . Waiting for Gauguin to arrive, Van Gogh painted a series of pictures of sunflowers to decorate his friend’s bedroom. They were meant as a sign of friendship and welcome, but also of Vincent's allegiance to Gauguin as his artistic leader. Vincent wrote to his brother Theo in August 1888: 'I am hard at it, painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when you know that what I’m at is the painting of some sunflowers. 'If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow. 'I am working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers fade so quickly. I am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers. 'This fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers... it gives a singular effect.' The pair worked together throughout autumn 1888 – but it ended very badly at the close of the year when Van Gogh seemed to have a nervous breakdown, famously cut off part of his ear and entered an asylum. National Gallery Director, Dr Nicholas Penny, said: 'This exhibition is designed to help those for whom the paintings by Van Gogh are compelling images to understand how they were made – and made again – and out of what materials. 'It will deepen every visitor’s appreciation of the artist. We are very grateful to the Van Gogh Museum for making this possible.'","Dutch artist's 1888 pictures will be reunited for first time in over six decades .

Fears that use of Facebook and Twitter is making people ruder is a myth and Britain is still a nation of polite people, according to university researchers. For centuries Britons have been famed for their reserve, indirect way of saying things and, of course, a love of queuing. And although many of us might believe that modern life, texting and tweeting is making us as a nation ruder, the study from Lancaster University's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences has found that the British are just as polite as ever. Myth: Despite fears to the contrary, a new academic study has shown that using Twitter and Facebook is not making us ruder, and that Britain is still a nation of polite people . However, the research has revealed . that what we find polite, and what we find rude, is unique to British . culture, and can be very different to notions of rudeness in other . countries. As part of his research Professor Jonathan Culpeper, an expert in linguistic politeness, studied 500 diary reports of incidents of impoliteness experienced by those living in Britain, Germany, Finland, Turkey and China. He found that whilst personal image and appearance was most important for Brits, social rights and fairness, and how they were perceived within a group, . was most important for the Chinese. 'This fits the idea that British culture is more individualistic, . whereas Chinese culture emphasizes one's position in the group and . social reciprocity, for example reciprocal gift giving and returning . favours,' said Professor Culpeper. The . study also dispels the popular belief that we're getting ruder, with . the perceived rise in impoliteness merely down to a clash of values . between different generations. Professor . Culpeper said that if anything, we are more polite than our ancestors, . and that 400 years ago everyday language was far more plain and . direct than it is today. Professor Culpeper said: 'A thousand or so years ago in Old English, it was fine to use . brusqueness which is jaw-dropping from our modern perspective. National sport: The British are famed for their love of queuing, as these polite sports fans hoping to watch Andy Murray play at Wimbledon demonstrate . 'Our . impression of a massive explosion in the use of impolite language is . partly the panic reaction of those with more traditional values meeting . new values - values which encourage more direct ways of expressing . emotions and doing business.' He added: 'The new 'let it all hang out' culture is clashing . with the ""beat about the bush"" culture. A result of this clash is a . sense amongst traditionalists that their values are under attack.' Professor Culpeper's research will be presented on November 4 as part of next week's Economic and Social Research Council’s annual Festival of Social Science, which encompasses a series of events across the UK. As part of the study he also found that when people talk about things they consider impolite, they actually refer to a very limited number of things in specific contexts. Professor Culpeper used the two-billion word Oxford English Corpus, an electronic collection of various writings including newspapers and online blogs, and found that actions likely to be described as rude or impolite included: 'evesdropping', interrupting', 'pointing', 'ignoring', 'smoking' and 'laughing'. Among the people most likely to be described as rude or impolite included: 'doorman', 'bouncer', 'bartender', 'waitress', 'waiter', 'staff', 'guest' and 'customer'. Many of these relate to those in public service, where people have expectations of entitlements, which are not always met. Research: The study was carried out by academics at the University of Lancaster (file picture) Professor Culpeper said: 'Impoliteness often gets a bad press. It is assumed to be a poor, debased kind of language used for dysfunctional social purposes. But impoliteness can also be sophisticated, creative, and can entertain.' The word most commonly used by people when describing events in which they had been offended was 'patronising', which Professor Culpeper said was because the British are particularly sensitive to power hierarchies and can take offence when a speaker adopts a position of superiority. 'What British people tend to react to and label as impoliteness are abuses of power, that is, cases where a person or group exerts power over another person or group beyond what is considered legitimate,' he said. 'This means that while asking someone to do something in a normal way is not considered impolite when the speaker is in a position of power, for example a boss asking an employee to do something, even politely worded requests could be deemed to be rude, if the speaker were in a position of very low power.'","Study probes diary reports of rudeness to find British are as polite as ever .

Escape: Alan Giles (left) was in the open part of the multiple-category HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire, serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts (right) in 1995 . Giles was described as white, 5ft 9in height and of proportionate build, with short grey hair and blue eyes. He has a scar on the right of his forehead and another small one by his left eye. He has tattoos of an eagle on his back and a swallow, shark and flower on his left arm. The murderer was described by police as an ‘expert digger’ at the time of the killing. He became the ninth killer in Britain to be put behind bars despite no trace of a victim’s body. But in 1998, Giles phoned police from his cell to confess to the killing and where he had buried the body. After spending hours excavating earth in the back garden of a house in Edgbaston, West Midlands, forensic anthropologists recovered a body 5ft below the surface, hidden by thick undergrowth. Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty . Dental records and x-rays confirmed . the body was of Mr Ricketts, but it was too decomposed to find a cause . of death. At an inquest, a transcript was read out of the interview . between Giles and police. HMP Hewell - which is governed by . Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a . scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said . it was unacceptably dirty. The . report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were . high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs . and some staff seemed to lack motivation. It . also said: ‘Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been . “cleaned” by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the . exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.’ The . prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender . Management Service said the management team had been strengthened. It read: ‘I don’t know whether I grabbed . him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him . round the throat. A struggle broke out. I left him on the ground, where I showed you, in the garden.’ He went on to say that he had hit the student from Quinton, Birmingham, with a piece of wood, but it was not clear whether that had killed him. Detective Inspector John Cashion of West Mercia Police said: ‘We have a dedicated investigation team working expeditiously to locate and apprehend Giles and to that end we are also liaising with our colleagues in West Midlands Police and in the Prison Service. ‘We have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible. It should be borne in mind that Giles was in an open part of the prison when he went missing. ‘However we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999. Furthermore, we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The level of absconding from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began. Troubles: The HMIP report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation . ‘Absconds are still 13 per cent lower . under this Government. We are not complacent about this issue and are . looking at ways in which the risk of absconding can be reduced further. ‘We . are committed to ensuring that risk to the public is minimised. All . those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and . categorised as being of low risk to the public.’ Giles was believed to have been wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and white trainers. He has had recent contact with family in the West Midlands and most of his friends are in the same area. HMP Hewell was created by an amalgamation of the three former prisons on this site, Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange, in June 2008. The prison formerly known as Brockhill has since closed.","Alan Giles was in open part of HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire .

The estranged wife at the  centre of one of Britain’s  biggest divorce cases yesterday said she would ‘settle for £300million’ of her husband’s money, plus legal bills. Michelle Young estimated that Scot Young – once a successful property tycoon – was worth ‘a few billion at least’. The couple yesterday embarked on the final chapter of a seven-year court divorce battle. Battle: Michelle Young, 49, told a High Court judge that her estranged businessman husband Scot once spent £1 million a year on dining out as she launched a High Court divorce settlement battle . Mr . Young, 51, insists he is ‘hopelessly insolvent’ and has no wealth or . assets to fund the vast divorce settlement his 49-year-old wife demands. Earlier . this year he served three months of a six-month prison term for . contempt of court after he failed to reveal information about his . finances. Mrs Young, mother to his two children, continues to insist . he is hiding the truth, and yesterday told the High Court he had ‘a vast . fortune hidden’. She has refused to complete their divorce until the . settlement is agreed, stopping him marrying his fiancée Noelle Reno, a . 29-year-old model. High seas: Mrs Young said her husband Young paid '£2 million to £4 million' for a boat - 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' - and had talked about buying a 'very expensive helicopter' to fly between a home near Oxford and London . Mrs Young told Mr Justice Moor of the extravagant life she had enjoyed with her husband before they separated in 2006. ‘We . had vast estates. We had staff,’ she said. ‘We had a very luxury . lifestyle.’ Mrs Young, a former model, said she had  jewellery which . cost a million pounds and which she  auctioned at Sotheby’s for between . £160,000 and £180,000. She added: ‘We had a chandelier in our drawing room. The other chandelier sits in the White House. They were valuable assets. Plans: Once divorced Mr Young plans to wed his fiancee, 29-year-old model and actress, Noelle Reno . ‘I . paid £10,000 for a beautiful piece of furniture around 15 or 18 years . ago. It was a beautiful side piece. I bought that at Sotheby’s.’ Mrs . Young said they had moved house a number of times and the profit on one . house was ‘£10million’. She said Mr Young paid ‘£2million to £4million’ for a yacht – ‘a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat’ – and had . talked about buying a ‘very expensive helicopter’ to fly between their . homes in Oxfordshire and London. The couple lived in Belgravia, . central London, for three or four years and in Miami where they owned . three Porsche cars, she said. Mrs Young told the judge: ‘My husband . has never produced a shred of real evidence about where one asset has . gone to.’ She accused him of being ‘incredibly’ secretive about finance . and accused him of hiding his ‘vast fortune’ offshore. ‘He was . constantly on the phone to his high-profile friends and advisers talking . about  multi-million-pound deals he was involved with,’ she said. ‘If . I heard it... he would quickly run off... or jump out of the Phantom or . Ferrari so I couldn’t hear.’ She added: ‘He was  secretive. I wasn’t . made aware very much regarding the business side.’ Mrs Young, who in . the past has described herself as a  ‘pioneer’ for divorcing women, . said she wanted a £25million house and wanted to live in Belgravia. She . was previously awarded £30,000 a month to pay for rent and school fees . for their two daughters, Scarlett, 20 and Sasha, 18. In court hearings earlier this year she claimed she was owed more than £1million in unpaid maintenance. Mr Young denied his ex-wife’s allegations yesterday and at one point asked the judge if her ‘ranting’ was allowed. He . was made bankrupt over a £1.8million debt in 2010 and claims to be . living off the generosity of friends including entrepreneur Sir Philip . Green and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. The estranged . couple began their relationship in 1989 and married in 1995, before . separating in 2006. After a hearing due to last four weeks Mr Justice . Moor will make a final decision about how much Mr Young is worth. The trial continues.

The Coast Guard confirmed, and then quickly denied, that the mysterious new barge in San Francisco Bay belongs to Google. On Wednesday, the Coast Guard visited the barge on Treasure Island, near the Bay Bridge. A spokesman for the Coast Guard said that Google is the owner of the barge, but that they can't say more about the project due to a nondisclosure agreement. 'We can confirm that Google is involved or associated with the barge but there is a nondisclosure agreement in effect; the Coast Guard is unable to discuss or divulge any further details at this time,' Petty Officer 1st Class Thomas McKenzie told CNBC. Neither confirming or denying: Members of the Coast Guard have confirmed that the mysterious four-story barge in San Francisco Bay is owned by Google. But shortly after making those statements another official retracted them . Under wraps: The San Francisco barge is docked at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay and is guarded by security and fences . Possible: This large structure parked between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google . But Officer McKenzie's statement was quickly countered by Petty Officer Barry Bena who told the Portland Press Herald that the Coast Guard would not be confirming or denying Google's alleged ownership of the barge. 'Due to issues of commercial confidentiality we are unable to disclose any more information at this time,' Officer Bena said. Lt Joshua Dykman told the San Jose Mercury News that he hadn't signed a non-disclosure agreement, but had been told by his superiors not to discuss the project because of 'legal reasons'. 'Once the project is completed, we will be releasing information,' he said. The mystery surrounding the barge in . San Francisco recently crossed the continent thanks to a similar barge showing up . in the Portland, Maine harbor. Mystery: This is the Maine barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by Google . According . to Coast Guard officials there, no such non-disclosure agreement has . been set up because work has not started on the barge. Construction is . expected to start once the San Francisco project wraps. However, Ensign Connan Ingham says that the Coast Guard officials in Maine know the owner of the Portland barge. 'We have people in the (Coast Guard's) Prevention Department who have been asked by the owner not to talk about it,' Ingham told the Press-Herald. 'They are fully aware of what's on the barge.' Petty Officer Robert Simpson, spokesman for the Coast Guard in Boston, said it wasn't uncommon for the Coast Guard to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. But what's piquing interest the most is not whether or not Google owns the barges. CNET put out a pretty convincing story connecting the company to the barges. What they will be used for is more puzzling. Plans? Sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco's Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public . Is this it? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center . One theory is that they are being built as floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers. Google has refused to comment on the vessels, though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally-friendly sea-powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent. The Portland Press-Herald reports the Maine barge is docked at the city's Ricker's Warf. Contractors from local engineering firm Cianbro Corp. are installing high-tech equipment in the vessel, though workers said even they didn't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for. Little is known about them, but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor. The structures are registered with a Delaware corporation as BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011 and BAL0100. In binary code used in computing, the numbers spell out 'one,' 'two,' 'three' and 'four.' Currently, numbers 1 and 2 are on the water in San Francisco and No. 3 is in Portland Harbor. This is an aerial view of the 'secret project' in San Francisco Bay . This is Hangar 3 on Treasure Island, alongside Pier 1, as seen in Apple Maps, before construction began . Also, the Delaware company to which they're registered is called Buy and Large, a likely joking reference to 'Buy N Large,' the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 Pixar film 'WALL-E.' Google's patent describes 'a system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units.' Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center. 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.' Jonathan Koomey, a Stanford research fellow and expert on data centers, said companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft have been installing specially built data centers in shipping containers for some time because they're easy to deploy. Meanwhile, KPIX 5 reports that Google is actually building a floating marketing center at Hangar 3 for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable computer the company has under development.

KPIX 5 claims sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco’s Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public. The media outlet also reported that construction on the site, near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, stopped several weeks ago because Google does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront. Construction on the site commenced last year, and the work is being shielded by a high security fence.","The Coast Guard confirmed yesterday that they visited the mysterious four-storey barge being constructed in San Francisco Bay .

Court documents have revealed that the newlywed bride who is charged with pushing her husband to his death during a hike in Montana reportedly wanted to avoid a police investigation. A friend told investigators that Jordan Graham went back to the scene of the crime to search for her husband Cody Johnson's body herself days after he died. The friend said that Graham wanted the search called off and 'the cops out of it'. The documents collected by federal prosecutors also describe an email from a person named Tony that said Johnson had fallen to his death and called for an end to the search. Investigators say the message was sent from an account using a computer registered to Graham's father. Second thoughts: Ms Graham told a friend the morning of the day her husband went missing that she was doubting the viability of the ill-fated marriage . Still free: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the federal courthouse after pleading not guilty to three charges stemming from the death of her husband . Graham has pleaded not guilty to murder and making a false statement. Police believe the newlywed pushed her husband off a cliff in Montana's Glacier National Park after a heated argument which is thought to be over him asking her for an annulment. 'One of the police theories is that the new bride ""snapped"" after her husband figured out she had lied about being in love with him. She was only in love with the idea of being a bride,' a source close to the investigation told the National Enquirer. The source also revealed that authorities believe Cody told her he . wanted a divorce or an annulment and she couldn't face telling her friends . her husband already wanted out of the week-old marriage, so she came up with a crazy plan to kill him and make it look like an accident, it is believed. The couple had been together for less than two years when they got married and it is said both of them were having doubts about tying the knot. Graham (left) 'pushed Johnson (right) with both . hands in the back, and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' an affidavit states . A friend of the accused murderer told . the Enquirer: 'Jordan was a dreamer who was more excited about the idea . of marriage than actually being married. 'She loved picking the wedding dress . and showing off her ring, but on the day of the actual wedding, she . sobbed uncontrollably.' The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers. Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment. Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage. Jordan Graham, who goes by 'JoJo' is pictured on her wedding day . Family friend Tracey Maness told the Missoulian that Johnson was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham . Reported missing on July 8 when he did . not show up at work, authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body . until July 11 when Graham told officials she found it in the hard to . reach spot after she thought to look there. Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died'. As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Graham, her story began to change. Having first told authorities that . her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, . Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he . died. Doomed: Ms Graham's second thought about her marriage to Mr Johnson saw the union tragically end only eight days after they were married . Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson . argued on the trail. When he grabbed her . arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in . the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an . affidavit. Earlier that day, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.' Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding.","Jordan Linn Graham and Cody Lee Johnson were married only eight days when he disappeared .

A professional wrestler in Iowa has come up with an enticing proposition for sponsors - the chance to have their logo inked permanently on his back. Levi McDaniel came up with the idea to sell advertising space on his back as a way to raise money for a cancer charity in memory of his aunt who died this month. After advertising for sponsors on eBay, a Des Moines tattoo and piercing parlor took him up on the deal and offered to do the tattoo for free. Deal: Wrestler Levi McDaniel is offering companies the chance to have their logo tattooed on his back . Opening bid: Lucky Gal tattoo parlor is the first company to have their logo inked on to McDaniel's back . 'It just seemed like he had a big heart, . since he was going to give the money away to family,'  Chris . Pruisner, of the Lucky Gal parlor, told the Des Moines Register. McDaniel, 23, said he got the idea for selling advertising space on his body from Rock 'n' Roll Wrestling founder Buck Zumhofe. After seeing McDaniel's extensive tattoos, Zumhofe suggested that he used future ones to attract sponsors. McDaniel said he wasn't sure if Zumhofe was joking but when he thought about the size of the crowds he competes in front of he decided to give it a go. The wrestler listed his offer on eBay, saying 'let me be your mascot' and telling prospective sponsors their logo would have plenty of exposure thanks to his more than 22,000 Twitter followers and a career performing in front of huge crowds. Exposure: McDaniel says the logos will be seen by the large crowds who watch his wrestling matches . When tattooist Pruisner heard about the auction he loved the idea and decided it would be better if his logo went on McDaniel rather than something else. 'Someone said something [in the article] . about him ending up with something like the Gerber Baby on his back. I . decided it would be better if I did it than someone else,' he said. After contacting McDaniel in private, he offered to pay $1,000 and do the tattoo for free - an offer the wrestler was more than happy to accept. Todd Countryman, one of 3XWrestling's owners, said McDaniel's tattoos added to his presence in the ring. 'It gives Levi an extra gimmick and . draws more attention to him. It could make whatever company decides to . advertise on him seem more unique and draw a little more attention to . him,' he told USA Today. On show: Chris Pruisner of Lucky Gal took up McDaniel's offer and tattooed his company's logo on the wrestler himself . McDaniel said his new tattoo was awesome, and added: 'Chris did a great job; he’s a cool guy with a cool shop. I . really like the tattoo, so I’m happy. It was all worth it.' He donated 75 per cent of the sponsorship money to the family of his aunt, Linda, and the remainder to a cancer charity in memory of her. Since having the logo inked on his back, McDaniel has been approached by other companies also wanting to advertise on the wrestler's body.","Levi McDaniel sells space on his back to advertisers .

A medical examiner has testified saying he was unable to prove how the wife of a Mormon doctor charged with murder died, complicating an eventual decision by jurors in the case. The medical examiner said that Michele MacNeill’s heart could have stopped beating because of a natural reaction to the toxicity of prescription drugs she was using following her recent face lift and latent heart disease. 'I didn't believe I had enough to justify homicide,' Todd Grey testified on Thursday about his finding in the case involving defendant Martin MacNeill. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Inconclusive: Medical examiner Todd Grey changed the report of Michele MacNeill's death so that it wasn't necessarily a natural causes but said that it was undetermined . Grey said an irregular heartbeat was the most probable manner of death, but he doesn't know what caused it. A heart arrhythmia 'leaves no footprints' that can be detected by a forensic pathologist, he said. While he did not directly state any alternative theories, the prosecutor laid one out for him, saying: 'If you were to learn that the defendant here drugged up Michele MacNeill, and convinced her to get into the tub, and held her down for a little bit and it caused her death, would that scenario be consistent with how Michele MacNeill may have died here?' 'Yes it certainly is possible,' Grey responded. The assistant medical examiner who drew up the first report has since died, but Grey said that he purposefully made it more open-ended. 'You wonder is something else going on here, if there is motive,' he said of the case. Grey's testimony came a day after one of Martin MacNeill’s mistresses testified that he once described how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural. Anna Walthall said MacNeill told her over 'pillow talk' in 2005 that '`there's something you can give someone that's natural that's a heart attack that's not detectable after they have a heart attack.'' One of Grey's subordinates initially ruled that Michele MacNeill's 2007 death was natural from heart disease, and that she had high blood pressure and was developing myocardosis, or inflamed heart tissue that could have interfered with a normal heart rate or rhythm, he said. Investigative findings prompted Grey to change the autopsy finding to undetermined - and to add that drug toxicity may have played a role. Staying quiet: Martin MacNeill (left) has yet to be called to the stand, and it is not clear if he ever will . Those investigative findings 'raised a question as to whether this was a simple, straightforward, natural death,' said Grey. He wasn't asked to elaborate on the stand. That said, the change to undetermined opened the way for the murder charge against Martin MacNeill. Prosecutors have said he hounded Michele MacNeill to get cosmetic surgery, then knocked her out with painkillers, Valium and sleeping pills and left her to die in a bathtub. For the first time in the trial, prosecutor Chad Grunander suggested that MacNeill 'held her down to cause her death.' Defense lawyers argue she had a heart attack and fell into the tub. Grey said he couldn't confirm that she drowned, but it is possible. He said her lungs were about twice their normal weight, possibly because they were saturated with fluid or blood congestion, 'but I couldn't use those findings alone to prove drowning.' Family view: Alexis Somers, who is a doctor and is familiar with the drugs her father gave her mother, took the stand for a second day, repeating how she believes 'he killed her' Defense and offense: MacNeill's lawyer Randy Spector (left) tried to poke holes in Somers' credibility and prosecutor Chad Grunader (right) hails her as one of his star witnesses . Emergency medics previously testified Michelle MacNeill expelled two or three cups of fluid from her mouth when they performed chest compressions. Still Grey said it wasn't clear if the water came from her lungs or stomach. In addition to the medical examiner, the court also heard from one of MacNeill’s older daughters Alexis Somers. She first testified on Wednesday and continued on Thursday, when the prosecution tried to poke holes in her credibility. They argue the Somers, who now uses her mother’s maiden name, has based her recollections of the events surrounding her mother’s death on her desire to seek revenge on her father. She has not been shy in offering her opinion, saying explicitly why she was so determined to investigate her mother’s death. ‘Because I believe my father killed her,’ she said in court on Thursday. Picture perfect: Martin and Michele MacNeill, who died in April 2007 after a facelift, had eight children . During her testimony on Wednesday, Somers revealed that just days after Michele was found dead in the family's bathtub, she received a phone call from her father saying that he had found a nanny for her younger siblings. She told the court that he started to say that the nanny's name was Jillian and she cut him off. 'You mean Gypsy Jillian Willis? I know that woman and I know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home,' Alexis recalled telling her father. 'He got irate. He was screaming at me, ""How dare you, how dare you accuse me?""' The court had never been told that Michele had suspicions about her husband cheating before, but Alexis said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling. That number was registered to Gypsy Jyll Willis.","Medical examiner changed the report of Michele MacNeill's death from originally saying that she died of natural causes to 'undetermined'

Eric Pickles has accused ‘gullible’ BBC journalists of working with Labour to maximise the ‘political damage’ over the Coalition’s spending cuts. In one of the most outspoken attacks on the Corporation by a senior minister, he said regional programmes gave ‘unquestioning’ airtime to Labour councils complaining about cuts. The Communities Secretary praised councils that had ‘risen to the challenge, managed change, protected the best of the public service ethos’ in a speech to the New Local Government Network in London. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles stepped up his criticism of the Corporation, claiming reporters were 'unquestioning' in reporting attacks on council spending reductions . However, he added: ‘A number of . Labour councils have given way to temptation of reliving the past in an . 80s tribute band, maximising the cuts to the most political damaging. 'With a backing group of gullible and unquestioning BBC regional reporting, this has led to a heady mix.’ Mr Pickles has long been angry at the . way funding cuts to town halls have been reported by the BBC. On Monday, . he said: ‘You would think, listening to the BBC, that sensible savings . and improved services were a bad thing.’ In his speech yesterday, he said that funding cuts would have been made regardless of who won the election in 2010. ‘There is a reasonable case that . because local government was not considered to be a priority service by . Labour that councils may have borne an even greater share,’ he said. He said the coalition had devolved . spending, responsibility and powers to councils and accused Labour of . adopting the ‘Miss Havisham approach’, after the jilted bride in Great . Expectations. He said opponents were ‘refusing to . change from a faded wedding dress, waiting for the return of a groom who . is not coming back and who realised you were mad decades ago, feasting . on former glories, reciting the taxing mantra, dreaming of taking, not . making. Fooling yourself into thinking you can really have power without . responsibility.’ BBC news reporters were accused by the minister of being 'gullible' in accepting Labour criticism of spending cuts . Mr Pickles also urged councils to open . to public scrutiny more of its books, spending, meetings and data. He . claimed  there was a ‘secret state in our country’ because too many . unelected quangos refused to publish such information. He attacked ‘a regime of local quangos . who help set council tax, but have minimum presence or public profile’, . singling out internal drainage boards, integrated transport . authorities, crematorium boards and waste disposal authorities. ‘I want to open up this secret state . and ensure their council tax setting is accountable directly to the . people, and their policy decisions are open and transparent,’ he said. He said council tax in Manchester was being forced up by a ‘botched PFI deal’ signed by the unelected waste authority. ‘A shoddy deal by a shadowy unelected . body, with no one taking responsibility and local taxpayers left with . service cuts and higher taxes,’ he said. ‘That isn’t local democracy – . it’s municipal autocracy.’ Last night, a BBC spokesman said: ‘We . are confident that BBC local and regional coverage of local government . is impartial, fair and balanced.’","Communities Secretary steps up criticism of the BBC reporting .

A new storm has erupted over tickets for the London 2012 Paralympics after some disabled parents were told they cannot sit with their families while watching the games. Wheelchair-user mothers and fathers have been shocked to find out that they cannot be seated with their young children because of 'discriminatory' seating rules. They claim to have been told that only one accompanying adult could join them in the wheelchair area while children need to be sat with at least one able-bodied adult. Wheelchair-users mothers and fathers have complained that only one person is allowed to accompany them at paralympic venues . Disabled mother-of-two Beth Davis-Hofbauer said she felt 'non-human' when she was told her family could not sit with her at the events which start on August 29. Outraged by the poor provisions for disabled visitors she has launched a petition on Change.org which has attracted more than 12,000 signatures. The wheelchair user of Fareham, Hampshire said she had tried to book tickets for a cycling event at the Velodrome for her husband and carer, Ed, autistic four-year-old son Milo and her baby daughter. But she claims a LOCOG official told her because she was disabled only one accompanying adult could sit with her in the wheelchair area. The 32-year-old said: 'They wouldn't even allow me to pay full adult price for the children to sit on my lap. They said my kids, would have to sit somewhere else - which of course they could absolutely not. 'I felt non-human. It's because I'm in a wheel-chair. I cannot believe that at this event, which could inspire a new generation of athletes, has a discriminatory ticket policy. 'Quite apart from these practical considerations I want to share this special occasion with my family.' However, she added: 'This isn't just about my family - it's about making sure every family is able to enjoy the Paralympics together now and in the future.' Mrs Davies-Hofbauer says she is unable to attend any of the Paralympic events because of the seating plans and lack of consideration for families with a disabled parent or child. Wheelchair-users Beth Davis-Hofbauer, who has a four-year-old autistic son and a 19-month-old baby complained about the Paralympics' 'discriminatory ticketing policy' She said another adult would have to buy a ticket to accompany her children as it is essential her husband sits with her. She added: 'We like to do things together, despite me being in a wheelchair, and I can't believe that LOCOG have not made the provisions to cater for me and other families. It's an outrage.' The self-styled 'mumpreneur' who runs a craft box company Little Doers said: 'I don't want special treatment - I just want to be treated the same as everyone else.' Another disabled mother; Melissa Chapin, 43, who bought six tickets eleven months ago for her eight-year-old twins, Ben and Mia, two wheelchair users and their carers, has labelled the seating rules a 'fiasco'. The actress from Milton Keynes, who specialises in professional voice-over work, said she contacted the tickets official after seeing the online petition. She said: 'When I spoke to the ticketing agent I was told I shouldn't have been sold the tickets as the children can't attend in without adult supervision. I was furious and shouted 'I am an adult!' 'She also told me that the computer system won't sell children's tickets without an accompanying adult. 'I am the twins' sole carer, just like other single mums. It just so happens I'm sitting on wheels. 'She then backtracked and said she meant a non-disabled adult.' The mother from Milton Keynes added: 'The Olympics planners have clearly made a terrible blunder and it is going to cause enormous pain and heartbreak for families planning to attend the Paralympics.' The Games' organisers denied they had a policy that wheelchair users could only be accompanied by one other person when attending events. A LOCOG spokesman said: 'We designed our venues such that accessible seating will be located around the new venues at different price points so that wheelchair users can sit with their friends and families rather than in one single designated area, and we included a companion seat in the cost of a ticket for a wheelchair space. 'With just a couple of weeks to go to the Games, many sessions are now selling out and additional spaces are subject to the same availability as for non-wheelchair users.' The organisers for the Paralympics and the Olympic London 2012 Games have been under fire for poor organisation of tickets throughout both games. More than 2.2 million tickets have already been sold for the 12-day Paralympic Games, and another 400,000 are due to go on sale in the coming days. But technical issues have prevented thousands from buying tickets online which has prompted a further wave of criticism on Twitter. LOCOG admitted the unexpected surge for tickets had caused initial problems but insisted these had now been resolved.","Wheelchair-user parents cannot be seated with young children .

"Manufacturer Videalert says they have been 'inundated' with requests . By . Eleanor Harding and Lizzie Edmonds . PUBLISHED: . 05:38 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 4 November 2013 . Councils are using CCTV-style cameras to catch parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up pupils from school. The cameras are timed to switch on during the school run and zoom in on the number plates of parents who stop in restricted zones. They then record footage of the registration number and parking sign and send it as a ‘video and data package’ to councils. Target: Parents on the school run will be hit with fines from CCTV-style cameras that are currently being trailed by councils across the country (library image) This information can help local . authorities issue fines of up to £120 to families who stop outside . schools to let their children out. The . surveillance system is being made available to councils across the . country for £16,000 by the manufacturer Videalert, which specialises in . traffic management. Bosses . at the firm say five councils in London and at least two others outside . the capital are testing the system, but refused to say which they were. Surveillance: CCTV-style cameras, similar to this one in London, are to be trialled by several councils across the country . The . firm says it developed the system after being approached by a council . concerned about the safety of pupils in the chaos outside school gates. According to insurance industry figures, more than 1,000 children a month are injured on roads around British schools. Tim . Daniels, a Videalert director, said: ‘Head teachers had been . complaining about the parking outside their schools and worrying about . the safety of children. ‘Since . the first trials started over the summer we have been inundated with . requests from other councils across the country asking about the . system.’ Yesterday, Enfield . Council confirmed that it had launched a pilot of the technology but . said it was too early to decide whether to buy it. The system has angered motoring campaigners, who said it would give councils another chance to use parents as cash cows. Alex . Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists Action Group, . claimed the cameras were illegal because government guidance said they . should not be used routinely. The . Scottish actor Tom Conti, 71, who drops his grandchild off at school in . London, compared the camera system to surveillance by the Stasi. He said: ‘The councils are doing this for revenue. To target parents is frankly disgusting.’ Mr Daniels said his system was three times cheaper than camera cars, which were often used to police school parking. Alternative: Director of manufacturer Videalert Tim Daniels insists the cameras will be cheaper than 'camera cars', pictured, which are often used to police school parking . He . told The Sunday Times: ‘Our system can be fixed to existing street . furniture and programmed to look for specific school-gate offences such . as parking on a zigzag line for more than three seconds.’ Anger: Eric Pickles has hit out at councils who were using parking enforcement powers as a 'cash cow' instead of a way to curb crime . It . comes after a number of ‘lollipop rage’ incidents outside schools, . where parents have become involved in disputes about parking and other . issues. According to the Local Government Association, There were 7,000 such incidents in 2011, up from 1,400 in 2008. But . Department for Transport guidance says CCTV should only be used to . enforce parking rules when it is impractical to use traffic wardens. When . CCTV is used, drivers only find out they have been caught when a fixed . penalty ticket drops through their letter box some time later, making it . harder to challenge the fine. Brandon Lewis, Local Government Minister said: 'The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This Government wants to rein in over-zealous parking enforcement, including stopping the use of CCTV spy cameras for parking, so it focuses on supporting sensible drivers, not raising money. 'Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle serious crime, not to raise money for council coffers by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run.' Councils . are on track to make £635million profit from parking this year - with . income from fines and penalties alone topping £340million. Earlier . this year, Eric Pickles hit out at councils who were using parking . enforcement powers as a ‘cash cow’ instead of a way to curb crime. The Communities and Local Government Secretary said that councils using parking to supplement their income were acting ‘outside the law’ and should be stopped. He . said: ‘We are worried that what is happening in local authorities is . they are using parking fines as a kind of a cash cow from motorists. The . legislation is very clear, you cannot do so.’","Cameras switch on during school run and zoom in on number plates .

Three people have been arrested in Oklahoma after one was shot in the back during an alleged Bigfoot hunting quest in a case that has baffled police. It all started on Saturday night when a man called 911 saying that he'd accidentally shot his friend. The pair claimed to have been on a Sasquatch hunting expedition on the corner of 177th East Avenue and Tiger Switch Road in Rogers County. One of the men, Omar Pineda, told police he flinched after hearing a 'barking noise' and accidentally shot his friend in the back. 'When you start off with an explanation like that do you believe anything after that?' Rogers County Sheriff Walton told Oklahoma's News 9. Adding to the inconsistent stories, Pineda's wife, Lacey Jane Pineda, 22, told police that someone else had shot at her husband. Proof? There is still debate over the existence of the Sasquatch and grainy photos such as this one are often dismissed as hoaxes. This latest story has done nothing to add any light on the existence of Bigfoot . Hardly hunting territory: The Bigfoot hunters claim to have been here, on the corner of 177th East Avenue and Tiger Switch Road, when they were searching for the Sasquatch, resulting in one being shot. Police do not believe their story . Police say that drugs and alcohol may been involved. The men met emergency responders at a QuikTrip convenience store near Interstate 44 and 161st Street after the shooting. Pineda, 21, was arrested for reckless conduct with a firearm and obstruction. Deputies also arrested Perry Don James, Pineda's father-in-law. James threw his son-in-law's gun in a pond on the property because he is a convicted felon and was afraid to have the gun on his property, the Sheriff said. James, 53, was booked on complaints of felon in possession of a firearm and destruction of evidence. Deputies arrested Lacey Jane Pineda as well for obstruction because of her account of events. Believable? There is no shortness of images mocking up what Bigfoot might look like should he exist. The Sasquatch hunting craze was reignited recently after new 'evidence' was found. However the findings turned out to be bear hair . The shooting victim was not charged and is expected to survive. Walton said they will continue to investigate the incident. 'It probably was an accidental shooting,' Walton said. 'Our efforts now are to locate the weapon that was used.' Whether the group were hunting or not, the Bigfoot search craze was recently reignited after scientists claimed to have found evidence the creature exists. However the 'evidence' turned out to be the hair of a rare species of bear. That doesn't seem to have stopped avid hunters from continuing to try and find the elusive Yeti.","Man calls police in Rogers County, Oklahoma, on Saturday night saying he accidentally shot his friend in the back .

The Texans lost the game 27-24 after leading 21-3 prior to Kubiak’s collapse. It was the team’s sixth straight loss after opening the season 2-0 with Super Bowl hopes. 'Obviously we were all upset about (it) but trying to stay focused at the same time,' quarterback Case Keenum said. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips took over for Kubiak in the second half and described the trying situation. ‘We had to adjust as far as the head coach not being there,’ Phillips said. ‘But, it was a shock to everybody.’ Kubiak has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring . quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub - and .

Expectations were high in . 2010 after Houston finished at 9-7 for its first winning record in 2009. But the Texans instead fell to 6-10, which led to many fans calling for . Kubiak's firing. His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner . Bob McNair has stepped up to keep Kubiak and defended him several times . amid the bumps. Among recent departures were assistant head coach Alex . Gibbs (for Seattle) and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan went to join . his father, Mike, in Washington. A former NFL quarterback, Kubiak made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Kyle Shanahan, winning two Super Bowls . Kubiak hired former Denver offensive coordinator Rick Dennison to . replace Shanahan and former Atlanta offensive coordinator Greg Knapp to . become Houston's quarterbacks coach. Dennison worked on the Broncos' staff during Kubiak's 11 years as Denver's offensive coordinator, and . Knapp coached Schaub for three seasons with the Falcons.

The 61-year-old, who has run Doug and Di's Off Licence, for 28 years, said: 'It was reckless beyond belief. 'They didn’t check who was in there before they threw it inside and it was a miracle it didn’t hurt someone or cause some serious damage. Mr Gill said it is a 'miracle' no one was hurt in the incident, which he said was 'reckless beyond belief' 'What worries me is that my family, . including my three-year-old granddaughter, will often be out in the shop . and if they’d have been in its path they could have been badly burned. 'I was in the back at the time and I just heard a deafening bang. When I got downstairs the shop had filled with smoke.' Mr Gill chased the group along the road after they threw the rocket but they ran inside a house. Ahead of tomorrow’s Bonfire Night celebrations, police chiefs have urged anyone worried about anti-social behaviour involving fireworks to report it. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan of Greater Manchester Police said: 'If behaviour gets out of hand and causes distress to anyone then we will take firm action.'

The troubled Co-operative Bank is to shut around 50 branches as part of a rescue plan. Investors and hedge funds will take control of the bank in an attempt to plug a £1.5 billion black hole in its finances. The bank ran into trouble after buying the Britannia Building Society and a later-abandoned attempt to buy hundreds of Lloyds Bank branches. The Co-Operative group will only keep a 30 per cent stake in the bank, but insists its ethical practices will remain embedded in the firm . The deal will see Co-operative Group lose overall control of its banking arm, which has traded on its reputation for ethical behaviour, and retain just a 30 per cent stake. The funerals-to-supermarkets group had initially hoped to retain control of the ethical lender by giving bond investors a minority stake in return for a £500 million loss on their debt. But bondholders, including US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital, will take control of the bank under the new plan, which will see it listed on the stock market next year. The Co-op's loss of control of the bank has raised concerns among some customers. The bank has traditionally attracted organisations like trade unions and charities because of its ethical approach. But the Co-op said its values and ethics will be ‘legally embedded’ in the lender's new rules. Investors must now vote to back the plan, and the Co-op warned that the bank will fall into state hands through the resolution process if they do not, leaving investors empty-handed. Co-operative Group chief executive Euan Sutherland insists it will retain 'effective control' of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder . The group announced plans to close around 50 of its 324 bank branches, about 15 per cent of its estate, without revealing how many jobs will go among the lender's 9,000 staff. The Co-op has faced tough questions over the impact on the bank's ethical values from the new plan to cede control to predatory US hedge funds and blue-chip investors. Co-op Group chief executive Euan Sutherland had insisted the group, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, will retain ‘effective control’ of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder. He said last month the co-operative principles will be embedded in the constitution of the bank. Mr Sutherland said today: 'We recognise the huge importance of ethics and values for all our customers and remain committed to upholding them.' Its turnaround is expected to take four to five years, and will shift its focus to households and small and medium-sized businesses. The Co-op added that the bank's outlook remains 'challenging', although monthly bad debt charges have fallen. The Co-op will be the bank's single biggest shareholder, and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent . The Co-op had originally said there would be ‘no plan B’ for its recapitalisation, which would have seen the Co-op retain control through a stock market flotation - a turnaround strategy requiring a £500 million contribution from bondholders, with £1 billion coming from the group. But bondholders led by US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital - who own 43% of the higher-ranking bonds which had been due to be hit - ratcheted up the pressure on the bank, proposing an alternative plan of converting more debt into shares. The new deal is expected to need approval from 80 per cent of shareholders, with a vote set to take place before the year end. The Co-op Bank's woes have been blamed on soured corporate loans, many of which were acquired with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009. Retail investors such as pensioners who bought the bank's bonds for a steady income will be offered a choice between two types of bond - one paying income and another repaying the principal they invested - although they will still suffer losses. Mark Taber, who campaigned for retail investors, said: 'This deal has been extremely hard-fought and is now a much better solution for retail holders and pensioners.' The Co-op Group will contribute £462 million to the bank's turnaround, including £129 million handed to retail investors, £333 million in cash and £40 million in interest savings. Investors such as hedge funds will take up to 70 per cent of the bank's equity through a combination of converting debt to shares, buying equity and acquiring fresh bank debt. The Co-op will be the bank's single biggest shareholder, and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent. 'That will give us a key role in shaping the bank's future direction,' Mr Sutherland added.","Bank hands control to investors in rescue plan to plug £1.5bn black hole .

Michael Sikora, defending, said his client's blood was three times the legal limit when the killing took place. Prosecutors sought the death penalty, but Sweeten took a plea deal and his two consecutive 20-year jail terms were upheld last week by the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, the Salt Lake City Tribune reported. According to the newspaper, during the 2011 trial Sweeten said: ‘I messed up. I'm absolutely ashamed of myself. ‘I want to acknowledge the pain and anguish I have caused.

Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito, 30, is alleged to have sent teammate Jonathan Martin a series of threatening text messages and voice mails. In one of the disturbing exchanges Incognito referred to Martin, 24, as a ‘half-n*****’, while in another he threatened to defecating in his young teammate's mouth. Incognito also made reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them in other texts, reports CBS Sports. Scroll down for video . Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims . Incognito was indefinitely suspended by the NFL on Monday morning while the league investigates the situation involving the rookie player. It is the latest development in a controversial case that first came to light last week when Martin shockingly announced he was taking a leave of absence from the team. Martin accused Incognito of player misconduct after an incident that occurred in the team cafeteria last Monday. Over the weekend it was alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles . including $30,000 dinners. Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, has taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is partly the reason for Martin's shock leave of absence from the team. ESPN . claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to . help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter. ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved. They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team. One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment. Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin . On . Friday, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take . very seriously and will not be tolerated'. Incognito has been playing with the . Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with . the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as . an offensive guard. Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke. Reporter . Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab . for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around . $400.000.' Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation. 'Everything tastes better when . rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I . just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.' Jeff Darlington from NFL.com reported the suspension on Twitter . Jay Glazer from Fox Sports confirmed Darlington's report after allegedly talking with Incognito . Mike Garafalo of Fox Sports 1 gives the official reason for Incognito's suspension . 'Sources': ESPN TV personality, Adam Schefter, who first broke the story, is being attacked by Incognito on Twitter who says Schefter is 'slandering' his name . The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.' They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being. 'The . Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, . have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his . departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary . concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the . statement read. 'As an . organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been . presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. 'Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we . appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's . health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.' After ESPN . reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito . took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing . '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind ""sources"" who . are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.' Three minutes later, the player . added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my . name through the mud with lies.' It . was first reported on Friday that tackle Martin had taken a . personal leave of absence from the team because of persistent bullying . and teasing at the hands of certain teammates. Martin, . nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by . bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice. The . latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters last Monday . after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them . for lunch. The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out. Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University .

A . second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at . right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this . season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of . the Dolphins' struggling offensive line. 'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time. 'You . can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer . in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you . can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to . help the team win.' Pass . protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went . into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) were saddled with a four-game losing streak. Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise.","Richie Incognito, 30, was suspended indefinitely on Monday morning over allegations that he bullied teammate Jonathon Martin, 24 .

If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from the internet, it’s that domestic cats are curious about their surroundings. There are hundreds of online videos of felines investigating everything from treadmills to printers. And their big cousins on the African savannah are just as inquisitive. Evidence for this has arrived in the form of a video in which a cheetah wanders up to the GoPro camera filming it – and licks the lens. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spotted: The cheetah wanders over to the camera after it spies it on the ground . Spot clean: The cheetah quickly sets about licking the lens . The footage has gone viral, with over 130,000 views so far. The HD Hero3 camera had been placed on the ground by wildlife expert Matthew Copham, from Safari Footprints, and pointed towards two cheetahs resting near a bush. At the start of the footage one them wanders slowly over to the camera and begins sniffing it. And after a few seconds it lies down and gives it a good lick. Perhaps it thought it would taste good – or maybe the spot clean was carried out over concern there was some dirt on the lens that would ruin shots of it looking magnificent. After all, we also know that cats take their looks very seriously. After a short time something appears to spook the cheetah, though, and it suddenly gets up, turns and sprints back to its friend. Got it licked: The cheetah gives internet users a brilliant close-up of its tongue . Off and running: Something spooks the cheetah after a short while and it sprints back to its companion . In the wild cheetahs are found in Africa and Iran, with their name deriving from the Hindi word Chita – which translates as ‘the spotted one’. They are, of course, famed for their speed – and have been clocked hitting 70mph for short bursts. This means that their favoured prey of gazelles, impalas, antelopes and birds often don’t stand a chance of escape.","The Hero3 camera was set up by Safari Footprints guide Matthew Copham .

A dilapidated Victorian lighthouse has been returned to its former glory following a £1.35million restoration project. Battered by waves and storms for more than a century, Roker Lighthouse, which stands at the entrance to Sunderland Harbour, Tyne and Wear, had begun to show its age. Both its interior and exterior were in a state of disrepair, while the once powerful light needed replacing. Restoration: Roker Lighthouse, which stands at the entrance to Sunderland Harbour, is undergoing a £1.3million renovation project to bring the crumbling structure back to its former glory . In need of work: Many of the 110-year-old lighthouse's internal rooms, pictured, had fallen into disrepair . Rough around the edges: The money, put aside by Sunderland City Council, has been used to repair some of the Grade II listed building's interior, pictured . Paint on the structure’s 138ft exterior was also peeling. But after Sunderland City Council put aside £1.35million for the restoration, it is now slowly returning back to its former splendour. The grade II listed building has been sandblasted, painted and polished. Its light has been replaced by a £200,000 LED, while work is planned to resurface the deck of the adjoining pier. A gilded 1.6-metre weather vane, which has been daubed in gold-leaf, will be the lighthouse's crowning glory. Lick of paint: A worker paints the exterior of the 138ft lighthouse, built by engineer Henry Hay Wake . Powerful: The building's light - which used to run off gas - has now been replaced by a £200,000 LED, pictured . Bright: The new light, pictured, replaces the former beacon - which could be seen 15 miles out to sea . A team of workers from contractors Trac had to battle winds and waves as high as 20ft to carry out the renovations. Site manager Ian Buchanan said: 'We are still on schedule to finish on time. 'The work we have been doing has been confined to the lantern house because it has been in disrepair for about 40 years. 'You could poke your fingers through holes in the metal walls to the outside because of rot. 'Now, there is new metal and new glass in there, and a new lantern is to be installed.' Former glory: Many of the landmark's original features have been repainted, left, and a 1.6-metre gilded weather vane, right, will now crown the lighthouse .

Building blocks: A crowd gathers on the Roker Lighthouse pier to watch workers construct the iconic building . The landmark was the brainchild of Henry Hay Wake, chief engineer of the . River Wear Commissioners. Constructed between 1885 and 1903, the lighthouse and pier were hailed at the time as a triumph of engineering. It was constructed from 45-ton blocks made from concrete plus grey and red Aberdeen granite. Concrete was poured into huge wooden moulds on shore, before the blocks were installed in to place by a crane - which some sources say was called 'Goliath' Heavy duty: A huge crane, named in some historical sources as 'Goliath', pictured, was used to ease the 45-ton blocks into place . 'A triumph': This picture shows the opening of the lighthouse - which was described as a 'triumph of engineering' when it was completed in 1903 . The original lantern was gas powered and would emit a 45,000 candlepower reflected beam - visible for over 15 miles out to sea. By the end of the 19th century Sunderland Harbour was one of the busiest industrial ports in the country, with 15,000 tons of coal transported through it every day. The lighthouse would have been a welcome sign to hundred of crews coming into the port. Work on the lighthouse begun at the end of July 2013 and the first phase of renovations were completed on Monday.

Devastating: Dozens of witnesses and a soldier rush to put out the flames and rescue the victims on Sunday . The pilot and co-pilot survived but remain in a critical condition. The cause of the crash is not yet known but police claim the heavy rain and poor visibility may have been a factor. Local reports describe a huge plume of smoke erupting from the aircraft when it crashed at 16.15pm local time (8pm GMT) as the 18 people on board screamed for help inside. But seconds later the vessel exploded. Dozens of people rushed from the airport to break the victims free from the plane - and put out the fire - in the pouring rain. Police and three ambulances arrived to take all 18 passengers to hospital where eight were declared dead. Explosion: Witnesses claim the Aerocon plane veered off the runway and exploded in the pouring rain . The remaining 10 - including pilot Kevin Roca Alpire and co-pilot Cecilia Tapia Salina - are still in a serious condition suffering from severe burns and post-traumatic stress. Mr Alpire and Ms Salina were later transferred to a specialist hospital in the city of Guayaramerín, 55 miles from Riberalta. Senior doctor Miguel Batista told local media two of the survivors have suffered second-degree burns, adding: 'Considering the nature of the crash, it is a miracle there are survivors.' The regional minister, Miguel Ruiz, lamented the lack of facilities to rescue the victims. He said: 'We don't have the necessary tools.

LA boutique Kitson has called for a boycott of the Today show after a co-host told viewers not to shop there any longer.

The launch of the collection sparked fury among many customers and Twitter users - particularly among those who have witnessed first-hand the deadly consequences of prescription drug abuse.

A rare Faberge figurine found stashed in a deceased retiree’s upstate New York attic sold at auction Saturday for over $5million. Dated to 1912, the figurine depicts a known personal bodyguard to royalty and was given by Czar Nicholas II to his wife only years before his ouster from power and death at the hands of Bolshevik revolutionaries. The figurine, one of only about 50 known to be in existence, sold at auction for $5.2million, according to WNYT. Very rare: Only about 50 of these figurines are known to exist . Commissioned by the last Russian Czar, the tiny statue is adorned with several diamonds and other materials that make it highly valuable. It has ‘little sapphires in the eyes, little gold trim and gold braid and all these elaborately inlayed enameled double headed imperial eagles,’ auctioneer Colin Stair told WNYT. It was originally purchased from the Soviets after the fall of the Romanoffs by Armand Hammer, a Soviet-aligned industrialist, according to a bill of sale cited by the station. George Davis, of Manhattan’s Hammer Galleries, then bought it from him in 1934 for $2,250 and it had been out of sight since, according to the Register Star. Found in an attic: The tiny statute was found in the attic of descendants of a gallery owner who bought it in 1934 . Going once, going twice: Sold! For $5.2million - during the Saturday auction . Over 100-years-old: The original bill of sale dates back to Imperial Russia . Buried treasure: The statuette was purchased by a London-based jeweler who specializes in Russian pieces . Mr Davis’ descendants found the treasure buried in the attic of recently deceased relatives as they poured over belongings of the estate. It was found in its original box, wrapped in ‘ordinary fashion’ and without ‘special security,’ Mr Stair told WNYT. After being authenticated, it was appraised as high as $800,000, but sold for more than $5million after a brisk 15 minute auction. Wartski, a London-based jeweler specializing in Russian pieces, will pay a total of $6million, including commission, once the transaction is finalized. The British firm bid by phone, the auctioneer noted, joining in-house bidders in a mad dash to the finish. ‘The purchase of the figure is a continuation of our long-running tradition of acquiring Imperial Russian Works of Art,’ Wartski said in a statement to the Register Star.","The figurine was given by Russian Czar Nicholas II to his wife in 1912 .

The number of Americans who believe that JFK’s assassination was the result of a government conspiracy has dropped over the past ten years reveals a new poll. According to an Associated Press-GfK poll, conducted in April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure. While a clear majority still suspect there was a conspiracy behind the tragic death of President John F. Kennedy, the number is down from the 75 percent who felt there was a conspiracy in a 2003 Gallup poll. The number of people who believe that the shooting of JFK was due to a conspiracy has dropped 16 percent in the past ten years . As the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death approaches, the number of Americans who believe Oswald acted alone is at its highest since the period three years after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed the Warren Commission on Nov. 29, 1963, to investigate both Kennedy's assassination and the killing of Oswald days later. The commission concluded that Oswald was the lone gunman. Those who were adults in 1963 were almost as likely as younger Americans to say that Kennedy's killing was a conspiracy involving multiple people - 55 percent, compared to 61 percent. The poll was conducted April 11-15, 2013 and involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 adults nationwide. There has been a 16 per cent drop over the past ten years in the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories surrounding JFK's assassination . The number of Americans who believe Oswald acted alone is at its highest since the period three years after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination . Five decades after President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot and long after official inquiries ended, thousands of pages of investigative documents remain withheld from public view. The contents of these files are partially known - and intriguing - and conspiracy buffs are not the only ones seeking to open them for a closer look. Some serious researchers believe the off-limits files could shed valuable new light on nagging mysteries of the assassination - including what U.S. intelligence agencies knew about accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald before Nov. 22, 1963. It turns out that several hundred of the still-classified pages concern a deceased CIA agent, George Joannides, whose activities just before the assassination and, fascinatingly, during a government investigation years later, have tantalized researchers for years. ‘This is not about conspiracy, this is about transparency,’ said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and author embroiled in a decade-long lawsuit against the CIA, seeking release of the closed documents. ‘I think the CIA should obey the law. I don't think most people think that's a crazy idea.’ The poll found that those who were adults in 1963 were almost as likely as younger Americans to say that Kennedy's killing was a conspiracy involving multiple people - 55 percent, compared to 61 percent .

Others say the continued sealing of 50-year-old documents raises needless questions in the public's mind and encourages conspiracy theories. ‘There is no question that in various ways the CIA obfuscated, but it may be they were covering up operations that were justifiable, benign CIA operations that had absolutely nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination,’ said Anthony Summers, a British author who has written extensively about the JFK case. ‘But after 50 years, there is no reason that I can think of why such operations should still be concealed,’ Summers said. ‘By withholding Joannides material, the agency continues to encourage the public to believe they're covering up something more sinister.’ President John F.

A series of gloomy mini dramas aired during Downton Abbey to promote the show’s sponsor not only enraged viewers but also broke industry rules. The ten second credits for insurance giant Aviva ran at the beginning and end of commercial breaks. Early slots traced the true story of Gary, who suffered a motorbike accident. Viewers complained they were depressing and ruined the programme. Breached rules: In this link for the Aviva mini-drama featuring crash victim Gary, he says: 'It's my insurance policy. I think I am still covered if I do that course.' Ofcom said the line promoted the sponsor's income protection policy . Code broken: The mini-series goes on to tell the story of Gary, who was unable to return to work after being involving in a crash with a motorbike . Now industry regulator OFCOM has ruled that some scenes contained an ‘advertising message’ which is not allowed in sponsorship promotions. ‘Credits must not encourage the purchase or rental of the products or services of the sponsor or a third party,’ a spokesman explained. ‘The focus of the credit must be the sponsorship itself.’ The latest controversy comes on top of concerns that the series, starring Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, was swamped by ad breaks, with up to one minute of promotions for every three of Downton Abbey. Broadcasters are restricted to 12 minutes of advertising per hour and credits are not counted towards the total. The credits, which sparked viewers' complaints because of their regularity, featured his recovery, his . inability to return to work and his decision to retrain for a new . career. In . one of the links, Gary was seen to be reading an insurance document and . tells his partner: 'It's my insurance policy. I think I am still covered . if I do that course.' Ofcom judged that that line promoted a benefit of the sponsor's income protection policy. Rapped: Downton Abbey has been criticised for the amount of advertising it shows and today Ofcom ruled that the mini-drama made by Aviva strayed too close to advertising . Aviva amended subsequent sponsorship credits, which featured a character called Jane, removing the phrase 'It's my insurance policy'. But Ofcom said that they were still in breach of the broadcasting code because 'it was still clear that the character was referring to an insurance policy that covered him even if he undertook a training course'. Ofcom said: 'We concluded that the sponsorship credit contained an advertising message and therefore was in breach of the rule.' The mini-drama was shown in September and October during six episodes of Downton. From the trenches: Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley in the most recent series of Downton shown this autumn . Despite drawing record-breaking audiences, it is the latest setback to hit the ITV drama which has been criticised for having too much advertising. In other complaints: . In their ruling, Ofcom said sponsorship could not contain advertising messages. Ofcom said in its ruling: 'To prevent . credits effectively becoming advertisements and therefore increasing the . amount of advertising transmitted, broadcasters are required to ensure . that sponsorship credits do not contain advertising messages.' Record ratings: Downton Abbey with Samantha Bond as Lady Rosamund Painswick . Channel TV, responding for ITV, said the reference to the benefit was 'a brief product description' rather than an advertising message 'about a distinct benefit of Aviva's cover.' The mini drama has previously been heavily criticised by viewers who regarded the clips as adverts.

Murder charge: Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez confers with his attorneys during a pretrial court hearing in Fall River, Massachusetts today . Hernandez's defense attorney Michael Fee is a partner at law firm Ropes and Gray - as is the Assistant DA Patrick Bomber's wife. Fee told the court that his association with a prosecutor's wife will not affect his representation of Hernandez. The former football player, who wore a tie for the first time in court, agreed to keep Fee as his lawyer. At one point the judge allowed a request to have Hernandez's handcuffs removed. Prosecutors in the murder case also filed a motion on Wednesday to ask Judge Susan Garsh to recuse herself. The former football player wore a tie for the first time in court today following many appearances over the last few months. At one point, the judge agreed to remove his handcuffs (left) Prosecutor William McCauley and the district attorney say in a memo that McCauley and Garsh 'have a well-known and publicly documented history of antagonism'. Hernandez's lawyers say they'll object to a recusal. Garsh didn't hear arguments on the issue. The 23-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murder and five-related weapons charges. He is being held without bail. Four others, including Hernandez's girlfriend and cousin, face charges in the case. Claims: Aaron Hernandez, pictured more casually dressed during an earlier court appearance, opened fire on two men as they left a nightclub in July last year, a witness says . Lloyd, a semi-professional player, was found dead less than a mile from his home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts on June 17. Hernandez is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Danny Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub in Boston. A friend of the two victims, who has refused to be named, has told Fox25 last week that he saw the ex-Patriots player shoot the two men while shouting: 'What up negroes?' He said that the three friends, all immigrants from Cape Verde off the coast of Africa, had been partying at Cure nightclub in Boston's Theater District, and had not been in any fights.

Boston police commissioner Ed Davis told Fox25 that the case was still under investigation and expressed optimism that it would reach a conclusion soon. Officials believe that Hernandez may have killed Lloyd to stop him speaking out about last year's murders, according to reports.

It’s a horrible website and it should be closed down, it’s gone too far. 'We are all much closer now, even people who didn’t know Izzy are devastated. There was not one student or teacher who wasn’t in tears when they found out. 'She was such a lovely girl and whenever you saw her she had a smile and had lots of friends.'

One of the world's most primitive tribes is being humiliated on a daily basis - by tourists who pay to go on human safaris and treat them like animals in a zoo. Hundreds of visitors to the remote Andaman Islands, north of the Equator in the Indian Ocean, queue up each day at dawn to drive through a jungle reserve set aside for the Jarawa tribe. They then toss scraps of food to the half-naked natives, who only started making contact with the outside world in the late 1990s, and command them to dance. Scroll down for video . Exploitation: Hundreds of visitors to the remote Andaman Islands, north of the Equator in the Indian Ocean, queue up each day at dawn to drive through jungle set aside for the Jarawa tribe . Busy: The tours are technically illegal, and sold under the pretext of a trip to a local cave, but police turn a blind eye in exchange for bribes . The 403 tribe members should, in theory, be protected by strict laws on the Indian-run island. A sign at the gate to the 'enclosure' states: 'Don’t give any eatables to the Jarawas. 'Don’t indulge in photography, videography. Otherwise you will be liable for legal action ­including seizure of camera.' But tourists can pay touts £350 to take part in the convoy, with local police taking a £200 cut and turning a blind eye to the exploitation. Visitors are regularly seen throwing bananas and ­biscuits to tribe's people waiting at the side of the track. Similar scenes are seen across Britain as people feed animals in a zoo. Photojournalist Gethin Chamberlain uncovered the tour, which is not advertised but sold under the pretext of a visit to local caves, in the islands' capital Port Blair. He joined a tour run by Rajesh Vyas who said the tours were 'very popular' with the British. Rules: There are signs, on entry into the Jarawa reserve area, clearly saying that photography and giving food to the tribe members is banned - but these are routinely ignored . Vyas said: 'It will cost 15,000 rupees (£182) to buy off the police and about the same for a car, driver, gifts for the Jarawa, biscuits, snacks. It is guaranteed.' Police on the islands are told to arrest anyone caught taking pictures of tribe members. But officers have been seen ­pocketing a £200 bribe.

They now regularly visit local towns and settlements. Degrading: Tribe members will dance in exchange for food and money from tourists . Denis Giles, editor of the campaigning Andaman Chronicle newspaper, said the Jarawa were being 'abused'. He said: 'They know they need to mix in the outside world but it should not be a culture shock – they should choose the pace at which they do it. 'Instead, they’re being thrust into ever closer proximity to tourists and other islanders. They believe the police are protecting them but the reality is they are being used. 'Officers have taught them how to beg and they take money the Jarawa collect and give them tobacco in return, which they have never used before. 'There have even been cases of Jarawa women having kids fathered by outsiders – but the babies are not accepted by the tribe and are killed.' And Ajai Saxena, the government official responsible for the reserve, said: 'These tours do not respect the Jarawa. 'We have told the tour operators they must not stop but we cannot control every vehicle.'","Jarawa tribe first made contact with the outside world in the late 1990s .

A woman has apologized for sparking a major emergency operation on Wednesday, when she became trapped in an eight-inch slot between two walls in Portland, but has failed to explain what led her there in the first place. Anita Mann, 30, became stuck in the tiny space between the parking garage of the Gretchen Kafoury Commons apartment complex and the New Avenues for Youth building in downtown Portland at 3.45am on Wednesday. Firefighters worked for over three and a half hours to free her and had to cut an opening in . the concrete wall of the parking lot and use soapy water to assist in . squeezing her out. Scroll Down for Video . Wedged: Anita Mann was stuck for more than three and a half hours on Wednesday morning as emergency workers tirelessly fought to release her . Rescue mission: Portland firefighters used an air bag to spread walls to free the Oregon woman and used soap to slip her out of a hole in the wall . She was left with just a few scrapes and minor hypothermia. But one thing emergency services now want to know is - why was she there in the first place? The only way to get to the gap is . from the roof of the New Avenues building or from the top of a 20-foot wall . on the side of the parking garage. There was some speculation she was . smoking on the rooftop, when she fell into the space, but both she and her . husband have remained tight-lipped on what she was doing since the rescue took place. Police also investigated claims she was a graffiti artist but dropped their probe today. 'We looked into it and she is who she says she is,' an officer told the Oregonian. 'There were no paint cans lying around . and no graffiti on the building.' Mystery: No one knows what brought Anita Mann to the area and what led her to fall down the gap in downtown Portland only accessible via a rooftop . Sealed with a kiss: Anita and Brett Mann kissed passionately when she was released from the 8-inch space but neither have explained what brought her there . In a statement to the newspaper, she said she was sorry and grateful to have escaped. 'The events of the morning were awful . and ridiculously frightening. I am extremely thankful for the outcome . of the situation I found myself facing. I profusely apologize for the . disturbance and damage this has created,' she said. Her husband Brett Mann, who was . called from their home to help calm his wife during the rescue mission . told the newspaper she was 'embarrassed' but couldn't explain any . further. 'She's extremely embarrassed,' Mann, told the Oregonian on Thursday. Hospitalized: Mann was taken to hospital by ambulance on Wednesday but only had minor injuries . Uncomfortable: Firefighters cut a hole through concrete and used an air bag and a soapy lubricant to free Mann who escaped with minor scrapes . Early operation: Firefighters worked from 3.45am to free Mann who fell part of the way down the 20-foot wall and got stuck between the two buildings . 'She slid. She couldn't climb back up. She doesn't have the greatest recollection.' The Fire Bureau's Lt. Rich Chatman told the newspaper it was an unusual case. He said she was 'vague' about what happened, 'Nothing really seemed to make sense,' he told the local paper. Mann added she was a medic in Canada, where she grew up, so knew the pressures on rescuers. Home Forward, a government agency . that owns the garage, told the newspaper it will cost several thousand . dollars to repair the wall and they would seek to block up the gap so . nothing like this can happen again. They too are in the dark about what led Mann to be there in the first place. 'We are just all really wondering how it happened,' said Shelley Marchesi, a spokeswoman for the housing authority. On Wednesday, alarmed residents of the building called 911. Witness Kia King said she heard cries for help early in the morning and saw the woman trying to climb out of the small space. 'First, . she had the grip and she was holding on,' King said. 'Next thing you . know, she started panicking and she let go and fell down.' Vague: No one knows what exactly happened in Portland on Wednesday. Passerby Tim Weber checks the area where two holes were cut .

The government is changing the law to drive through NHS changes after losing a court battle to close services at a London hospital. The Court of Appeal ruled today that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt does not have the power to implement the cuts at the successful Lewisham Hospital in south east London. But Mr Hunt said ministers are ‘now looking at the law’ to ensure changes can be driven through in future ‘when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients’. Warning: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government would change the law to make it clear that NHS changes can be made . Supporters of the Lewisham hospital cheered when the judges at the Court of Appeal backed an earlier ruling that Mr Hunt's move to downgrade A&E and maternity services was ‘unlawful’. Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lord Justice Underhill, rejected an appeal brought by the Government. Campaigners said they were ‘absolutely delighted’ by the result. Rosa Curling, who represented the Save Lewisham Hospital Group, said: ‘It confirms what the Save Lewisham Hospital Campaign has been arguing from the start - that the Secretary of State did not have the legal power to close and downgrade services at Lewisham Hospital. ‘This expensive waste of time for the Government should serve as a wake up call that they cannot ride roughshod over the needs of the people.’ Mr Hunt's decision to close the services in Lewisham were quashed in July, when Mr Justice Silber declared that the government had breached provisions of the National Health Services Act 2006. The ruling was a serious blow for Mr Hunt because the case involved the first legal testing of a new Government procedure for dealing with failing NHS organisations - referred to as the Unsustainable Providers Regime. The Court of Appeal today upheld a ruling at the High Court in July . Under the new regime, Mr Hunt had appointed a Trust Special Administrator (TSA) to the ‘very badly performing’ South London Healthcare Trust, which went into administration after it started losing more than £1 million a week. To help deal with the problem, the special administrator recommended measures including cuts at Lewisham Hospital. Mr Hunt told Parliament in January that A&E and maternity services at the hospital would be downgraded. He assured MPs the changes would improve patient care in south London, saving up to 100 lives a year, but gave an undertaking not to implement them pending the legal challenge. Today Mr Hunt said: ‘I completely understand why the residents of Lewisham did not want any change in their A&E services, but my job as Health Secretary is to protect patients across south London - and doctors said these proposals would save lives. ‘We are now looking at the law to make sure that, at a time of great challenge, the NHS is able to change and innovate when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients.’ An amendment is being made to the Care Bill currently going through Parliament to avoid a repeat of the legal challenge. It will clarify that if changes need to be made at other hospitals they can be driven through, although it will not be retrospective so will not affect Lewisham directly. But Andy Burnham MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: ‘This decision is a humiliation for Jeremy Hunt and raises major questions about his judgment. ‘Instead of graciously accepting the first court ruling, he has squandered thousands of (pounds of) taxpayers' money trying to protect his own pride and defend the indefensible. He is diminished by this ruling and has let down the NHS. ‘The court has done an important public service today in standing up to an arrogant and high-handed Government and a Secretary of State who is trying to close A&Es across London in the middle of the worst A&E crisis in living memory.’ Delight: Campaigners welcomed the ruling which means that 'Lewisham is now safe and this case is now over' Vicky Penner, who has been involved in the campaign from the outset, was jubilant to be told by lawyers: ‘Lewisham is now safe and this case is now over.’ The mother of three young children, aged two, three and six, said: ‘We are absolutely over the moon. We are thrilled that justice has prevailed for a second time. ‘I was shocked that the Government was arrogant and foolish enough to carry on and try and bully through the closure of our excellent much-needed Lewisham Hospital. ‘The judgment made in July was very clear indeed - that they acted unlawfully - so this is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money by Jeremy Hunt.’ She said the Government had brought a last-minute amendment to the Care Bill giving trust special administrators (TSAs) much greater powers, which meant no hospital in the country would be safe and showed a ‘contempt for normal people and democracy’. ‘We are not against change in Lewisham but against the dangerous closure of vital services being rushed through without proper consultation.’","Cuts to services at south London hospital ruled unlawful by High Court .

Pay rise: New Network Rail boss Mark Carne (left) will earn 14 per cent or £80,000 more than his predecessor Sir David Higgins who is standing down next year . Furious unions said the enormous rise . was ‘an extraordinary decision’ and ‘an insult to passengers’ suffering . expensive, delayed and overcrowded services, urging Network Rail to get . off the ‘gravy train’. Mr Carne, 54, will take over the role . of chief executive on April 1 but joins Network Rail in January – just . as rail travellers face another round of inflation-busting fare hikes. The rail network operator has come . under constant criticism recently over train punctuality and received . repeated warnings from rail regulators about its poor performance, . particularly on long-distance routes. Justifying the bumper pay package, . Network Rail said: ‘Mr Carne’s base salary of £675,000 was determined . following an exhaustive and independent process which compared the . salaries of chief executives in both the public and private sectors . given Network Rail’s unique position as a not-for-dividend, independent . company.

Mr Cortes added that Mr Carne also . stood to earn large bonuses of up to 60 per cent a year on top of his . salary, plus a 100 per cent ‘long term incentive’ bonus over his first . three years. Mr Cortes said: ‘It is passengers who . should be rewarded with lower fares, not directors for joining a gravy . train paid for by every taxpayer.’ Mick Whelan, of train drivers’ union . Aslef, said: ‘The extraordinary decision to hire a new man, Mark Carne, . to do the same job as Sir David, but to pay him a whopping £80,000 more . exposes the extraordinary lack of governance and lack of proper public . scrutiny in Network Rail.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is now quite  clear that high pay does not buy  high performance.’ Mr Carne, a father of three, was . formerly executive vice president for the Middle East and North Africa . for Royal Dutch Shell.

Songwriter: Perhaps understandably, Joe Sherman, who's best known for co-writing Nat King Cole's 1962 hit 'Ramblin' Rose,' pictured, doesn't want anything to do with Richard Winkler, who was convicted of killing the man he believed was his father in 1980 . A convicted killer who spent 27 years in prison for slaying a man he thought was his father only to learn two years ago he was not is now trying to force his real 'dad' - a Grammy-nominated Manhattan composer - to take a paternity test. Richard Winkler, 51, shot dead Irving Winkler as he slept in 1980 and served nearly three decades behind bars before his mother revealed a bombshell: Winkler wasn't actually his father, 87-year-old songwriter Joe Sherman was. But, perhaps understandably, Sherman, who's best known for co-writing Nat King Cole's 1962 hit 'Ramblin' Rose,' didn't want anything to do with the father-killer. Now, Winkler is trying to force Sherman to take a paternity test, after he repeatedly refused to acknowledge him as his son. According to papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Winkler says his mom, Lanie Sattler, told him for 'the very first time' in 2011 that Winkler was 'not his biological father' but Joe Sherman was. Sattler revealed she'd gone on two dates with the songwriter and conceived Winkler on the second, allegedly at the home Sherman still lives in. When her son was three she said she'd contacted Sherman to tell him he had a son but she said he ignored her. Sattler told her son the two men looked 'strikingly similar' so she was sure Sherman was his dad. Winkler said he was 'dumbfounded.' By that time he had been out of prison four years and was working as a para-legal for Skadden Arps, having earned his GED, a bachelor's degree and a master's degree behind bars. 'After much soul searching, some anger, and lots of discussion, (Winkler) decided he wanted to meet Joe Sherman,' the suit says, according to the New York Daily News. So Winkler and his mother wrote him a letter in November 2011 but got no response. Winkler then sent a follow-up, and Sherman replied simply: 'I decline to take any DNA tests. Very truly yours, Joe Sherman.' They tried unsuccessfully to call the now-elderly musician but Winkler did get his supposed father on the intercom when he showed up at his apartment this spring. Contact: Winkler has repeatedly tried to contact Sherman on the phone and at his Riverside Drive, Manhattan apartment, pictured, to no avail . Sherman responded 'in a scared, shriek-like voice, ""I really don’t know how to handle this,""' and then hung up when Winkler suggested they meet face-to-face. Winkler, however, was not deterred and tried several more times to contact him before receiving a letter back in May, saying, 'I really feel that there is no purpose to be served in our speaking.' Winkler says in the petition, which he wrote himself, that Sherman 'has done everything in his power to flaunt the law and ignore plaintiff, and his mother, even to this day.' He said he wants the 'DNA test for a myriad of reasons, but one of the key reasons is to identify whether he is predisposed to any genetic illnesses or diseases,' in addition to 'his fundamental right to know his background and heritage, and where it derives from.' Sherman refused to comment to the New York Daily News on Monday, saying simply: 'I really don't know anything and I have no comment about it.' Winkler acknowledges his father troubles in his petition. 'On October 24, 1980, plaintiff was arrested and accused of the murder of his father,' the papers state.

No claims: An Australian civil servant has lost her appeal case for damages after she was injured by a light fitting (not pictured) while having sex in a motel room on a work trip . An Australian civil servant has been denied government compensation after she was injured by a falling light fitting when having sex in a motel room while on a work trip. The woman in her 30s, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was initially approved for compensation by federal government insurer Comcare. But after further investigation the claim was rejected. The High Court yesterday agreed. In a majority 4-2 decision, it ruled that the woman's employer did not induce or encourage her to participate in the sex, so Comcare was not liable to compensate her. The High Court's ruling is final and . could have ramifications for other federal employees who claim . compensation for unconventional work-related mishaps. The worker needed hospital treatment after the incident which took place in 2007. She and a man were having sex in her . motel room when a glass light fixture above the bed fell onto her face, . injuring her nose and mouth. She later suffered depression and was . unable to continue working for the government. Comcare initially approved her claim for . workers' compensation, but then rejected it. An . administrative tribunal agreed that her injuries were not suffered in . the course of her employment, saying the government had not induced or . encouraged the woman's sexual conduct. The tribunal also found the sex . was 'not an ordinary incident of an overnight stay,' such as showering, . sleeping or eating. Federal Court Judge John Nicholas overturned that last year, rejecting the tribunal's findings that the sex had to be condoned by the government if she were to qualify for compensation. 'If the applicant had been injured while . playing a game of cards in her motel room, she would be entitled to . compensation even though it could not be said that her employer induced . her to engage in such activity,' Nicholas wrote then. Comcare lost its appeal to the Full Bench last December, with the three judges finding that the government's views on the woman having sex were irrelevant. But the High Court ruled that Comcare was not liable to pay compensation. The judges did not say how much compensation had already been paid. Comcare declined to comment on the amount, but said it was considering recovering it. 'The relevant question is: Did the employer induce or encourage the employee to engage in that activity?' a summary of the court ruling said. A majority of judges — Justices Robert French, Kenneth Hayne, Susan Crennan and Susan Kiefel — answered 'No'. Justices Virginia Bell and Stephen Gageler dissented. The High Court's ruling, in Canberra, pictured, is final and could have ramifications for other federal employees who claim compensation for unconventional work-related mishaps . The crucial facts were that the overnight stay was within the two-day period of the work trip and her employer had encouraged the woman to stay in the motel in Nowra, 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of her hometown of Sydney, Gageler said. 'In the absence of any suggestion that she was engaged at the time of injury in misconduct, those facts were sufficient to conclude that the injury the respondent sustained during that interval, and when at that place, was sustained in the course of her employment,' Gageler said. Employment Minister Eric Abetz hailed the ruling as a victory for common sense. 'Instances such as this, where an employee seeks to stretch the boundaries of entitlements, are of great concern and the High Court's intervention is welcome,' Abetz said. Comcare declined to say what effect the ruling would have on other compensation claims. The government insurer also declined to say whether other claims in comparable circumstances were pending. Australian National University law lecturer Cameron Roles said the ruling reduced the range of after-hours activities covered by workers' compensation when an employee was away from home on business. 'I don't think you can say that this decision means that all activity in hotel rooms won't be covered, but it certainly narrows that range of what activity will be covered,' Roles said. 'In terms of the precise activities, it's quite difficult to say because everything turns on the facts' of an individual case, he said.","The woman was hospitalised when a light fitting fell on her face during sex .

Mrs Graff, whose husband Raymond is a director of Graff Diamonds, confronted dry cleaner Ian Cohen. Complained: Katie Graff, 71, bought the outfit (pictured) to wear at Royal Ascot when she went with her husband Raymond in June 2012. But when she took it to the dry cleaners to be cleaned it came back dark grey . She . accused him of leaving her outfit looking like a ‘dishcloth’ with dark . patches along the lapels and the satin tie of the jacket, a court heard. Mr Cohen made attempts to clean the suit again but Mrs Graff, 68, said the results left it ‘slate grey’.She . demanded the full cost of the suit. Mr Cohen eventually offered her . £400, even though he claimed that experts who examined the garment said . the ‘slight dark grime’ had not been caused by cleaning but possibly by . humidity while being stored. Mrs Graff sued and this week a judge found Mr Cohen liable. He awarded Mrs Graff £600 compensation and £140 costs. Mrs . Graff, whose husband runs the production side of the business founded . by his brother Laurence, bought the Emporio Armani design to wear at . Royal Ascot in June 2012.

I . was so concerned and incensed that they had not said to me, “We’re . really sorry, there’s been an accident on the suit”. ‘It looked like . a dishcloth in my kitchen, all the life had gone out of it.

Illegal immigrants use £3.7billion worth of taxpayer-funded health and education services every year, figures out yesterday suggest. Each one taking advantage of Britain’s free NHS and schools costs the Treasury £4,250 per year, a Home Office report reveals. The figures underline the true cost of illegal immigration to taxpayers and emerged as ministers admitted their controversial ‘go home’ vans led to just 11 illegals volunteering to leave the country. Essential, but costly, services: Each illegal immigrant taking advantage of Britain¿s free NHS and schools costs the Treasury £4,250 per year, a Home Office report published yesterday reveals. (Stock picture) The UK’s huge bill for funding education and health for illegal immigrants was condemned by campaigners last night and prompted calls for further action to deal with the scale of illegal immigration. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think tank said: ‘This is a stunning figure which previous governments have covered up for far too long. ‘It amounts to six times the cost to the taxpayer of the entire immigration system. So the case for a firm crackdown on illegals is absolutely undeniable.’ Latest figures suggest the illegal population living in the UK may be as high as 863,000. When combined with the per person cost of around £4,000 estimated by the Home Office, the statistics suggest an annual public services cost of £3.67billion – nearly half the annual police budget for England and Wales. The controversial advertising vans were used over several days this summer in London boroughs where high numbers of illegal immigrants are thought to live. They carried the slogan ‘go home or face arrest’ and gave a hotline telephone number to call. Home Secretary Theresa May has already said the vans were ‘too much of a blunt instrument’ and their use will not be extended across the country. Only 11 illegals contacted the Home Office as a result of seeing the vans and have been removed. Controversial: Adverts urging illegal immigrants to go home were driven around London on vans, but they have only resulted in a total of 11 migrants leaving the country, according to the Home Office's own figures . However, the measure was just part of a wider campaign costing nearly £10,000, featuring adverts in foreign language newspapers and postcards left in shop windows. Overall, it helped lead to another 60 voluntary departures and another 65 are waiting in the system. Ministers claim the 60 who have left so far have saved taxpayers nearly £900,000, as voluntary departure costs as little as £1,000 – compared to the £15,000 cost of ejecting an illegal immigrant. Although confined to London, the pilot scheme also resulted in applications to leave from as far away as Blackburn and Great Yarmouth. The first person to leave as a result of the campaign was a Pakistani student who saw coverage of the vans in the Guardian newspaper. The report showed two thirds of the text messages sent to the hotline were hoaxes, and required 17 hours of staff time to deal with. Campsite: Roma gipsies in London's Park Lane in July. A new report suggests there are now 200,000 Roma migrants living in the UK . Britain has one of the largest Roma populations in Western Europe with around 200,000 living here, an authoritative report shows. Migrants have doubled the size of Britain’s gipsy and traveller population, researchers said yesterday. It contradicts Government claims that ‘relatively few Roma citizens’ had set up up home in this country. The study’s ‘conservative’ and ‘increasing’ figure is four times the 49,000 number estimated four years ago in a report for the Department for Children, Schools and Families. It comes amid concerns at the prospect of a new wave of migration when restrictions on workers from Romania and Bulgaria are relaxed in January. Areas where most Roma people have settled include Yorkshire, the North West and the Midlands, the study by Salford University of data from more than 150 councils found. It said the term Roma applied to ‘a wide diversity’ of groups in eastern Europe, including gipsies. Large-scale Roma migration, the  researchers said, may have begun with the boom in numbers of people seeking asylum in the late 1990s. Commenting on the report, immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The Government will continue to enforce the immigration rules and promote voluntary departure schemes to those who have no right to be in the UK – backed up with arrest, detention and enforced removal where individuals refuse to comply with the immigration rules or present a danger to the UK public.’ The £4,250 figure relates to migrants who have been in Britain for less than five years, and was drawn up as part of efforts to quantify how removing them benefits public spending. The report adds: ‘Each person living illegally in the UK is estimated to cost up to a further £4,250 per year in costs to public services.’ The estimate is far from a complete analysis of immigrants to the UK, and does not include other costs or what indirect taxes they may pay such as VAT. The total number of illegal immigrants in the country was estimated by a London School of Economic research paper. It put the total number of irregular – or illegal – migrants at 618,000, but said it could be as high as 863,000 or as low as 417,000. Under Labour, ministers proved hugely reluctant to put an estimate on the number of Britain’s illegal migrants. In 2005, the Home Office said the figure could be as high as 570,000. The total includes migrants who sneaked into the country illegally, or over-stayed their visas. The Government’s Immigration Bill, currently passing through  Parliament, is aimed at making it harder for migrants to use public services to which they are not entitled. It includes compulsory new rules for landlords – and fines for those who allow illegals to rent. It also contains new checks on anyone applying for a driving licence and bank account.","Each illegal immigrant costs Treasury £4,250 in services, says Home Office .

Christopher Philips made the offensive gesture to photographers outside Wolverhampton Crown Court last week. The 23-year-old, formerly known as Darren Clifft, was told at a hearing today he could face prison for trying to 'stir up racial hatred'. Offensive: Christopher Philips, 23, who was formerly known as Darren Clifft, gave the salute as he left Wolverhampton Crown Court last week . He was arrested by Counter-Terrorism police in March after . posting the footage of a mock-execution onto the internet. Philips pleaded guilty to distributing and recording visual images, which were shot at an extreme right-wing concert held in West Wales. But he denied wearing the Ku Klux Klan outfit, which the prosecution accepted, and the charge of using threatening or insulting behaviour intended to stir up racial hatred was ordered to lie on file. The court heard his father had committed suicide shortly after Philips was arrested and interviewed about the racist crime. Adjourning sentence until December, so a psychiatric report can be carried out, Judge John Warner told Philips: 'The fact that I’ve allowed your bail to continue is not in any way at all tying my hands.

Judge Warner said the mock-execution videos had caused 'strong feelings'. He . added: 'It’s the sort of material that will attract very strong . feelings in certain sections of the community and I think there is a . real risk here of violence and retribution.' Defending Philips, Mohammed Ramzan said: 'His father committed suicide, one of the reasons was this case.' The court heard Philips, who had a 'huge online presence' and called himself ‘Clansman of the West Midlands infidels’ on Twitter, had received death threats from anti-racist groups. Mr Ramzan said: 'His life was threatened. People did attend the gym where he coaches kick-boxing, fortunately for him he was ill that day so not there. 'It was a gathering of quite a few people with weapons. His mother is very anxious for the address not to be revealed because she fears for her safety.' As well as being bailed to live and sleep at his mother's address in Wolverhampton, Philips was given an electronic tag and told to keep to a 9pm-7am curfew. He was also ordered not to access any social media websites. Philips, who wore a grey suit with a white shirt and striped tie, left court quietly with several members of his family and friends after yesterday’s 45-minute hearing.","Christopher Philips, 23, posted clips onto YouTube 'stir up racial hatred'

To mark Halloween and the 50th birthday of the BBC show, an adorable two-year-old girl dressed up as all 11 of the Doctors, from the original, played by William Hartnell, to 2013’s Matt Smith. Katie Kent, from Dallas, Texas, modelled the costumes after her father, Todd, had spent months scouring the internet for them. He posted the pictures on his Comic Book Literacy blog in a gallery called ‘Happy Wholloween’, alongside pictures of the Doctors that the costumes mimic. He told MailOnline that the photos took several months to put together. He said: ‘Most clothing items were bought surprisingly cheaply on eBay. Each item was only around a dollar or two. I started looking for costume items around February of this year so it took several months to compile everything.' 'We also took the pictures over the course of several months. Whenever it was time for Katie to go outside and play we would dress her up in an outfit and head out. I would just follow her around with the camera and take about 30 to 40 pictures per outfit with the hopes of getting two good pics that would work for the blog.' Katie dressed as William Hartnell, who played . the Doctor in the first series, which aired in 1963. He bowed out three . years later . Patrick Troughton . became the second doctor in November 1966 in the 'regeneration' process. He described his Doctor as a ‘Cosmic Hobo’, who would play a recorder when stressed . Mr Kent explained that Katie liked wearing all the costumes, but the ones with big coats in particular. He said: 'She likes to play dress up so she seemed to like most of them, especially the ones with long coats. I think both our favourite may be the sixth Doctor's outfit. She liked the colours and I love how the outfit came together. It was the most challenging to make. My wife is a talented seamstress and she made the coat herself.' The show has been a hit with Mr Kent for a long time. He added: 'I've been watching Doctor Who since I was a child. Shortly after Katie's birth we started a complete re-watch of the entire series from the very first Hartnell episode. We usually watch one serial per weekend together but so far have only made it up to the fourth Doctor. Katie likes the theme song and claps along to it when we watch.' Peter Capaldi has been revealed as the twelfth incarnation of Doctor Who. The 55-year-old actor, best known for playing Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It, was announced as the new Time Lord in a live BBC TV special in August. The Scot's appointment came two months after Matt Smith, 30, announced he was quitting following four years as the time-traveller. Matt, who joined the show in 2010, will appear in his last scenes in the Christmas Special, with the Peter appearing in 2014, joining current assistant Jenna Coleman, who plays Clara. Jon Pertwee's Doctor, who hit screens in 1970, was a little more action-packed than his predecessors and was predisposed towards slightly frilly shirts . In 1974 Tom Baker arrived as the Time Lord, with his trademark long scarf and trilby. He was perhaps one of the most popular Doctors . Peter Davison stepped up to the Doctor Who plate in 1981. He was known for his role in All Creatures Great and Small and outfit-wise went for a cricketing look . Another Baker played the Doctor in 1984, this time with the first name of Colin. He wore colourful outfits and had a larger-than-life personality . Sylvester McCoy took the Tardis helm in 1987 and in 1989 viewers watched what was apparently the final episode in the series' 26-year-run, with McCoy and his assistant walking off into the distance... but the show would return .

Charles Saatchi has decided not to sue former wife Nigella Lawson as he wants to 'get on with his life', it has emerged. Sources close to Saatchi, 70, had suggested he was willing take his ex-wife to court in order to reveal the ‘truth’ about their break-up following the release of a series of photographs showing him with his hands on her neck. But the art tycoon, who is dating fashion expert and journalist Trinny Woodall who he's been spotted with several times in recent months, now appears to have changed his mind about legal action. Charles Saatchi has reportedly dropped his threat to sue ex-wife Nigella Lawson for £500,000 . The threat to take legal action against the celebrity chef came despite the fact Saatchi had made a formal admission of assault. But he became furious after being publicly reviled for the incident and threatened to sue Miss Lawson, 53, for £500,000 and reveal the 'truth' about their relationship. He is said to have been ‘disappointed’ when the ‘Domestic Goddess’ would not state publicly that he did not physically abuse her - and this is when he instructed his lawyers. But the proposed legal action has now been dropped with friends telling the Telegraph that he ‘wants to get on with his life’. On the photographs, one friend told the paper that there is ‘far more to it than meets the eye’. The images were taken outside restaurant Scott’s in June - the same exclusive spot where Saatchi has since been spotted alongside Ms Woodall, 49. Charles Saatchi, pictured here with Trinny Woodall at Scott's, is threatening to sue his ex-wife Nigella Lawson for £500,000 in an explosive case where he wants to reveal 'the truth' about their break-up . Full details of Saatchi’s allegations about Miss Lawson following the divorce could not be made public for legal reasons - but were strongly denied by her spokesman and lawyers. The threat to sue meant they could have been revealed at the High Court in London. His lawyers sent a legal letter to Miss Lawson’s solicitors warning that he was poised to sue her for around half a million pounds in a bid to clear his name. The letter warned that if she refused to settle the matter voluntarily, legal action in court would ensue. Saatchi, who was Miss Lawson’s second husband, attempted to dismiss the photographs that ended his ten-year marriage as a ‘playful tiff’ initially.

He then said ‘my actions were not . violent’ and that he was ‘disappointed’ Miss Lawson had not publicly . said he had ‘never abused her physically in any way’.

She said the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’. The couple had married in 2003 following . the death of Miss Lawson’s first husband, broadcaster and journalist .

A disqualified driver who had already been banned FIVE times when he crashed on the motorway was spared jail - so he could tie the knot. James Horan, 28, was sent to prison for four months by district judge Jonathan Taff after the crash in September. However his lawyer appealed and just 24 hours after a sobbing Horan pleaded to be . let out, a crown court judge went against the original sentence and his immediate jail term was postponed for two weeks so he . could marry Tina McGrail, 28. Offender James Horan wept in court as he described his wish to get married . Road safety campaigners have slammed the decision. MP Rehman Chishti, who has campaigned for tougher penalties for repeat offenders, said ‘This case is another example of why we need tougher sentences for persistent offenders and for those who drive whilst disqualified. 'It is astonishing that the culprit has been spared jail to be allowed to get married, when people’s lives and safety should be paramount.’ Neil Greig of the Institute of Advanced Motorists said judges were not in tune with public opinion. ‘These sorts of stories undermine the justice system and judges aren’t reflecting the seriousness of what has happened,’ he said. But speaking after his wedding last Saturday, father-of-three Horan, of East Dene, who owns a tattoo parlour, tried to blame Judge Taff for being too ‘tough’. ‘It was as if he got some pleasure in beating me down and in that moment my life was torn apart. I owe my lawyer a lot and I’m so happy that we were able to get married. ‘We’d gone to court expecting a community sentence. When the judge said it was four months my legs went. I could only think about Tina, my kids and our wedding day. ‘I knew I had done wrong and I didn’t want to get away with it but I never expected him to give me that sentence. It was the toughest he could have been. 'It didn’t feel right, I’ve worked hard to put my life back on track and I hadn’t driven for six years until that day in September. Everyone at the wedding knew what had happened and I know I have let a lot of people down,' he said. His wife Tina added ‘I couldn’t believe it when I realised the wedding wasn’t going to take place. But the Crown Court judge was really kind and it meant we could get married. ‘Everything went really well and we had a lovely day with our children, our family and friends.’ Horan pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and without insurance following the crash on the slip road of the M18, near Rotherham on September 15. He is expected back in court next Friday. Defending him, Ms Hester Russell said Horan had missed a period of work due to post traumatic stress disorder since he was the victim of a serious assault last December. She said: ‘On that particular day he awoke after an extremely unpleasant night’s sleep and realised he had missed his train. ‘Realising that he’d already upset his employer he decided, utterly foolishly, to take his partner’s car.’","James Horan, 28, was disqualified and uninsured at the time of the crash .

Nestled among the emerald hills of the Derbyshire Peak District, the Old Post Office sits in an idyllic spot at the centre of a postcard-perfect village. Parwich, near Ashbourne, is inside the Peak District National Park, favourite destination of hikers and mountain-bikers. Its village green, babbling brook, cosy pub and stone cottages make it a place people tend not to want to leave. In fact, the Old Post Office had been in the same hands for nearly  90 years when the current owners bought it in 2005. It was run by the Graham family from 1918 until 1984, when the last Miss Graham retired from the role of postmistress. The old post office at Parwich, Derbyshire, home of Simon and Tracy-Ann Ingham and their 4 children . The counter used to be in the room now transformed into a farmhouse-style kitchen/diner, complete with cream Aga, tiled floor and a bowl of eggs laid by the children's chickens. 'My husband used to come in here as a child to buy stamps,' says owner Tracy-Ann Ingham. The 17th Century, Grade II listed house has many untouched period features, including a complete cast-iron range in the sitting room with its ovens still intact. This is where Tracy-Ann warms her mince pies and mulled wine at Christmas, and dries the kindling for the open fire. On the other side of the hallway is a second, smaller sitting room with a log-burner, which the family use as a snug but could become a dining room, playroom or spacious study. The ground floor is completed by a large utility room with tiled flooring and a butler's sink, along with a cloakroom and separate boot room. Upstairs, the bedrooms are as charming and distinctive  as the rooms below. Old wooden doors lead into four bedrooms with original fireplaces and window recesses deep enough to sit in. There's also a bathroom and a shower room on this floor, while the pitched and beamed attic has been turned into a fifth bedroom with an en suite bathroom, currently given over to the Inghams' nanny. The whole house has been beautifully refurbished and tastefully decorated, mostly in light colours that allow the beams, sash windows and other architectural quirks to speak for themselves. 'We bought the Post Office from one of the postmistress's nephews,' says Tracy-Ann. 'We put in a new kitchen, including the Aga, and floor tiles from Hopton Wood, a local quarry. We completely did up the attic, which was previously used for storage, and put in new bathrooms.' The sitting room with cast iron range . The Old Post Office also generates an income, no longer from sending off parcels but from the holiday cottage that Tracy-Ann, 40, and husband Simon, 41, created a few years ago out of an old stone stable behind the main house. Winning a four-star Gold Award from the Tourist Board, it's as characterful as the house, with a brick horse trough and an owl hole above the door, originally to let owls (good mouse-hunters) in and out.The pretty cottage has a double bedroom and bathroom on the ground floor, with a sitting room  and kitchen on the first. It also  has its own sun-trap patio and is often booked by couples as a romantic getaway (The Stable, sykes cottages.co.uk). 'We let it all through the year; people come for long weekends even in the low season,' says Tracy-Ann. The Inghams have also converted a former pigsty in the garden into an office, though it has been unused since former Army captain Simon took over the family business, Bennetts department store, which has outlets in Ashbourne and Derby. With a mini-kitchen and log-burner, it must be one of the cosiest pigsties in Derbyshire. The spacious kitchen . The garden is unusually large for a village house and slopes gently upwards from the stone steps that connect it to the flagstone courtyard. Tracy-Ann says that when they first bought the house, you could hardly get through to the garden for all the brambles, but it is now a haven for the games of the Inghams' four children: Annabelle, seven, who keeps the chickens; Thomas, five; and two-year-old twins Charlotte and Alice. There's a hammock slung between two trees, an outdoor pizza oven built by Simon, stone seats in the walls and plenty of trees to climb, some of which are laden with apples, pears and damsons. At the top of the one-and-a-half-acre garden is a section that was once a paddock and could easily be one again, with another stable in its far corner. Surrounded by trees, the garden is secluded and faces south, catching the sun all day. 'In the summer we get sunshine at the top of the garden until 8pm,' says Tracy-Ann, standing at a point in the garden that has a lovely view down towards the house. 'I will miss this spot. You feel that you are  both in the village and outside it because it's so private.' After eight years, the Inghams have found another house, with larger rooms than the Old Post Office, that they would like to live in, and have put their home on the market for £850,000. They have no intention, however, of going very far, as the new house is in the same village. Like other residents, such as the Graham family who lived at the  Old Post Office for the best part of  a century, they have no plans to leave Parwich. lbagshawsresidential.co.uk, 01335 346677 .","Inghams bought 17th Century, Grade II listed house, in 2005 .

Attack: Police are hunting for this teenager who is suspected of trying to break into the hospice and steal memorabilia donated by Gary Barlow . A thief attacked a hospice for babies in an attempt to steal memorabilia donated by Gary Barlow after the Take That star tweeted about his visit, owners believe. The singer dropped into the hospice a fortnight ago with a BBC camera crew to film scenes for this year’s Children In Need appeal. He donated dozens of signed pictures, records and books for the charity to auction to raise enough funds to open 24 hours a day. Moments after leaving Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice in Coventry, the 43-year-old X Factor judge sent a tweet about the visit to his three million followers. He said: 'Been to ""Zoe’s place baby hospice"" today and met some inspirational little people!' But on Sunday, a thief was seen on CCTV smashing a glass pane at the entrance of the centre with a large garden ornament at 6.30pm - the first attempted break in at the charity. Although the raider, believed to be aged between 17 and 19, left empty-handed, owners believe the high-profile coverage of Mr Barlow's visit may have led to the 'abhorrent' attack. Fundraising manager Mick McCann said: 'It’s extremely difficult to understand how anyone could stoop so low as to break into a children’s hospice. 'We were told to keep the visit a secret but Gary was so touched by the people he met he tweeted about it after he left. 'As a result, local radio and media contacted us and we told them how he had donated items which we could auction which would be worth a lot of money. 'This is the first time someone has tried to break in. 'Whoever it was needs to be caught.' Tweet: He told his three million followers about the visit with a Children in Need camera crew . Devastated: Receptionist Deb Lacey holds the broken ornament the thief used to smash the entrance . Happier: Staff were delighted two weeks ago when the X Factor judge chose to do a TV appeal for them . The break-in has cost the charity hundreds of pounds in damage to the glass entrance. And the bronze statue the teenager used to smash his way inside was broken beyond repair. No staff, children or parents were inside . the building at the time and the memorabilia has now been moved off the . premises to prevent another possible break-in. Warwickshire Police today branded the raider 'heartless'. A . force spokeswoman said: 'Any burglary is upsetting, but it is . particularly heartless for someone to try to break in to a children’s . hospice. 'We would like to identify the person in . the CCTV as they may have information that can help us with our . investigation and appeal to anyone who know who this person is to get in . touch.' Famous: X Factor judge Gary Barlow tweeted: 'Been to ""Zoe’s place baby hospice"" today and met some inspirational little people!' and a few days later the hospice was targeted . First attack: There has never been an attempted break-in at the hospice which offers unique respite for infants . 'Heartless': Warwickshire Police branded the abhorrent attack 'heartless' in their appeal to find him . Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice runs respite, palliative and end of life care to families and their children from newborn babies up to five-year-olds who have life-limiting or life-threatening conditions.

There are three centres across the UK - in Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Coventry - which can each accommodate six children and their families at any one time.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there was a 'lot more work to do' to speed up the deportation process . Foreign criminals will be able to stay in Britain unless human rights laws are changed, Chris Grayling has warned. The Justice Secretary said attempts to return prisoners to their home countries ‘very often’ come up against the Human Rights Act. He said efforts were being made to strike     prisoner transfer agreements with other countries but it ‘isn’t easy’. Ministers have been ordered to step up efforts to end the scandal of more than one in eight prisoners being from overseas. David Cameron vowed to end the practice of the British taxpayer picking up the bill for criminals with no business in the UK. The Prime Minister said in 2010 that he would ’personally intervene’ to send more foreign criminals home. But to date little progress has been made, and senior Conservatives have repeatedly blamed the Human Rights Act for allowing criminals to challenge their removal from Britain. The Government has set out a series of measures to make it harder to challenge deportation proceedings, but Mr Grayling said there was a ‘lot more work to do’. He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘If anybody said to me I think we need to deport more foreign prisoners and foreign offenders, I would agree wholeheartedly. ‘Very often attempts to deport (foreign prisoners) run into problems with the Human Rights Act, which is another reason why human rights laws need to change. ‘But there's a lot more work to do. We're working hard on prisoner transfer agreements with other countries, we're working hard to speed up the process. I'd love to say it was easy (but) it isn't. ‘We will do everything we can to improve the situation.’ Home Secretary Theresa May announced at the Tory party conference that foreign criminals will be deported from Britain before their appeals against leaving the country are heard . Under the Government's Immigration Bill, the number of grounds on which migrants can lodge an appeal against deportation are to be slashed from the current 17 to just four in a move drawn up in response to the 12 years it took to deport radical cleric Abu Qatada. It will also aim to curb the number of migrants who block deportation using Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a private or family life. At the Tory party conference Home Secretary Theresa May announced that foreign criminals will be deported from Britain before their appeals against leaving the country are heard. Mrs May said she was sending a ‘very clear message’ to judges who ‘choose to ignore Parliament and go on putting the law on the side of foreign criminals instead of the public’. Ministers are close to striking a deal to send hundreds of Nigerian criminals home to serve out prison sentences. Talks are continuing into reaching a compulsory prisoner transfer agreement, which could see more than half of the 500 criminals from Nigeria currently in UK jails repatriated.","Chris Grayling complains that human rights laws need to change .

Police are being called out thousands of times a year to deal with dementia patients, including incidents where care home or hospital staff had become unable to cope (file picture) Police are being called out thousands of times a year to deal with dementia patients, an investigation has found. One chief constable said his officers had become an ‘extension of social services’ as a result of the crisis in dementia care. Most incidents involved patients who had gone missing but call-outs also included incidents where care home or hospital staff had become unable to cope. Sussex Police attended 1,800 incidents last year concerning vulnerable patients in hospitals and care homes or when they went missing. Of these, 71 involved violence. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, described his force as becoming an ‘outpost of the NHS’ and an ‘extension of social services’. He added that because dementia sufferers are vulnerable patients, his officers are duty-bound to prioritise their cases and stay with them for ‘hours’ in hospitals. ‘We have seen a number of incidents where we feel our officers are called inappropriately to care homes and the wards of hospitals to try and restrain patients,’ he said. ‘We have made it really clear that should only happen in the most extreme of circumstances.’ Sir Peter suggested introducing a national database of carers and the families of elderly vulnerable people so that officers could phone a carer in an emergency. The extent of police involvement with dementia patients was revealed in a Freedom of Information request by BBC Radio 5 Live, to which only 14 of the country’s 46 forces responded. Sir Peter also spoke on the use of handcuffs for dementia patients, saying it was ‘a difficult judgment’ for officers. ‘Sometimes people suffering with dementia can be violent and can be in danger of harming others and also injuring themselves,’ he said. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, described his force as becoming an 'outpost of the NHS' and an 'extension of social services' ‘It might be something that has to be done as a very, very short-term measure before medical intervention.’ Recent figures have shown that the number of dementia patients being sedated, tied to chairs or locked in bedrooms by staff in hospitals and care homes has doubled in the past three years. Some 2,979 restraint orders were granted for such patients last year, up from 1,459 in 2009/10. The measures are officially referred to as Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards and are sometimes necessary to prevent confused patients wandering off or harming themselves. But as they breach patients’ human rights, staff must apply to either their NHS trust or care home before resorting to them. Sussex Police attended 1,800 incidents last year concerning vulnerable patients in hospitals and care homes or when they went missing (file picture) Figures from the Information Centre for Health and Social Care show that 6,355 applications were made by hospital staff and carers to restrain dementia patients in 2012/13, but just under half – 2,979 – were approved. But these do not include the number of times staff restrained patients without seeking permission.George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said society is ‘not equipped’ to support people with dementia. ‘We need a step change to enable people with dementia to live in our communities,’ he said.","Chief constable says officers are an 'extension of social services'

Shocking details of the unpublished report into electoral fraud in Labour's Falkirk constituency have been revealed, showing evidence of forgery, coercion, trickery and manipulation. The Unite union has been accused of trying to fix the selection of the Labour candidate in the party's safe seat and Ed Miliband ordered an enquiry into goings-on, only to abandon the inquiry and refuse to publish what was discovered. However, extracts from the report are contained in a Unite document compiled to reject the accusations against the union. A report by Unite on Labour's investigation into alleged vote rigging by Unite members has revealed details of alleged fraud. Ed Miliband, pictured on the Andrew Marr Show last week, ordered the investigation but refuses to publish the findings . It says Labour's probe found evidence that signatures and documents were forged, new recruits pressured to join Labour and even tricked into signing up. There is also evidence that membership fees were paid by a third party. Published in today's Sunday Times, the report states: 'It is not unusual for complaints to be made about all aspects of the selection procedure but these complaints are of particular concern because of the number of members involved. 'There is a line to be drawn between recruting members who support the aims of the party and the recruitment of large numbers of paper members who have no wish to participate except at the behest of others in an attempt to manipulate the party.' The union has been accused of trying to pack the Falkirk Labour party with Unite members to win selection for his assistant Karie Murphy, left . The report also states that there are concerns over 112 applications or direct debit forms, and 14 show evidence of being paid for by someone other than the person named, a violation of party rules. Unite's document denies all the allegations outlined and today it released a rebuttal of the claims made in The Sunday Times, claiming their responses to questions sent to them by the newspaper were ignored. It said: 'This report is a rehash of issues already investigated by Police Scotland and the Labour party, both of which found that Unite had done nothing wrong, and had broken neither the law nor the party’s rule book as it stood at the time. 'Specifically, Unite entirely denies any involvement in or knowledge of the forging of signatures on application forms or of any documents whatsoever; the coercing of individuals to join the Labour party – however that might be accomplished; the recruitment of individuals to the party without their knowledge or any other breach of Labour party rules. 'Unite called for an independent public enquiry into what happened in Falkirk, and we remain entirely happy to assist such an inquiry – and draw appropriate lessons from it if necessary – should one be established. 'Some of the questions submitted, however, appear to relate to conduct by third parties, about which Unite cannot comment. 'Unite would also point out that once individuals join the Labour party they can involve themselves as much or as little in the party’s business as they choose, but Unite would certainly encourage any of its members to play as full a part in the party’s life as they can.' Today the Mail on Sunday reported Tom . Watson is at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging row in Falkirk after . one of the candidates for the seat directly accused him of trying to fix . the selection. Gregor . Poynton, a Blairite communications expert, said Ed Miliband’s former . campaigns chief had used his power in the party to try  to install his . union-backed office assistant as the candidate. Blairite Gregor Poynton, left, has accused Ed Miliband ally Tom Watson, right, of being key to the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk, Scotland. Police investigated in May amid claims the party was packed with Unite members . Mr Poynton also claimed that Mr Watson had been involved in ‘all the shenanigans’, including trying to pack the Falkirk party with members of the Unite union to win selection for his assistant, Karie Murphy. He also alleged that the party leadership ‘knew what was going on’. It is the first time Mr Watson, who stepped down from his frontbench role in the wake of the row, has been publicly accused by another party figure of trying to influence the selection process. Mr Watson did not respond to messages but has previously denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the alleged ‘fix’ of the selection process in Falkirk. The explosive claims come just days before the contest to succeed Eric Joyce, who quit the party after a Commons bar brawl, is reopened in the Scottish seat. Mr Poynter is married to West Dunbartonshire MP Gemma Doyle, pictured . Labour suspended the selection in May after The Mail on Sunday revealed it was investigating allegations of vote-rigging by Unite and had referred the matter to the police. Ms Murphy and the local party chairman, Stephen Deans, were also suspended - triggering a knock-on threat of industrial action by Unite at the nearby Grangemouth petrochemical plant, where Mr Deans is a union convener. Mr Miliband dropped the investigation in September after key witnesses withdrew their testimony. Mr Poynton, the UK political director of communications firm Blue State Digital, made his remarks at a party fundraising dinner last week. He described an atmosphere of ‘serious intimidation’ during the selection process - claiming he and fellow candidates had ‘all been taken out in one way or another’. He told how Mr Watson had tried to help Ms Murphy by ‘packing’ the local party with Unite members, ‘getting them put on the membership list... they had a spreadsheet of names and a cheque, and he phoned up party office and said you need to accept this’. He described the reaction of Labour HQ as ‘it’s a bit dodgy... not sure about this’, adding about Mr Watson: ‘He was involved in it all behind the scenes... all the shenanigans, pushing things through’. But Mr Poynton said that when the party leadership uncovered the allegations it tried to broker a deal with Unite for Ms Murphy to quietly stand down: ‘The party came to a deal... we’re not going to investigate this stuff that’s gone on, we know what’s all gone on, but you have to pull out of the selection,’ adding: ‘Their preference was, we know it’s all happened but it’s better for everyone if you just pull out.’ Shortly before the process was suspended, Mr Poynton was eliminated from contention when an all-female shortlist was imposed. Mr Poynton, who is married to West Dunbartonshire Labour MP Gemma Doyle, said he still had not ruled out being selected when the process is reopened. The allegations follow the leak of emails last week which appeared to show Unite officials were involved in a bid to undermine Labour’s inquiry. Unite dismissed the suggestion and said neither the law nor party rules had been broken in the selection process. Last night, a senior party source said: ‘We have acted swiftly and decisively throughout the process, and the candidate at the centre of the issue has now withdrawn.’ Mr Poynton did not comment.","Unite compiled a dossier into Labour's unpublished report into voter fraud .

CBI director general John Cridland said the 'Single Market is fundamental to our future' Staying in the European Union is 'overwhelmingly' in Britain’s interest, although reforms are urgently needed, business leaders have said. The CBI highlighted research showing that EU membership was worth between £62 billion and £78 billion, around 4-5 per cent of the country’s total economic output. The business group, which holds its national conference in London today, called for a number of reforms, including removing barriers to e-commerce, becoming more outward-looking, and re-focusing the work of EU commissioners. The CBI said business also wanted a moratorium on legislation which could be made at national level, and a permanent UK opt-out from the Working Time Directive. Director general John Cridland said: 'We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros and cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal - the Single Market is fundamental to our future. 'We are better off in a reformed EU than outside with no influence. Each year, membership is worth £3,000 to every household in this country. 'But the EU isn’t perfect and there is a growing unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. Europe has to become more open, competitive and outward-looking if we are to grow and create opportunities and jobs for all our citizens. 'Contrary to popular myth, the UK is influential in the corridors of Brussels and will still be as long as we play our cards right. The Single Market is a great British success story and the best way for us to remain a leader on the world stage is from within the EU.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This compelling report makes a powerful business case for the UK’s continued membership of the EU. 'EU membership is one of the reasons why Britain is an attractive place to invest, as businesses in India told me last week. 'Liberal Democrats know that we are all better off with Britain in Europe. 'We can only build a stronger economy working together with our neighbours, exerting maximum influence in our continent and leading the reform agenda as the most liberal economy in Europe.' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the report 'makes a powerful case for' EU membership . Shadow minister for Europe Gareth Thomas said: 'The CBI’s report clearly shows that the business community doesn’t want to see Britain sleepwalk out of the EU. 'Despite this report making clear that British business wants us in Europe, the Tory Party still wants David Cameron to take us out. 'Today’s report shows that Europe brings each UK household £3,000 a year. David Cameron is willing to put this at risk because his approach to Europe is based on narrow party interest, not Britain’s national interest. 'Labour believes that a commitment to staying at the heart of the EU, along with a clear programme of deliverable reforms is the best course for Britain.

Jersey Coastguard said: 'The two missing men involved in this evening's incident at Les Ecrehous have been found. 'A rescue operation is currently underway and we will update as and when we have further information.' The pilot on the search and rescue plane reportedly used the lights of a pub located on the coast to try and land the aircraft on dry land.

The silver-coloured car, being driven by a 30-year-old woman, crashed into the Fatburger restaurant on Denman Street at around 8pm on Sunday evening. Collision: An employee of a Fatburger restaurant looks on after a car crashed into the restaurant injuring four on-duty police officers . The driver was heading south when she abruptly drove off the road, mounted the pavement and crashed into the front of the building. Four uniformed officers eating inside were struck by the car and debris. Police said that it’s early in the investigation, but alcohol does not appear to be a factor. Crash: The driver was heading south on one of Vancouver's busiest roads when she careered into the diner . Officers with the VPD Collision Investigation Unit remain at the scene and will be trying to determine the cause of the collision. The injured officers were taken to hospital but have now all been released with various injuries that, everything considered, are relatively minor, Vancouver Police said in a statement. The driver was not injured, but was taken to hospital as a precaution. Her cell phone was seized for examination by officers that attended after the crash, but police say it is too early to determine if its use played a role in the collision.

The Serious Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation into claims private firms G4S and Serco were overcharging for tagging criminals. The probe comes after it was claimed taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country. It is a fresh blow for government plans to outsource even more work to private firms in a bid to save money. Ministers fear taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals . The government launched a review of . all contracts with G4S and Serco signed by every government department . after doubts were raised about the use of taxpayers money. A . disciplinary investigation was begun into former officials in the . Ministry of Justice  after discovering contract managers were aware of . billing issues in 2008, but ‘nothing substantive was done’. The scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005. In . some cases private contractors charged the Government for years after . tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead . people. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has previously condemned the 'wholly indefensible and unacceptable state of affairs'. In . May it emerged auditors had been called in to examine payments to Serco . and G4S, which monitor around 20,000 criminals at any one time. Today . an SFO spokesman said: 'The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has . opened a criminal investigation into G4S and Serco electronic monitoring . contracts.' Probe: Global security firm G4S is to be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over tagging contacts dating back more than a decade . Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'The decision by the Serious Fraud Office to launch an investigation into the G4S tagging contract is a major development. 'With future Ministry of Justice contracts up for grabs, including more than £600million of probation contracts, the Government must act swiftly and bar G4S from bidding for any more until the SFO has concluded its investigation. 'By failing to do so, David Cameron risks undermining public confidence in our justice system.' An audit by big four accountancy firm . PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that overcharging began . at least as far back as the start of the current contracts in 2005 - . but could have dated as far back as the previous contracts let in 1999. G4S, which made headlines around the world for failing to povide enough security guards for the London Olympics, previously refused to take part in an additional government audit to rule out any dishonesty. A spokesman for G4S said: ‘G4S confirms it has today received notice that the director of the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the ""contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services which commenced in April 2005 as amended and extended until the present day"". ‘G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will co-operate fully with the investigation.’ A statement from Serco said: ""Serco confirms that it will co-operate fully with the SFO investigation."" Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the two firms that an independent forensic audit was required to look at, among other areas, internal email trails between executives to establish what happened. While Serco agreed to take part, G4S refused. A Government-wide review of all contracts held by Serco and G4S was sparked by the allegations last July. G4S was reported to the SFO when it refused to co-operate with a further audit, while Serco allowed a further forensic audit to take place. In the course of the audit in September, the Ministry of Justice provided material to the SFO in relation to Serco's conduct.","G4S and Serco accused of wrongly billing for non-existent tags .

This is the first picture of heroin addict Euclides Monteiro who has become a key suspect in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Monteiro worked in the restaurant at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz but was fired a year before Madeleine vanished on May 3, 2007. It has been claimed he was caught stealing from the tills and raiding the resort's rooms for valuables to sell in exchange for drugs. An investigation is now under way to determine whether Monteiro, who died in a freak tractor accident in 2009 aged 40, took Maddie in revenge for losing his job. It has also emerged that police warned holiday hotel staff about Monteiro, known as Toni. Nelson Rodrigues, 32, a barman at the Ocean Club, told the Daily Mirror: 'The officer told us. ""We know him, you can't trust that man"". 'They said he had been in trouble in the past for drug offences.' Monteiro, from Cape Verde in West Africa, was convicted of theft in 1996 but escaped deportation after a presidential pardon. However, his family deny the allegation. Police identified him as their main . suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when Maddie disappeared. The flat is a 15-minute drive from the town of Lagos where he was living after he stopped working at the Ocean Club. Yesterday, close friend Sergio Paulo, 44, a builder from Lagos, said: 'I know he would sometimes break into apartments and rob them. He was taking valuables from rooms at Ocean Club and selling them for drugs.' Motive: Police are investigating whether Monteiro, who died in 2009 in a tractor accident, killed Madeleine . Prime suspect: These e-fits were released of a man carrying a child 500 yards from the McCanns' apartment . Monteiro's widow Luisa, who has been questioned by police, told local media: ‘They are looking for a suspect that can't defend himself. ‘Peoples' lives can't be exposed this way.’ An investigation is now under way to determine whether Monteiro took Maddie in revenge for losing his job . A . source told Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha that police believe he may have killed the . youngster to ‘shut her up’ when he saw the huge media response to the . disappearance - and are now trying to find her body. Portugal’s Attorney-General gave the . go-ahead for the investigation into the girl’s disappearance to be . reopened last week at the request of local police – more than five years after the original inquiry was . shelved. Correio da Manha claimed: ‘Police suspicions about the former . Ocean Club employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a . PJ team from Porto. ‘This was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened. ‘The . man, who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009, was not on the . list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation . by the Ocean Club because at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance he . was not working there.’ It . described his departure from the Ocean Club as ‘frictious’ and said: . ‘The motives that could have caused the ex-employee to kidnap the . youngster are still being investigated.’ Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive . It . suggests that he may ‘have committed the kidnap as a form of . retaliation against the Ocean Club. His aim could have been to call into . question the security of the holiday club but something went wrong and . the youngster disappeared.’ Portuguese police and a spokesman for the McCanns declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday. It emerged over the weekend that police were planning to reinterview several Ocean Club employees. More . than 130 workers were questioned during the initial inquiry, including . two men who fixed a blind in the McCanns’ apartment two days before . Madeleine disappeared. New leads: The investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine was reopened following a case review .

Last . week it emerged that Kate and Gerry McCann are to apply under . Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ and may now be able to . influence the course of the investigation and any prosecution. Their . status as ‘assistentes’ will allow their legal team to work alongside . state prosecutors, keeping the McCanns informed of all new developments . in the case. They could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over Maddie’s disappearance.

Coalition tensions over immigration deepened today, with David Cameron accusing Nick Clegg of opposing himself. A plan for a £3,000 bond to deter illegal immigrants has been dropped, after it was vetoed by Mr Clegg. But Mr Cameron said he was surprised by the Lib Dem opposition because 'this was an idea that the Deputy Prime Minister first proposed'. Swipe: David Cameron made clear that the immigration bond was first proposed by Nick Clegg, who now opposes it . Under the proposals, temporary migrants from high-risk countries – such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Ghana – would have paid a surety before coming to Britain, and have it seized if they failed to leave when their visa expired. The proposal, a Tory manifesto commitment, was to be tested later this month. In a speech in March Mr Clegg tried to take credit for the idea but now wants to disown it. Lib Dem sources said Home Secretary Theresa May's version of the policy was 'not acceptable' to the party and not supported by other departments. 'They have seen the writing on the wall and binned it off. We have been clear from the start that the version was just not acceptable to us,' they said. But Mr Cameron today tried to pin blame for the confusion on his Lib Dem deputy. He told the CBI annual conference in central London: 'This was an idea that the Deputy Prime Minister first proposed but we are not proposing to go ahead with it.' To laughs, he added: 'He has lots of good ideas but this one is not one we are going ahead with.' The scheme was expected to apply to visitors from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria who would have paid up for a six-month visa. Home Secretary Theresa May ridiculed the Liberal Democrats' stance on immigration bonds at the Conservative party conference . In March Mr Clegg appeared to back . the policy in a speech in which he said there should be ‘zero tolerance’ of those who abuse the immigration system. But later this year he threatened to block the scheme if bonds were applied in an ‘indiscriminate way’. ‘I . am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate . way of clobbering people who want to come to this country, and in many . respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country, of course . not.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable had . suggested the policy could be used as a way of allowing in visitors who . had been refused a visa. This stance was ridiculed by Home Secretary Theresa May in her Tory party conference speech. She said Mr Cable’s idea amounted to paying for ‘more immigrants to come here’. She said: ‘Our drive to cut immigration has been so successful, even the Liberal Democrats are boasting about it in their campaign handbook. Labour MP Keith Vaz described the plans as 'unfair and discriminatory' 'I don’t remember their enthusiasm . for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies - so I’m going to . take this with me next time they try to block our reforms. ‘Bonds . were in our manifesto at the last election. But the Lib Dems suddenly . announced that it was their idea. Then they said they were against them. ‘Then . they said they were for them - but only to help more immigrants to come . here. Now they say they’re against them after all. 'They were for them, then they were against them... then they were for them, and now they’re against them.’ ‘Confused? Don’t be - the simple conclusion is you can only trust the Conservatives on immigration. Lib Dem sources said the policy was ‘not acceptable to the Liberal Democrats and was not supported by other government departments.’ One said: ‘We have been clear from the start that the version was just not acceptable to us.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government has been considering whether we pilot a bond scheme that would deter people from overstaying the visa. We have decided not to proceed.’ Tory ministers are trying to cut net migration - the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving - to below 100,000 by the time of the next general election. Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the scheme as ‘unfair and discriminatory’.","Plans for bond to deter immigrants staying after visas expire dropped .

He was placed in foster care with Gonzalez's maternal aunt. A family court judge found that Gonzalez's behavior was neglectful because Gonzalez, a recovering drug addict, was not allowed to use alcohol while free on bail. She is awaiting sentencing on charges of having sex with an inmate. Anthony Ricco, the lawyer for the 29-year-old for corrections officer, says his client was being manipulated by Wilson's family. Gonzalez's pregnancy threw up a monkey wrench in the death penalty case against Wilson - though she ultimately refused to take the stand and testify on his behalf . The baby, Justus, was conceived in an 'activity room' at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn . They were 'subtly blaming her' for Wilson being sentenced to death by a federal jury this summer. Gonzalez, 29, refused to testify at his sentencing hearing. Prosecutors said they suspected Wilson targeted Gonzalez and impregnated her so that he could use his child as an argument not to sentence him to the death penalty. In court filings, Mr Ricco described his client as mentally unstable and vulnerable. He claimed that she had been sexually abused and raped by her step-father, her uncles and other men. As an example of her emotional instability, Mr Ricco said that his client had sexual relations with eight other guards - some men, some women - during her two years working at Metropolitan Detention Center. She is set to be sentenced November 15 on charges of having sex with an inmate. She faces 15 years in prison, though Mr Ricco urged a judge to give her probation so she can continue getting psychological treatment.","Nancy Gonzalez, 28, was manipulated by the family of Ronell Wilson, her attorney says .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 10:16 EST, 4 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:09 EST, 5 November 2013 . Health officials today denied that a flesh-eating heroin alternative drug had spread to Ohio. They said that three suspected cases of krokodil were not confirmed to be the lethal drug and that the most prominently reported case, in Columbus, was likely an infection from using dirty needles. Surprisingly, a spokesperson for the Central Ohio Poison Control Center told MailOnline the lack of krokodil usage in Ohio may come from heroin being so readily available. Flesh eating: There had been fears that flesh eating drug Krokodil was being used in Ohio. Angie Neitzel, 29 a drug addict, in Joliet, Illinois shows her wound from the drug . All three suspected Ohio cases, initially suspected to be the cannibal narcotic were something else entirely. 'It is my understanding that everything that’s been tested for has been negative,' the spokesperson said. Testing for the drug failed to find codeine, the key ingredient that makes the krokodil authentic, the spokesperson explained. Initial assumptions that people were taking the drug may have been rooted in skin conditions found on drug users. 'There’s a skin reaction associated with krokodil, causing some people to jump to the conclusion,' said the spokesperson. 'It’s turning out to be other types of skin reactions from using dirty needles,' the spokesperson added. All three cases were likely simple infections from sharing needles with others. Already suspected to be in Arizona, . Illinois and Oklahoma, the lethal opiate gets its name from the . greenish-black color and scaly appearance given to the skin of users – . similar to a crocodile. The spokesperson further added that one of the two Arizona cases did not test positive for the toxic drug. Local officials immediately suspected the Columbus man had taken krokdil after he admitted to using the drug, and because of lesions on his skin. ‘The patient had a large, open wound and it is consistent with what we've been seeing, or the trend when people use [krokodil].’ Columbus Fire Deputy Chief Jim Davis told WBNS. A call by MailOnline to the Columbus Division of Fire was not answered. 'It seems like a stretch in this case,' Dr Marcel Casavant, of the Central Ohio Poison Control Center told MailOnline. 'But injection drug users will do a lot of things before calling [for help].' The lack of evidence supporting the usage of krokodil in Ohio is also being attributed by poison control officials to a surprising, and perhaps unexpected, factor. Heroin is easier to get: One Ohio official claims readily available heroin, similar to that pictured here, keeps krokodil off the state's streets . 'We’re guessing totally that it’s not an issue here is because sadly its much easier for people to get a hold of heroin here,' the spokesperson said. 'We have a major problem with heroin being extremely . available,' Dr Casavant added, explaining that Ohio is a hotbed for drug users. 'There’s still a very plentiful supply of all sorts of opiates available,' Dr Casavant said, adding 'I don’t expect that [krokodil is] going to be a big problem here.' Given the lack of readily available codeine, which is the key ingredient in krokodil, the drug is harder to make. In Russia, the spokesperson further explained, people have a much easier time finding codeine than they do heroin, both the doctor and the spokesperson noted. People in Ohio who want heroin get heroin, many in Russia who want heroin settle for krokodil - and its devastating side effects. Even though there is no evidence to suggest the . deadly drug has found its way into Ohio, Dr Casavant cautioned that it . doesn't mean people in the state aren't using it - but reiterated that . he doesn't ever see it reaching the scale of epidemic currently seen in . Russia. Despite the lack of concern by officials, the deadly drug’s presence has been detected in multiple US states, and horrific images of the ravaged bodies of addicts are becoming commonplace. At least one user, in Oklahoma, has died from using krokodil, others have suffered permanent damage from the drug – which literally eats the flesh of users from the inside- out. Another user, in Illinois, told MailOnline of the horrors krokodil has inflicted on her. Wounds: Krokidil causes terrible weeping sores and its use has been spreading across America . ‘It didn't take long before we both started to get these horrible deep sores on our bodies, particularly our arms and legs,’ former addict Amber Neitzel said. The woman suffered ‘deep holes and the skin is just rotting away, it's hard to describe how revolting they are,' she said. Despite having spent $100 on her last . stash of the vile narcotic, Ms Neitzel threw it away – a cardinal sin . to an addict – when she discovered what it was. A doctor who treated Ms Neitzel and her sister told MailOnline the drug’s use is widespread and pleaded with authorities to address it. ‘The . effects are the worst I have ever seen from any drug in all my years of . practice… I really don't know how it can be stopped, but it has to . start with law enforcement.’ The Drug Enforcement Administration, for its part, has mostly downplayed the drug’s danger to communities. ’None of our forensic labs have analysed samples that became . krokodil,' DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne told MailOnline. Ms Neitze told MailOnline she has been using the drug for over a year, and that its use is common. Joliet, where Ms Neitzel is from, is close to Chicago - notably because Mr Payne said the Chicago field office of the DEA recently received a sample of a drug believed to be krokodil. Testing revealed it to be heroin, said Mr Payne. 'Often times we get a sample of a chemical or substance, and its given to us believed to be one thing that turns out to be something . else,' said Mr Payne. 'This is what is happening, things are believed to be one . thing, and it turns out to be other substances,' he added. Mr Payne also explained that dealers don't always know what they are selling, leading them to call something krokodil because that is the hot name, but have it be another synthetic drug. Krokodil, . also known as desomorphine, is similar to heroin, but more powerful . than morphine. The high is immediate, intense and cheap - but only lasts . a few hours. Unlike heroin, which some people use for several years, krokodil is known to kill the majority of those addicted in only a couple of years.","Three people were suspected in Ohio as recently as last week to have taken krokodil .

Music has long been said to soothe a troubled soul but now it appears it can also alleviate physical pain. Four out of ten people who suffered persistent pain said listening to music helped relieve their symptoms. Among 16 to 24-year-olds in the survey of 1,500 people, the figure was 66 per cent. Fittingly, the song that helped the most was Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water, followed by Angels by Robbie Williams, Fleetwood Mac’s Albatross, Elton John’s Candle In The Wind and Easy by The Commodores. Relief: Pop music helped four in ten people suffering with chronic pain (library image) Pop was the most popular type of music – helping 21 per cent of people – followed by classical music at 17 per cent, and rock or indie music at 16 per cent, according to a UK survey of over 1,500 people conducted by LloydsPharmacy. ‘People in pain should try to find some activity to get fully engaged in,’ said David Bradshaw of the University of Utah Pain Management Centre. ‘Listening to favourite music is excellent for that because it can involve both thoughts and feelings. ‘No matter how anxious you may feel, if you can get absorbed in the music this can help with your pain.’ Of those who listened to music to help with pain, a third said they did so as often as they could, while 40 per cent listened just in the evenings. An estimated 10million people in Britain experience some pain on most days. Soothing: Angels by Robbie Williams, left, and Candle in the Wind by Elton John, right, were top choices . Latest figures suggest that four out of five adults will suffer back pain at some stage in their lives, while around 10million people in Britain are living with arthritis. Previous studies have found that stress and anxiety worsen the experience of pain, so anything that helps to make people feel relaxed can also help with their pain. LloydsPharmacy pharmacist Andrew Mawhinney said: 'There are lots of different ways of managing pain, not only with medicines but also with lifestyle changes such as moderate exercise and relaxation. 'After speaking to many people who are living with pain we were interested to learn just how many found music beneficial, which is why we're now trialling the use of music within our pain service in some of our pharmacies.' David Bradshaw, a Research Assistant Professor at The University of Utah Pain Management Centre in the United States, said: 'People in pain should try to find some activity to get fully engaged in. 'Listening to favourite music is excellent for that because it can involve both thoughts and feelings. 'No matter how anxious you may feel, if you can get absorbed in the music this can help with your pain. Choose music you like and know well, humming or singing along can help you engage in listening and distract you from your pain.' Top-five songs to relax to as recommended by people living with persistent pain were: . 1. Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel2. Angels by Robbie Williams3.

A Georgia teenager left destitute after his parents kicked him out of home for being bisexual has been overwhelmed after strangers online raised more than $20,000 towards helping him get his life back on track. Nick, an 18-year-old freshman at Kennesaw State University, was left reeling last month after his step mom and father told him never to return to the family’s home in Marietta after someone informed them that he was bisexual. Not only was Nick left homeless, but his parents left all his stuff in the front yard and told him to come pick it up before it got stolen. Nick, an 18-year-old freshman at Kennesaw State University, Georgia, was forced to leave home last month after his step mom and father found out he was bisexual . When Nick showed up to collect his . belongings, the police were on hand and he claims that officers . threatened to arrest him if he came back. Then while the teen was at work as a bag boy at a local supermarket, his parents came and took away his car. He maintains that even though the vehicle was registered in their name, it was he who made the monthly payments for it. As if all that wasn't bad enough, his parents even withdrew all his savings which they were able to do because his bank accounts were ‘custodial accounts’. Fortunately for Nick, a woman who works with him was there in his hour of need and has allowed him to sleep on her couch since. The woman’s son-in-law Steve Bevers then set-up a crowd funding page on October 22 to help raise money for the freshman and to show him that even if his parents didn’t love him there were others who did. ‘We have taken him in, and are committed to keeping him on track. But he will need to find a place to live soon (He is welcome on our couch as long as he needs, but everyone deserves a bed to call their own) and a car to help him get around,’ reads a message from Bevers on the GoFundMe page. The Georgia teenager has been overwhelmed after strangers online raised more than $20,000 towards helping him get his life back on track . ‘Had his parents not emptied his accounts, he could have paid a deposit, got into an apartment, and found a new car, but he was left with nothing.’ 'We're working to show Nick that he is loved, even by strangers,' he added. 'That the horrible acts of some people will not be enough to stop him, and that with the help of people everywhere, he can get through this.' The results have been extremely encouraging and in just 12 days more than 600 people have raised over $21,000 for Nick. The teen has been overwhelmed by the support he has received and on October 24, he uploaded a video to tell supporters his story and offer his thanks. In the video he revealed that he did not choose to tell his father and stepmother about his sexuality because of how they would respond. ‘This whole thing started when my stepmom caught wind of me being bisexual,’ he said. ‘I don't know where she got her information from, but I know it wasn't from me. 'She didn't like that and neither did my dad. I got told some very vulgar and disgusting things... That's why I didn't tell them, because I wasn't ready. And I didn't tell them for the exact reaction I was scared about, and that's exactly what happened.’ In a second video uploaded last Wednesday, Nick revealed that he is trying to get registered for the spring semester of school and is hoping to put some of the donation money toward getting himself a car. ‘You guys pretty much saved my life,’ he said to those people who have already donated to the crowdfunding effort.

Coasteering is an extreme sport which involves exploring rocky shorelines without a boat.

The . sport appeals to thrillseekers because it allows them to jump into the . ocean from remote cliffs. The first mention of coasteering was 40 years . ago, but it did not catch on amongst the general population until the . 1990s. Coasteering fans . are advised to wear safety gear such as a helmet, wetsuit and . lifejacket due to the risks involved in exposing themselves to the . elements. Novices are also recommended to join a tour led by a qualified instructor, who can be found in many coastal towns.

Somewhere in a galaxy far, far away... scientists believe they have captured the first image of a planet orbiting two suns. A team of French astronomers believe the snappily-named 2MASS0103(AB)b - could be a 'Tattoine' world just like the fictional home of Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films. The image, captured by telescopes at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, shows a large object orbiting binary stars. Discovery: The binary stars appear to have a large object orbiting them (the circle and green arrow demonstrate the planets movement between 2002 and 2012) However, it is so massive that researchers are not sure yet if it is a failed star or an enormous planet. They say deciding its identity could teach us more about how stars and planets form. The arid, lawless landscape of Tattoine was the setting for some of the most famous scenes in the Star Wars films. Planets orbiting binary stars have been seen before, but only through indirect methods. Philippe Delorme of the Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, and colleagues took the picture in November last year. After searching the telescopes archives they discovered the large object had moved considerably between 2002 and 2012. They believe it is orbiting the dual suns at a distance of about 12.5billion kilometres. This would be close enough for it to have been born from a disc of the dust surrounding them, as a planet would. Iconic: In the Star Wars films, Luke Skywalker lives on a fictional planet with two suns called Tatooine . But it is 12 to 14 times the mass of Jupiter, placing it near the dividing line between planets and failed stars called brown dwarfs. 'It's either one of the most massive planets you can form or the lowest-mass star you can imagine,' Delorme told New Scientist. Delorme added that the current mass-based dividing line between planets and failed stars 'is more of a working definition, as it is easier to measure the mass of an object than its past formation history'. His team is now analysing the object's light spectrum to learn more about its atmosphere. 'It's a really cool image,' Ben Burningham of the University of Hertfordshire told new Scientist. Asked whether he thinks 2MASS0103(AB)b is really a Tatooine planet, Burningham said: 'I'm giving it a firm maybe.'","French astronomy team find object orbiting binary stars .

This is the face of the man suspected of gunning down members of a British Iraqi family in the Alps. French police investigating the . horrific crime have finally released a portrait of the possible killer – . a year and two months after the attack. The unnamed motorcyclist with a . goatee was seen by several witnesses near the scene, allowing an image . to be generated on a computer. French police investigating the horrific murder of Saad al-Hilli (left) have finally released a portrait of the possible killer (right) Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud . finally agreed to release the portrait of the man, who was wearing a . crash helmet and sunglasses. In September 2012, satellite engineer . Saad al-Hilli was mysteriously murdered along with his wife Ikbal, 47, . his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a . 45-year-old French cyclist close to the village of Chevaline. Mr al-Hilli's two daughters, Zeena, four, and Zainab, seven, were with the family in the car. Zainab was left fighting for her life . after being shot in the shoulder and bludgeoned over the head with a . gun, while Zeena hid underneath her mother's skirt in the back of the . car and survived unscathed. In the days after the murder, at least . three forestry workers were among those who helped police put together . an identikit image of the suspect. Mr Maillaud is now facing questions as . to why he did not release the image to the public in the days after the . murder, when it had grabbed the attention of the world's media. The . prosecutor in turn defended his decision, saying it was kept out of the . public domain for 'strategic reasons'. Denail: Zaid Al-Hilli denies any involvement in his brother's death . 'We did not want this person to go into hiding,' Mr Maillaud added. Former RAF pilot Brett Martin . discovered the gruesome murders while on a bike ride, and described how . he had seen a motorcyclist riding away from the scene shorty beforehand. One of the forestry workers said he saw the motorcyclist pull into the parking spot where the Hilli family were murdered. He described the motorcycle as white and black with panniers and said it was ridden by a man dressed in black. Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family . One explained that his colleagues . later talked to the man about a minor traffic violation – effectively . driving in a part of the mountain where cars were banned – and described . him as having 'a bit of a beard'. According to Mr Maillaud, the forestry . worker's colleagues were able to 'get a glimpse' of his face when he . lifted his helmet's face shield. The two forestry workers have also . described seeing a grey BMW 4x4 close to the murder scene, saying it was . a right-hand drive British car. It was said to be driven by a man . described as 'slightly bald' with 'dark skin, no glasses' – suggesting . he might be an accomplice to the crime. Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy . The helmet opens from the side to allow a wearer to have a conversation without removing the whole helmet. But despite checks with manufacturers over the past year, no-one has been able to track down the helmet's owner. Police investigator Benoit Vinnemann confirmed that the wearer of the helmet is 'potentially the perpetrator'. A French Gendarme blocks access to the road to La Combe d'Ire ,the scene of the Al-Hilli killings, in Chevaline . Zaid al-Hilli, Saad's 54-year-old . brother who lives in Chessington, Surrey, was arrested by British police . in June on suspicion of masterminding the killings. He denies all the . claims, and has been bailed to return to his local police station in . January. Zaid claims that French police have . failed to properly investigate the possibility that the real target was . Sylvain Mollier, a Frenchman who was also shot dead near the family's . car as he cycled through the hills above Lake Annecy. 'They are covering up for someone in . France' said Zaid al-Hilli. 'Mollier was involved in family disputes and . was an outsider to his rich family. We are dealing with very powerful . local people, they know each other and are in each other's pockets. They focused attention on us, it has a . racist background.' Mr Al-Hilli, a payroll manager, said he was in . Worthing, Sussex, on the day of the murder, and his alibi has been . confirmed. He has spent a total of 25 hours talking to the British . police, but has refused all requests to travel to France. The French claim that one of the . reasons Mr Al-Hilli was arrested was because of a series of mysterious . phone calls to Romania when he could have been 'hiring' a hitman. But Mr Al-Hilli said this was . absolute fiction, saying: 'I have no idea where Romania came from; I've . never even been asked about Romania.' Mr Al-Hilli said he would be prepared . to take a lie detector, and was on 'a mission to find out the truth.' He . thinks the possibility of Mr Mollier being the target has been played . down because of the influence of the 'rich, powerful local family' of .

The San Francisco Chronicle is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term 'Redskins' when it refers to Washington's National Football League team. Managing Editor Audrey Cooper announced on Wednesday that the newspaper's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial slurs. '""Redskin"" is a patently racist term,' Ms Cole said. Scroll down for video . Name change: The San Francisco Chronicle will now refer to the Red Skins as the Washingtons . The Chronicle joins several other publications that have made the same decision, including the Portland Oregonian, the Kansas City Star and Slate.com. In recent months, local leaders in Washington and some members of Congress have also called for a name change, and some media outlets have stopped using the name. It is also the subject of a long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to void the team's federal trademark protection. Redskins' owner Dan Snyder has said that the original Boston Redskins had a Native American coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to Washington. But Suzan Shown Harjo, a major figure in the trademark case before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was unimpressed with the reference which she described as part of the team's 'time-dishonored history of putting up pseudo-Indians as part of their promotion.' Campaign: The Chronicle is the latest publication to say it will no longer use the term Red Skins . Outdated? Zena ""Chief Z"" Williams, unofficial mascot of the Washington Redskins, signs autographs during fan appreciation day at the Redskins' NFL football training camp at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Virginia in 2012 . Ms Harjo also rebuffed an assertion by Mr Snyder that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage. 'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said in an email to The Associated Press. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.' The debate about whether the term is an epithet has raged for decades. The Chronicle says it revisited the issue last month at the request of Scott Ostler, one of its sports columnists. The paper also recently ran an editorial by Caillie Millner, in which she recalled an encounter two American Indian friends of hers had when they watched the Red Skins play about 40 years ago. Tussle: Fans and campaigners are fighting over claims that the team's name is offensive . The couple 'took their seats, only to be treated like living mascots by Redskins fans. She spoke of being ""poked"" and having their hair ""pawed"" by them, ""in a scary way"",' she wrote in the Chronicle. Ms Millner added: 'When it's all over, we'll look back with amazement at the fact that a team had a name like that in the nation's capital. We'll look back and realize how shameful and embarrassing it really was.' When the San Francisco Chronicle refers to the team, it will now call them the 'Washingtons' Ms Cooper said.","Managing editor says newspaper has policy against using racial slurs .

The Liberal Democrat conference grew increasingly stormy today, as delegates in Glasgow were battered by high winds. The main entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre was closed to activists, who arrived with a warning to Nick Clegg that they want a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election. However the Lib Dem leader hinted he would prefer a power-sharing deal . with the Tories, arguing he wants the chance to 'finish the job' of repairing the economy begun in partnership with David Cameron. Battered: High winds and heavy rain made it increasingly difficult for Lib Dems to even reach the party's conference in Glasgow . Brolly hard work: After a day of sunshine on Saturday, gloom has descended on the party gathering . The first full day of the conference proved hair-raising for some . The Lib Dem leader insisted he had not held secret talks about forming a government with either of the main parties - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for Labour. But it risks infuriating his party members demoing the Lib Dems to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election. Mr Clegg has ordered his ministers ‘lift the veil’ on private battles with the Tories in government, including policy fights over welfare, employment law, immigration and climate change. But challenged over the role the Lib Dems would play working with either party in 2015, Mr Clegg appeared to favour the Tories. Gloomy: Nick Clegg braved the cold as he walked to the BBC studios in Glasgow this morning . Hair-raising: Before the security marquee was shut, delegates had to make a mad dash through the rain . He claimed Labour left to run the country alone would 'wreck' the economy, but suggested only that the Tories would not be quite as fair. He told BBC1's Andrew Marr programme: 'It is my genuine belief that if you go  back to the bad old days, not of coalition and balanced politics, but either the left or the right dominating government on their own, you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable. 'I think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 'So our message is: coalition is good; what the Liberal Democrats have done in government is good. Let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.' The Independent on Sunday published a . poll conducted by the website Liberal Democrat Voice, which found that . 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a Lib Dem-Labour . coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another . coalition with the Conservatives. A further 15 per cent of those . questioned said that, in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Clegg's . party should forge a ""confidence and supply"" agreement with Labour, . under which Lib Dems would not enter coalition but would undertake not . to bring down the minority government or vote against its Budget. Just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with Tories. Mr . Clegg predicted more coalitions in future, suggesting Labour and the . Conservatives will have to draw up a ‘shopping list’ manifesto, with a . handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during . coalition talks. He said: . ‘In my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future . you’re going to get more coalitions, it is less likely that you’re going . to these slam-dunk results when one or the other of the two major . parties always get a majority. ‘I . think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the . British people – as we were  last time – about those issues which you . really will die in the trench for, and those which clearly will depend . on political and economic circumstances.’ Blustery: Many delegates were not well-prepared for the weather . Wet wet wet: Lib Dem president Tim Farron (left) and pensions minister Steve Webb got caught out in the rain . In the pink: Nick Clegg boasted that his party was making a difference in government . He . said his focus was on returning to the Lib Dems to power in 2015, and . hinted at a desire to continue working with the Tories on the economic . plan which is already underway. 'Our . message to the British people in 2015 will be essentially this: we will . say: we’ve done very good things in government, but let us finish the . job and finish the job fairly. 'Because . there are millions of people in this country who have made huge . sacrifices, we’ve gone through this very difficult time over the last . two or three years – that would be squandered if you had a single-party . government of either the Labour [party] or the Conservatives in 2015. 'I . think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who . don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the . wrong kind of recovery.' Prediction: The Lib Dem leader told Andrew Mar there would be more coalitions in future - and all parties had to prepare for talks . Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government . Nick Clegg stepped up calls . for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he signalled soaking the rich will . be a key demand of the Lib Dems at the next election. He said the party's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £2 . million, raising £2 billion, sent a signal that 'even though we are . committed to deficit reduction' that would not be achieved entirely . through spending cuts. He told the BBC: 'Taxes and particularly taxes on people . who can afford it, have to play some role in the ongoing effort to . making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the . public finances. 'If the Conservatives don't want to do . that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we . will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - . schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to . make up that £2 billion.' However Mr Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne. Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government. Ms Pryce, who will attend the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a . mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives. In . an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is . set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level . or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a . mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just . waiting to be tapped’. Ms . Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business . Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit . mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says.","Lib Dem leader warns recovery would be threatened if Labour wins power .

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 5 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 5 November 2013 . On the 26th July 1937, Gerda Taro was doing what she loved best. A noted photographer, she was busy documenting the progress of the bloody Spanish Civil War. But tragedy was about to catch up with her. As Republican forces retreated in the face of an aerial bombardment, the car in which she was travelling was rammed by an out-of-control tank. Critically injured, Taro died the next day aged just 26 years old. After Taro's death, a legend grew up around her but her work was often overshadowed by that of her former lover: war photographer Robert Capa. Now a new book looks set to change all that. Tragic: Gerda Taro (pictured with Robert Capa) was killed aged 26 during the Battle of Brunete . Book: Rogoyska's new book suggests that Taro was responsible for work published under Robert Capa's name . Gerda Taro: Inventing Robert Capa tells the story of their ill-fated love affair and also illuminates their working relationship. In 2007, a suitcase was discovered in Mexico that contained hundreds of negatives belonging to Taro, including many that had previously been attributed to Capa. Now author Jane Rogoyskaya aims to shed light on Taro's extraordinary life and reveal the extent to which Taro influenced Capa, who went on to become one of the most famous photojournalists of his generation. 'Her early death, the overshadowing of the Spanish Civil War by the Second World War, and her connection with communism all contributes to her obscurity,' writes Rogoyska in the book. 'The rediscovery of Taro's photographs opens the door to more than just an insight into the brief career of a talented photojournalist. It allows us to re-examine the story of Gerda Taro herself and the partnership that so defined her. 'Behind the melodramatic newspaper tale of the heroic girl reporter tragically killed in action lies a highly complex reality, a fascinating story of image and identity, love and loss in which little is as it first appears.' Portrait of a young photographer: Gerda pictured in Paris in 1935, the year she met Robert Capa . Devastated: Capa was eaten up with guilt after Taro's death during the Battle of Brunete . Hellish: Half a million people were killed during the Spanish Civil War which raged between 1936 and 1939 . Robert Capa was born Endre Friedmann on the 22nd October 1913 in Budapest. After moving to Paris in 1933 and meeting Gerda Taro, he adopted the name Robert Capa and made his name documenting the Spanish Civil War. Following the death of Taro and the end of the war, he moved to New York but was soon back in Europe, covering the battles of World War II, D-Day among them. Later, he would document the aftermath of the German campaign in Russia and the early years of Israel following independence in 1937, all while finding time to romance actress Ingrid Bergman, although he never married. His death, when it came, was remarkably similar to Taro's. Embedded with the French army during the First Indochina War, in May 1954, Capa was travelling through northern Vietnam when he left the convoy that he was accompanying to go ahead and photograph the advance. According to those with him, the explosion that killed him came just five minutes later. Capa had stepped on a landmine. He died hours later in hospital at just 40 years old. And what a tale it is. Taro was born in 1910 to a family of . German-Hungarian Jews in the city of Stuttgart. Known then as Gerta . Pohorylle, her early life was uneventful. But . after Hitler and the Nazis came to power, life became increasingly . difficult for the Pohorylle family and in 1933, Taro was arrested for . distributing anti-fascist pamphlets. Forced out of Germany following her release in 1934, Taro would never see her family again. In 1935, a year after moving to Paris, Taro met Hungarian photojournalist Endre Friedmann and fell in love. Renaming themselves Gerda Taro and Robert Capa, the pair worked together to document the rise of the Popular Front in France, selling their photos under Capa's name. But their French idyll was not to last. In 1936, civil war broke out in Spain and Taro and Garda travelled to Barcelona. Together, they covered the war in Aragon and Córdoba, still publishing all the images under Capa's name. By mid 1937, Taro had left Capa and was producing work under her own name, including iconic images of the bombing in Valencia. Sadly, Taro wouldn't have the chance to create many more. After her death while covering the Battle of Brunete in July 1937, Taro's work was largely forgotten and her reputation overshadowed by that of Capa. Iconic: Capa later became one of the world's top war photographers and took this shot of the D Day landings . But with the discovery of the 'Mexican suitcase' and the news that two films about her life are in the offing, Taro may not be overlooked for much longer. Brave, beautiful and the inspiration for the hundreds of female war correspondents who have followed in her footsteps, as Rogoyska's book makes clear, it's time to reassess the legacy of the first female photographer to fall in battle.

Blunder: Sylvia Dawson was taken 30 miles from her home in Appleby, Cumbria, after medical staff gave a taxi driver her wrong address . The family of a grandmother with severe dementia are furious after she was sent home from hospital alone in a taxi - naked but for a flimsy bed gown. Medical staff gave the cab driver the wrong address and his passenger Sylvia Dawson, 76, was incapable of telling him where she lived. So she had to sit, unchaperoned, in the front seat as the driver tried to locate the home she shares with her husband Terry, 80, more than 30 miles away. When she finally arrived at their front door in the middle of a rainstorm she emerged distressed from the car - still clutching the plastic bag with the clothes hospital staff had not bothered to dress her in. Health chiefs at the failing NHS trust running the A & E department involved have apologised unreservedly for the retired mother-of-three’s appalling treatment. Tragically, within two days of her returning home, Mrs Dawson’s condition deteriorated rapidly and she was taken into residential care. It is unlikely she will return home. Her family believe that although this would have been eventually inevitable, her ordeal in the taxi hastened her decline. Mr Dawson, a retired IT consultant who has three children and eight grandchildren with his wife, said he was ‘resentful, disillusioned and shattered’ by her treatment. He said: ‘I can’t put it into words - it is beyond belief. ‘I can’t imagine what staff were thinking when they put her into that taxi, undressed, and when it was very cold, pouring with rain and blowing half a gale. ‘She was clearly distressed, and stark naked save for a hospital gown and light wrap. ‘It was the sheer callousness of the way they sent her home – their shipping her off in the nearest cattle wagon they could find.’ In August, Mrs Dawson was assessed by carers and a psychologist and even then was unable to answer the simplest of cognitive questions. Terry and Sylvia Dawson. Mr Dawson, 80, said he was horrified to find his distressed wife had been sent home by staff at the A&E Department of the hospital, after treating her for a cut to her head . Mrs Dawson, a former office manager, was diagnosed with vascular dementia four years ago and has been cared for since then at home in Appleby, Cumbria, by her husband, with the support of social services and a private carer. On Wednesday last week, she was rushed to Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, after cutting her head in a fall – but a scan showed it was not serious. Within a couple of hours, Mr Dawson received a call saying his wife was on her way back to him at home. He added: ‘It would have been obvious to anyone at A&E that she wouldn’t have had any idea which way was up when they put her into that taxi. ‘She suffers very seriously with dementia and she’s not exactly very articulate. She would have had no idea where her correct address was or what was going on.’ ‘The cabbie came to the door and the carer took over from there. I don’t think I was in too much of a state to do much. ‘The next thing I remember is that my wife was sitting in the kitchen with the carer bending over her taking off her hospital gown and fishing into the plastic bag which contained all of her clothes.’ Mr Dawson has formally complained to the trust and to the Care Quality Commission. The CQC is already investigating the North Cumbria Hospitals Trust, which runs the site, after it was one of 11 which featured in the Keogh Review highlighting unacceptably high death rates and was put into special measures. Yesterday Chris Platton, acting director of nursing and quality at the North Cumbria NHS Trust, apologised ‘wholeheartedly’ for what happened. ‘The circumstances around Mrs Dawson's discharge from hospital are clearly unacceptable and do not meet the high standards of safe and compassionate care that we aim to provide, especially for our most vulnerable elderly patients,’ he said. ‘As soon as this matter was brought to our attention on Friday we started a full formal investigation.’","Sylvia Dawson, 76, was incapable of telling the driver where she lived .

The incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning, October 26. Cameras in the building show a bulky shirtless man in shorts, heaving a suitcase into the lift a few minutes before 11pm. Moments later he lugs the case out of the front door depositing it on the pavement for refuse trucks to collect in the morning. The man does not appear to be concerned about a resident entering the building as he carries on regardless. According to police, Sampaio, who had been living with his mother, suffered from psychological problems and was known to be violent after having a drink.

Scotland Yard was accused of hiring . out officers for cash yesterday after Richard Branson’s business empire . paid for police investigating a massive fraud. The cable television company Virgin . Media agreed to fund the Metropolitan force’s overtime bill in an . investigation into a set-box racket costing £144million a year. The firm paid police £5,060 following . raids which revealed how thousands of viewers were using the boxes to . view subscription channels without paying. Virgin Media also agreed to give the . Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) a quarter of any compensation . awarded following a successful prosecution. One of the gang jailed over the . set-box scam has launched an appeal, alleging that police were . interested in the case only because of the money a conviction might . bring in. The extraordinary deal, at a time of . unprecedented police budget cuts, has raised wider questions about . whether the force’s impartiality is compromised in the face of so-called . incentives. The agreement between Virgin Media . and the MPA was signed in November 2008 but did not come to light until . after the conviction of three men for their part in the fraud, which . involved 400,000 dodgy set-top boxes. In August 2008, Virgin Media was . tipped off that a company named Rayyonics was manufacturing and . importing the devices, sold to suppliers and dealers across the UK. In September Virgin Media alerted . police who launched an inquiry, deploying 30 officers who worked . alongside 18 Virgin investigators. On November 19, police raids in and . around east London led to five arrests and the seizure of 5,000 set-top . boxes and £90,000 in cash. Virgin Media agreed to give the Metropolitan Police Authority a 'cash donation' of 25 per cent of any compensation awarded following a successful prosecution of the fraud . Six days later, a contract was signed . between a senior Virgin employee and the Met’s commercial partnership . manager agreeing that Virgin Media would fund the officers’ overtime . bill as they continued to pursue the inquiry. It also stated that: ‘It is agreed . that subject to the following conditions the MPA accepts from the donor . the unconditional offer of cash donations of 25 per cent of any money . returned to Virgin Media under a compensation order following asset . recovery work.’ Raids: Police arrested five people following raids in east London which resulted in 5,000 set-top boxes and £90,000 in cash being seized . In April last year, the ringleader, . Munaf Ahmed Zinga, along with Mukandun Pillai, went on trial at . Snaresbook Crown Court after attempts to argue that the police payments . were illegal were dismissed. Judge Inigo Bing ruled the contract . including the ‘incentivisation scheme’ was above board and he accepted . that the financial arrangement had been made after the arrests. Zinga, 40, was jailed for eight years . and Pillai, 39, six years for conspiracy to defraud. A third man was . jailed for 12 months after admitting being their delivery driver. Two other men were cleared. Zinga is appealing against his conviction, arguing that the payments were illegal. Challenge: One of those prosecuted after the investigation is appealing his conviction handed down at Snaresbrook Crown Court . Under the 1996 Police Act, a force may provide ‘special police services’ to ‘any person’ subject to payment. Although the Virgin deal comes under . those terms, an MPA member has questioned payments to police by a victim . in an active investigation. Jenny Jones, a member of the . authority for 12 years until it was replaced this month by the Mayor’s . Office for Policing and Crime, said: ‘I have never heard of this. It’s . like private policing and I am really shocked that somebody thought this . was OK.’ The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment pending Zinga’s legal action. Virgin Media refused to say how often it had put such contracts in place but said they were used only when appropriate. It is understood that the company has not yet applied for any compensation in relation to the fraud.","Virgin Media settled police overtime bill for paid-for TV scam investigation .

Google is developing a reputation for ‘accidentally’ leaking images of its upcoming devices, and it appears to have done it again with what’s rumoured to be a new 8-inch tablet. Dubbed 'Nexus 8' by speculators, the tablet is shown in a promotional image on the firm’s Android Apps and Entertainment page and if the rumours are true, would make the tablet just 0.1 inches smaller than the iPad mini. It appears to be running Google’s latest Android 4.4 KitKat operating system and is a slightly different shape than the current 7-inch, Nexus 7. The shots of the so-called Nexus 8, pictured, are shown on Google's Android Apps and Entertainment page. It has a different shape and smaller bezels than the search giant's current Nexus 7 device. An 8-inch tablet would more closely compete with Apple's 7.9-inch iPad mini . Google has a series of mysterious containers docked off the coast of San Francisco. One rumour claimed it was a research centre, while another said it was a showroom for Google products. A MailOnline investigation recently uncovered a second structure being built hastily at the top secret site. The huge structure is made up of shipping containers and looks set to be identical to the first. Another identical barge has been spotted on the East Coast in Portland, Maine. Such is the level of secrecy surrounding the project even members of the Coast Guard have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the teams of engineers and welders who have been working there. If Google is working on an 8-inch tablet it will compete more closely with the iPad mini which deliberately has a 7.9-inch screen designed to distinguish it from other smaller tablets on the market. Google announced its Nexus 5 handset last week with few surprising features. This was because images of the phone were leaked during a promotional video for Android KitKat back in September. The phone’s specifications were then leaked in an online manual, and the device later appeared on Google’s official Play Store alongside the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets all before the device was even officially unveiled. Rumours about a Nexus 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its Google Nexus 7 by Asus tablet in July. The picture of the so-called Nexus 8 on . the Apps and Entertainment page can’t be the latest Nexus 7 device . because it appears to have a slightly different shape. Rumours about a Nexus 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its Google Nexus 7 by Asus tablet in July, pictured. The bezels at the bottom of the leaked device are smaller than on the current Nexus 7. The Nexus 8 is also shown running Google's latest Android 4.4 KitKat operating system . It also has fewer bezels at the top and bottom of the device. These are the areas of the tablet where owners can comfortably hold the tablet without touching or interfering with the screen. The bottom bezel on the Nexus 7, for example, is much thicker than on the leaked images of the rumoured 8-inch model. The image was first spotted by a member called Britoid on The Verge Forums. Google doesn’t manufacture its devices; the phones are made by LG and the latest tablets have been made by Asus. Similarities with the Nexus 8 to the LG G Pad 8.3 tablet could suggest Google will ditch Asus and work with LG on its tablets, too. Google announced its Nexus 5 handset, pictured, last week after months of leaked images and specifications. It was the first device to run the new Android 4.4 KitKat operating system.

A man who faced a charge of sending soiled condoms and faeces in a campaign of harassment against a woman he had never even met has been given a restraining order. Anthony Jones was convicted of harassing the mother of six, Joanna Green, for two months between December 15 last year and February 16 this year. He was alleged to have sent menacing letters to her flat, in some instances stuffed with human faeces and a liquid-filled condom, as well as fabricating complaints against her and making hoax calls to the emergency services. Victim and perpetrator: Joanna Green, left, was left 'stressed and confused' by the inexplicable campaign of harassment waged against her by Anthony Jones, right . The letters did not use Miss Green's name but were addressed to 'The Occupier' and contained strange expletive-littered demands and accusations. One said 'Shawn, stop f***ing Skyping me, ****.' Others kept asking after a person named 'Mandy'. Mr Jones, 40, denied sending the condom and faeces but admitted that he had made hoax calls which sent the police and ambulance to Miss Green's home in Bristol. He had also fabricated complaints about Miss Green's family, alleging that he had witnessed fights and drug-taking by people living at her flat and accusing them of harassing him. Police tracked Mr Jones down after discovering four . of the 10 hoax 999 calls had come from his mobile phone, which he had previously used . to make bizarre calls to police in 2009. Mr Jones blamed 'friends' for sending the sick letters and making a further six phone calls from a phonebox near his home. Sick letters: One of the notes used as evidence in the trial, addressed to 'The Occupier' and stating 'Mandy's still not round' Terrifying: Anthony Jones was alleged to have sent menacing letters stuffed with faeces and a liquid-filled condom, which he denied . Miss Green, 44, said she had no idea why she had been targeted and that the experience had left her 'stressed and confused' and fearing for her . six-year-old son's safety. She said: 'He's . obviously a fantasist. I've never met anyone like that before. 'It was a . really hard time for all of us.' Bristol magistrates found Jones guilty of causing harassment without violence but could not find enough evidence to prove he sent the letters, which came under the same charge. Mr Jones has been given a one-year community order including 100 hours of unpaid work and a 12-week curfew, as well as a restraining order which will keep him away from his victim until May 31, 2014. He has also been ordered to pay £300 costs.

With energy bills soaring and no sign of prices coming down one team of scientists in America may have come up with the answer - heat the person not the building. Inspired by a desire to reduce energy consumption a team of four engineering students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) flipped the age-hold worry of heating your home on its head. Focusing on the innovative idea of cooling and heating people rather than entire buildings, the team developed a thermoelectric bracelet. Innovative: A team of scientists at MIT have developed a new wrist watch to help regulate body temperate. The aim is to solve the problem of soaring energy bills, heating the person rather than the building . The idea was borne out of the concept that heating or cooling parts of your body can help influence how hot or cold we feel in general. A cool flannel placed on your head can sooth a fiery temperature while a pair of handwarmers can help skiers and hikers warm up. The invention, dubbed Wristify, takes advantage of this, working by . monitoring air and skin temperature, and sends tailored pulses of hot . or cold waveforms to the wrist to help maintain a comfortable . temperature. The wrist watch can be can be powered for up to eight hours by a lithium polymer battery. The . 'watch' part of the prototype consists of the team’s custom . copper-alloy-based heat sink - a component that lowers a device’s . temperature by dissipating heat. Attached . is an automated control system that manages the intensity and duration . of the thermal pulses, delivered to the heat sink. Integrated thermometers also measure external and body temperature to adjust accordingly. 'Buildings right now use an . incredible amount of energy just in space heating and cooling, said Sam Shames, a materials science and engineering student who co-invented the Wristify technology. 'In fact, . all together this makes up 16.5 percent of all US primary energy . consumption. 'We wanted to reduce that number, while maintaining . individual thermal comfort. 'We found . the best way to do it was local heating and cooling of parts of the . body.' The team has estimated that if the device stops one building from varying in temperature by one degree Celsius, it will save around 100 kilowatt-hours per month. It comes as four of the big six energy suppliers in the UK have already hiked their bills this year. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. It means the average cost of keeping our homes warm has reached around £610 annually - up from £360 in 2008, the Independent revealed. Wristify: The device works by monitoring body temperature and then regulating it by delivering warm or cool pulses to the skin . The Wristify team took home the first prize at this year's MADMEC, MIT's annual materials-science design competition, receiving funding to create a working prototype. The annual competition, now in its seventh year, is run by MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), and is sponsored by Saint Gobain, BP, and Dow Chemical. The contest’s theme this year was 'materials science solutions for sustainability'. Michael Tarkanian, a lecturer in DMSE who runs MADMEC said while some teams may further develop their products, taking them to market, the primary aim is to get students involved in the design and prototype process. First prize: The team behind Wristify won first place in the MIT's annual MADMEC competition, receiving funding to develop their prototype . He said: 'The goal is to allow students to get their hands dirty, working in the labs to design and build functional prototypes. 'It gives them an opportunity to put their classroom knowledge to work, solving problems related to energy, habitat, and sustainability.' In developing their 15 prototypes, before landing the final product, the team discovered human skin is very sensitive to minute, rapid changes in temperature, which affect the whole body. They discovered they needed to heat or cool any body part - in this case a wrist - at a rate of at least 0.1C per second in order to make the entire body feel several degrees warmer or cooler. The final product resembles a wrist watch and can be powered for up to eight hours by a lithium polymer battery. The 'watch' part of the prototype consists of the team’s custom copper-alloy-based heat sink - a component that lowers a device’s temperature by dissipating heat. Attached is an automated control system that manages the intensity and duration of the thermal pulses delivered to the heat sink. Integrated thermometers also measure external and body temperature to adjust accordingly. 'What we developed is a wearable, wrist-based technology that leverages human sensitivity, can detect and perfect rates of change, and can maintain overall thermal comfort while reducing the need to heat and cool buildings,' added Mr Shames. With their prize money, the team, also made up of graduates Mike Gibson and David Cohen-Tanugi and post doctorate student Matt Smith, plans to further develop the prototype.","Revolutionary design aims to heat the person not the building .

And now developers at Google are hoping to make life on the road even easier - with drivers able to open the windows or turn on the air con with a wave of a hand. The internet giant is working on a new system that will effectively do away with complicated buttons and dials on a car's dashboard. New technology: First the driver-less car (pictured), and now Google is developing a system of hand gestures to turn on car lights and wind down windows in a bid to replace many of the buttons found on car dashboards . Give us a wave: An image submitted as part of the Google patent showing the typical sort of gesture that might be performed by motorists using the new technology . Instead a range of the vehicle's functions will be controlled by simple hand gestures detected by in-car cameras. Both Google and car manufacturer Ford has separately applied to patent the technology that will allow motorists and passengers to lower and raise the window with a swipe gesture, turn on windscreen wipers and indicators with a flick of the fingers or open the sunroof just by pointing at it. The idea is drawing comparisons with the control system in the 2054-model Toyota Lexus driven by Tom Cruise's character in the 2002 futuristic film Minority Report. According to the Daily Telegraph, Google's patent claims that the technology will be more useful in cars where the driver still has to drive, rather than alongside its self-drive system. They say that it will stop drivers becoming distracted by gizmos and gadgets in the car while at the wheel. Thing of the past? The new technology could do away with the sometimes complicated dashboard controls found in most cars (file picture) According to the Telegraph, their patent said: 'While a user is manoeuvring a vehicle, the user may wish to perform a number of additional functions, such as navigating to a destination, changing the temperature in the vehicle, or changing the volume of music playing in the vehicle. 'The user may perform a gesture in a region of the vehicle. Example regions include a steering wheel, an air-conditioning vent, and an ear of the user. 'The predetermined gestures may include, for example, any gesture that an occupant of the vehicle may make with his or her hands, fingers, arms, legs and head.' Gestures will be recognised by a 3D camera in the car and can be confirmed using a voice function. As well as basic dashboard settings, the system could also be used to change cruise control speed or to alter the position of one of the car's seats. Ford's proposed technology would use a similar camera operated recognition system. The car manufacturer's patent application says that drivers can confirm commands by a simple thumbs up or thumbs down gesture. Last year Mercedes showcased a gesture control system at the Consumer Electronics Show. Google has been testing its self-driving cars on roads around Nevada and California since 2010 and claims that they are safer than cars driven by professional drivers. The firm is said to be considering how to market the car.

A father who has twice been told he will die from cancer has defied the odds to get married and celebrate his daughter's first birthday. Tommy Kirkland, 44, had survived four brain tumour operations when doctors revealed a fifth deadly brain tumour had appeared only weeks after the birth of his daughter Anna last October. The father-of-two, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, underwent eight hours of surgery last December as surgeons battled to remove the tumour. Hope: Tommy Kirkland, who has twice been told he will die from cancer, has defied the odds to get married to partner Gillian (pictured) and celebrate his daughter's first birthday . Mr Kirkland, 44, had already survived four brain tumour operations when doctors revealed a fifth deadly brain tumour had appeared only weeks after the birth of his daughter Anna (pictured) last October . They also warned him that this fifth lifesaving operation would be his last chance of survival. Miraculously, he pulled through and has now married his partner Gillian, 33, and celebrated Anna's first birthday. Mr Kirkland said: 'My partner Gillian and I were looking forward to the birth of our second child in October last year. 'But not long after Anna was born, I was told I had another tumour. 'There is nothing I love more than my children and my wife and I knew I had to survive to see them growing up. 'When Anna was born, I was holding her and knew I'd do everything I could to be around for her for as long as possible. 'I knew I had to fight, there was just no other way around it. So I had the final operation to remove it three months later. Under the knife: Doctors have now told Mr Kirkland that, following the removal of a fifth tumour last December (pictured), his brain is unable to take any more surgery . Despite five bouts of surgery, he remains positive, saying: 'Five tumours down and I'm still here. They are always on the left hand side of my brain. I have many problems with my left side, I'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye' 'Then in July this year, Gillian and I decided to get married as we realised life is too short - especially when the doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if I get another tumour.' Mr Kirkland, who also has a seven-year-old son called Leo, added: 'Celebrating Anna's first birthday in October this year exactly 12 months since my diagnosis was such a special day. 'We went off to the Scottish Borders camping as a family for the occasion - I just never thought I'd see it.' Mr Kirkland, a bar manager, was fit and healthy until he began to suffer headaches in 2006. An MRI scan revealed he had a tumour the size of a baseball in the left side of his brain. Celebrating: Mr Kirkland with daughter Anna, celebrating her first birthday in the Scottish borders. He said: 'I never thought I'd see that day' In July this year, the couple decided to get married. Mr Kirkland said: 'We realised life is too short - especially when doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if I get another tumour' Doctors broke the news that he didn't have long to live and told him to say goodbye to his family before having an emergency operation to have it removed. He survived and tried to get on with life, but in May 2007 he began to feel ill again and, following an MRI scan, was diagnosed with a second brain tumour, which was again successfully removed. Then in 2009 doctors found yet another tumour. Again, Mr Kirkland was warned his chances of survival were slim because of the depth of the growth inside his brain. He underwent a marathon 12-hour operation in March that year where his entire face was pulled down and part of his skull removed as doctors worked to remove the lump. But he was dealt a further twist of fate when doctors found a fourth brain tumour and he was rushed back into surgery for a six-hour operation. Even as he recovered, he fell ill again after contracting meningitis and septicaemia. Doctors have now told him that, following the removal of a fifth tumour, his brain is unable to take any more surgery. Determined: Mr Kirkland added: 'I owe it to my family to fight with all that I can' Family man: Mr Kirkland said: 'Before this happened to me, I was always at the office, now I just want to be home with my kids. I'm on many different drugs now and I'm looking to the future' Despite this, he remains positive, saying: 'Five tumours down and I'm still here. They are always on the left hand side of my brain. 'I have many problems with my left side, I'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye. 'The moments when doctors tell you that you have to say your final goodbyes are just heartbreaking. 'But there is always hope. And I still have a life to live. People always say I'm a very positive person but I have to be.' He added: 'I owe it to my family to fight with all that I can and just live my life as normally as I can. 'Before this happened to me, I was always at the office, now I just want to be home with my kids. 'I'm on many different drugs now and I'm looking to the future.

The shots, taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, were captured as the moon entered its Spring season, meaning the sun was shining down onto its north pole making it possible to capture them for the first time. The near-infrared images show bright spots in the northern part of the lakes, suggesting the surface is unique from the rest of Titan, which . might explain why almost all of the lakes are found in this region. Scroll down for video . Images of the lakes near the north pole of Saturn's moon Titan, pictured, were taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft as it entered its Spring season. This shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of Titan . The data also suggests parts of Titan's lakes and seas may have evaporated to leave behind the Titan equivalent of salt flats found on Earth. This evaporated liquid is thought to be made up of chemicals that come from particles in the haze that surrounds Titan that have been dissolved in liquid methane. Titan's lakes, pictured, have distinctive rounded 'cookie-cutter shapes with steep sides'. The data suggests parts of Titan's seas may have evaporated to leave behind salt flats . Titan's lakes have distinctive rounded 'cookie-cutter shapes with steep sides'. The explanations for how the lakes formed range . from the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption to so-called . 'karst' terrain, where liquids on the surface dissolve . soluble bedrock. Although there is one large lake and a . few smaller ones near Titan's south pole, almost all of Titan's lakes surround its north pole. Cassini captured the images during . flybys of Titan on 10 and 26 July and 12 September. These flybys, . coupled with the sunlight shining on the north pole and a lack of clouds . as the moon entered its Spring season gave a much clearer, close-up . view. 'Ever since the lakes and . seas were discovered, we've been wondering why they're concentrated at . high northern latitudes,' said Elizabeth Turtle, a Cassini . imaging team associate based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics . Laboratory in Maryland. 'Seeing that there's something special about . the surface in this region is a big clue to help narrow down the . possible explanations.' Scientists at Nasa's . Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California study Titan's terrain . using Cassini's visual and . infrared mapping spectrometer. This mosaic, made from near-infrared images of Titan obtained by Cassini's imaging science subsystem, shows a view from the north pole (upper middle of mosaic) down to near the equator at the bottom. Here, the seas and lakes appear as dark shapes, embedded in some kind of bright terrain . Titan . is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles (2,574 . kilometers). It's bigger than planet Mercury and is the second-largest . moon in the solar system. The . atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components . lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich . organic smog. The climate - . including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on . Earth, including dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid . methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather . patterns as on Earth. Launched in 1997, Cassini has been . exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the . equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to . observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from . northern winter to northern summer. Cassini revealed that Titan's . surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the . main component of natural gas), during its initial flybys. Scientists are interested in Titan because its atmosphere is most like that on Earth. Titan is said to resemble a . frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before oxygen entered the atmosphere. Images taken using this visual and infrared . mapping spectrometer, which turns infrared colours into colours that can . be seen by the human eye, reveal differences in the composition of . material around the . lakes. Yet, until now, they have only been able to capture distant or partial . views of this area. Linda . Spilker, Cassini project scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion .

Warning: Martin Stephen, former chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, said the independent sector is 'perilously close to tragedy' Private schools are fostering overseas ‘cliques’ as they increasingly price themselves out of the UK market, it has been revealed. Martin Stephen, former chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said the independent sector is ‘perilously close to tragedy’ amid inflation-busting fee rises. It risks becoming the ‘sole preserve of the UK’s most wealthy families’ as many British parents - who were privately educated themselves - cannot afford the exorbitant charges. His warning comes as an influential guide said that some private schools are packing their boarding houses with international students in a bid to fill growing numbers of empty British places. The trend has led to some schools having ‘houses full of mature Chinese pupils’ who plug themselves into the internet and ‘refuse to join house activities’. One girls’ school had ‘for a time, only two non-Chinese boarders’ which meant the ‘dining room was a babble of gambling cliques - (that) could have been in Beijing’, according to The Good Schools’ Guide. Dr Stephen, the former high master of St Paul’s School in London, said he was worried that private schools are ‘marching steadily, resolutely and confidently over the edge of a steep and life-threatening cliff’. Writing in the Times Educational Supplement, he said: ‘Independent schools are in danger of pricing themselves out of the market. ‘They are also in danger of becoming the sole preserve of the UK’s most wealthy families. ‘My father was a Sheffield GP who was able to send three sons to boarding school. Try that now. ‘I have met a growing number of independently-educated young parents, our schools’ most obvious market, who have moved to the catchment area of a good state school, having baulked at the prospect of paying fees. ‘I feel in my bones that the way the numbers are stacking up, our sector is perilously close to tragedy. ‘I . do not know what the percentage is of the population who could afford . to send their children to one of our schools - 10 per cent? 15 per cent? ‘I cannot say . exactly, but I do know that we are creeping ever closer to the lower . figure, and it doesn’t leave enough people on the ground to stand and . fight for us when the going gets rough.’ Meanwhile, . The Good Schools Guide reveals that as fees have slipped out of the . reach of many UK parents and the economic downturn affects pupil . numbers, some boarding schools are over-exploiting rich overseas . families. Costs: Fees at elite boarding schools such as Eton (pictured) are now in excess of £30,000-a-year . But if the proportion of overseas pupils in a school grows beyond 20 per cent, the British feel of the school - its main selling point to foreigners - is thought to be compromised. Some overseas parents are now actually asking ‘not to be put in schools with too many of their fellow countrypersons’. The Good Schools Guide advises them not to be ‘fobbed off with second rate’ and to ‘look for a school that is popular with the British, as well as with foreigners’. Janette Wallis, senior editor of The Good Schools Guide, said: ‘The best schools are welcoming overseas pupils and integrating them beautifully. ‘In other schools, there’s a bit of a “pack them in, pile them high” attitude.’ The Independent Schools Council’s annual census showed there were 26,376 non-British pupils at UK independent schools in 2012, up by 5.8 per cent on the previous year. More than 3,700 were Chinese, 6,064 hailed from Hong Kong and 2,340 were German. However, the figures did not include foreign pupils at hundreds of smaller, non-affiliated private schools. Average day fees at ISC schools are almost £12,000-a-year and boarding is £26,340.

The precise moment two of the most powerful and destructive volcanoes in Russia erupted and began spewing lava and ash hundreds of feet into the air have been caught on camera. British volcanic photographer Dr Richard Roscoe stayed awake for up to 20 hours straight in a bid to capture the shots of the Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi volcanoes in the Kamchatka region. Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi are among 150 volcanoes situated in the region and are classed as stratovolcanoes because of their giant height; with their summits reaching 10,771ft and 15,862ft respectively. Scroll down for video . Rockfall on flank of the Shiveluch volcano lava dome in the Kamchatka region of Russia. British volcanic photographer Dr Richard Roscoe stayed awake for 20 hours to capture the spewing lava and eruptions from both the Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi volcanoes in the Far Eastern region . Roscoe travelled thousands of miles from his home in Munich, Germany, to the Far East of Russia, to take the shots. At Shiveluch, he plotted just 3.5 . miles away in an area previously destroyed by a previous eruption. While . picturing Klichevskoi, the closest Roscoe could safely get was 12.5 miles . away. Dr Roscoe, a . molecular biologist, said: 'At Shiveluch we camped in an area that had . no trees left thanks to a previous eruption. It meant we were able to . get much better pictures with nothing in the way. 'But . the trouble with a lava dome is these things are unstable - it could . look benign but them suddenly collapse. If that had happened we would . have been gone. 'That's why we always travel in groups to these events so that there is support if you need help.' Dr . Roscoe, who says his extreme hobby can sometimes leave his family . concerned, has spent the last 10 years travelling the globe in search of photographing and . picturing eruptions, also known as 'volcano hunting.' Ash eruption from the summit of the Shiveluch lava dome. Shiveluch is a stratovolcano - one of Kamchatka's largest volcanoes - with a summit of 10,771 feet. Shiveluch increased activity in May 2009 and has been periodically spewing ash up to distances of six miles ever since . The eruption of the Kliuchevskoi volcano is shown reflected in the Kamchatka river. The first Kliuchevskoi eruption was recorded in 1697 and it has been almost continuously active ever since. The volcano was first climbed in 1788. Several climbers were killed by flying lava when they attempted the ascent in 1931 . This image shows the destruction caused by the Shiveluch volcano on the surrounding areas. Dead trees sit on the embankment of an erosion gully. So-called pyroclastic flow, or the flow of hot gas and rocks, from the eruption would have caused this trench to develop in the landscape. It sits approximately six miles from the Shiveluch lava dome . These latest photos, captured earlier this month, show lava spewing out from the two stratovolcanoes before . trickling down the rocky sides. Huge clouds of ash can then be seen . developing above the active volcanoes. Shiveluch was most recently active between 11 October and 16 October, while Kiluchevskoi was last active between 16 October and 22 October. Dr Roscoe said the key to his success was to capitalise on small windows of good weather: 'It is very difficult to get close and conditions can often be . poor - snow and gale force winds are common. We had only small windows . when the clouds cleared to capture the photographs. 'Volcanoes are quite volatile things so you have to make the most of a clear skies before it changes again.'

This was the miraculous scene as rescue workers plucked two people from their car after it crashed through a motorway bridge, leaving them hanging precariously in mid-air. The driver and passenger of the car were 'extremely lucky' to escape following the dramatic accident on the M6 in Merseyside today. The impact left the car's back wheels dangling off the side of the bridge, which crosses over the A580 carriageway below. Rescue teams worked to lift the car, dangling precariously off the bridge which crosses the A580 below, cutting one motorist free and rescuing another. One is said to have suffered a leg injury . The accident happened in the southbound carriageway at Haylock shortly after 8.30am. Rescue teams cut one person free from the wreckage before rescuing the other and then firefighters worked to lift the car back on to the road. A spokesman for the Highways Agency said the rescue efforts took almost an hour, with the pair safely helped from the car by 9.45am. Firefighter Chris Parrington, a member of the search and rescue team who attended the call-out, said: 'We were called to the flyover of the roundabout near junction 23 of the M6. 'When we arrived the back of the car was overhanging part of the East Lancashire Road, but the car was relatively stable and pretty level. 'We had to use winches and cables to secure the vehicle before the two occupants could be helped out. 'We had to use hydraulic cutters and a reciprocal saw to remove the door to release the driver. 'Both occupants of the car walked out assisted by firefighters and members of the North West Ambulance Service’s Hazard Area Response Team. 'They were extremely lucky with a drop of more than 30 feet to the carriageway below.' The North West Ambulance Service said one of the motorists suffered a leg injury. The pair were both taken to hospital for checks. No other vehicles were involved. The crash and subsequent rescue mission resulted in significant delays on the M6. The Highways Agency spokesman said they were working to put a temporary concrete barrier in place to plug the gap left by the car. He said: 'The rescue efforts took around an hour. 'The driver and passenger were rescued before firefighters then lifted the car back on to the road. 'We are putting a temporary barrier in place to stem the gap in the fence left by the car. 'As a result today we have only had one lane open past the crash scene for most of the day. 'Lane one and two and the hard shoulder have been closed while repairs are carried out.' He said lanes one and two are expected to remain closed until 5pm. 'We will have to go back tomorrow morning to inspect the damage to allow us to plan for a permanent repair,' he added.

Say cheese: Matthew Feroze with the winning cheeseboard that made him Champion de France at the Concours National des Fromagers . He says his French is fluent, but one wonders how much Matthew Feroze understood of what was being muttered about him in Lyon, the capital of Gallic gastronomy, last weekend. After becoming the first foreigner to scoop the top prize in one of France’s most prestigious national contests for cheese-mongers, the Londoner said the other competitors had been ‘friendly and encouraging’. If so, that’s commendable, not to mention rather startling, given the French’s famous fondness for fromage. ‘Any country with 300 cheeses cannot die,’ remarked Winston Churchill, and today France is reckoned to have more than 1,000 varieties. All the more galling then that two of the cheeses presented to the judges by Matt were — sacre bleu! — a stilton and a West Country cheddar.  ‘The French don’t have many things comparable to a stilton,’ says Matt. ‘To them it’s really quite exotic.’ As if all that is not enough, the French must be choking on their camembert to discover the relative inexperience of the man who became ‘Champion de France’ in the Concours National des Fromagers. Though judged to be one of France’s foremost experts on the food, 30-year-old Matt has been in the cheese business for little more than a year. Until 2011, he was working for the National Audit Office as an accountant. When he learned his employer was offering unpaid sabbaticals of up to two years — a kind of ‘trial separation’, as he puts it — he seized the chance to swap his calculator for a cheese wire. ‘I enjoyed elements of my job, but I felt it was perhaps not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,’ says the man who now wrestles not with columns of figures but blocks of cheese. With an uncut Emmental weighing upwards of 170lb — the average weight of a British male — the work has had an unexpected effect on Matt’s waistline. Cheesemonger: Mr Feroze had to present a cheese platter that he had selected and matured himself as part of the Concours National des Fromagers at the Salon Mondiale de Restauration et Hôtellerie . ‘You need pretty big biceps to work with some of the bigger blocks,’ he says. ‘I thought I might get fatter with all the cheese I get to taste, but, in fact, I’ve lost weight.’ This is but one perk for Matt, who fell in love with France and its cheeses when he went to Lyon to learn French after graduating from Durham University with a degree in chemistry. ‘I worked on a farm where they were making goat’s cheese, and discovered there is something compelling about the people who are involved with it. ‘There’s not really much money to be made in cheese, especially on a small scale, so they tend to be people who are passionate about what they do, interested in keeping something historic alive, but also in creating something brilliant. I found them engaging to be around.’ Matt, who fell in love with France and its cheeses when he went to Lyon to learn French after graduating from Durham University with a degree in chemistry . His fascination with cheese was put on hold — ‘except that I liked to eat lots of it’ — while he pursued his accountancy career, but one Saturday he started chatting with a stall-holder at London’s Borough food market. He was selling cheeses supplied by the Fromagerie Mons-Etienne Boissy, one of France’s best-known cheesemongers, and gave him the name of a contact in Lyon. It was the start of what has turned out to be a remarkable venture for Matt and his fiancée, Jen, who works in publishing. We LEFT home with some savings, an idea we might want to live in Lyon and a fair amount of enthusiasm,’ says Matt. ‘Around that time I saw pictures of the kinds of platters presented at the French cheese competitions, but I had no idea then that I would be up there one day, not only putting one together but actually winning.’ Matt’s fast track to fromagerie fame continued when he was offered  work experience at Fromagerie  Mons-Etienne Boissy’s shop in Lyon. Taken on as a trainee cheese- monger, he learned some of his most important lessons in the ‘caves’ — a term dating back to the days when the first blue cheeses were matured in the natural caves of France, the temperatures and humidity proving ideal for the growth of mould. ‘Part of what I love about good cheese is that it’s an expression of the land that produced it,’ says Matt. ‘I’ve heard stories about farmers shooing their cows from under trees when it’s raining so they are forced to feed on fresh grass rather than ruminating what they have eaten already. ‘All those things affect the taste — there’s far more to cheese than you could ever imagine.’ Such knowledge is tested in the written section of the competition won by Matt last weekend. Which cheese is hand-wrapped in chestnut leaves? (A southern variety called Fagace.) And which is made from the last ebbs of milk from cows making milk for large wheels of Comte in the Alpine pastures (Mont d’Or, not something you find in your average sarnie). Selection: Mr Feroze's selection included two British cheeses, a stilton and a West Country cheddar (stock) Candidates must then identify unlabelled cheeses from all over France, an art in which Matt has quickly become skilled. ‘First, you look at the colour. If it’s yellowy, that suggests it’s made from cow’s milk, because of the carotene in the grass they eat. If it’s white, then you are probably looking at goat or ewe’s cheese. ‘Then you crumble it to see how it has been made, how the curds push together. Finally, you taste it. Is it acidic or sweet? Does it have a woolly, sheepy taste, or is it more goaty? ‘Or has it a woody flavour, like Vacherin Mont D’Or, which is wrapped in a belt of spruce bark? These are all things you get to distinguish in time.’ Equally challenging is the section where contenders slice a block of cheese into specified weights without scales. ‘Judging the weight by eye is something that French customers expect you to get right because it’s something they are very good at themselves,’ says Matt. ‘They have grown up around cheese.’ The highlight of the competition is the presentation of the platters of up to 25 cheese ‘sculptures’. ‘You know roughly the size of the platter, but not the shape, so it’s all about what you do on the day, which makes it very pressured,’ says Matt who carved his cheeses into elaborate crescent shapes. Apart from the Stilton — ‘one of the British cheeses I’ve always loved’ — his other selected cheeses included a Swiss gruyere, which he describes as tasting ‘savoury and fruity at the same time and with great texture’. And, more practically, he picked mimolette, an orangey cheese from Lille. ‘It added great colour and it’s very easy to carve,’ he says. He clearly impressed the judges. ‘He was best, that’s all you can say. He worked hard on his presentations, with great passion and knowledge,’ says the competition organiser Catherine Bonnetaud. So what’s next? ‘I want to keep improving my knowledge about cheese and it’s definitely something I’m considering as a career,’ he says. That’s bad news for Matt’s competitors. After all, they might have applauded the upstart ‘Rosbif’ last weekend, but who could blame them if they feel a bit cheesed off?","Matthew Feroze became first foreigner to win Concours National des Fromagers .

French judges have ordered Google to stop providing links to the sadomasochistic private life of former Formula 1 chief Max Mosley. In a landmark ruling in Paris, they agreed that the 73-year-old should have all details of his sexual past erased from the internet giant's search engine. It follows the defunct newspaper the News of the World publishing videos and nine photos of Mosley taking part in an S&M orgy in 2008. Max Mosley: All details of the Formula 1 boss' sexual past will be erased from the Google search engine . Although Mosley, former president of the FIA motor racing organisation, successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £60,000 in damages from the paper, the images can still be found on the worldwide web. Now Google will have to introduce a filter to prevent the material appearing in any search results, after Mosley successfully argued that sexual activity is a private matter. Lawyers for Google had told the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris that the request was a 'legal aberration' which 'undermine the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information on the internet'. The ruling comes after the News Of The World published images and videos of Mr Mosley's sex life . Daphne Keller, associate general counsel at Google, said: 'This decision should worry all those who defend freedom of expression on the internet.' Google has two months to comply with the order. The court also fined the firm a symbolic €1 and ordered it to pay €5,000 (£4,205) in court costs. Mr Mosley's legal team failed to secure a broader ruling which would have also forced Google to block access to any further extracts from the video which may emerge in the future. Google said it had, at Mr Mosley's request, already taken steps to ensure hundreds of pages whose content could be deemed to breach the law in some countries are excluded from its search results. At the heart of the legal debate is the question over whether companies like Google should be obliged to play a role in policing the internet. The company says no to that and believes its stance is supported by a European Union directive (law) on e-commerce which should take precedence over privacy . Oxford graduate Mosley is the youngest son of the late British fascist Sir Oswald Mosley.","All images and videos will be removed from search engine after ruling .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:14 EST, 31 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 31 October 2013 . Tributes by MPs to Prince George have been condemned as ‘stomach-churning’ by a Labour politician. Tom Copley, Labour’s housing spokesman in London, complained that valuable time in Parliament had been taken up to ‘congratulate two very wealthy aristocrats for procreating’. And he criticised the London Assembly for sending ‘loyal greetings’ to the Queen to mark the future monarch’s christening. Tributes: David Cameron and Ed Miliband sent congratulations to William and Kate on the christening of George, to to horror of Labour politician Tom Copley . Mr Copley’s republican outpourings on his blog have been branded ‘surly and mean-spirited’ by the Tories, who called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to distance himself from the remarks. David Cameron led tributes in the House of Commons to Prince George on his birth, and last week told the Commons: ‘I am sure the whole House will join me in celebrating the christening of baby Prince George later today.’ He was supported by Mr Miliband who said: ‘I also join the Prime Minister in celebrating the christening of Prince George later today and send best wishes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.’. Criticism: Mr Copley condemned the 'unctuous fawning and sycophancy' of MPs towards the royal family . But Mr Copley used his blog to rage against senior politicians paying tribute to the heir to the throne . Mr Copley wrote: ‘Every so often we are subjected to the stomach churning spectacle of Members of Parliament queuing up to offer tribute to the royal family upon some particular event or occasion. ‘Only recently they devoted valuable Parliamentary time to debating a motion congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge upon the birth of Prince George. ‘Amidst the crises of the civil war in Syria, the ever growing cost of living and Britain’s economic woes they managed to find an hour or so to congratulate two very wealthy aristocrats for procreating.  Politics is the language of priorities, after all.’ He said he hoped the London Assembly ‘could leave such displays of unctuous fawning and sycophancy to the experts down the river but instead was ‘disappointed’ to discover that members of the Chair of the Assembly also sent ‘loyal greetings’ to the Queen and the royal family. Mr Copley added that four in 10 children in the assembly live in poverty, yet the Assembly chose to congratulate ‘one of the richest, most powerful and influential families in London on the christening of the child who will one day inherit the office that most modern democracies trust the people to elect’. Conservative Party vice-chairman Bob Neill said Mr Copley’s views were out of touch with the public. Greetings: Mr Copley said he was 'disappointed' that the London Assembly had also sent a message of goodwill to the Queen . ‘It’s a pity Tom Copley hasn’t got better things to do with his time than write such surly and mean-spirited drivel on his blog,’ he told the London Evening Standard. ‘On the positive side, this kind of dour killjoy attitude shows why republicanism has never caught on in the UK. ‘You couldn’t get someone more out of touch with the public. I wonder whether Ed Miliband will have the guts to disown him?’ But Mr Copley is unrepentant, telling the newspaper: ‘I’m very clear that I want a democratically elected head of state. ‘The royals would carry on as a family and could carry on using their titles if they want. If they want to continue to ride around in gold carriages, that would be fine with me.’","Labour housing spokesman Tom Copley condemns christening messages .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 19:46 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:44 EST, 30 January 2013 . George Osborne made a joke that the Tories could lose the next election . As the man charged with delivering a Tory victory at the next election, George Osborne is supposed to be a cheerleader for Conservative triumph in 2015. But the Chancellor has revealed his inner doubts about the prospects of victory to the rest of the Cabinet. The Mail has learned that Mr Osborne surprised his fellow ministers recently by cracking a doom-laden joke predicting that the party will soon be in opposition. Mr Osborne’s comment came as Tory chairman Grant Shapps outlined ways the Tory Party can maximise their vote by reaching out to black and other ethnic minority voters at the next election. One minister urged Mr Cameron to act promptly on the plans, saying: ‘We don’t want to be sitting around the Cabinet table having this conversation in three years’ time.’ At that point Mr Osborne piped up: ‘In three years’ time we will be sitting around the shadow cabinet table.’ Those present said the Chancellor was ‘only half joking’ when he made the crack and that he provoked ‘nervous laughter’ from other ministers. Mr Osborne’s gallows humour was particularly stark coming from the man who is charged with devising the Conservative election strategy and reviving Britain’s economic fortunes. And observers expressed surprise that the Chancellor chose to make his gloomy comment at a meeting expressly designed to boost the Tories’ prospects of boosting their vote share in 2015. One of those present said: ‘George just said it quick as a flash. There was a bit of a stunned pause while everyone realised what he meant and then a lot of nervous laughter. Everyone knows we might lose but to hear it from George himself is not exactly reassuring.’ Another source said: ‘It was an odd moment to make that joke since we were talking about how we win, not how we lose.’ A spokesman for Mr Osborne denied that he is pessimistic about the Tories’ chances of success: ‘George thinks we can and will win the next election.’ But he did not deny that the comment was made. Details of the Chancellor’s mordant joke emerged as Tories said they will seek ‘revenge’ for the Liberal Democrats voting down reform of constituency boundaries, which would have given the Tories a 20 seat boost at the next election. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne made the grim joke at a meeting to discuss ways of boosting Conservative election chances . Thanks to the pro-Labour bias, the Tories will now need a national poll lead of around 7 per cent to secure a majority. Under plans being discussed by senior Conservatives, more Lib Dem seats would be added to the Tory hitlist of target seats. Tory donors will be asked to contribute with the specific intention of ousting particular Lib Dem MPs. Mr Shapps has drawn up a list of 40 seats the Tories need to win a healthy majority - 20 of which are Lib Dem seats. But a well-placed source said: ‘The talk now is that we increase that to 30 or 35. Make them pay. It’s pretty hard getting donors to cough up to run photocopiers at Millbank [Tory HQ] but they would be more than happy to fund a campaign to oust some more of these b******s.’ Eric Pickles joked that the Coalition has become like a family gathering with relatives who have outstayed their welcome . Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, has said that the coalition is like an extended family that has spent too much time together. It was like Boxing Day, he said. ‘You have been as nice as you can to your relatives, but by the time Boxing Day comes around you realise why you do not live together.’ Tory MPs in target seats will be told they must attend ethnic minority events in order to boost their chances of victory. Before Mr Osborne’s joke, ministers had heard how being non-white is the single biggest reason why people don’t vote Tory -more important than class or wealth or home town. They then discussed plans for David Cameron to make a speech distancing the Tories from the toxic legacy of Enoch Powell, whose ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech about immigration in the 1960s is still seen as proof the party is racist by some ethnic minority voters. Mr Cameron has brought in Australian election expert Lynton Crosby to run the campaign. But strategy will still be set by himself and Mr Osborne, who divides his time at the Treasury with political strategy meetings in Number 10 Downing Street. Labour leader Ed Miliband regularly taunts Mr Osborne as ‘the part time Chancellor’ for his dual political and economic role. But a growing number of Tory MPs are also losing patience with Mr Osborne amid concerns that the flatlining of the economy will cost them any prospect of victory in 2015. One senior backbencher said yesterday: ‘People are getting nervous that the time on the economic clock is beginning to run out.’","A meeting was held to discuss ways to boost votes at the next election .
