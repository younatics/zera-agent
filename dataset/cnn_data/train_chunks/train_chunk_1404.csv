"With tank-transport and personal bodyguards included, a holiday company is testing the boundaries quite literally with guided tours of war-torn eastern Ukraine. A fierce and bloody battle between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces continues, but Moscow-based Megapolis Kurort believes they can cash in on the unrest. The self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk are on the itinerary, both rebel strongholds and witnesses to some of the worst violence. Scroll down for video . Moscow-based Megapolis Kurort are organising tank-trips to war-torn eastern Ukraine . Customers should be aware that unsurprisingly, the trips to Ukraine are at 'their own risk' A four-day tour of the war-torn regions will cost about £1,300 to £2,000 ($2,000-$3,000), according to the the pro-Kremlin Izvestiya newspaper. Bodyguards will be provided from a security firm, and the tanks will hold between five and seven people. Ten members of the travel agency have already expressed an interest in signing up for the trip, which as co-owner Anatoly Aronov added, will be attended 'at their own risk.' 'There is death and tears, there is grief, and I didn't expect such a proposal to appear at all, especially from our Moscow colleagues,' Stanislav Vinokurov, Luhansk's self-proclaimed sports and tourism minister told Izvestiya. The tour of Ukraine will offer guests the chance to get up close and personal to scenes of battle . The trip is sure to leave memories, perhaps not so good, of the troubles in Ukraine . Officials in areas of unrest in Ukraine say the holiday company should not be profiting on 'people's grief' 'I understand and support commercial initiatives in the tourism industry, but to earn money on people's grief? I do not support this.' The trip to war-torn Ukraine is a far cry from the holiday company's usual themed trips - they are know for organising health-orientated vacations. Heavy artillery fire roared this morning in eastern Ukraine as fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists continued hours before a cease-fire was to take effect in the conflict that has killed more than 5,300 people. Under an agreement reached Thursday, the warring sides are to cease firing at midnight (22:00 GMT). However, a previous cease-fire called in September failed to take hold and after fighting escalated sharply in January, expectations for the new agreement are clouded. A four-day tour of the war-torn regions will cost about £1,300 to £2,000 ($2,000-$3,000) Officials in the port city of Mariupol meanwhile said an array of artillery attacks hit areas near the city during the morning. There was no immediate information on casualties. Russia has flatly denied repeated Western claims that it has sent troops and equipment to the eastern Ukraine rebels. The fighting started in April after armed separatists took control of towns and official buildings in the Dometsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. The seizures began after Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power in the wake of months of protests in the capital, Kiev. The separatists claim the new Ukrainian authorities are fascist-inspired and aim to suppress the heavily ethnic Russian population in the east.","Megapolis Kurort believes they can cash in on the unrest in Ukraine .

"His wife called him 'nuts' for setting a $1 reserve price on their property, but the unexpected strategy paid off for Neil Tyagi- who sold his house in a Valentines Day auction for a well-earned $565,000. The 33-year-old transport worker listed the surprising reserve price for his house at 230 Blacktown Road, Blacktown just for fun to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to the auction. Mr Tyagi told Daily Mail Australia that he had been slightly worried about the prospect of his four-bedroom two-bathroom home actually being whipped off the market for $1, but said he would just have to deal with it if it had happened. Neil Tyagi set a reserve price of $1 on his property- but it sold for a respectable $565,000 . 'I won't have a choice if it does sell for $1, we're going to have to cut our losses and let it go,' he said. Luckily for the transport worker, and his family, the property sold after about 20 bids for the respectable sum of $565,000- only $5000 more than the asking price. While Mr Tyagi said that the family was over the moon to have sold the property, and for a fair amount more than $1, they were also quite relieved. 'We're all very tired ... all we're thinking about is lunch,' Mr Tyagi told Domain. He said that all the attention the auction had attracted made the day more exciting. 'That's what you want at an auction, the excitement... But we didn't think people would be so interested!' The lucky new owner, Aishwani Sharma, said that he had actually known the family for many years, and wanted to offer a fair price for the property. After the opening bid of $1, the auction quickly jumped to $30, then to $10,000, before Mr Sharms jumped in with his first offer of $400,000. The house at 230 Blacktown Road, Blacktown was originally purchased for $300,000 . Despite his family telling him he was 'nuts' Mr Tyagi said he wanted to do something memorable . 'It was taking to long - and I brought my cheque book,' he explained. Mr Sharma said the property would be a Valentine's Day surprise for his wife, who wasn't at the auction. Mr Tyagi earlier told Daily Mail Australia that he and his wife Maria never wanted to sell the house in the first place. When their circumstances changed and they were forced to put the house up for auction, Mr Tyagi saw it as an opportunity to have some fun. 'We didn't really want to sell the property in the first place so when it came about that we did have to sell and we said we might as well do something different, something special.' The couple bought their 576 square metre house in 2004 for $300,000 and hoped to sell for between $500,000 and $600,000. 'My family think I'm crazy, my wife thinks I'm nuts,' Mr Tyagi said. Mr Tyagi's agent Raj Bhandari said he had been completely shocked when his client called him asking him to set the reserve for the house at $1. The 33-year-old transport worker wanted his house in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1 . The couple bought their 576 square metre house in 2004 for $300,000 and hope to sell for between $500,000 and $600,000 . Despite his agent telling him it was a bad idea, Mr Tyagi went ahead with his plan, claiming he wanted to do something special and believes he will make a huge profit . 'I said noone has done it in NSW, I said mate that's not a good idea but he decided to do it anyway,' Mr Bhandari told Daily Mail Australia. 'He's a businessman and he believes that setting a $1 reserve will create more competition and he may achieve a higher price than what the property could sell for.' Mr Bhandari said he hasn't slept since Mr Tyagi's bizarre request and revealed that he and his team had been working around the clock to ensure they weren't left 'left red-faced' following the February 14 auction. Mr Tyagi said earlier that he knew the risks involved but believes he had a good chance of making a profit due to the booming property market. 'There's a fair bit of buyers in the market  and we're hoping to achieve a fair price for us and for the buyers. We're not expecting something that's above market price but we're hoping we can achieve something fair.' he said.

"A family has been awarded a million dollar payout after shocking undercover footage revealed their mother was being abused in her care home. Eryetha Mayberry, 96, had dementia and was living at Quail Creek Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Oklahoma when her daughters Doris, Earlene and Sandra suspected that caretakers were stealing from her. They installed hidden cameras that collected footage of employees manhandling the grandmother by shoving latex gloves into her mouth and hitting her head. After seeing the footage, the family filed a civil lawsuit, and Friday the nursing home was found guilty of negligence, and the family was awarded $1.2 million in compensation, according to Fox23. Eryetha Mayberry, 96, had dementia and was living at Quail Creek Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center in Oklahoma. The grandmother was shown in footage having latex gloves forced into her mouth by caretaker Lucy Waithira Gakunga (above Mayberry sitting left as Gakunga, right, shoves gloves into her mouth) Footage also showed staff pushing Mayberry's her head to make her lie down (above) A few months after the footage surfaced, Mayberry (above) passed away in July 2012 . Gakunga (left) has since been convicted for abuse by caretaker in the case and was also fired. Her colleague Caroline Kaseke (right) was also caught on tape watching the incident involving the gloves. She was subsequently fired and still has a warrant for her arrest . The family also assisted in passing the POLO Act, a law allowing cameras inside of rooms at nursing homes, according to News9. Following the incident three years ago, caretakers Lucy Waithira Gakunga and Caroline Kaseke were subsequently fired from the home and turned over to police. The video footage that was handed over to police allegedly showed Gakunga shoving latex gloves into Mayberry's mouth and forcibly holding them there while Kaseke watched, according to NewsOK. Daughters Doris, Earlene and Sandra (above) suspected that caretakers were stealing from their mother and installed undercover cameras in her room . The nursing home has been found guilty of negligence and the family was awarded a $1.2million compensation (above Mayberry and two of her daughters) The family filed a civil lawsuit against the nursing home (above) which reached a federal court room . Gakunga has since been convicted for abuse by caretaker and Kaseke still has warrant for her arrest. A few months after the footage surfaced, Mayberry passed away in July 2012. Daughter Doris Racher, said: 'All in the memory of our mother. All of us fought hard and are just happy that now we can relax a little bit, and mother's probably smiling.' 'I'm so glad and grateful for the outcome, because we told the truth, and the truth always prevails,' she added. Attorneys for the facility said the family was awarded too much money as the care home is only worth $2.8million, and that the jury misapplied the law and granted an excessive award of damages. Attorneys for Quail Creek Nursing home said they will appeal the verdict to the tenth circuit if they find it necessary.

"Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has accused the United States of plotting to blow up the presidential palace in an attempted coup. On Thursday, the South American country arrested a retired air force general and 13 other people who were allegedly trying to overthrow the socialist government. In a statement which has been dismissed by American officials as 'ridiculous', Maduro addressed national television to accuse the United States of trying to curry favor with the revolutionaries. 'It is the government of the United States that is behind the plans of destabilization and coups against Venezuela. I have come here to denounce it,' Maduro said in a televised address on Thursday. Accusations: President Nicolas Maduro addressed the nation to say the United States tried to overthrow him . 'We have dismantled a coup attempt against democracy, against the stability of our homeland. 'It was an attempt to use a group of officials from the air force to provoke a violent act, an attack.' It has been a year since violent protests broke out in the streets of Caracas. Venezuela's government has frequently alleged coup plots, often without providing much evidence or follow up. Congress president Diosdado Cabello said in a television broadcast that 11 soldiers were among those implicated, including a retired general, and that several had been arrested. He also named two opposition politicians and a businessman as plotters and charged that the U.S had tried to buy the loyalty of air force officers. Cabello showed photos of weapons and other items that he said had been seized from those implicated. In addition to the palace, the plotters planned to bomb the Defense Ministry and the headquarters of the government-sponsored news channel Telesur, officials charged. On Friday, the military's top leadership denounced the purported coup in a nationally televised news conference. Opposition coalition spokesman Jesus Torrealba rejected the claim of a plot. 'The government makes up these stories about coups to avoid talking about how the country is breaking down,' he told a group of journalists. Government opponents also complained about what they said is the continuing harassment of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been jailed since last February for his role in leading protests that resulted in more than 40 deaths. An opposition demonstrator prepares to throw a molotov cocktail at police after clashes broke out at a protest in Caracas on Thursday as Venezuelans marked the anniversary of last year's bloody protest movement . His party, Popular Will, said more than 10 masked men violently raided Lopez's cell early Friday and moved him to an isolation cell as punishment. Human Rights Watch condemned the 'violent attack' and said what it considered reliable sources had confirmed the authenticity of the opposition's account. The Associated Press could not verify the raid, and the government declined to comment. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki also criticized the government's plot charge, calling the accusation 'ludicrous' and saying it was part of a pattern by Venezuela's government of looking for scapegoats as the country's struggles with severe economic problems. 'These efforts reflect a lack of seriousness on the part of the Venezuelan government to deal with the grave situation it faces,' she told reporters in Washington. A study by the Caracas-based newspaper Ultimas Noticias counted 63 allegations of assassination plots from the beginning of the late Hugo Chavez's presidency in 1999 and his death in 2013. The government of Chavez's successor, Maduro, has denounced more than a dozen purported plots since coming to power 15 months ago. Last spring, Maduro announced that three air force generals had been arrested after they were discovered plotting with opposition politicians to overthrow the government. Officials have said nothing about the case since. The most serious recent allegation came in late May, as authorities tried to mop up dissent that led to a three-month wave of deadly anti-government protests. Top officials delivered an hours-long presentation in which they accused a handful of opposition leaders of working with the U.S. ambassador in neighboring Colombia to 'annihilate' Maduro. Those who believe the government are quick to recall Washington's endorsement of a coup that toppled Chavez for two days in 2002. Chavez himself rose to fame when he helped lead an unsuccessful coup in 1992 as a young military officer.","President Nicolas Maduro said the U.S. is 'trying to destabilize Venezuela'

"A captain involved in a Hong Kong ferry disaster which left 39 partygoers dead - including a British child - has been convicted of manslaughter. Lai Sai-ming was found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter, and also found guilty of endangering the safety of others at sea after a 60 day trial. The accident was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster for more than four decades. Sunk: The pleasure cruiser, carrying 124 people, including three members of staff, went down shortly after 8pm on October 1, 2012 . Trail: A 60 day trial saw Chow Chi-wai, left, skipper of the pleasure cruiser, and ferry captain Lai Sai-ming, right, point the blame at each other . Lai was captain of the Kowloon Ferry's Sea Smooth, which collided with the pleasure cruiser Lamma IV near the island of Lamma, around two miles south west of Hong Kong island, in October 2012. The Lamma IV - which had 124 people on board, including three staff members - was taking a group out to watch the fireworks. The fireworks were part of a celebration for China's national day. But the two boats collided, and the pleasure cruiser sank shortly after the ferry collided with it at about 8pm, leaving 39 dead, including eight children, and more than 100 needing hospital treatment. At the time, it was reported a British child was among the dead. The high-speed ferry managed to make it back to shore. The Lamma IV's skipper, Chow Chi-wai, had also been accused of manslaughter, but was cleared by the same jury after 35 hours of deliberation, the South China Morning Post reported. But he was found guilty of endangering lives of others at sea. Devastating: The sinking was the worst maritime disaster to take place in Hong Kong waters since 1971 . Death toll: A total of 39 people died, including eight children. At the time, it was widely reported one of the children was a Brit . Both men had pleaded not guilty to all charges, and had pointed the finger of blame at each other during the trial. Chow's lawyer refused to comment after the hearing, while Lai's lawyer confirmed his client was due to be sentenced on Monday. It was Hong Kong's worst maritime disaster since 1971, but several other incidents since -- including two high-speed ferry accidents which injured scores of passengers and the grounding of a large container ship -- have worried those who cross Hong Kong's waters.","Jury convicts ferry captain Lai Sai-ming of manslaughter after 60 day trial .

"Boxing champion Tyson Fury tried to fend off two police patrolmen who stopped his new car by exclaiming: 'I'm a superstar - I'm going to report you for jealousy.' The 26-year-old heavyweight  who was with his three children in a green Mitsubishi Shogun was so annoyed by traffic on the M6 that he decided to shoot along the hard shoulder. Traffic officers driving in a BMW X5 noticed the sportsman sneaking along the emergency-only lane and pulled him over. Scroll down for video . Heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury, pictured, told police that they were jealous when they stopped him from driving along the hard shoulder of the motorway in his £40,000 Mitsubishi, which was not insured . Highway Agency staff spotted boxer Tyson Fury driving on the hard shoulder, pictured, on CCTV . CCTV cameras followed Fury as he continued to drive along the hard shoulder avoiding traffic . When asked for his name, Fury, who is the WBO heavyweight champion said: ''I'm a boxer, I'm a superstar, I'm a celebrity'. Officers informed Fury, who is named after the former heavyweight champion 'Iron' Mike Tyson, that he was going to be booked for the offence, he replied: 'Good... I'm going to report you to the the police for jealousy.' However, officers then discovered that the £40,000 vehicle was uninsured and ordered Fury to hand over the keys. The boxer initially refused to the request but eventually said he would arrange to recover the car from the police pound. Details of the exchange emerged at Preston Magistrates' court where Fury, from Heysham was convicted of careless driving and having no insurance. He was not in court claiming he was 'bedridden' with diarrhoea. He was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £360 in costs. His licence which already has three points was endorsed with a further eight penalty points. The incident occurred on 18 April 2014 after Fury was spotted at around 1:30pm on the hard shoulder of the M61 near Walton-le- Dale where there had been a build up of traffic on the northbound carriageway. He took a slip road before entering the M6 heading Northbound towards Bamber Bridge where again used the hard shoulder to pass slow moving traffic. Eventually the boxer is pulled over by the Highways Agency who ask him why he's using the hard shoulder . The Highway Agency staff warned Fury about driving on the hard shoulder, but he continued to use the emergency lane and was eventually stopped by police who had been alerted . Miss Philippa Jones prosecuting said: 'Quite simply Mr Fury is seen to be travelling along the hard shoulder of the motorway. He is initially stopped by the Highway Agency they stopped him, spoke with him and allowed him on his way. Instead of proceeding onto the motorway he continues his travels on the hard shoulder. The traffic was extremely heavy. I'm going to suggest there is only one reason - to bypass all the traffic. It falls below the standard of driving.' PC Julian Berry who was travelling with a colleague on mobile duty in a BMW X5 Road Policing car told the court they had received information from the regional control centre about Fury's car. He said: 'We were informed by the motorway control room, they were watching the vehicle on CCTV travelling along the hard shoulder of the M61 in what they believed to be an attempt to bypass standard traffic on what was a busy afternoon. We were given the registration number.' He added that they located Fury and were also given a second account as Fury again took onto the hard shoulder to bypass traffic. He told the court that they waited for Fury at Junction 32 of the M6 as Fury continued his journey north and passed under them. The officers stopped Fury near Garstang. PC Berry added: 'He told us his name was Tyson Fury. He gave us an '88 date of birth and address in Morecambe. There was no insurance held for the vehicle he was driving. When asked about this he told us his vehicle had just been bought from Manchester and believed he was driving as a named driver on a traders policy.' The boxer, pictured, was fined £1,000 and handed eight points on his driving licences after he was convicted of careless driving and driving without insurance at Preston Magistrates Court . But PC Berry said that despite producing a policy there was a discrepancy and that he was not in fact a named driver on that vehicle. 'When I told him he was been reported he replied with 'good'. He also said 'I'm a boxer, I'm a superstar, I'm a celebrity'. 'He asked for mine and my colleague's numbers and said he was going to report us to the police for jealousy.' He added that there were no other adults in the car but that there had been Fury's three children who he believe were eight, nine and 10. PC Berry added: 'The vehicle was seized and Mr Fury was obstructive. Initially he refused to hand over the keys and said he would organise his own recovery.' The court was played moving footage from the Regional Control Centre for the North West Motorway Police which is operated manually. Fury denied wrongdoing and tried to get the trial delayed due to his illness. His lawyer James Ball told the hearing: 'He is bedridden, a manager or agent of Mr Fury (contacted) saying that his client is effectively bedridden, suffering with diarrhoea and vomiting. A medical note dated yesterday says he is not fit for work and he must stay away from work until 48 hours after the last loose motions.' But the request was refused after it emerged the boxer made another attempt to get the case adjourned earlier in the week - claiming he was in training for next fight. District Judge Roger Lowe said: 'There's a difference between being unfit for work and being unfit for court. I don't feel the symptoms would have prevented him from being fit for court. The court would have been quite accommodating, any difficulties part way through the court could break halfway through for him to use the facilities.' He added: 'Footage shows the vehicle being driven along the hard shoulder of the motorway. clearly it is only for emergencies - it seems pretty obvious he is doing so to avoid slowing, standing traffic. There is no evidence he is driving in an emergency situation. 'There are no other adults in the car just the defendant and three children. I'm satisfied he is driving. I find the offence proved. 'PC Berry examined the documents, they didn't appear to cover Mr Fury. In the absence of any evidence provided, I find that the allegation against the defendant is proved.' Fury is currently preparing to defend his European Heavyweight Championship title at the O2 Arena on February 28, and is set to fight for the English Title on April 4.","Boxer Tyson Fury tried to dodge motorway traffic using the hard shoulder .

"A mother who tricked Seattle Children's doctors into operating unnecessarily on her young daughter will be allowed to get mental health help and avoid jail. Carmen Boyce, 35, of Kenmore, Washington, went so far as to force one young daughter to throw up when doctors weren't looking in an effort to convince them that the little girl couldn't keep food down, authorities say. Ms Boyce will not be jailed as long as she sticks with her mental health treatment and abides by the terms of the no-contact order and avoids new trouble with the law. But she will likely be ordered to pay for counseling for her daughters. The Washington state mother was convicted of battery after she claimed for years that her daughters were suffering from severe health problems and even convinced doctors to perform unnecessary surgery, prosecutors said. Scroll down for video . Carmen Boyce, 35, has now lost custody of both of her children after prosecutors accused her of forcing them to endure unnecessary medical treatments . After repeated trips to Seattle Children's Hospital over claims that her oldest daughter wasn't eating, Ms Boyce insisted that surgeons insert a feeding tube into her stomach through an invasive procedure called ercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, according to court documents. Doctors at Children's Hospital claim they were convinced Boyce's pleas were truthful and went ahead with the procedure on the girl, who was three years old at the time. However, prosecutors claim that both of Boyce's daughters were perfectly healthy all along - except for their mothers' meddling. When the girls, now age four and six, were removed from Boyce's custody, they exhibited no health problems at all. Boyce has furiously fought the charges, hiring a top Seattle criminal defense attorney who battled the case for nearly two years. On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor fourth-degree domestic assault - but admitted no wrongdoing, saying only that prosecutors likely had enough evidence to win a jury conviction. Boyce pleaded guilty, but refused to admit wrongdoing. She has avoided jail . She will avoid jail, but must undergo psychiatric treatment. Prosecutors also recommended that she have no unsupervised contact with either of her daughters. Prosecutors had charged Boyce with second-degree assault of a child - a felony that would likely have carried a three-year prison term for Boyce - as well as fourth-degree assault. In motions filed by her attorney, David Allen, Boyce argued that the behavior that led to her arrest in May 2013 was the result of a misunderstanding by doctors and a witness. Both Boyce and Allen declined to comment for this story. She was arrested after a parent of another patient at Children's Hospital, who happens to be a nurse, reported to hospital staffer the Boyce appeared to induce vomiting in her young daughter during a visit, authorities say. Boyce had taken the girl to the hospital and told doctors that she wasn't eating and could not keep food down. According to prosecutors, the witness saw Boyce throw her daughter over her knee and tickle her until she lost control and vomited.","Carmen Boyce, 35, will have to undergo mental health help but will avoid jail .

"Move over Barbie Bus, this weekend it is the Purple Godiva – my dark metallic purple V8 Jaguar Sovereign with Ukip yellow 'go faster' battle stripes – that is hitting the Election campaign trail. Still, after Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman's lipstick-pink 'Woman to Woman' minibus so spectacularly backfired on its launch last week, I thought it would be wise to consult my wife Laura about my own campaign slogan before the Jag was delivered to a Wolverhampton firm for its Ukip makeover. 'Anything but Man to Man, Vote for Cash,' she replied sharply. Ukip's head of policy, Suzanne Evans, suggested 'North Warwickshire needs Cash' – in reference to the constituency I'll be fighting for Ukip in May.

'What on earth is that?' she exclaimed. Well, it proves the car is eye-catching… . And yes, the postman will find it bizarre to pull up next to two campaign battle wagons, both saying 'Vote for Cash' – only decked out in different political colours. The only other piece of advice my mother gave me was to take the slogans off when not in the constituency I'll be fighting. 'Voters get confused about names. That's why politicians use magnets, so they can take them off easily.' Then we walked outside and inspected my new vehicle. Despite being built in 1998, the car is was what the trade refer to as 'immaculate'. The classic car ad that caught my eye ran: 'Very rare purple metallic with cream leather. Top-of-the-range model with all the usual refinements expected. Needs to be seen and driven to appreciate the condition.' As my mother admired the sleek Jaguar lines and finest English hide upholstery, did I detect I tinge of campaign car jealously? Back-fired: Will Cash says the pink bus Deputy Labour Leader Hariet Harman used in a bid to get women voting 'spectacularly backfired' The search had not been easy. I nearly bought a silver 1987 Jaguar Sovereign from a dealer in the New Forest. It was advertised for just £950, which made me slightly nervous. When I got inside, I understood why. The polished mahogany dashboard had half curled off, the steering wheel was off-kilter and, the indicators didn't work. Such an Arthur Daley-style rust-heap wasn't going to fit the bill. Finally, I tracked this one down to Blackpool, being sold by a former hotel owner. He had decided that parking his 'Turkish Delight' in central Blackpool was asking for trouble. 'There are pubs which open at 9am and so many people are just layabouts,' he said as we cruised along the seafront where many shops and bars were boarded up. He wanted £2,450 but we settled at £2,075. The Jag is not a rich man's car. The car is now named after Lady Godiva, who rode through Coventry naked to get her husband to abolish high taxes in the 11th Century. As my party's tourism spokesman, I'll be using the Jag to tour the countryside and coastal regions of Britain, to promote more visits to our hidden gems. But as much as I am opposed to higher taxes, I cannot promise my wife will be inside naked. The owner of Harriet Harman's much mocked 'Barbie Bus' could face a £1,000 fine for not registering the makeover with the authorities. The Ford Transit, right, is licensed with the DVLA as being white, but for the 'Woman To Woman' campaign it has been given a pink vinyl wrap. The Mail on Sunday was told by the DVLA that the owner of the van hired by Labour to tour constituencies could face prosecution for the change in colour, for which its V5C log book should have been amended. A spokesman added that they may face no action if the change was 'temporary' but could not specify up to how long that might be. The bus is due to remain pink for three months until the General Election in May. Labour said the bus was hired from a rental company, which officials declined to name, but added: 'We've informed them. It's up to them to talk to the DVLA.'","Ukip's tourism spokesperson hits the election trail in Jaguar Sovereign .

"As the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty. While Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime. Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge. But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reports. Scroll down for video . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali . This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug. When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39. But while the Australians' judicial review were rejected, in Gunwan's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax. His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution. The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran who are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed. Sukumaran and Chan are expected to be taken to Nusa Kambangan, where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation . A general view shows the death island of Nusa Kambangan island, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed . From there they will be given 72 hours' notice of their execution by firing squad. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers. 'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said. 'My plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas.' Australia has not decided how it would respond to the executions, including whether to withdraw its ambassador, but Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph newspaper: 'We will find ways of making our displeasure known.' Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on Monday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers . A date for the executions won't be provided at the meeting, but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed, as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage. Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir says officials representing Ghana, France, the Philippines and Nigeria have also been summoned. When Indonesia executed five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before Attorney-General HM Prasetyo announced the execution date. That announcement signalled the 72-hour notice period. But in this case, the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over Indonesia to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . Indonesian police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan . Authorities have permission to move Chan and Sukumaran from Bali's Kerobokan jail, but haven't set a date. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Friday suggested the depth of feeling in Australia is so strong that Australians may boycott Indonesia if the executions go ahead, but she denied that she was urging for a boycott. 'I knew that there was very deep concern in the Australian public about the likely executions of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan, and that Australians will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told Macquarie Radio on Saturday. Death-row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran's sister Brintha Sukumaran, left, and his mother Raji Sukumaran, right, have been visiting him every day . Andrew Chan mother's Helen Chan arrives to visit her son at Kerobokan prison on Thursday . Boycott calls were growing on social media before Ms Bishop's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions. Ms Bishop's opposition counterpart Tanya Plibersek told the Seven Network she didn't think this was helpful. 'I'm really not sure that boycotting Bali is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in Jakarta,' Ms Plibersek said. Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search. Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad. Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . In this photo taken on August 17, 2010, convicted Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran (L) and Andrew Chan (R) gesture as they sit inside Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali . Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday. 'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said 'no'. He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio. The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids. Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail. Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.

"It’s the house where virtually nothing is in a straight line. But although it may look like something out of The Hobbit, for the past 13 years it has been the perfect cosy sanctuary for millionaire Peter Saunders. Set against the slate-grey mountains of Snowdonia in North Wales, it’s not surprising that so many people do a double-take when they first see the house near the village of Llanegryn. ‘They usually stand outside looking stunned,’ admits Saunders, 64, who had the house built. ‘Many assume it’s some kind of strange ancient farmhouse, which is a simple mistake to make because it looks so comfortable in its surroundings.’ Natural look: Cynefin, set against Snowdonia, took three years to complete thanks to its complex design . Saunders went to enormous trouble to capture this natural look, interviewing six architects before finding the one who impressed him. That was Christopher Day, a sculptor with a keen interest in ecology. ‘I loved his philosophy that a well-designed building should have a sense of soul,’ explains Saunders. Realising this vision, though, was no small task, with the property – called Cynefin – taking three years to create. Whereas normal houses are variations on a box shape, this one is all bends and soft corners, with very few right angles. Its geometry is very complex: walls melt into the ceilings, skirting boards are often curved, and the roof zigzags into peaks and slopes. Determined: Millionaire businessman Peter Saunders went to enormous trouble to capture the house's natural look, interviewing six architects before finding the one who impressed him . ‘The interior owes everything to the carpenter, Dafydd Davies-Hughes,’ says Saunders. ‘He enjoyed the work because it gave him the opportunity to think outside the box. I’d say, “What would you do if you really could?” and he’d come up with answers.’ Following a hunch and backing his instincts is typical of Saunders, who in business terminology is a ‘dragon’ – someone who buys and improves firms before selling and moving on. Price: £985,000 . Location: Llanegryn, Wales . Bedrooms: Five . Unique features: Bespoke ‘wonky’ design, Welsh ash staircase, spectacular views of Snowdonia . He set up his first such venture, Halo Foods, a company selling healthy snacks, in the 1970s. Initially with a workforce of just five, he developed it over six years before selling it to Rowntree. Later, when Halo was threatened with closure, he bought it back, then sold out for a second time in 2004, by which time he had 500 people on the payroll. He is reluctant to talk about his wealth but it is obviously considerable. A noted philanthropist, he has given more than £400,000 to local causes in the past ten years. Everything about Cynefin’s interior feels bespoke. Open the front door and you find a rounded reception hall, with a superb Welsh ash staircase leading up to a gallery. The ground floor is built into the natural terrain, so the living room area is on a split level, with French windows opening on to terraces from which there are gorgeous views. Well rounded: The property has a stunning hall with a Welsh ash staircase and offers spectacular views of Snowdonia . There are two bedrooms on the ground floor – one with steps leading to a mezzanine sleeping area above a study, the other more conventional in layout. There are three more bedrooms upstairs, all with their own individually designed bathrooms. However, it is Cynefin’s location that is its main attraction. It nestles amid hillocks, with the mountains of southern Snowdonia as a backdrop. The house has received many plaudits, notably from Sir Simon Jenkins, the former National Trust chairman, who described it as ‘an outstanding example of British craftsmanship in wood’. Saunders and his wife Judith, 64, have enjoyed good times here. Apart from family get-togethers with his three sons, it was while living here that he became involved in his most satisfying business venture to date. Called Sure Chill, it is a medical refrigeration company that helps keep vaccines in top condition, even in areas with erratic power supplies. It is a project that should save millions of lives in years to come – hence the involvement of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose charitable foundation is heavily involved in healthcare overseas. ‘It has been a wonderful house – like living inside a sculpture,’ says Saunders, who is selling for £985,000. ‘But now I want to move to the Cardiff or Monmouth area where our sons, their wives and our grandchildren live.’ struttandparker.com, 01743 284200 .","Peter Saunders went to great lengths to have extraordinary house built .

"Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made comments suggesting that her son Jeb could be president, backtracking on previous remarks that America has 'had enough Bushes' in the White House. The Republican matriarch appeared via Skype at a literacy charity fundraiser event her second oldest son was holding for the Barbara Bush Foundation in Bonita Springs, Florida, where he used to be governor. 'Jeb, it’s Mom. Listen, what do you mean, ‘too many Bushes’?... I changed my mind!' she said, according to the Washington Post. Scroll down for video . Barbara Bush (left) gave her blessing to son Jeb (right) to run for president in a video exchange. Above, the two attend a Barbara Bush Foundation event together on an unknown date . The former First Lady (right, 2010) said she had changed her mind about previous comments she made suggesting that her son  (left) should not run for president because there had been 'enough Bushes' in the White House . Bush had brought up his mother's statement in 2013, when she told NBC's Matt Lauer that there were other qualified candidates besides her children, right before she appeared via video link. 'Hey mom, can I get that in writing by the way,' the younger Bush, who has announced he is 'seriously considering' running for the presidency in 2016, said. Barbara Bush, 89, who appeared next to former president George H W Bush, said, 'Our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America.' Jeb Bush replied, 'Mother, I love you. You’re the greatest mother in the world.' Jeb Bush, who has announced he is 'seriously considering' running for president, referenced his mother's 'enough Bushes' comment before she appeared and walked the remark back . Barbara Bush responded candidly that she did not think Jeb should run for president in an April, 2013 interview on NBC . Other Bushes, such as former First Lady Laura (in blue dress) supported a potential Jeb candidacy in 2013. Above (from left), Mr Lauer, Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Pierce Bush . Late last year the potential candidate's mother said that she had shifted her position on Jeb running to 'neutral'. She said her previous comments about 'enough Bushes,' which were in direct response to a question about Jeb running for president, were to clarify that the political family does not feel a 'sense of entitlement', according to Bloomberg. The last several weeks since Jeb's announcement that he is looking at the presidency have seen him begin raising money for his super PAC Right to Rise. Events have included a $100,000 a plate fundraiser in New York at the home of billionaire Harry Kravis on Wednesday. A Bush family photo includes (top row, from left) Neil, Jeb with son George P, George H W, George W, Laura, (bottom row) Jeb's wife Columba with daughter Noelle, Dorothy, Barbara and Marvin . Jeb Bush, seen in 2012 with Columba, has been holding high profile fundraising events for his super PAC, Right to Rise . The former governor has become the presumptive front runner for the Republican nomination after 2012 candidate Mitt Romney said he would not run again. One problem for Bush is the  legacy of his older brother George W Bush, especially two wars that he began in Afghanistan and Iraq during his presidency. Prepping for a foreign policy speech next week in Chicago, Jeb Bush said 'I won't talk about the past' in response to a question about the wars. 'If I'm in the process of considering the possibility of running, it's not about re-litigating anything in the past.' The front runner status of both Bush and likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton have raised the idea that the 2016 election will be fought between their two powerful political families. Jeb Bush will have to answer questions about his brother George W (pictured) and the two wars that began during his presidency .","Barbara Bush, 89, had said American had 'enough Bushes' in White House .

"Remorse: The Syrian boyfriend of Mueller, pictured, posted the message online after her captivity and death became public . Kayla Mueller's Syrian boyfriend wrote a remorseful heart-wrenching message after her death became public apologizing for not doing more to save her. The man, a Syrian photographer who has not been named for fear of his safety, posted the message online after Mueller's death in the hands of ISIS captors became public. According to friends, the 33-year-old man was taken to prison alongside her but was later freed. He then staged a desperate, single-handed rescue attempt, but failed to secure her release. In a long account of Mueller's life published by the Arizona Republic, it is revealed that he posed as her husband and tried to secure her release - but the plan was foiled when Mueller said she was unmarried. The couple had reportedly often described themselves as husband and wife while traveling through Syria and neighboring Turkey to suit the countries' conservative attitudes. A spokesman for the family confirmed the couple had been together since around the end of 2013, though they met as early as 2010. In the message, posted to a public Facebook account, he man wrote: ''Dear Kayla, I'm not writing her to say goodbye, this is a thank you. 'Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. '(Y)ou supported me in everything I did, even if it was extremely stupid. ... l'm writing to tell you l'm sorry about so many things. I'm sorry l didn't 't take better care of you...

'I'm sorry I didn't try harder to find the words, to tell you what I was feeling. And how much I loved you..' Two two were captured together in August 2013 on the road to Aleppo, despite repeated warnings. Previously published accounts of her final journey told how the boyfriend had just fixed the internet connection at a Doctors Without Borders outpost when they were captured by jihadists. By September, the boyfriend had been freed, and had posted on Facebook about his capture. According to the Republic, he said: 'Now i am free and free and free... Thank you for everyone who asked about me. Killed: ISIS claims that Mueller was being held in this prison building when it was hit by an airstrike, killing her . Rescue attempt: The man was freed while Mueller remained captured - but returned in an attempt to save her . 'Sorry for not contacting each one of u. Im very tired now. I'll be online later inshallah [God willing]. Thank u for your love.' He is thought not to have mentioned or acknowledged her publicly online while she was in captivity, for fear it could affect negotiations over her release. However, shortly after he is said to have posted the following poem on his account, apparently in reference to Mueller. 'My heart is in your detention cell . 'its lives your pain all day . 'you are not alone . 'you are not alone' Mustafa Abbas, a Syrian TV journalist, told the Republic that he headed back into Syrian in late 2013 in the hope of rescuing her.

"A man who was sexually abused by paedophile weatherman Fred Talbot has spoken of the torment of watching his abuser  on television for decades before seeing him brought to justice. The former ITV presenter was convicted of a string of offences yesterday after jurors heard how he coerced young boys into simulating naked orgies on school trips in the 1970s and 80s. He was remanded in custody after being found guilty of two sexual assaults against two boys and faces up to ten years in jail when sentenced next month. Another 20 alleged assaults, said to have taken place in Scotland, are being investigated. Scroll down for video . One of Fred Talbot's victims has spoken of how he used to 'pray' the weatherman would fall into the water while presenting on ITV's This Morning from his floating map at Liverpool's Albert Dock . Talbot presented the weather for years after having abused boys during his time as a biology teacher . Now one of his victims has spoken of the horror of having to see the 65-year-old enjoy national acclaim as the once-beloved face of This Morning's weather for years after enduring his depravity. The man, now in his fifties, is one of five to have had their cases heard at Manchester Crown Court. Just a young boy when he was attacked by the former teacher, he has told of watching a seemingly care-free Talbot hop between the floating platforms of his weather map at Liverpool's Albert Dock for years before seeing him prosecuted. 'If I ever caught him on TV I prayed he would fall off that floating map into the water,' he told the Sun's Lauren Veevers. 'I felt sick by the sight of him...everyone thought he was a fun weatherman. 'But I had this shocking secret I knew.' During the trial, in which jurors dismissed another eight counts of indecent assault, it was revealed Talbot abused boys while supervising school trips on boats. Guilty: Television weatherman Fred Talbot has today been convicted of abusing two schoolboys and faces jail . On one occasion he told a group to strip naked and simulate an orgy while he took photographs. The attacks were documented in a personal diary kept by Talbot, with the days on which each took place marked with an asterisk. In a separate incident, Talbot told one boy to 'leave room for him in the middle of the bed' as there weren't 'enough bunk beds to go around'. The boy, who told jurors he was around 14 at the time, said it was then the former teacher performed a sex act on him. 'He said this is natural and this is how men touch other men, because I didn't know what was going on.' Later, he told the boys never to speak of what had happened on the trip and that it was 'their secret'. Another victim was abused on another barge trip in similar circumstances. He said that boys would take turns to sleep in Talbot's bed during the trip and when it was his turn the defendant 'started talking to me about sexual stuff'. Talbot then began to indecently assault him and the schoolboy told him to stop, the court was told. The complainant - who thought he may have been aged 14 at the time - said the defendant persisted and he kept pulling Talbot's hand away. He said: 'I was a very naive child and I couldn't really understand it.' The complainant said when he was aged in his late 20s he wrote to ITV Granada to tell them Talbot had abused him. He said: 'I wrote an anonymous letter to Granada Reports but obviously they could not act on it. 'It was just to say that I had been sexually assaulted on an occasion by this man. I think I was a bit angry at the time'. Talbot's perverted tendencies were spurred on by alcohol, he claimed in is diary, writing: 'I must drink less as the situation is getting out of hand. Paedophile: Talbot was said to have been 'obsessed' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and 'could not help himself' around them when under the influence of drink . Abuse: The former This Morning star, left outside court, got drunk and attacked the teenagers on school trips on a canal boat, right, while he was teaching in the 1970s and now faces jail . Problem: This entry describes his struggle with drink where he said he 'must drink less' because when 'I am drunk I do and say things I later regret' Chilling: Talbot dressed as Gary Glitter (left). The singer has been convicted of indecency against children . 'When I am drunk I say and do things I later regret.' When questioned by police, Talbot claimed the asterisks stood for panic attacks. The diary entries were used as evidence in the trial, brought to a dramatic pause when the paedophile gashed his forehead after falling over. Among witnesses testifying against the disgraced teacher was Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, one of his former pupils. Recalling his time at the school where Talbot taught, he said: 'Very early at school, I would not have been there a long time, Mr Talbot asked all the class if any of us had ever masturbated. 'He went on to explain how to masturbate, how you should masturbate and the following lesson he asked who had masturbated.' Yesterday Talbot was remanded in custody as the jury found him guilty of two counts of indecent assault against two boys. He was cleared of another eight, but told by a judge that his crimes were so serious he would be held until sentencing. It comes as police are investigating fresh claims of abuse said to have been carried out by the man in Scotland. It was revealed that one of his victims had reported him to police several times in the 1990s though nothing was done.

"The friend of a bigamist who pretended his first marriage was over claims he had also been duped after he was asked to be best man at both weddings. Mark Stapleton, 47, said he was 'shocked' to find out that friend of 20 years, Adrian Linham, had lied about divorcing his first wife and went on to marry another woman. The 43-year-old had been dating Hayley Totterdell for three years and secretly splitting his time between there and his marital home with loyal wife of seven years Liz, 37, near Bristol. Scroll down for video . Mark Stapleton (left) was best man at both weddings and claims friend of 20 years, Adrian Linham (right), had told him he divorced wife Liz two years before his new marriage . He told wife Liz he was working in Bangor, north Wales for his job as a scuba diving instructor but he was actually living just 16 miles away with Hayley. Mr Stapleton claims he was also tricked by Linham, who told him that his marriage ended two years prior to his second wedding, and only found out the truth on the day he went to court for bigamy. He told The Sun: 'I didn't know anything about his double life. He has managed to deceive everybody. 'I had asked him about Liz and he had given the impression it was all over. He was so happy when he married Hayley.' Adrian Linham married wife Liz in Weston-Super-Mare in 2007 before the couple honeymooned in Mexico . But after several years of marriage, Linham met Hayley Totterdell, who he then married at the same resort he had visited with his previous wife six years earlier . Linham has now been jailed for 18 weeks for bigamy - but new wife Hayley is sticking by her husband. Mr Stapleton has vowed that he will confront his friend once he is released from prison, after he was given no explanation. 'I've got a lot of unanswered questions. I'd imagine there will be some choice words added in there too,' he said. Liz knew nothing about their secret marriage in Riviera Maya, where they honeymooned following their wedding in 2007, until she saw photographs of her husband on Facebook. She received a letter from her mother-in-law saying she was sorry to see they had divorced and that Linham had remarried. Liz has spoken of the extent of Linham's lies after he was jailed for bigamy this week . She then went on to say that she had been on Facebook and seen Linham's wedding pictures to Hayley and hoped that his new marriage hadn't affected her too much. Liz then went online and found dozens of pictures of her grinning husband embracing his new bride - on the same beach where they went on honeymoon. Linham has two children from a previous partner and one with Liz, while Hayley has two children from a previous husband. Mother-of-one Liz said: 'I didn't think stuff like this happened in real life and I certainly didn't think it would ever happen to me. 'I genuinely didn't know what was going on. I never thought for a moment that he'd gone and married someone else. 'It has completely altered the way I look at everyone. I look at people now, who I have known and trusted for years, and think ""can I really trust you?"".' Liz and Adrian met at his brother's wedding in 2000 and became an item in July 2006 after he divorced his first wife. They got engaged in 2007 and married just months later at Rookery Manor in Somerset before jetting off to Riviera Maya in Mexico for their honeymoon. But throughout their relationship, Linham would stay at their marital home near Bristol less and less - sometimes coming home as little as once or twice a month. In spite of this Liz thought their marriage was still going strong and she gave up work to look after their daughter, now aged four. 'He would tell me he loved me every day and he'd say how he couldn't be without me,' she said. But she was shocked to discover that he had been leading a double life and had been seeing Hayley Totterdell for more than three years. Liz was aware of Hayley's existence but had been told she was merely the wife of Linham's psychiatrist. Meanwhile Hayley was blissfully unaware that Linham was already married and only found out about his previous marriage when he was arrested. They are believed to have got engaged in August 2012 after he proposed on the same beach where he honeymooned with Liz. Then, in May 2014, Linham told Liz he was going away for a longer stretch in Bangor to oversee exams - but actually flew back to Mexico for his wedding to Hayley. None of Hayley's family knew he was already married. After the wedding Linham returned to the UK and carried on living his double life as if nothing had changed. Liz only found out about the wedding three months later when she received a letter from Linham's mother, who she had not spoken to for a while. 'I got a letter from his mum on 21 August 2014,' she said. 'It said that she was sorry to hear Adrian and I had gotten divorced and that she hoped I was dealing with it ok.' Linham is believed to have got engaged to Hayley (pictured) in 2014, when he proposed on the same beach he and Liz had visited shortly after they were married in 2007 . Neither his not Hayley's family (pictured) were aware of his secret wife at the ceremony at the same resort later that year. Mark Stapleton (second right) was his best man at his second wedding to Hayley . She added: 'It was such a huge shock to me, I went on to Facebook and found the pictures pretty much straight away. 'I didn't read the whole letter - I tore it up into tiny pieces and threw it away, I had just picked out certain parts of the letter. 'Those parts of the letter are still whirling around in my head, especially the bit about ""Mrs Hayley Linham"" - she took his name.' Liz added: 'I called him to confront him but he yet again denied it - I just went into meltdown. 'He totally denied it and told me not to be so silly. But that was it - I haven't spoken to him since. 'It's just been like a total nightmare. I actually remember saying this is the kind of thing you'd read about in the newspapers and magazines.' Liz has since discovered the catalogue of lies which Linham told her in order to conduct his secret double life. She recalled how she waited at home all day one Christmas Day for Linham to return home only for him to arrive late in the evening. Linham told his wife he was away for work but was secreting living at his bride-to-be Hayley's house (pictured) - which is on the other side of Bristol from his marital home with Liz . It later transpired he had spent the day with Hayley before telling her his mother had died in order to duck out and return to his wife. He then returned home to Hayley, describing his mother's funeral in full detail - despite the fact she is still alive. In December 2013 Liz suffered a miscarriage at 7pm one evening but Linham left her by 7am the next morning to go and see Hayley. The love rat also tricked Liz into redecorating Hayley's second home in Swanage, Dorset - asking her to paint the bedroom, and her children's bedrooms, convincing her it was his boss' home. Liz said: 'I'd always known about Hayley but the way he'd speak of her was just ""oh she's loaded, her and her husband have got more money than sense so I do as many jobs as possible at their house to rinse them"". 'He even took me to Hayley's second home in Swanage on two separate occasions, the first time I actually helped him set up for a party he was throwing for her and the second time I helped him redecorate. 'I painted her bedroom and both of her children's bedrooms as he told me it was his bosses house and we could stay there if we painted.' Liz had no idea her husband was seeing another woman and believed their marriage was still going strong . Liz was so furious she reported his actions to the police and he pleaded guilty to one count of bigamy at North Somerset Courthouse in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on Thursday. Chair of the bench, Peter Searle, sentenced Linham to 17 weeks in prison and ordered him to pay £1,000 compensation and put into place a restraining order. He told Linham, who has two children from a previous relationship: 'The length of deception is nothing short of incredible. You have shown no remorse and have humiliated your wife.' Sue Baker, defending, told the court he admitted bigamy when he was arrested and intended to get divorced from his first wife when he returned from the wedding 'but he was putting the cart before the horse'. Linham has now begun divorce proceedings, the court heard.","Mark Stapleton was 'shocked' to discover his best friend was still married .

"A mother teaching her 14-year-old daughter to drive was shot in the head in a road-rage attack and is not expected to survive. Tammy Meyers, 44, is in hospital on life support machines after the shooting in the outskirts of Las Vegas. Police believe the shooter followed 44-year-old Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire. Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday . Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves. Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said. She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. He described the girl as emotionally distraught. Distraught: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 14-year-old daughter who was driving is distraught . Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car. Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said. Investigators were looking for the shooter and at least one other person in the vehicle, Garcia said. Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. Meyers also said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police.

"Support: Prince William is patron of the wildlife charity Tusk . Prince William was last night urged to cancel his visit to a wildlife park in China where elephants are forced to dance, play football and perform degrading circus tricks for crowds of tourists. The Prince, a keen conservationist, is due to round off a solo trip to Japan and China next month with a visit to Wild Elephant Valley in Xishuangbanna. The popular tourist attraction set in a nature reserve is home to some of China’s last remaining wild elephants. William, who is patron of the Tusk wildlife charity, will also see the reserve’s Wild Elephant Walkway, which has been credited with helping to double the wild elephant population in China’s Yunnan province in the past two decades. What the Prince may not realise, however, is that just 400 yards away, captive elephants are forced to perform to thousands of visitors a day in a shoddy arena that draws crowds from across China. Chained by their legs in dingy pens between performances, the wretched-looking elephants go wearily through a routine that involves kicking footballs into a goal, dancing to disco music and forming a pyramid, four times a day. In depressing scenes witnessed by The Mail on Sunday on Friday, one elephant is spun around on a wheel to music while another is made to put on a pair of glasses, before picking a ‘girlfriend’ from the audience and kissing her with its trunk. When the shows are over, the weary elephants – led by handlers carrying bullhooks – take tourists on rides around the arena for £8 a circuit or pick up tourists by their trunks for a few seconds for £4. Most of the performing elephants, which experts say are subjected to brutal ‘breaking’ rituals to tame them, have had their tusks sawn off. One handler explained: ‘We do it to make it safer for people. It also stops the elephants injuring the performers or each other.’ Barbaric: Elephants are forced to perform degrading tricks in an arena that draws crowds from across China . In the breaking rituals, according to animal welfare groups, young elephants are separated from their mothers, and then beaten and deprived of food and water for up to a week to make them subservient to trainers. The shows – Wild Elephant Valley’s biggest draw – are highly lucrative, with up to 15,000 tourists a day paying £6.50 each. Word about Prince William’s visit has spread rapidly among excited park employees. Li Wei, 36, who works as a compere at the elephant shows, said: ‘He is very handsome. I don’t know if he will come to see our show but I hope that I get the chance to meet him.’ Wretched: The animals are chained in pens and have their tusks cut off . In its brochure, the park – which is operated by a tourism company set up by the local government – says the animals used in performances are rescued wild elephants, which have been injured or abandoned in the reserve. The news will alarm animal welfare groups, which believe rescued animals should be released back into the wild. William is due to meet one of four elephants rescued from poachers during his visit on March 4. Yesterday, in the park’s rescue centre, we found a distressed young elephant left alone in a concrete enclosure. Wardens told us it had been rescued after being orphaned in the wild, but refused to say if it was the one William would see, or if it would be trained for the shows. The park declined to answer questions about the Prince’s visit. Louise Rogerson, of the Elephant Asia Rescue and Survival Foundation charity, said: ‘I applaud William for visiting China to address wildlife conservation issues, but do not feel he should be endorsing circus performances involving abused elephants. Any elephant forced to perform is subjected to immeasurable cruelty to do the unnatural tricks it has been trained to do. These barbaric performances should be brought to an end.’ Elephant shows are banned or restricted in 30 countries including Mexico and the Netherlands, which has also introduced total bans on animal performances. The RSPCA is trying to ban them in Britain but legislation has so far been blocked. The number of wild elephants in Yunnan province has reportedly doubled to about 300 in the past few years thanks to the reserve, government-financed feeding programmes and laws which threaten poachers with the death penalty. Excited: Li Wei, 36, who works as a compere at the elephant shows, is hoping the Prince pays a visit . A Royal source said last night: ‘The Duke’s visit is to learn about emerging indigenous Chinese approaches to conservation. His time at Wild Elephant Valley is not to judge or condone, but to gain a greater understanding of the challenges in a part of the world where developments in conservation are critical to the elephants’ survival.’ There was yet more embarrassment for Prince William last night after it emerged that HSBC and PwC – both accused of encouraging tax avoidance – are sponsoring an event he is due to attend on his visit to China. The Prince is set to appear at next month’s The GREAT Festival of Creativity, which is designed to showcase British creativity and business. More than 500 UK companies will use the Shanghai festival, which has been co-ordinated by UK Trade & Industry, to reach a global business audience. Scandal-hit HSBC, which is facing an investigation over allegedly helping customers dodge tax, and consultants PwC, which the Public Accounts Committee said promoted tax avoidance on an ‘industrial scale’, are sponsoring the event. Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: ‘Prince William is in a predicament, or people are putting him in one. ‘Why is he being asked to compromise himself in this way? This conference shows that companies which have worked to undermine the taxation revenue of this country are part of the establishment in this country. The two are inextricably linked.’","Prince is due to visit to Wild Elephant Valley in Xishuangbanna, China .

"A Texas man was convicted of his 10th DWI and will face life in prison for his dangerous actions. Bobby Gene Martin, 64, was found guilty by a jury of driving while intoxicated as well as threatening to kill the officer who arrested and him and go after his family. Jurors were shocked to find that the man already had nine prior convictions and was still driving, Kyle Crowl of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. Bobby Gene Martin, 64, was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences after being arrested for his 10th DWI in August . They were only informed that he had been found guilty of drunk driving at least three other times, enough to make his most recent case a felony. Martin, whose first DWI was in 1981, will be 80 before he is eligible for parole during his two concurrent life sentences. 'I think that resonated with the jury that if no matter what he does, if he ever gets out of jail, he’s going to do it again' Mr Crowl told the Montgomery County Police Reporter. The driver, who was living in Houston during his most recent arrest in August, also threatened a police officer and his family in 1999 and once went on a racist rant towards a jailer. He has previously been sentenced to prison three times for drunk driving, in 1986, 1996 and 1999. The man also served time starting in 2012 for evading arrest with a vehicle. It is unclear whether he attended substance abuse treatment programs either inside or out of jail. Martin's DWI arrests stretch back to the 1980s, and he has gone to prison three times for drunk driving . Martin had seven previous DWI convictions when he was arrested in 2009 after being found a ditch with the motor still running according to the Houston Chronicle. His blood alcohol content level was .21, more than double the legal limit in Texas. He was arrested for a string of drunk driving incidents in the early 1980s: January 1981, February 1982, June 1982 and October 1982. More arrests followed in June 1987, September 1993, August 1996, January 1999 and March 2009. The incidents happened across the greater Houston area in Harris County, Waller County and Montgomery County.","Bobby Gene Martin, 64, given life sentences in Montgomery County, Texas .

"Perched on top of a hill overlooking the dense woodland of the Pennsylvania Poconos, the abandoned Buck Hill Inn has an imposing presence. Left desolate after changing hands several times since its construction in 1901, the five-storey building serves as an obvious backdrop for all things sinister. The resort, formerly the respite of Quakers, made headlines earlier this year when searched by police in the hunt for alleged cop killer Eric Frein, a survivalist accused of the murder of one state trooper and the serious injuring of another. For almost 50 days Frein evaded capture, somehow managing to keep off the radar of sniffer dogs and thermal lighting. The empty, junk-filled pool at Buck Hill Inn where alleged murderer Eric Frein was thought to have hiden out from police during a 45 day search . Rusty coat hangers and bed frames litter the former hotel, with soiled mattresses and eerie paintings remarkably still in tact elsewhere . Keys hang on a chart in reception in the abandoned ill which has been sitting, quietly empty, after changing ownership over the past century . 'Cop killer' Eric Frein is alleged to have ambushed a Blooming Grove barracks . Eric Frein went on the run after allegedly ambushing Alex Douglass and Cpl. Bryon Douglas in August. He is said to have killed Cpl. Douglas in a planned sniper attack at his barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. The 31-year-old survivalist evaded police capture for almost 50 days by, it was reported, hiding in the dense woodland of the Poconos and Birchwood Resort in Tannersville. He was arrested in an abandoned hangar in September, remarkably clean shaven after more than a month on the run from police, and charged with a string of offences including the murder of Cpl. Douglas. Suspicious cuts and bruises on his face were, it was claimed, the result of Pennsylvania police officers' struggle to capture him in the airport hangar where he was found. During the nation-wide hunt for Frein police faced harsh questioning on why the man, accused of the murder and attempted murder of two police officers, had not yet been arrested. As speculation as to his whereabouts grew, details of Frein's life emerged, painting him as a 'self-taught survivalist' with a penchant for shooting. In his adolescence he won prizes for rifling and later he worked for the Boy Scouts of America Minsi Trails Council. On Halloween this year, following weeks of investigation, he was arrested by U.S. Marshalls. Since then Frein has been imprisoned at Pike County Jail in Lords Valley, Pennsylvania, where he has received no visitors. Prosecutors have revealed they will seek the death penalty when his case is heard. Yesterday Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf however imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in the state, describing it as 'error prone, expensive and anything but infallible.' Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said he would continue to seek the penalty in Frein's case, responding to the governor's claims: 'This action will not deter my efforts, nor the efforts of prosecutors across this state, to bring accused killers to justice.' Previously prosecutors said the suspect, whose hobbies included dressing up as a Serbian soldier to take part in war reenactments, had a longstanding grudge against law enforcement. He did not have a specific target in mind when he opened fire on the barracks in August, it was claimed. As part of an extensive police search to find him, the inn was scoured. No trace of Frein was found - he was eventually discovered in an empty airport hangar. Now, a photographer reveals details of the abandoned resort, home to rusting bed frames, soiled mattresses and a litter-strewn swimming pool. 'I've written a book about abandoned resorts on the Northeast Coast in the Borscht Belt. In that research I learned of another vacation region in the Northeast, the Poconos,' said Jonathan Haeber. 'Both regions differ - the Borscht Belt catered to a largely Jewish clientele and the Poconos started as more of a Quaker destination. I was intrigued by the differences and similarities between these two cultural enclaves. 'I was also interested in why both eventually became abandoned and deserted in favor of other vacation destinations.' 'When it comes to abandoned buildings, what interests me is the cultural history, remnants of the past. Every building is like opening it's own time capsule. I'm formally trained as a historian, so I analyse a lot of the contents for their meaning. 'As a photographer, my mandate is to document these structures before they disappear entirely.' Mr Haeber's visit to the inn took place years before it was considered in the hunt for Frein, though, he says, he would have been 'impressed' if the man had been able to successfully hide there. 'I heard about the story on the news, and it was intriguing. If Eric Frein was able to hide away in the structure, I would have been impressed, because it is very closely watched and almost impossible to access without being apprehended by security.' Staircases left to rot lead to cracked flooring and shattered glass panes in the hotel's lobby, while weeds and plants have been left to grow through the disused swimming pool's surrounding area . Mr Haeber, a formally trained historian and photographer, said he was drawn to the property as it was like opening 'a time capsule' Electricity sockets and a clock in what would have once been a functioning room at the inn (left) and a service staircase with iron railings .

"Intense fighting has continued through the night in eastern Ukraine - shattering the fragile ceasefire agreement which was due to begin at midnight. Both pro-Russian rebels and government troops have accused each other of violating the deal signed by the country's leaders on Thursday. Heavy artillery was fired from an area manned by Russian citizens according to Ukrainian security service chief, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko. Meanwhile, rebels accused the Ukrainians of deploying artillery shortly after midnight. The Donetsk News Agency quoted a senior rebel official as saying the Ukrainian forces garrisoned in Debaltseve and fired mortars at rebel positions. 'In the interests of preventing the death of the civilian population, precise fire is being deployed toward the enemy's positions,' He was cited as saying. 26 people, including four civilians, have been killed during heavy fighting across eastern-Ukraine in the last 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Death: Pro-Russian separatists stand next to the body of a soldier who died just hours before a ceasefire with Ukrainian soldiers was enforced . Bereaved: A man cries next to a body of his grandfather who was killed during shelling in Donetsk, Ukraine . Tragedy: He is among 26 people - including one child who died when a nursery was shelled by rebel forces - who have been killed during heavy fighting across eastern-Ukraine in the last 24 hours . Last battle: Separatist fighters (pictured) are battling for control of land before the ceasefire is brought in later . Death toll: Ukrainian military reports 26 have died in the last 24 hours - including one child . Destruction: The main focus of the fighting seems to have been Debaltseve, a key transport hub. Pictured: Two burned trucks of Ukrainian forces on a road not far from the Luganske village, Donetsk region . Ceasefire: From midnight, troops on either side are supposed to be abiding by the agreement thrashed out in Minsk on Thursday . The separatists desperately tried to grasp as much territory as possible before the ceasefire negotiated by European leaders in Minsk was enforced at midnight. The Ukrainian military has reported 120 separate attacks in just 24 hours and one child reportedly died when a nursery was shelled by rebel forces. Fighting was particularly intense around the government-held railway city of Debaltseve on Saturday. The area was besieged by separatist forces who say they do not consider battles for the town as a violation of the ceasefire. The US ambassador to Kiev Geoffrey Pyatt has produced satellite images which he says show Moscow's role in the escalating violence. The images appear to show Russian anti-aircraft batteries and artillery near Debaltseve - 45 miles north of Donetsk the regional capital. He said: 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists.' The government-held town has been on the receiving end of dozens of artillery and rocket salvos in the 24-hour period after the peace deal was sealed Thursday by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Intense shelling was witnessed on Friday along the highway north of Debaltseve, which remains the town's only land link with the rest of government-controlled territory . Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted Petro Mekhed, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, as saying separatist forces had been tasked with hoisting their flags over Debaltseve, as well as the key port city of Mariupol, before the ceasefire takes hold. Outside interference: The US ambassador to Kiev Geoffrey Pyatt has produced satellite images dated February 12 which he says shows Russian anti-aircraft weaponry stationed inside eastern-Ukraine . Russian involvement: The satellite images produced by Mr Pyatt appear to show Russian anti-aircraft  artillery near Debaltseve - 45 miles north of Donetsk the regional capital . Satellite images: Pyatt - who claims Russian troops along the border are planning to deliver a large shipment of supplies to rebels in the country -  said: 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists' War: Fighting has continued to rage in Ukraine, throwing doubts on a ceasefire deal due to take effect over the weekend . Fighting position: A man from the Ukrainian military digs as Ukrainian troops take position not far from Debaltseve, Donetsk . Last gasp: Russian-backed separatists wait for their transport, preparing to leave towards the frontline, in the village of Vergulivka, just outside Debaltseve . 'There has been no lull, moreover rebels continue attacks on Debaltseve,' military spokesman Anatoly Stelmakh said in a television interview. The Ukrainian military separately said the situation remained tense in parts of the contested Luhansk region. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt has said: 'I fear the ceasefire will not last and in that event the best next step would be to press for international intervention and for a United Nations monitoring force to deploy to Ukraine in a bid to prevent further fighting. 'While Britain should commit troops to this force if invited, in the interests of neutrality it would likely be better that these soldiers were drawn from Germany and France.' Earlier Lord Dannatt described the sale of Saxon armoured troop carriers to Ukraine as 'nothing short of immoral', as the vehicles were so decrepit as to be 'quite useless'. But it isn't just towns on the border which have come under attack: shells have landed as far as Artemivsk, a government-held town 25 miles behind the front line. Associated Press reporters saw the body of a child killed after rocket fire hit a nursery there, and regional officials said the child and one other civilian died in the attack . Collateral damage: Firefighters battle a blaze at a medical clinic which was hit by artillery fire . Horror: A woman walks past the body of a child covered with a cloth after shelling between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces in a residential area of the town of Artemivsk . Prepared: The Ukrainian military continues to train its newly mobilised recruits near Kiev . Buffer zone: An area roughly 30 to 85 miles wide should separate the forces by the end of the fortnight. Pictured: A new recruit training . It is hoped the ceasefire will bring an end to the fighting, which broke out almost a year ago and has left 5,000 dead. From a minute after midnight, a sizeable buffer zone between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels will start to be created. Each side is to pull heavy weaponry back from the front line, creating a zone roughly 30 to 85 miles wide, depending on the calibre of the weapons. The withdrawals are to begin Monday and be completed in two weeks. Other thorny political questions, including a degree of autonomy for the disputed eastern regions, are to be settled by the end of the year. The peace deal suggest an amnesty for people involved in the conflict, but the vague terms of that provision will likely be provoke further disagreements. Speaking to parliament, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said amnesty would not be granted to anyone suspected of committing crimes against humanity. 'This is an absolute position that was unambiguously underlined during negotiations,' Klimkin said.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Ed Miliband's attack on the tax arrangements of Tory donors took a new turn last night when it emerged that one of his own backers had millions of shares in an offshore trust. Sir David Garrard, who has given more than £1.2 million to Labour, transferred shares to Liechtenstein and Jersey, some of which were later sold for a reported £37 million. The disclosure comes after Mr Miliband denounced ‘dodgy Tory donors’ and named City tycoon and Conservative backer Lord Fink as one of those with Swiss accounts with the controversial HSBC bank. Sir David Garrard, left has given more than £1.2 million to the Labour Party in advance of the election, although claims that he may have used an offshore trust to reduce his tax bill could impact Ed Miliband, right . But last night the focus was back on Labour’s backers after company returns showed details of Sir David’s multi-million-pound business background. In 1995, seven years after he founded property company Minerva, he transferred more than 16 million of its shares to a Liechtenstein firm acting on behalf of his family trust, with a further 1.8 million shares going to a trust company in Jersey. When Sir David retired as chairman of Minerva in 2005, it was reported that his family trust sold 13.4 million shares in the company, leading to a huge windfall for them. Shortly afterwards, Sir David was contacted by Tony Blair’s fundraiser Lord Levy, who persuaded him to loan the party £2.3 million. He then became embroiled in the ‘cash for peerages’ row after being nominated for the honour in the same year – a move which was dropped in the ensuing furore. Sir David has gifted £690,000 to Labour while Mr Miliband has been leader. Sir David, 75, who has an estimated £100 million fortune, moved to Switzerland with his wife Maureen following his 2005 retirement, taking up permanent residency in a Geneva hotel suite, although he agreed to resume paying UK tax when the offer of a peerage was made months later. A leading tax expert told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Putting company shares offshore is one way to maximise the chance of legally avoiding tax when they are disposed of at a future date. There is no way of telling whether Sir David took advantage of this’. Last night, a spokesman for Sir David stressed that there was ‘no irregularity or impropriety in the conduct of his financial affairs’ and ‘all of his financial affairs have been conducted in the full view and knowledge of the UK tax authorities’. A source added that the Garrard family had benefited from the 2005 shares windfall, not Sir David. Labour said: ‘All our donations are declared and published in line with Electoral Commission rules.’ Yesterday Mr Miliband accused the Coalition of ‘shrugging its shoulders’ on tax avoidance. However, the Tories hit back, saying the last Labour Government should be held responsible for the level of avoidance. ‘The culture and practices of HMRC went wrong under Labour – when top bankers paid lower tax rates than their cleaners, foreigners didn’t pay capital gains tax and the richest people routinely avoided paying stamp duty,’ said a spokesman. In a further development, a former Conservative Trade Minister at the centre of the HSBC row stood down from his role at the financial industry lobbying group TheCityUK. Lord Green, the former chairman of HSBC, headed the bank during the period when staff at its Swiss operation appeared to be helping British customers to avoid tax.","Sir David Garrard transferred shares offshore before some were later sold .

"Islamic State has publicly executed two alleged spies and mercilessly crucified another to a road sign in the Syrian city of Al-Bab. Images have emerged showing two men - bound and dressed in orange jumpsuits - kneeling on the ground as hundreds of jeering insurgents surround them. Masked men dressed in black have their weapons trained on the captives, while young boys force their way through the crowd to catch a glimpse of the helpless men. Another picture shows a deceased man hanging from a post with a sign hanging around his neck. The onlookers in the photograph seem unphased by the man's limp, crucified body. On Thursday, the extremist group announced it was holding an Israeli-Arab who posed as foreign a fighter to spy for the country's intelligence agency, Mossad. Scroll down for video . Helpless: Islamic State has reportedly executed two alleged spies in the Syrian city of Al-Bab . Crucified: One of the men's dead bodies was tied to a post, with a message hung around his neck . Public killing: One picture seems to show a crowd of hundreds gathering for what could be the execution . Muhammad Musallam, 19, was quoted in Islamic State's online magazine Dabiq saying he joined the insurgents in Syria to report information about their weapons cashes, bases and recruits back to Israel. It claims he said: 'I say to all those who want to spy on the Islamic State, don't think that you're so smart and that you can deceive the Islamic State. You won't succeed at all. 'Stay away from this path. Stay away from helping the Jews and the murtaddin [apostates]. Follow the right path.' His cover was blown when he phoned his father back in East Jerusalem, Dabiq claimed. The Israeli government has denied he was working for them as a spy. So has his father Said who claims he was kidnapped after travelling to Turkey as a tourist. Muhammad phoned home to say he had been abducted to neighbouring Syria and could not find a way to escape, his father said. Said Musallam claims his son needed '$200 or $300' before they would release him. But before he could send the money, another man phoned to tell him Muhammad had escaped his captors and was seized by Islamic State. Surrounded: Hundreds of masked and armed men encircle the helpless captives, while young men look on . Cruelty: Men believed to be IS fighters and sympathisers seem to celebrate the kidnapped men's deaths . An Israeli security official said Mr Musallam travelled to Turkey on October 24 to fight alongside Islamic State soldiers in Syria. He said: 'He went on his own initiative, without his family's knowledge.' Asked whether his statement constituted a denial that Musallam was an Israeli spy, the official replied: 'You can understand it that way, yes.' Ayoob Kara - an Israeli politician and former army officer close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu - said he was unaware of Musallam's case and did not believe he was a spy. He claims several Arab men cross the boarder to aid refugees only to be kidnapped and exploited by Islamic State. Kidnapped: On Thursday, ISIS announced they are holding another man believed to be an Israeli spy but Muhammad Musallam's father Said (pictured) denied those allegations . Israel has recently intensified its monitoring of would-be volunteers who might cross the border to join Islamic State and return to the country as battle-hardened extremists. Turkey is a popular holiday destination for Israeli-Arabs. In November, the country jailed an Arab citizen who returned from Syria voluntarily having spent three months there with Islamic State. In the first conviction of its kind, Ahmed Shurbaji was imprisoned for 22 months on the condition he cooperated with security services. A source from Israel's internal security agency Shin Bet said Israeli-Arabs returning from Syria were routinely questioned for intelligence on jihadist groups. Footage released yesterday showed Kurdish fighters dressed in orange jumpsuits being paraded through the streets by jeering IS militants. Surrounded: A terrified Kurdish prisoner looks out from his cage at a mob of jeering militants in the horrific scene . Humiliation: Each prisoner was accompanied by black clad and flag waving jihadis, some armed with AK-47s . Posts on social media implied the men - shackled in cages - would suffer the same fate as a captured Jordanian pilot who was burned alive by the extremists. The grim procession apparently took place through Kirkuk in North-west Iraq - an oil rich Kurdish stronghold where ISIS now has a presence after mounting repeated attacks in recent weeks. In the nearly four minute long video, 17 of the Iraqi-Kurdistan soldiers are driven one by one on the backs of white pick-up trucks with ISIS flag-waving militants toting AK-47s accompanying each prisoner. At the end of the clip the long line of cages can be seen retreating into the sunset over the heads of massed crowds of militants.","Images have emerged of two helpless men surrounded by armed fighters .

"Small earthquakes linked to energy drilling are shaking Oklahoma and southern Kansas daily and may be dramatically increasing the chance of bigger and dangerous quakes. This once stable region is now just as likely to see serious damaging and potentially harmful earthquakes as the highest risk places east of the Rockies. A major quake is still a low risk, about a 1 in 2,500 years' chance of happening, according to geophysicist William Ellsworth of the US Geological Survey. 'To some degree we've dodged a bullet in Oklahoma,' Ellsworth said after a presentation to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Scroll down for video . Research says small earthquakes shaking Oklahoma and southern Kansas are dramatically increasing the chance of bigger, more dangerous quakes. Above, an Oklahoma man looks at damage from a 2011 quake . The number of earthquakes in Oklahoma has grown dramatically in the last several years, and the state saw 562 in 2014 . But, he added, 'This is not to say we expect a large earthquake tomorrow.' The change in risk puts Oklahoma on par with such areas as New Madrid, Missouri, where residents are warned that a devastating earthquake in 1811 could receive a dangerous aftershock. During Dr Ellsworth's 90-minute session on human-induced earthquakes, three quakes larger than 3.1 magnitude hit northern Oklahoma. Federal records show that since Jan. 1, Oklahoma has had nearly 200 quakes that people have felt. These quakes started to increase in 2008 and made dramatic jumps in frequency in June 2013 and again in February 2014, Dr Ellsworth said. The state saw three times as many quakes larger than 3,0 magnitude in 2014, according to Reveal News , the most perceptible tremors in the contiguous United States.Oklahoma saw 562 earthquakes to California's 180. 'Yeah, we are shaking all the time ... You put up with a few things falling off your walls, a few nights waking up with the shakes,' Medford Oklahoma City Manager Dea Mandevill told KCUR. She said that energy drilling had benefited her town economically and did not discuss the possibility of large, damaging quakes. The Midwestern states' earthquakes are mostly in areas with hydraulic fracturing, a process known as fracking. Maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee, Okla., after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours. Many studies have linked the increase in small quakes to the process of injecting wastewater deep underground because it changes pressure and triggers dormant faults. Until now, those quakes were mostly thought of as nuisances and not really threats. But Dr Ellsworth's continuing study, which is not yet published, showed the mere increase In the number of tiny temblors raises the risk of earthquakes that scientists consider major hazards. That's generally above a magnitude 5 with older buildings and a magnitude 6 for modern ones, he said. 'The more small earthquakes we have it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event,' Dr Ellsworth said. A 2011 earthquake in Prague, Oklahoma, was a 5.7 magnitude, causing some damage and hurting two people. Some scientists have linked ground pressure changes from hydraulic fracking (pictured) to the increased seismic activity (file photo, Britain) Some studies said that was a side effect of the drilling process, but other scientists are not convinced. Experts at the science session said Dr Ellsworth's finding of a higher risk for big quakes makes sense. 'We are worried about this, no question about it,' said Rex Buchanan, interim director of the Kansas Geological Survey. Not all states with fracking and wastewater injections are seeing increased quakes and not all those with increased quakes, such as Texas and Ohio, are at a higher risk for major quakes, Dr Ellsworth said. Arkansas and Ohio, for example, are also now seeing fewer man-made quakes, he said. Areas in the Bakken formation in North Dakota and Canada, where there has been heavy drilling, have also not seen the same increase. Much depends on geology and how the wastewater is injected, said Stanford University geophysics professor Mark Zoback. He said industry and regulators can be smarter about where they inject wastewater and where they do not, and can avoid many of these problems.","US Geological Survey says risk of major earthquake elevated after fracking .

"Twice as many teenagers are using e-cigarettes than conventional smoking with fears this could potentially lead to an addiction to nicotine. The findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a 'gateway' to tobacco. The study, based on surveys of 50,000 students in 400 secondary schools in the US, is the first sign among this age group the use of e-cigarettes has surpassed the use of traditional tobacco products, researchers claim. The new findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a 'gateway' to tobacco . Dr Wilson Compton, deputy director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: 'I was really surprised that among the eighth graders over a third of users of e-cigarettes hadn't previously tried tobacco cigarettes . 'In a lot of kids, their first exposure to nicotine is now with these e-products.' Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in San Jose, California, Dr Compton warned about the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. He said: 'There is potential that if you start with e-cigarettes, that gets you into a nicotine habit, and then you switch over to the real thing. That's speculation but what we don't want to do is look back and say I wish we'd done something. 'Just like tobacco becomes a habit that's life long and hard to break, e-cigarettes might start you on the same pathway. The model Helen Flanagan with an e-cigarette - they are widely used as an aid to quitting smoking . 'They could not be described as harmless. Nicotine itself is not a harmless substance. It produces changes in heart rate and blood pressure, can be dangerous in high doses, and certainly wouldn't be recommended for the adolescent brain.' He said it was important parents did not fall into the trap of thinking that 'vaping' e-cigarettes were harmless. 'Parents are our most important tool for shaping teenager behaviour and they may not see this as risky,' he added. The study found that among 14 to 16-year-olds, nine per cent reported using an e-cigarette in the past 30 days, while only four per cent had smoked a tobacco cigarette. Among 17 and 18-year-olds, 16 per cent reported using an e-cigarette compared to 14 per cent smoking a cigarette. Scientists also found that 36 per cent of 13 and 14-year-olds who had used e-cigarettes had never smoked a real cigarette. Jack Nicholson smokes an e-cigarette - a study has found far more teenagers are now turning to e-cigarettes . E-cigarettes, widely used as an aid to quitting smoking, contain a heating element that produces a vapour containing nicotine but are free of many of the harmful substances associated with tobacco. The vapour is often given sweet flavours - examples include bubble gum and milk chocolate cream - that might be attractive to younger teens, the researchers said. 'E-cigarettes have made rapid inroads into the lives of American adolescents,' said senior study investigator Dr Richard Meich from the University of Michigan. He added: 'Part of the reason for the popularity of e-cigarettes is the perception among teens that they do not harm health.' The same investigation, now in its 40th year, revealed a long-term decline in the use of tobacco cigarettes by American teenagers. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said, 'Nicotine can be harmful to the growing brain so it's best if young people avoid it. But if they're going to experiment it's better to use e-cigarettes as vaping is far less dangerous than smoking and much less addictive. 'So far in the UK and the US, smoking rates are going down more than e-cigarette use is growing. This would not be the case if vaping really were a gateway into smoking.'","Twice as many teenagers using e-cigarettes than conventional smoking .

"Prisoner: British rifleman Victor Gregg, 25, was being held in the city of Dresden along with hundreds of other men who had been sentenced to death . On 13 February 1945, British rifleman Victor Gregg, 25, was being held by Germans in a makeshift prison in the city of Dresden along with hundreds of other condemned men. He was taken there after being sentenced to death for burning down the soap factory where he had been sent to work as punishment for twice trying to escape his POW camp. Like the  townspeople of Dresden, Gregg did not believe the city would be bombed. There was a widespread understanding that the Allies would preserve its cultural heritage, just as the Germans had refrained from attacking Oxford. But, as this powerful eyewitness account reveals, this was not to be the case. It begins in the makeshift prison after British bombers had started their air assault. Gregg and his friend Harry, who had also been sentenced to death after burning  down the soap factory, were surrounded by the wails of desperate men trapped in the locked room. Tragically, Harry didn't survive Dresden. After the assault, Gregg, now 95, eventually walked to the advancing Russian lines and weeks later was flown back to Britain. Four incendiaries burst through the heavy glass roof, turning men into human torches. Nothing could be done to help them, it was impossible to extinguish the flames, and so the screaming of those who were being burned alive was added to the cries of others. The raid had been in progress for 30 minutes when a ‘blockbuster’ landed, blowing in the whole of the wall. (These thin-walled, massive missiles could demolish whole blocks with one explosion, hence the name). All I could remember was being thrown over to the far corner of the building, nearly 50 feet. The next thing I knew I was being covered in brickwork and rubble and everything went dark. When I came to, I realised the building was slowly collapsing. Wherever I turned, I was confronted by flames, smoke and dust – and all the time blocks of debris falling from the sky. There were about a dozen of us in our small group of survivors who were able to walk or stagger. In the town, there were other small groups moving between the heaps of rubble, dodging the flames which, without warning, shot out of gaps in the walls. The noise of the planes died down and people started to claw their way out of the huge mounds of rubble that an hour before had been their homes. Although the authorities had built huge concrete water towers, only a few of these had been filled with water – and these were to prove tragic. People climbed into them to escape the flames and found it impossible to climb back out. They were trapped in water which slowly boiled. Devastation: The once-beuatiful city of Dresden after the  air raids. There was a widespread understanding that the Allies would preserve its cultural heritage, just as the Germans had refrained from attacking Oxford . We stumbled along the remains of a wide avenue. We were surrounded by fires and mountains of red hot wreckage. What saved me were the clogs - the wooden soles were so thick I could walk over the red hot cinders. Finally we found ourselves in open fields, next to a railway line. Reaching safety, we saw another group coming towards us from along the railway line. They were pulling and pushing a large cart full of picks, shovels, buckets, coils of rope and some cans of drinking water. The leader of the group selected those men whom he judged to be capable and fit – including myself - and marched us off, leaving the injured to fend for themselves. At first we came across people who had been caught out in the open and were still alive. By fixing bits of wood to our picks and shovels we turned them into stretchers to carry the injured. After two hours we returned to the railway, where we discovered reinforcements and a food wagon that had somehow been shunted in from God knows where. Then the sirens started their terrible wailing again and the people started to gather in small bunches, as if to shield each other from the onslaught. The new bombs were so big that it was possible to see them falling through the air. Raining down with this terror came more blockbusters – 10-tonners this time. Only five hundred yards of open land separated us from the heart of the first raid on the old part of the city and yet not one bomb landed on us. The second raid had been in progress for 15 minutes when the ground erupted in huge clouds of smoke and flame. Then came the enormous pull of the wind as air rushed in to replace the vacuum that had been caused by the blasts. Escape: After the assault, Gregg, left as a rifleman and right today, eventually walked to the advancing Russian lines and weeks later was flown back to Britain. The horrors he witnessed haunted him for years . Some 30 minutes later they had gone. Everything that could burn was alight - the metalled roadways were like burning rivers of bubbling and hissing tar and huge fragments of material were flying through the air. A small group tried to reach us by crossing what had once been a road, only to get themselves stuck in a bubbling mass of molten tar. One by one, they sank to the ground through sheer exhaustion and then died in a pyre of smoke and flame. People of all shapes, sizes and ages were slowly sucked into the vortex, then suddenly whisked into the pillars of smoke and fire, their hair and clothing alight. And as if the Devil himself decided the torment the people were suffering was insufficient, above the noise of the wind and the roar of the inferno around us came the agonised screams of the victims as they were roasted alive. It was these fiendish visions that brutalised my mind in later years. Destruction: Buildings in the city of Dresden were left as hollow shells by the relentless bombing. Gregg was able to escape the prison where he had been held and help search for survivors - and recover bodies . What saved us was that we were on open ground with oxygen to breathe and, since the fires were getting worse, we abandoned any idea of approaching the city centre for now. At dawn, we saw new gangs had arrived to fill up the craters and re-lay the track, and by mid-morning a small line of wagons was shunted alongside us. You had to hand it to the krauts, the first thing they think of is invariably their belly, and in the centre was a kitchen wagon, complete with hot soup, black bread and a 40-gallon drum of erzazt coffee. After eating, about 40 of us trudged into the smouldering embers edging the vast bonfire that still raged nearby. While other groups dug at the piles of masonry, clearing pathways we were to uncover the cellars. Powerful: Mr Gregg's account has been published in full as an ebook by Bloomsbury . But then the third raid started. Now it was the Americans. While their bombs were much less destructive than the British, many more were killed. When the raid ended, we continued to the cellars, prising them open with pickaxes and crowbars. Inside, we found the victims’ bodies, usually shrivelled to half their normal size. Children under the age of three or four had simply melted. But most of them looked as though they had died peacefully through lack of oxygen, losing conscious in the process. Even the hardest of us would flinch as we got nearer to where the centre of the firestorm had been and where fierce fires were still raging. Some of the corpses were so brittle that they crumbled into clouds of ash and dried flesh. Yet so methodical were Germans that we were ordered to stuff any identifiable parts of these corpses into sacks. The next day we were ordered to tackle a sector where there were chances of finding survivors alive, the news brought us fresh life to the gang. We set off for a small square where what had been grass was now a bed of ash at least four inches thick. Examination of one shelter revealed a tunnel leading to another shelter where the roof had collapsed. We later broke through and found four women and two girls huddled together and alive. Even the guards cheered themselves hoarse. It took an hour to get them to the surface but we all felt like heroes. But sadly, this was a solitary event, as we learned the next day. Trudging through the streets the next day, we came to the door of a communal shelter, which took all afternoon to prise open. With the first inch or so, there was a large hissing sound and the surrounding dust was sucked into the opening. As the gap widened so a terrible smell hit us. Slowly the horror inside became visible. There were no complete bodies, only bones and scorched articles of clothing matted together on the floor. There was no flesh visible – just a mass of solidified fat and bones swimming around, inches thick, on the floor.

"Extremist group Boko Haram launched a fierce assault on a Nigerian town today and warned people they face being killed if they vote in the country's upcoming elections. As the militants attacked the town of Gombe, clashing with ground troops, they distributed papers warning that they will attack all polling stations on March 28. Boko Haram left the town in a convoy of vehicles carrying dozens of corpses, according to residents. Scroll down for video . Attack: Boko Haram militants were greeted by fighter jets and ground troops when they struck the village of Gombe on Saturday morning. The group's leader Abubakar Shekau is pictured centre . 'They were heard telling our people in the villages leading to Gombe that they have not come to harm civilians but the security agents,' said resident Malam Hassan. 'They were also dropping copies of papers with messages written in Hausa warning people not to participate in the coming elections, lest they risk being killed.' The message warns that Boko Haram fighters will attack all polling stations on March 28. The paper also said residents should not assist the army and pledged that extremist fighters would not attack those who stayed out of its fight against the government. 'We are calling on you all to come and join us in the Jihad and embrace Islamic Sharia jurisprudence,' the paper urged. On February 7, Nigeria announced it was pushing back planned presidential and legislative elections by six weeks to March 28, because of insecurity. Soldiers on the ground in Gombe were backed up by two fighter jets, witnesses said. Gombe has previously been attacked multiple times. At least 20 people died when a car bomb was detonated in December. Chadian soldiers gathered near the Nigerian town of Gamboru on February 1, where forces carried out clean-up operations after entering and retaking it from Boko Haram . Boko Haram's Islamic extremist insurgency killed 10,000 people last year, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. Fighting has forced some 157,000 people to seek refuge in Niger, while 40,000 others have gone to Cameroon and 17,000 are in Chad, according to the United Nations. Yesterday, the group staged its first attack on Chadian territory, bringing the number of neighboring countries roped into what had previously been an internal Nigerian conflict to three. The targeted village, Ngouboua, was already home to nearly 3,300 refugees who had fled Boko Haram-related violence in Nigeria, according to the U.N. Cameroon and Niger have also been attacked. Along with Benin, they have vowed to contribute to a regional force against Boko Haram that is expected to be launched in the coming weeks, though funding questions remain unsettled. The U.N. special representative for West Africa said Friday that Nigeria's military needs to show 'greater resolve' in the widening fight against Boko Haram.","Boko Haram said Nigerians  face being killed if they vote in March elections .

"The consultant who treated Tony Blair’s heart ‘flutter’ is pioneering a same-day method to detect and treat similar cardiac problems. A ‘heart detective’ system is being used to root out the cause of disorders that make the heart beat too slowly, too fast or out of sync. Called the rhythmia mapping system, the technique involves a probe being threaded up into the heart via a small incision in the groin. The probe, which looks like a miniature egg whisk, brushes the surface of the heart, with electrodes picking up problem tissue in just 15 minutes. This tissue is then burned away under local anaesthetic and normal rhythm is restored, meaning patients may be able to go home the same day. Consultant cardiologist Wyn Davies, who treated the former Prime Minister for an abnormal heart rhythm in 2004, is one of the first in Europe to use the device, caring for patients at London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. It is also being used at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London. Mr Davies says the treatment is a breakthrough for hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from complex rhythm conditions, which can trigger strokes – or even sudden death. ‘These abnormal rhythms have a major impact on people’s lives and survival,’ he says. ‘The advantage of this system is that it “maps” the heart’s electrical activity more accurately and more quickly.’ A ‘normal’ heart beats between 60 and 100 times a minute when resting. But for people with atrial fibrillation (AF) – the most common of abnormal heart rhythm conditions – it can beat 140 times a minute. Consultant cardiologist Wyn Davies, who is pioneering the method, treated Tony Blair’s (above) heart ‘flutter’ in 2004 . This is because electrical impulses start firing off randomly in the upper chambers of the heart, causing it beat out of rhythm. Mr Blair is one of an estimated 800,000 Britons to be diagnosed with the condition, which can cause breathlessness, dizziness and palpitations. He underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation, known as a catheter ablation, to correct his irregular heartbeat in October 2004. With AF, blood can pool and clots can form inside the heart, which, if left untreated, can make the patient five times more likely to suffer a stroke. Similarly, actor Brian Blessed blamed his recent collapse on stage on an irregular heart rhythm condition. The 78-year-old, who underwent a heart procedure three years ago, said he had suffered a ‘little fibrillation’ after fainting and falling during a performance of Shakespeare’s King Lear. He has since pulled out of further performances due to ongoing problems. Scare: Actor Brian Blessed blamed his recent collapse on stage on an irregular heart rhythm condition . Other rhythm conditions the new procedure could help include ventricular tachycardia, a rapid heartbeat caused by a malfunction in one of the heart’s ventricles. Serious cases of this can lead to a cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating, which in turn stops oxygen-rich blood reaching the brain and other vital organs. The recognised treatment for heart-rhythm disorders is to burn away the tissue responsible for the problem, yet the challenge for doctors is to identify the exact spot. Until now, they have used tubes with electrodes on the tips to monitor the signals and track where they are coming from. These send back pictures that can be viewed on a computer screen, but the images tend to be flat and difficult to make out. Hope: Consultant cardiologist Wyn Davies believes the new treatment method is a major breakthrough . In comparison, the ‘heart detective’ system, which has been a decade in the making, is far more sophisticated. After being threaded up through a 2mm incision in the groin, the whisk-shaped probe inflates to the size of a lime once it reaches the surface of the heart, and begins to monitor the electric signals. The probe is fitted with dozens of electrodes that capture 20,000 pieces of data in 15 minutes, compared with only 500 in half an hour with a conventional device. This data allows doctors to build a detailed 3D image of the heart on a computer to identify the precise section of muscle causing the problem. The rogue tissue can then be destroyed in a separate procedure immediately after doctors have ‘mapped’ the heart and identified the problem area. Mr Davies said that in some cases, patients can be treated under local anaesthetic, meaning that a longer hospital stay is no longer necessary. ‘The new technology locates the source of abnormal accelerated heart rhythms, guiding their elimination and then confirming successful treatment,’ Mr Davies adds. ‘We expect to be able to reduce procedure times significantly and to provide more accurate and detailed information than we could before.’ Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, believes the ‘heart detective’ shows real promise to speed up diagnosis of problems and treatment times. He says: ‘By allowing the cardiologist to diagnose more quickly and more accurately exactly where to block the source of heart-rhythm disturbance, patients may have better outcomes. We look forward to seeing it tested in larger numbers of patients.’","Cardiologist Wyn Davies treated former PM for abnormal heartbeat in 2004 .

"He is known as one of Britain's most hardened gangsters with a penchant for gangland violence and teeth-shattering boxing. But while locked in Wayland Prison in Norfolk, where he spent 31 years for the murder of a friend, Reggie Kray honed another talent. During his time behind bars, the criminal completed sinister and erotic pencil drawings of naked women and eyeballs, the finished works only revealed for the first time recently. Bizarre drawings completed by Reggie Kray in Wayland Prison in Norfolk in 1999 are due to be sold at auction. Among them is a depiction of the kung-fu actor Bruce Lee (above) The images, all signed by Kray, are thought to have been completed a year before his release in 2000 . The drawings, which include a detailed portrait of kung-fu star Bruce Lee, have been revealed before going on sale at an auction in the Cotswolds. Kray is thought to have completed the drawings in 1999, a year before his release. He was allowed to leave the prison by the then Home Secretary Jack Straw due to deteriorating health. The following year he died at the age of 66. The drawings will be sold by Moore Allen & Innocent in Circenster, Gloucester, in two weeks. Each is stamped by prison authorities and signed by Kray. Last week the auctioneers sold a boxing glove presented to the gangster by Rocky Marciano for £580. The collection of drawings is expected to fetch £100 and £150. Naked women also feature in the collection of drawings due to be sold at auction. Right, the gangster, who was jailed in 1969 for 30 years for the murder of his friend . The gangster completed a handful of drawings which are each stamped by the prison authority . Last week a boxing glove given to the criminal by Rocky Marciano sold for £580. The lot of drawings is expected to fetch between £100 and £150 . Kray was jailed for life in 1969 alongisde his brother, Ronald 'Ronnie' Kray, for the murder of their friend Jack 'the Hat' McVitie at a flat in Stoke Newington. Ronnie Kray died in prison in 1995. He was serving a life sentence for the murder of George Cornell when he suffered a heart attack. In 2000, Reggie, whose real name was Reginald, was released from prison on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with cancer. He took up a room in Beefeater Town House Hotel in Norwich after being discharged from the Norwich Hospital. On October 1, with his wife Roberta at his bedside, he died peacefully in his sleep. Considered the softer of the two twins, Reggie married twice in his life. His first wife, Frances Kray, died in 1967. While some claimed the young bride killed herself, others suggested Reggie's twin, Ronnie, had a hand in her death. Reggie Kray pictured on his wedding day. The gangster married Frances Shea in April 1965. Two years later, the young bride died in suspicious circumstances . Reggie Kray in 2000 after being released from jail on compassionate grounds. The 66-year-old died of cancer some days after inviting news crews to his deathbed where he confessed to a previously unknown murder . Ronnie and Reggie Kray controlled London's East End for years in the 1950s and 60s . The Krays were almost born to a life of crime. Their father, Charlie senior, was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was called up to join the Army, but deserted. Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father. It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition. However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot. In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder. Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept. Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair. Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear. In the middle of 1968, the twins’ older brother Charlie was arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders. Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. Ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and Reggie died in 2000 aged 66. The twins had an older brother, Charlie (centre), jailed alongside them in 1968. He was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of Jack McVitie .","The collection of drawings were completed in 1999 in Wayland Prison .

"The armed robber who escaped from prison after his Russian lover hijacked a helicopter and airlifted him out of the jail exercise yard is appealing to have one of the conditions of his parole changed, lifting a ban on the pair from having any contact. John Killick and Lucy Dudko pulled off one of Australia's most notorious breakouts when Dudko forced a helicopter pilot at gunpoint to land in the compound of Silverwater jail in 1999. The infamous couple cherished the 45 days they spent together before being caught and banned from seeing each other until 2022 - when he will be 80 years old and she will be 64. The former jailbirds have not seen each other for 15 years. Killick, who was released in 2014 after serving 15 years for a string of armed robberies, is appealing to have his 24 hour electronic ankle monitor, and the ban on seeing Dudko, removed when he appears before the NSW parole authority hearing on Friday,The Sun Herald reported. John Killick is appealing to have his 24 hour electronic ankle monitor, and the ban from seeing  his ex-girlfriend Lucy Dudko removed at a NSW parole authority hearing on Friday . Killick's lover Lucy Dudko (left), who was living with his wife Gloria (right) before she executed the daring escape, says she has moved on from the life that she described as a soap opera . They are are both writing books about their love affair which lasted 10 years and Killick says he wants to talk to the former librarian about the contents of her story. Killick says his risk of re-offending has been assessed at one out of 22. 'This isn't about Lucy and I being a threat to society the moment we catch up for coffee; this is about revenge. For what happened in that prison yard … for embarrassing them,' he said. While Dudko spent a decade at Mulawa women's prison she sent an astounding 4,500 love letters to Killick, who was serving the rest of his time at Goulburn jail. However, the relationship turned sour  when Dudko told him in 2005 that she had 'rediscovered' her faith and his said he didn't 'buy' most of what was written in the bible. Two weeks later, Dudko called off their relationship. Dudko told The Sun- Herald in 2009 that she had 'moved on' from that part of her life. 'My life was like a soap opera back then but slowly I've managed to put it all behind me,"" she said. 'It doesn't help to relive what happened, so I try not to.' Killick, who completed a Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program for his gambling habit which led him to commit armed robberies in 1966, 1972, 1981 and 1985, said he would like to see his long time lover again. 'I still believe there is a unique bond there. And I would need her to look me in the face and say there is not … for me to ever believe otherwise,' he said. The couple planned the great escape when Dudko's visited the prison three times a week . In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night last year, Killick revealed just what happened on the day, and during the weeks following, he and his girlfriend made the daring escape. In 1999, Killick was imprisoned in Silverwater jail, serving time for a series of armed bank robberies. His girlfriend, a librarian originally from Russia, went to see him in jail as often as she could. It was during these visits the pair decided that Killick would break out of prison. 'She was visiting me all the time and you can get three visits a week and she came out three times a week. I rang her as often as I could. And we decide ""look um I’m going to get out,""' Killick told the program. In preparation for Killick's escape, Dudko took a joy ride over the site where Sydney Olympic Park was being constructed in the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games. Pilot Timothy Joyce also spoke to the program, and told of the moment Killick's lover held a gun to his head . The night before the big day, Dudko ate dinner at the home of Killick's former wife Gloria, where she had been staying since her lover had been locked up. In another curious detail, the criminal revealed his girlfirend had hired the 1975 action film Breakout, about a woman who hires a pilot to break her husband out of jail and watched it in the week before the real thing. On March 25, 1999, the Russian librarian jumped in a plane with helicopter pilot Timothy Joyce, under the guise of another scenic tour. Joyce recounted the moment he knew something was awry, as Dudko was paying particular attention to Silverwater jail. 'I looked over my shoulder... and as I looked back she had pulled a pistol out of her purse and she put it to the side of my head and said ""this is a hijack"",' the pilot revealed. The helicopter hijacked was a Bell 47, and Joyce was tied up after he was forced to land the aircraft . From there Joyce was forced to land in the grounds of the jail, while Killick jumped in the aircraft and prison officers fired shots in his direction. He flew the couple about 7 kilometres from the facility, before he was forced to land and tied up the pair who were now on the run. Killick and Dudko were then forced to flag down a car and hijack it, as Killick recalled his lover admitted 'We have no car - I've forgotten the keys'. The fugitives drove the vehicle to North Sydney station where they dumped it and jumped on a train to Goulburn, well aware they would have officers hot on their tails. Killick was only released last year after serving time for a string of armed robberies and the helicopter escape . For 45 days the couple managed to avoid authorities, as they slowly made their way south to Victoria, changing hair colour along the way and travelling by bus and train. Their downfall came when they ran out of money and were forced back to Sydney to reclaim money from one of Killick's criminal friends who owed him cash. In a caravan park on the outskirts of Sydney they were cornered and arrested, and Killick was only released from jail for the daring escape last year. In July last year, he handed himself in to Brisbane police after he lost a case to be extradited from New South Wales. Killick must now abide to extremely tough parole conditions and wears an ankle monitor full time.","John Killick escaped prison in 1999 when his girlfriend Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the prison yard .

"It's the baby shower trend which swept America, leaving expectant parents weeping with joy at the sight of blue or pink sponge. And now gender reveal parties, where mothers-to-be discover the sex of their unborn baby in front of guests by cutting into a cake, have arrived in Britain. Reality television stars are among the first to join in, sharing photographs of their fluorescent baked goods on social media to the delight of fans. The popular trend has arrived in the UK, with expectant parents learning the sex of their baby by cutting into a dyed cake. TOWIE star Dan Osborne and his pregnant actress girlfriend Jacqueline Jossa shared their news with fans on social media last month (above) Forums on Mumsnet have been dedicated to the subject, with users agonising over whether to opt for cupcakes, cake-pops or multi-tier masterpieces for the big day. While naysayers have dismissed the parties as overindulgent and extravagant, event planners have begun cashing in on impatient parents' need to know and tell. Party Pieces, the website owned by Carole Middleton, is selling gender reveal balloons at £1.99 a packet. The balloons are filled with pink or blue confetti, with guests discovering the baby's sex after popping them. Customers can also purchase plates, cups and napkins to go along with the theme. Despite her family's interest in the business, there are no reports to suggest the Duchess of Cambridge, who is six months pregnant, will be taking part in such a party. One couple who are taking part in the act said it allowed relatives to join in with a woman's pregnancy and allow the mother to prepare. Party Pieces, the website run by Carole Middleton, has cashed in on the trend and is selling balloons, napkins and banners for the occasion . Party Pieces is run by Carole Middleton (left with husband Michael). The Duchess of Cambridge, who is six months pregnant, is not reported to be planning a gender reveal party for the royal baby . 'I wasn't going to find out the sex of the baby until the birth, but then I read about these parties and thought ti would be a really lovely way to share the news with our families and friends,' Katy Edwards from Portsmouth told the Times. At her 20 week scan, Mrs Edward's sonographer wrote down the sex of her baby for it to be passed along to her baker friend. 'I am from a big family and we share a lot, so we thought it would be nicer to all find out together rather than just the two of us at the birth.' But critics in favour of a more traditional approach said the party takes away from the 'magic' of finding out a baby's sex at birth. 'It's so lovely to say ""Come and greet your baby,"" and the parents discover it is a daughter or son. It's magical,' said Louise Silverton, the director of midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives. The trend started in America, with expectant mothers describing the parties as a way to share their excitement with loved ones .","Gender reveal parties swept the U.S. with themed cakes and balloons .

"A bullied student frequently picked on by students was victimized by the one person expected to help him in those situations - his teacher. Stephen Davis, 15, a freshman at Streamwood High School in Illinois, watched in horror as a cartoon-like sketch with buck teeth, hairy ears, bloodshot eyes, tentacles, a scar and a runny nose was labeled as 'Stephen's ugly ass' by a substitute teacher, who did this in front of his entire math class. Davis, who weighs 330 pounds, recorded the entire incident on his phone, leaving no doubt as to what the teacher did.

'Everyone was standing there pointing at me, laughing, (while) I'm on the verge of tears.' CBS Chicago also reports that Stephen is a special needs student. Making the situation even more difficult, Stephen said that he has always been picked on because of his weight, 'but I always learned to just move along. ... (It) is basically background noise.' This as the school's two vice principals acknowledged that Stephen is 'always helpful and respectful toward his teachers.' Now Stephen is taking a stand, and he and his family have shown the boy's video to school administrators. 'No other family should have to go through this suffering. This is unimaginable,' said Stephen. 'Everyone was standing there pointing at me, laughing, (while) I'm on the verge of tears,' said Stephen of the drawing . Stephen is also getting support on Facebook after his sister posted the video on a page dedicated to things that are happening in the school district. 'It's humiliating, and no one should ever have to go through that, and just the fact that it was a teacher makes it even worse,' said Brianna Davis. 'No one should do this to anyone, let alone a child.' John Heiderscheidt, the district's coordinator of safety and security, said; 'We've reviewed the posting on Facebook and are examining any evidence or statements regarding the incident and anybody who might be involved.'

"Justice Lowell Goddard clearly doesn't believe in the old adage that bad news comes in threes. If she did she would have run a mile when she was asked to take charge of the independent inquiry into historic child sex abuse. The first two women picked by Home Secretary Theresa May, Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf, had to stand down over their links with the Establishment. But as Justice Goddard sits in her office in Millbank Tower, Westminster, she shrugs off the suggestion that the job is cursed. 'It was unfortunate for the people concerned but not a poisoned chalice.' Here to stay: The first two women picked by Home Secretary Theresa May to head the inquiry had to stand down over their links with the Establishment, but Justice Goddard insists it is 'not a poisoned chalice' Elegant New Zealander Goddard, 66, is descended on her father's side from Renata Kawepo, chief of the Ngati Kahungunu Ki Heretaunga Maori iwi (tribe) in the mid-1800s. Her forefather's first name translates as Leonard Returns By Night, a quaint fusion of English and Maori. Although only one-sixteenth Maori, it shows in Goddard's tall, athletic frame. She was made a Dame last year, but talk of the Establishment is batted away. It doesn't exist where she comes from, she maintains. 'New Zealand is a classless society. We aren't concerned who people's great-grandfather was, it's what they do themselves that's important. 'How do I come to grips with the fact that there's a ruling class? Go about my job without fear or favour, that's how I operate.' She has a natural authority, but a relaxed air, too, as she demonstrated when her phone beeps during the interview. 'It's my husband wanting to know how long I'll be,' she says. Hopefully, not as long as your inquiry, I joked. 'No, or we'll be sitting here like Miss Havisham covered in cobwebs.' Goddard's father, New Zealand Air Force pilot Pat, was killed in an air crash when she was three. She was 20 when she fell in love with first husband Johnny Scott in 1969. Or to give him his full name, Sir Walter John Scott, 5th Baronet, of Beauclerc. As Establishment as they come. 'He's just Johnny,' she says. 'He was travelling with some chums.' Within months Johnny returned to England – with Lowell as his bride. A whirlwind romance? 'Probably. People didn't have these lengthy engagements that they have now. I get married, other people just live with people and apparently that's not remarkable. Ancestry: Goddard, 66, is descended on her father's side from Renata Kawepo (pictured), chief of the Ngati Kahungunu Ki Heretaunga Maori tribe . Axed: Baroness Butler-Sloss quit as chairman of the inquiry after questions were raised about her brother sitting in the Cabinet in the 1980s. Her replacement Fiona Woolf later resigned over her links to former home secretary Leon Brittan . 'These days people live with someone for years, get engaged for two years, then eventually get married, I can't see the point of it. 'When I married Johnny, I was still living at home.' A year later they had a daughter, Rebecca. But the marriage was quickly over. 'By Christmas 1970 I was very homesick. I came home with the baby and didn't go back. It was difficult for both of us.' Goddard was soon swept off her feet by another Englishman abroad, Tony Cotton, a lecturer at Auckland University, where she was studying. 'He was a gorgeous man,' she recalls. But their love was tragic. 'Tony had done voluntary service in Jordan and got hepatitis, it attacked his heart muscle and got worse. 'I knew he was dying but it mattered to him very much to marry me, so we did and he died a year later, just after my 26th birthday.' Goddard buried her head in her law studies – and being mum to daughter Becky. She is the first woman with Maori ancestry to become a High Court Judge in New Zealand. In 1992 she married third husband and fellow lawyer Christopher Hodson. The couple share a passion for horses – something that made child abuse survivors fear she was another member of the Establishment. 'They said, 'This sounds posh.' I told them it's not like that at home – most of our riders come from farms. In New Zealand, rugby, racing and beer are the national pastimes.' Goddard is no soft touch: as a New Zealand judge she handed out a record 28-year jail sentence to a child killer. 'Judges have to do more than simply take a 'legal' view,' she says. 'Judges are human beings. You have to look at the human misery that has been caused – and we're all shaped by our experiences.' The experiences that have shaped Goddard include having a 'lovely and sporty' Down's Syndrome brother, aged 64. But she fears the huge amount of internet pornography could encourage sex crimes. 'It can't be healthy. I'm sure psychologists would say the desensitisation gives it an artificial air of normalisation, which is very dangerous.' Goddard is a common-sense traditionalist with more than a dash of modern liberation. But not so modern or liberated to be interested in 50 Shades Of Grey. 'I haven't read the book and won't be seeing the film,' she grins. 'I gather it's pretty gross.'","Justice Lowell Goddard now heading inquiry into historic child sex abuse .

"An entire team of senior A&E doctors have resigned from a hospital earmarked for cuts. Four consultants at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, quit their jobs on Friday, following alleged rows with management. On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned. It means Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust will have to fill five vacancies in just a matter of months as the doctors work out their notice periods. Four consultants at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, quit their jobs on Friday, following alleged rows with management . Bosses are scrambling to find new staff at a time of unprecedented pressure on A&E departments and a shortage of consultants – a problem which has been highlighted by The Mail on Sunday’s Stop the Casualty Closures campaign. The shock resignations are a blow to campaigners hoping to save A&E services on the site and follow an apparent breakdown in relations between doctors and managers. It is understood all four handed in their notices on Friday after being interviewed and accepting offers at neighbouring Warwick Hospital. The crisis has led MPs to seek assurances from the trust that its A&E will remain fully staffed. The Alexandra survived a proposed downgrading in 2012 after an independent review warned that Worcestershire Royal could not cope with an extra 6,000 ambulances turning up on its doorstep each year if it closed. A further review by West Midlands Clinical Senate is due to report this month. Campaigners fear this latest setback could influence a decision, especially if the trust is unable to recruit new A&E consultants or locums in time. Karen Lumley, MP for Redditch County, said she and other MPs in the area were seeking an urgent response from the Health Secretary. On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned leaving the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust struggling to fill five vacancies in just a matter of months . ‘There is always natural wastage of staff but this is different,’ she added. ‘I am shocked and astonished that we have got to this stage. It is the trust’s responsibility to ensure the A&E is staffed properly.’ Dr Richard Taylor, co-leader of political party National Health Action, said: ‘This has been dragging on for years, leaving A&E consultants in limbo over their future amid fears the Alexandra will lose its A&E department. It’s not surprising they’ve decided to find secure, alternative jobs at another hospital.’ Neal Stote, of the Save The Alex Campaign, said: ‘This is devastating news. How has the trust allowed five members of staff to leave on the same day? There’s obviously an underlying problem with the capability of the trust to retain its staff.’ A spokesman for the trust said: ‘While there will always be differences of clinical opinion, all clinicians have had an opportunity to have their say and the final proposed model was endorsed by an Independent Clinical Review Panel in early 2014, subject to some further modifications.’","Four consultants at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch resigned on Friday .

"New York Times media columnist David Carr died of complications from metastatic lung cancer, according to autopsy results released Saturday. Julie Bolcer , a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office, said the autopsy shows heart disease also contributed to his death. Carr died at age 58 after collapsing in the Times newsroom. Scroll down for video . New York Times columnist David Carr died Thursday of lung cancer an autopsy has revealed . The father of three wrote the Media Equation column for the Times, focusing on issues of media in relation to business and culture. Just hours before his death, the veteran newsman tweeted about the death of his fellow journalist Bob Simon. 'RIP Bob Simon, a television storyteller without peer,' Carr wrote Wednesday. And just hours before news of his death broke Thursday evening, Carr participated in a TimesTalk, featuring Ed Snowden, among others. It's no surprise then that Carr's death came as a shock to so many. Initial reports, the New York Times' included, said Carr died in the newsroom. The Times' website now says Carr collapsed in the newsroom and later died at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital. The cause of death was not immediately known. Carr is survived by wife Jill Rooney Carr, an event planner with whom he lived in Montclair, New Jersey with their daughter Maddie. He also has twin daughters, Erin and Meagan. He joined the Times in 2002 as a business reporter, covering magazine publishing. His Media Equation column appeared in the Monday business section. Before joining the Times, Carr was a contributing writer for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. He also was a media writer for news website Inside.com. Carr served as editor of the Washington City Paper, an alternative weekly in Washington, D.C. He also was editor of a Minneapolis-based alternative weekly called Twin Cities Reader. Carr (at left on Thursday before his sudden death) well known for writing about his personal life and penned a memoir in 2008 The Night of the Gun in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction . Carr tweeted about the death of his fellow journalist Bob Simon just hours before his own death . Carr was well known for writing about his personal life and penned a memoir in 2008 The Night of the Gun in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction. The book, published by Simon and Schuster, traces Carr's rise from cocaine addict to single dad raising twin girls to sobered-up media columnist for the Times. Carr said he wrote up a book proposal 'on a dare to myself' in two days. After an agent sold the idea, Carr ended up interviewing about 60 people and working on the book for three years. He took the transcribed interviews, numerous documents and pictures to his family's cabin in the Adirondacks, where he wrote the book. Last year, Carr began teaching a Boston University class that explored the creative business models to support digital journalism. It was among the first professorships dedicated to evaluating how media organizations can sustain themselves financially as readers and advertisers migrate to digital platforms, a crisis that has doomed some news organizations and threatens the viability of others. Carr had written about the issue extensively. 'I think a lot of journalism education that is going on is broadly not preparing kids for the world that they are stepping into,' Carr told The Boston Globe.","David Carr died of lung cancer an autopsy has revealed .

"Dogs are known for being man's best friend, but after one dog stopped his owner from getting robbed at gunpoint he might soon be called man's best superhero instead. Thor, a Pit Bull-Boxer mix, didn't hesitate when a robber attacked his owner Justin Ireland, pouncing on the intruder and scaring him off in a matter of seconds. Ireland was working the afternoon shift at a gas station in Saco, Maine when he said a man walked up to the door and asked to use the phone. This is the moment a hero dog named Thor pounced on an intruder who attempted to rob his owner, Justin Ireland, at gunpoint in a  Maine gas station . 'I never let anyone in the building,' said Ireland. 'So I said no, I don't have a phone you can use.' The man then pulled out a gun and demanded money, before giving Ireland a hard shove. That was the moment, Ireland said, that Thor went on the attack, nipping at the robber's hand before biting him on both sides of the face, according to police. 'As soon as the guy laid a hand on me and I started yelling, that's when he went right after him,' Ireland told WGME 13. Ireland was working the evening shift when a man came up to the door and asked if he could use a phone. Ireland, who said he never lets anyone in the building, told the man no . The man then forced his way in and pulled out a gun, which Thor immediately sprung for, and demanded money . Thor immediately went on the attack, nipping at the robber's hand before biting him on both sides of the face . The robber fled in a matter of seconds and still remains at large. Ireland has never trained Thor and said the dog acted on sheer instinct . The intruder fled in a matter of seconds. Ireland, who has never trained Thor, said the three-year-old dog acted on sheer instinct. He said his boss has always liked having Thor around because 'he looks like good security'. Although Ireland ran after the robber, the man drove off and is still at large since the Tuesday attack. Police described the suspect as a 5'8 white male weighing 180 pounds who may have dog bites to his face. He was wearing a navy blue Gap hoodie during the attempted armed robbery and was carrying what Ireland said looked like a BB gun. The robber fled in a light blue Chevy Silverado truck.","Justin Ireland was working his shift at a gas station in Saco, Maine when a robber forced his way in with a gun and demanded money .

"America accused Russia of direct involvement in a ferocious bombardment of Ukrainian towns by rebel forces yesterday, as fears grew that last night's midnight ceasefire would not hold. On one of the bloodiest days of the conflict, pro-Moscow separatists tried to grab more territory before the deadline. The US ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, produced satellite images which he said showed Moscow's role in the escalating violence. The images purportedly showed Russian anti-aircraft batteries and artillery near Debaltseve, 45 miles north of Donetsk, the regional capital. 'We are confident these are Russian military, not separatists,' Mr Pyatt said. Scroll down for video . Death: Pro-Russian separatists stand next to the body of a soldier who died just hours before a ceasefire with Ukrainian soldiers was enforced . Ceasefire: From midnight, troops on either side are supposed to be abiding by the agreement thrashed out in Minsk on Thursday . 'The separatists now have a larger fighting force, with more tanks, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and rocket systems, than some Nato and European countries.' Local police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said: 'The rebels are destroying Debaltseve. There are non-stop artillery bombardments of residential areas. The town is in flames.' Seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 23 wounded in 24 hours in a conflict that has killed more than 5,300 people and displaced a million civilians. Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, insisted he would not respect a ceasefire and called on Ukrainian troops under siege in Debaltseve to surrender. If the fighting continues, the US may arm the Ukrainians, which could lead to the threat of a new Cold War. Last week a senior Obama administration official said Washington might consider sending 'defensive weapons' to Kiev if the Russians violated the ceasefire. Prepared: The Ukrainian military continues to train its newly mobilised recruits near Kiev . Collateral damage: Firefighters battle a blaze at a medical clinic which was hit by artillery fire . Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko warned that he would put his country under martial law – essentially on war footing – in the event of a Russian breach of the deal. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt, speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday last night, said: 'I fear the ceasefire will not last and in that event the best next step would be to press for international intervention and for a United Nations monitoring force to deploy to Ukraine in a bid to prevent further fighting. 'While Britain should commit troops to this force if invited, in the interests of neutrality it would likely be better that these soldiers were drawn from Germany and France.' Earlier Lord Dannatt described the sale of Saxon armoured troop carriers to Ukraine as 'nothing short of immoral', as the vehicles were so decrepit as to be 'quite useless'. They were sold by the Ministry of Defence to a private company in 2013 and then exported to Ukraine.","America has accused Russia of direct involvement in bombing of Ukraine .

"Plans to make Commons staff wear name badges have sparked a revolt by women who claim it will encourage male MPs to leer at their chests. They claim some MPs already ‘harass’ and ‘abuse’ them, and forcing people to wear name badges will make things worse. The badge plan is backed by the Commons’ governance committee, chaired by Labour MP Jack Straw. Women claim some MPs already ‘harass’ them, and forcing people to wear name badges will make things worse. File photo . It is designed to make it easier for parliamentary staff to be recognised by MPs and fellow staff. But when staff were asked for their views, it produced complaints from women and from men worried about how female colleagues would be affected. One person said: ‘Badges risk making younger or junior staff – especially women – more vulnerable. 'Harassment and rude comments by MPs are still commonplace. Having your name on show means the abuse can be personalised.’ Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the proposal . Another was ‘not comfortable with people staring at my chest to find out who I am’. A third staff member said: ‘A simple conversation should be sufficient in introducing ourselves to colleagues and to MPs, without encouraging strangers to peer at our chests.’ Acting Commons Clerk David Natzler has acknowledged the scale of protests, saying: ‘A number of female staff expressed objections on the basis that the position of the name badge would give some people an excuse to stare at their chests.’ Some staff are threatening to refuse to co-operate with the plan – estimated to cost as much as £8,000. ‘The badges will go in the bin, down the toilet or in the river,’ said one Commons official. The badge plan has also caused anger because it will not apply to MPs themselves. But senior Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the proposal. He said: ‘The male chauvinists of the House of Commons who stare at women’s chests like latter-day Sid Jameses from 1970s Carry On films will do that anyway, with or without a name badge. It won’t make the rest of us behave in such an undignified way.’ A Commons spokesman said: ‘We are piloting the policy while conducting an equality analysis.’","Plan backed by Commons’ governance committee, chaired by Jack Straw .

"A woman who received more than ten love letters from her boyfriend before Valentine's Day this year published them online for all the world to see - even though he didn't write them. Brandon Garner found 15 letters  John Edwin Walker wrote to the love of his life, Annie Elizabeth Goodyear, in 1916. Garner, who found the handwritten letters in a brick wall in a 19th century building in Raleigh, North Carolina, during renovations, promptly gave the notes to his girlfriend Kathryn Volpe. Brandon Garner found 15 letters written by John Edwin Walker to the love of his life, Annie Elizabeth Goodyear . Discovery: Kathryn Volpe with a trove of 15 century-old love letters discovered during renovation . After Garner (left) found the letters, he decided to give them to his girlfriend Kathryn Volpe (right) The letters from Walker to Goodyear were from 1916 and they were written on monogrammed stationery . A trove of 15 love letters from 1916, discovered during renovation of a 19th century building in Raleigh, N.C. After she got her hands on the letters, which were written in longhand on monogrammed stationery, Volpe decided to publish them  on her bakery's website. She was hoping to spread some ore-Valentine's Day love and also wanted to get help identifying the couple so she could give the letters to their family members. Volpe also fell in love with Walker and Goodyear according to theLos Angeles Times. It didn't hurt that Garner actually read several of the letters aloud to Volpe after he realized how much she liked them . She said: 'As cheesy as it sounds, I got that warm, fuzzy feeling — just all gushy inside. 'Anyone who has truly loved someone can identify with J. Edwin [John], even if they can't articulate their feelings as beautifully as he does.' Several of the 'tough guys' who were helping Garner renovate the building, which is now a martial arts gym, were also 'smitten' by the letters. The letters were found in a brick wall in a 19th century building in Raleigh, North Carolina, during renovations . After she got the letters, Volpe began publishing them on her bakery's website to help spread the love . Goodyear (pictured above) and Walker married in 1918 and then they separated in 1930 but did not divorce . The letters, which Walker wrote while he was living in a YMCA in Virginia, contain phrases such as 'yield up your own precious being to the impassioned arms and lips of him who bears this love for you' and 'sometimes a man will lose his useless head completely when his own love gives him the precious privilege of looking into her eyes'. Volpe published the last of the letters on Valentine's Day, along with all of the information she has about the couple. The final letter begins, 'My Lovely Sweetheart' and was sent in August of 1916.  It reads: 'How happy I was after you phoned me last night. 'I had been trying for a long long time to go asleep, but I couldn't. 1918: John Edwin Walker and Annie Elizabeth Goodyear were married. 1920-21: Lived in Atlanta, Georgia, with John Edwin working for Nash Motor Company. 1922-29: Lived in Raleigh with John working for Nash Motor Company and Southern Refrigerator Company. Early 1930: Lived in Springfield (question as to whether Missouri or Illinois. Later 1930: John and Annie separated but did not divorce. Annie went to Charlottesville, Virginia, to work at St. Anne's. John went to Sanford, North Carolina. 1971: John passed away in Sanford and Annie came down from Virgina to handle his affairs. 1990: Annie passed away in Charlottesville. 'Every moment found me more wakeful; and then the bell rang – cheerfully – surprisingly cheerful came your dear voice over the wire saying - “Are you there?” 'My own Darling, surely the people in the story we read were not more happy than are we in the new joy we found in the phone last night. 'And you discovered it! Just like you discovered me – and my heart and soul. O the vibrant whispers – they were so sweet. You were at my side! 'Then when you hung up, you came running, and in a minute you had found the haven of rest I had made for you in my arms, and with your own arms about me and mine around you, in the full knowledge of God, and with the most wonderful bliss of love to us, we slept!' Records show that Goodyear and Walker were married in 1918. He was 26; she was 22. They lived in Raleigh for more than ten years before hitting a rough patch and separating in 1930. The couple never officially divorced, but Goodyear began living in Virginia while Walker remained in North Carolina. Walker died alone of  'diverticular colon' in 1971 at the ago of 70. After his death, Goodyear traveled to North Carolina to deal with her husband's affairs. She died 19 years later in 1990 at age 94. Goodyear and Walker lived together in Raleigh for more than ten years before separating after a rough patch . Garner (right) actually read several of the letters aloud to Volpe (left) after he realized how much she liked them . After Walker's death in 1971, Goodyear traveled to North Carolina to deal with his affairs. She died in 1990 . Volpe summed up their story like this: 'J. Edwin and Annie were in their early 20s when he wrote the love letters, and there is no doubt that his professions of devotion and adoration were truly genuine. 'They were in love, got married, moved around the country, and then...who knows? 'We can speculate for days on why they might have separated, but at one time, they loved each other deeply and were able to realize it in marriage and life together. 'And that, to me, is a happy story.' When she published, the final letter today, Volpe revealed she had an ulterior motive for sharing Goodyear and Walker with the world. She wrote: 'Before we get to the final letter, I must confess the third reason I wanted to publish these. 'I was hoping to inspire people (my boyfriend included) to take a cue from J. Edwin and start penning love notes...' Only time will tell if Garner takes the hint.","Brandon Garner presented the letters to Kathryn Volpe after he found them .

"A family's Christmas presents arrived six weeks late after bungling postmen sent their gifts to Cambodia instead of Cambridge. The battered cardboard parcel arrived at the Cary family's home last Saturday from friends in Paris - after it went on a 12,000 mile round trip from the South East Asian country. It was only after the box arrived with a sticker saying 'missent to Cambodia' that they realised the French word for the country is Cambodge and the address had been misread. Joe (right), 14, Sam (left), 10, and five-year-old Anna Cary (centre) thought their Christmas presents from friends in Paris had been lost in the post . When the parcel arrived last Saturday it had a stamp on it saying it had been 'missent to Cambodia' - more than 6,000 miles away . The box, which contained three books for Joe, 14, Sam, 10 and Anna, five, is estimated to have cost ParcelForce around £120 to send and arrived 50 days late. Teenager Joe, who was delighted with his gift despite the delay, said: 'It must have stopped off in a lot of countries, because there's no direct route to Cambodia. 'They do live up to their ""Worldwide delivery"" slogan. 'It was a bit of a shock when we got a very battered parcel from the depot. It was really nice to receive. Joe Cary holds up the battered box, which arrived last week, after it cost ParcelForce an estimated £120 to sent back . The parcel travelled 6,142 miles (9884km) back from Cambodia to Cambridge after the address was misread . 'I think the sheer novelty of them having gone to Cambodia and back takes the sentimental value up.' The Paris-based friends who sent the parcel contacted the family in early January to see if the presents had been received and everyone assumed they had been lost in the post. The books were Lamentation by C J Sansom for Joe, a Terry Pratchett novel for Sam and a picture book for Anna.","The battered cardboard box arrived at Cary family's home last Saturday .

"Britain has signed up to a Nato initiative to share billions of pounds of military hardware with other countries, potentially leaving the UK incapable of fighting its own wars, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Under the scheme, heavy weapons, aircraft and ships will be pooled in an effort to save money and promote co-operation. But last night retired Air Vice Marshal Sir John Walker said military actions such as defending the Falkland Islands would be impossible if this country were sharing large quantities of vital equipment. He said: 'If we intend to act alone, Britain simply has to have its own kit. Lending and borrowing on the scale being envisaged here isn't wise in the long term.' Britain has signed up to a Nato initiative to share billions of pounds of military hardware, including Challenger 2 tanks . British defence chiefs confirmed that they have signed up to the Lead Nation Procurement Initiative to permit 'flexible sharing' of equipment between the 28 countries of Nato – the security alliance set up after the Second World War. The scheme was launched earlier this month and is being run by a branch of the US military called the Defence Security Co-operation Agency. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Nato last night declined to disclose details about what assets Britain may share, but experts believe the UK could soon agree to let the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia use its top-secret Skynet 5 military satellite system. Retired Air Vice Marshal Sir John Walker fears British security will be compromised . And as Britain is without any sea patrol aircraft to protect its airspace from incursions by Russian jets, experts believe that a deal will be struck for the UK to borrow a fleet of specialist US planes. Tanks, rockets, and heavy artillery may also be shared between countries as the scheme, which has begun with a two-year trial, is rolled out. Most will be manufactured in the US and sold to European states which then agree to share the equipment with their neighbours. It is understood Britain will benefit financially from any leasing arrangements when it buys kit which it then makes available to Nato partners for collective use. But Sir John fears British security will be compromised by the scheme. He said: 'Britain cannot be continually lending and borrowing equipment which is vital to national security – not if we ever intend to act independently, as we would be required to if the security of the Falkland Islands were compromised. 'It smacks of defence on the cheap and it is sickening that it is being introduced at a time when Russia is increasing its military spending.' Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said that although the scheme offered efficiencies, it was going down 'a tricky road'. He added: 'The introduction of this scheme should not be used by Nato members, Britain included, as an excuse to further reduce defence spending.' An MoD spokesman said last night: 'The UK will of course consider this opportunity along with all other procurement options on a case-by-case basis to ensure maximum value for money for the taxpayer.'","Britain has signed up to share billions of pounds of military hardware .

"For centuries France has held out against the dull language of 'les rosbifs' just across the Channel. But now the country's future leaders have been told they must master English – a dramatic climbdown for a nation that has tried to ban words such as 'le weekend' from encroaching on its precious vocabulary. ENA, the elite National School of Administration in Strasbourg, which produces the French governing class, is to make mastery of English a compulsory rule of entry from 2018. Nathalie Loiseau, director of the elite National School of Administration in Strasbourg, which produces the French governing class, has said the school will make mastery of English a compulsory rule of entry from 2018 . An ENA spokeswoman said fluency in English was essential to run a modern state, and that potential students had to be prepared. The move is in defiance of traditionalists including former French President Jacques Chirac, who in 2006 pledged to stop the spread of English internationally. 'We fight for our language,' said Mr Chirac, himself an ENA graduate, after walking out of a European Union summit when a French business chief spoke in English. 'I was profoundly shocked to see a Frenchman express himself in English,' said Mr Chirac. 'You cannot base a future world on just one language, just one culture. It would be a dramatic decline.' Nathalie Loiseau, ENA's director, confirmed that the reform reflected a break with the past, saying French words are stuffy and outdated. 'The usual words such as 'sacrifice', 'vocation' and 'commitment' sound half religious, half military,' she said. The move is in defiance of traditionalists including former French President Jacques Chirac (pictured) who in 2006 pledged to stop the spread of English internationally .","National School of Administration is making English fluency a requirement .

"Cost-cutting officials decided it would be too expensive to investigate concerns over gases coming from a landfill site now blamed for the death of a seven-year-old boy in last year’s floods. Experts flagged up a ‘high risk’ of contamination on land at the back of the home of tragic schoolboy Zane Gbangbola as early as 2010. But the internal report for the Environment Agency (EA) also discloses that Spelthorne Borough Council’s contaminated-land officer advised against testing the land on the grounds of cost. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Zane's devastated parents Kye and Nicole Gbangbola, pictured right, are still battling to find out the truth about their son’s sudden death last February . The shocking revelation is the latest twist in the battle by the boy’s grieving parents Kye and Nicole Gbangbola to find out the truth about their son’s sudden death last February. Zane was overcome by fumes while he slept as floodwaters rose in the basement of the family’s home in Chertsey, Surrey. His parents were also rushed to hospital and diagnosed as suffering from hydrogen cyanide poisoning, which has left Kye, 49, a paraplegic. A post-mortem into Zane’s death found he suffered ‘carbon monoxide poisoning’ after police suggested a gas leak from a petrol-driven flood pump was responsible – but no such pump was in use at the time.

The houses in Chertsey, Surrey, surrounded by flood waters close to the old landfill site (bottom left field) The EA commissioned a study of the site in April 2010 when it planned to build a cabin for workers next door to the Gbangbolas’ home. But when contamination fears were raised, the local council advised it was cheaper for the EA to simply protect its own property with a gas-proof membrane rather than carry out gas monitoring – and not warn neighbouring residents. Mrs Gbangbola, 37, said last night: ‘It sickens me that neither the EA or the council even warned us we were living next to a landfill site and there may be lethal gases. But to find out we were kept in the dark for financial reasons is devastating.’ An EA spokesman said: ‘We have worked with Surrey Police and await the coroner’s findings.’ Spelthorne Borough Council failed to respond.","Zane was overcome by fumes as he slept as floodwaters rose in Surrey .

"Anti-terror police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of being a member of or supporting ISIS in east London. Counter Terrorism officers visited an address in Newham this morning where the man, who has not been named, was detained. He is suspected of collecting information used to commit terrorism offences, belonging to or supporting the Islamic extremist organisation and encouraging terrorism. A 32-year-old man has been arrested in east London on suspicion of supporting ISIS, the terror organisation waging jihad in the Middle East. Above, a member in the group's Syrian stronghold Raqqa . He will be held at a south London police station while investigators continue their inquiries. ISIS, the fanatical organisation wreaking terror across Syria and parts of Iraq, was proscribed by the Government in June last year. It came after hundreds were slaughtered by militants in the Middle East. Several western and Asian journalists reporting on the conflict have since been executed on camera, while the group brutally burned alive a Jordanian pilot in their most recent slaying. Earlier this week police in Merseyside and the West Midlands made three arrests in relation to terrorism offences. The suspects were held over social media postings. They are unrelated to the today's arrest. Meanwhile in October last year, CT officers carried out a number of raids across London in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of offences relating to terrorism. The raids were part of an extensive police operation. Metropolitan Police would not confirm whether today's arrest was related to any of those made previously by CT investigators.

"A 29 year old first-time mother diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer has vowed to defy her doctors and beat the disease so she can take her daughter to her first day at kindergarten. On Boxing Day 2014, just three months after giving birth to her beautiful daughter Charlotte, Kate Vincent, from Newcastle in NSW, was told the killer disease was 'advanced' and had large clusters of tumours in her liver and lungs. Distraught and shocked, the young mum fleetingly let her mind wander about the worst case scenario but seven weeks on, Kate told Daily Mail Australia that she was now determined to fight the illness head on, and letting it win just wasn't an option. 29 year old first-time mother Kate Vincent (pictured) was diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer and has vowed to defy her doctors and beat the disease so she can take her daughter Charlotte (pictured) to her first day at kindergarten . 'In the really low moments it crushes your mind and I think it would be abnormal if I didn't (think about the worst),' Kate said. Her husband, Nathan, has been her rock through the tough times along with her amazing support group of family and friends and she believes that they are the reason she is willing to fight this battle. 'I'm not going anywhere and I was given this (cancer) for a reason and that reason is to find that other part of myself that I didn't know existed. The fight is on.' she said. With no symptoms and a newborn baby to look after, Kate, who is on maternity leave from her job as a teacher, ignored a lump under her ribs, putting it down to the effects her pregnancy and labour had on her body. On Boxing Day 2014, just three months after giving birth to her beautiful daughter Charlotte (pictured left) , Kate Vincent, from Newcastle in NSW, was told the killer disease was 'advanced' and had large clusters of tumours in her liver and lungs. She is pictured here with her husband Nathan. The young mother, pictured here on her wedding day to Nathan Vincent has vowed to fight the deadly disease . 'I just thought it’s hormones and it’s my body changing and getting back into shape after I’d had my baby,' she said. 'It just so happened that I took my baby to the doctor because I thought she had a little bit of a cold and while I was there I asked my GP to feel the lump and she said ""That’s your liver, we might get that checked out"".' Kate wasn't worried throughout her following CT scan on Christmas Eve, never allowing herself to think that the lump may turn out to be cancer. The diagnosis came as a huge shock to her and her husband but she says she was 'lucky in a way' that the tumour had spread to her liver as she would never have known about the bowel cancer if those lumps were not showing. She also said it has raised awareness that the disease can strike at any stage and doesn't just happen 'to 70-year-old men'. 'There have been so many messages from people who I've never met before and it’s overwhelming how it’s touched a lot of people because I think they don’t realise that this can happen to a 29-year-old.' the mother said. The diagnosis came as a huge shock to her and her husband Nathan (pictured) but she says she was 'lucky in a way' that the tumour had spread to her liver as she would never have known about the bowel cancer if those lumps were not showing. However, there was worse news to come, as a week after being told the devastating news that she had an 8cm tumour in her liver, her doctor gave her the dreadful news that it was incurable . However, there was worse news to come, as a week after being told the devastating news that she had an 8cm tumour in her liver, her doctor gave her the dreadful news that it was incurable. 'When I found out that it was cancer and that it was bowel cancer and that it had spread to the liver I was distraught and it was horrible,' she said. 'It was probably about a week and half after that I was told it was incurable. Kate said she can't describe the feeling of being told you may die from cancer, however after coming to terms with her doctor's diagnosis, she is positive she can overcome the illness. 'It was very surreal because you are thinking positively the whole time and to hear that it's incurable I can’t really describe what it was like,' the mother-of-one said, . 'I'm feeling very positive and I think my doctor would like me to prove him wrong.' While dealing with the fact that she may never see her daughter take her first steps, Kate had to take care of her three-month-old baby. Charlotte, who is now over five-months-old, is the reason Kate has adopted an optimistic approach to her treatment. 'Luckily we've been blessed with a very settled and beautiful baby who does all the right things at the right time so we’re very lucky in that way,' she said. 'She’s wonderful. We have got so much family and friends support around us which is really handy. Kate said she can't describe the feeling of being told you may die from cancer, however after coming to terms with her doctor's diagnosis, she is positive she can overcome the illness . 'On the days that I'm not feeling wonderful I've got so much family support around that they can take Charlotte and look after her while I recover myself.' Kate has already had two rounds of chemotherapy and has six left, with her third round of treatment starting tomorrow. She admits that she's been fine with her therapy and has had no side effects yet. 'Physically I feel fine so that makes it a hell of a lot easier to be positive about everything.' For now, Kate is in the middle of launching a support group for mothers who are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. She believes it's important for women to talk about what might happen 'if I don't get to see them start kindergarten and how that feels for everybody else'. 'It's very difficult for  friends to relate to where I'm coming from. There is nothing out there for young mums,' Kate said. 'To be told that I may not see her grow up, I don’t think that people who aren't in that situation can quite fathom what that must be like for me. I don’t want it to be a big sob story but I think it’s really important to talk to people who are in the same boat.' While dealing with the fact that she may never see her daughter take her first steps, Kate had to take care of her three-month-old baby. Charlotte, who is now over five-months-old, is the reason Kate has adopted an optimistic approach to her treatment . A Mycause page called Something For Kate set up by her best friend's husband has already raised over $46,000 for Kate and Bowel Cancer Australia . A Mycause page called Something For Kate set up by her best friend's husband has already raised over $48,000 for Kate and Bowel Cancer Australia. Kate requested that 60 percent of the money be given to charity and the remaining 40 percent to her and her family. 'That’s been a really overwhelming part of it. The response has been very overwhelming and obviously you realise that it brings out the best in people I suppose when they realise that something like this is going on,' she said. 'It can kind of scare people into thinking it could happen to them. It’s been great because it has really raised the awareness for people and it’s out there now. We’re getting a lot of responses from people realising that it is a disease that can affect people at any age.' Initially when the funding page was set up, just looking at the comments upset Kate, reminding her of the long road ahead of her. However, the messages of support now provide her with some much needed comfort in her dark times. 'The message of support have been the thing that I really hold on to. While it may make me cry every time I thought about it, holding on to those lovely words has really given me a lot to hold on to in my times that I'm not feeling very positive.'

"In 2005 a man made history when he shot a short clip for a video sharing site, but he didn't even know what the webpage was for when he did it. Yakov Lapitsky recorded 'Me at the Zoo', an 18-second video of his friend shot in front of elephants in San Diego, on April 23 that year, becoming the first person to shoot for YouTube. The video, which has now been viewed more than 17million times, would transform the way that people use the Internet, watch television and communicate with each other over the past ten years. The site is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its domain name today. Scroll down for video . Yakov Lapitsky, now 34, unknowingly shot the first ever video uploaded to YouTube in 2005, a clip of his friend Jawed Karim (pictured) at the San Diego Zoo. The site turns 10 years old today . Mr Lapitsky, now 34, was working as a doctoral student at the University of Delaware when he shot his friend Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo speaking about the elephants' trunks. He didn't even know about the video going up on YouTube until a month after his trip to California when Mr Karim posted it, according to the Toledo Blade. Mr Karim, now 36, along with PayPal coworkers Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, had registered the domain name YouTube earlier that year. The site would officially launch in November 2005, quickly racking up more than a million viewers per month by the next summer. Now more than 1billion users use YouTube everyday and 300 hours of video, 60,000 times longer than the zoo clip, are uploaded every minute. 'I didn't think much of it other than it was pretty adorable,' Mr Lapitsky, now an environmental engineering professor at University of Toledo, told the New York Daily News. What started as cute videos quickly became lucrative, and tech giant Google bought the company in 2006 for $1.65billion, when it was still unprofitable. Founders Mr Hurley, Mr Chen and Mr Karim are all now in different ventures. Mr Karim (left) has since moved on to other ventures after YouTube, which sold to Google in 2006. Mr Lapitsky (right), a doctoral student in Delaware in 2005, is now a professor of environmental engineering in Toledo . YouTube founders Chad Hurley (left) and Steve Chen (pictured in 2008) helped officially launch the video-sharing website in November, 2005 . The site is now used for applications as diverse presidential debates, official music videos, web television series, clips of people's pets and Internet-only news outlets. It has expanded to 75 countries and 61 languages and had $3.6billion in net revenue in 2013. The video sharing service is expected to reach $18.5billion in revenue yearly by 2019, according to Forbes. But the beginnings of the site were small, with individuals uploading their grainy camera footage by bits and bytes at a time. The beginning days of YouTube were not dominated by music videos, and independent producers such as Adam Quick posted grainy self-shot videos (pictured) Adam Quick, then 25, posted a video called 'Vernal Lullaby' in the first week of the site's experimental launch in May promoting a band called QOTSA. The music video was the 15th ever video on the site. Many of the first videos were silly snapshots of life captured on camera, people propping themselves up on corridor walls or a man getting his head shaved. 'It kind of blew us away,' Mr Quirk said. 'The videos just went straight up there to YouTube. It was pretty big for me.' YouTube now has copyright agreements with major record companies, and most of the most popular videos are from artists' official accounts. An entire economy has sprung up from independent content producers receiving money from companies to advertise or mention products on their channels. 1. PSY - GANGNAM STYLE (강남스타일) M/V . 2.24billion views since July 15, 2012 .

"David Cameron is 'turning a blind eye' to tax avoidance according to Ed Miliband who vowed to investigate wealthy firms who dodge paying billions of pounds. The Labour leader said the rich should play by the same rules as the poor and accused the Coalition of 'shrugging its shoulders over tax avoidance'. In a speech to a party conference in Swansea he promised to stage an 'aggressive' review into Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – if he were to win May's general election. Mr Miliband said the Government had failed to close loopholes that allow companies to be registered in tax havens such as Jersey and the Cayman Islands. Pictured: Labour party leader Ed Miliband addressing delegates Saturday 14 February 2015 . Re: Welsh Labour Conference 2015 at Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, south Wales, UK. It comes in the  same week a political row broke out over claims the British bank HSBC helped wealthy clients avoid or evade tax through its Swiss private banking arm. 'In Britain today we risk having one rule for the rich and powerful and another for everybody else,' said Mr Miliband. 'What we are seeing is the growth of hugely complex and aggressive tax avoidance schemes, often based offshore. 'The sort of activity that has left the United Kingdom a £34 billion hole in our nation's finances. 'That's why we have to act. Because this Government has simply shrugged its shoulders over tax avoidance. It has failed to take action on tax havens. 'All kinds of businesses find HMRC chases them for every penny they owe, but they suspect there are sweetheart deals with a few of the largest, multinational companies that aren't paying their fair share.' Prime Minister David Cameron was accused of 'turning a blind eye' to tax avoidance . The Labour leader has spent the week lambasting ‘tax dodgers’ in the wake of the HSBC scandal, but he has also faced questions over his own family’s practices. Mr Miliband and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide the ownership of the family home in North London . These legal documents – which change the terms of someone’s will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance. Mr Miliband said his proposed probe could have full investigatory powers and support from the Treasury as well reporting directly to the Chancellor. He told delegates: 'While this Government has had five years of inaction, we will begin from the first days we are in government and it will report within three months. 'We will ensure we are a country where there is responsibility from top to bottom. 'The Government's failure to tackle tax avoidance is no accident. 'It has turned a blind eye to tax avoidance because it thinks that so long as a few at the top do well, the country succeeds. 'It thinks that wealth and power fence people off from responsibility. It thinks the rules only apply to everybody else. 'We will act because we have a different vision of how our country succeeds. It doesn't matter how much I get attacked for this, I'm not backing down. 'I will stand up to all those who stand in the way of success for working families.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls welcomed his party leader's comments. Former boss of HSBC Stephen Green has stepped down from his position with a financial services lobby group after tax avoidance allegations . He added: 'We will close the loopholes, increase transparency and toughen up penalties. 'But we also need HMRC to do a much better job. This review of HMRC's culture and practices in the first weeks of a Labour government is so vital. 'HMRC needs to be fit for purpose and this review will help us make it so.' The Conservatives laughed off Labour's proposals - saying their rivals could not be trusted with the economy. A party spokesman said: 'The culture and practices of HMRC went wrong under Labour - when top bankers paid lower tax rates than their cleaners, foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax and the richest people routinely avoided paying stamp duty. 'It's David Cameron who has been clearing up Labour's mess - investing in HMRC to increase the number of prosecutions of tax dodgers, putting reform of the way multinational companies are taxed at the top of the G8 agenda and closing loopholes that the richest were exploiting under Labour. 'So the question for Ed Miliband is whether this inquiry would include Labour's record during the age of irresponsibility that he was at the heart of.'","Ed Miliband vowed to investigate wealthy firms who dodge paying billions .

"The fighting was as fierce as I have ever known it. Last night, 36 hours after world leaders agreed peace, a Ukrainian base near the front line of the war was being violently, ruthlessly pounded by those who wished to be ruled by Russia. Here in Mariupol, the notion that conciliation could be found any time soon seemed ludicrous. This city is a key prize for the pro-Russian separatists. Fighting raged at the front lines on its eastern outskirts all day as the rebel tanks tried to push ahead. Ukrainian positions were bombarded ceaselessly by rebel artillery in a bid to hoist the Russian flag over the town hall tonight. The deputy commander of the Ukrainian 37th Mechanised Battalion told me the rebels attacked 12 times. He expected the shelling of government positions that started at 5am yesterday to continue throughout the night. The officer said: 'Our scouts and intelligence people saw the enemy bringing up scores of new, modern Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers along the road from their positions at the town of Novoazovsk east of here. 'Why would they be hauling up lots of new armour if they were planning a ceasefire?' Scroll down for video . Escalation: Askold Krushelnycky writes the conflict 'has intensified dramatically in the last week, leading to real fears of a full-blown war between the West and Russia' Our conversation was interrupted by an excited voice crackling over his radio: 'The Russians are pulling up more armoured vehicles towards our lines!' The commander hurriedly left the room: soon there was the sound of heavy engines revving as some of the battalion's own armoured vehicles prepared to move out towards the threat. Earlier, a Ukrainian soldier who had been in the thick of fighting all day at the nearby town of Sherokin told me of the pro-Russian separatists' dawn mass attack. He said Ukrainian forces replied with artillery and small groups of men with anti-armour weapons who moved forward to try to knock out rebel tanks. He said: 'We had to commit a lot of our forces there to prevent them from outflanking us. We're managing to hold our positions but the fighting was hellish.' He reported casualties both among Ukrainian troops and civilians. Europe's leaders are desperate to tamp down the conflict in Ukraine. No wonder: it has intensified dramatically in the last week, leading to real fears of a full-blown war between the West and Russia. Ukrainians have watched their outgunned and outnumbered forces taking heavy casualties over the past days. Ironically, the one event of the last week that actually cheered them was the one that Britons rightly feel most queasy about: the advance shipment of 20 British Saxon armoured cars to Ukraine, with another 55 on the way. The rugged vehicles, which are ex-British Army, have since 1970 transported soldiers through battle zones. Here, they have lifted morale. At one pub in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on Friday evening, a table of people stood up as someone toasted 'Glory to the English'. Undedogs: 'Ukrainians have watched their outgunned and outnumbered forces taking heavy casualties over the past days' Price of war: Pro-Russian separatists stand next to the body of a soldier who died just hours before a ceasefire with Ukrainian soldiers was enforced . The Saxons have been delivered by a private firm which now owns them; but are a hugely symbolic totem of British material. To many, they represent the 'tooling up' of Ukraine by the West – the first palpable evidence of Britain having an interest in a conflict against Russia. Indeed, there is speculation here that the arrival of the Saxons might herald a split in ranks with Germany and France, which are steadfastly against arming Ukraine. On Friday, Ukrainian President Poroshenko paraded himself proudly by one of the Saxons. Soon they will be fitted out with guns. What will the effect be of images of pro-Russian victims of British hand-me-downs? No wonder alarm bells are ringing in Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, America and Canada have indicated they might supply Ukraine with weapons if the pro-Russian forces break the ceasefire. Russia, predictably enough, has said it would view weapons supplies to Ukraine as a direct threat to its security. Vladimir Putin's position is, of course, absurd. He denies supplying weapons and men to the rebels in Ukraine – but both Nato and Western intelligence have no doubt he is lying. They say there is plenty of proof that Russia has not only been supplying the rebels with heavy weaponry but that Russian regular soldiers are fighting alongside the separatists. US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, yesterday said satellite photos showed large numbers of weaponry being massed on the border with Ukraine and said that some of the tanks being used 'are Russian military, not separatist systems'. Pyatt added: 'The separatists now have more tanks, APCs, artillery and missile systems than some European Nato countries.' So now the ominous question is: are we being sucked, day by dangerous day, into a desperately perilous scenario? Are we being dragged into the unthinkable: a war with Russia? Conflict: Russian-backed separatist sniper plays with a dog as he and others wait for transport preparing to leave towards frontline, in the village of Vergulivka, just outside Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine . Consider this: the last time I was in this port city, last summer, I accompanied Ukrainian forces who took it from pro-Russian rebels after a short but vicious battle. Then, both sides were poorly armed, mostly with Kalashnikovs and a few mortars. Most of the rebels fled and about 20 were killed. There were no civilian casualties or buildings destroyed. Now the rebels – who want to carve out a pro-Russian state and make no secret that they eventually would like to be absorbed into the Russian Federation – have Russian tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The rebels' arms can only be coming from Russia. Many western countries believe they are working according to a plan by Putin to rebuild a new Russian-led empire. Those western politicians arguing for arming Ukraine compare Putin's actions to those of Hitler snatching Czechoslovakia, warning that appeasing him would only increase the dangers of more Kremlin aggression. Others fear that it would be impossible to contain the conflict within Ukraine's borders and it would spill over into neighbouring countries that were former components of the Soviet empire but are now Nato members – such as Poland and the Baltic countries. Putin was a reluctant member at the peace talks last week. Today will show whether he will risk edging Europe into an unimaginable conflagration… that is, unimaginable to anyone who knows nothing about the Second World War.","Ukrainian base bombed 36 hours after world leaders agreed ceasefire deal .

"It is news that will be welcome to anyone infuriated by Stephen Fry’s incessant swearing during the Baftas awards ceremony last weekend. The broadcaster says he is going to fall silent. The 57-year-old who is known both for his verbosity and as a prolific tweeter, broke the news of his self-imposed silence to his eight million Twitter followers yesterday. Stephen Fry, left, has announced that he is taking a holiday from Twitter for 'a while', right . The Tweet linked to his own website where he explained the reason behind his decision . He wrote: ‘Dearest Twitter followers and other interested (or bored) parties. Just a quick note to say that I’m going to be away until May. During that time I will be taking a holiday from Twitter and, with a few exceptions, not tweeting at all.’ The star said that a few automatic tweets would still appear, but that it would not mean he was logging on or monitoring his Twitter feed. Fry, who announced his recent marriage to his 27-year-old partner Elliott Spencer on the social media site, signed off: ‘Well, off I go. Have a wonderful time without me. I know you will.’ Fry faced criticism for swearing and making sexual references while presenting last weekend’s Baftas at the Royal Opera House. The recorded version of the night was broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on Sunday, and prompted a number of complaints. Last month, Fry revealed his plans for his travels with Spencer, saying: ‘We’re delaying our honeymoon until after the Baftas so I can relax for longer. We’re planning a huge adventure. ‘We’re going to start in Cuba because it’s one of my favourite countries in the world and we’ve got a romantic hideaway. And then we’ll go to about three or four more countries.’ Fry added: ‘I’m very happy.

"A bizarre sheet of wispy clouds billowing over the Teton mountain range has been enchanting tourists and even veteran employees of the Wyoming national park. Drivers stopped along the Grant Teton National Park's main highway on Thursday morning to gaze in awe and shoot photos of the rare phenomenon hovering over Grand Teton mountain. At 13,770 feet above sea level, the mountain is the highest point in the Teton Range. The shape-shifting clouds at times appeared like a billowing handkerchief or seagull with its beak touching the mountain's summit, Grand Teton National Park spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said. She first spotted them on her morning drive to work. 'I had to make myself pay attention to the road because I was like, ""Wow, that is really strange,""' Skaggs said Friday. The clouds persisted through the morning before finally dissipating in the afternoon. They were lenticular clouds, a type that forms downwind of mountain ranges in certain conditions. Occasionally, lenticular clouds occur as perfectly symmetrical disks, appearing like giant flying saucers and prompting UFO reports. These particular lenticular clouds resulted from an unusual combination of strong wind and moisture between 13,000 and 14,000 feet, said Riverton-based National Weather Service meteorologist Chris Jones, who got wind of the event from several weather spotters. 'We see these clouds get shaped both by the topography of the mountain and also the way the air will flow over the mountains,' Jones said. 'It was just in the right place at the right time.'","Drivers stopped along park's main highway on Thursday to take photos .

"A mother left her two children at home without food or heat while she went on a three-week trip abroad. The youngsters one aged 10 and 13, were left to fend for themselves while their mother attended a family wedding in Nigeria. It is understood they had continued to go to school while she was away but when officers visited the home, they found the house was in an unkempt condition while the children had no food or heating. A mother who left her children home alone for three weeks while she went to a family wedding in Nigeria has been arrested by Greater Manchester Police (pictured) on suspicion of child neglect . The mother, who lives in Salford in Greater Manchester, has since been arrested on suspicion of child neglect and her children were taken into care. Police said she had left the family home on January 28 to fly out to the wedding and had intended to stay out of the country until next week. But she flew back to the UK early on Wednesday after being alerted that the authorities were investigating. The woman was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport and questioned before being bailed.

So much has happened to Lallana since winning his first cap against Chile 12 months ago – from his wedding to the World Cup to a £23.7million move to Liverpool – it has been difficult, at times, to digest but there is no suggestion he wants merely to sit back and reflect on what has gone. Lallana is pictured mimicking the front cover of the new Assassin's Creed Unity game . Adam Lallana has had a busy year, from his wedding to the World Cup to a big-money move to Liverpool . Lallana (left) celebrates with Philippe Coutinho after scoring a goal for Liverpool against West Brom . His thoughts are focused on self-improvement; his ambitions are centred on making an impact for club and country and showing why he was prised away from Southampton for one of the biggest transfer fees of the summer. There is much for Lallana to prove for Liverpool and England – after games against Slovenia and Scotland, the focus will turn to the Barclays Premier League and then the Champions League – but it is a challenge for which he is ready. ‘When you put it like that, yes, it has been a great year with everything that has gone on,’ said Lallana. ‘A lot of things have happened and it will take some going to beat it next year. That is what I am going to try to do. Hopefully we can win a trophy this season. ‘We all know results (for Liverpool) haven’t been to the level we want them to be – we have to just keep working hard. I can’t guarantee that results are going to change imminently, but I can assure you we are working hard for it to happen. I am enjoying it. The Liverpool midfielder admits there is no time for reflection as he looks to step up his impact . This time last year, Lallana made his international  debut for England against Chile at Wembley . ‘We have got a nice couple of games coming up internationally, and we all know we are facing a big couple of Champions League games, plus we need to pick our form up in the league. I feel I am settling into the team nicely, albeit I want to up my contribution.’ That is now the big issue for Lallana. It is one thing thriving on the south coast, where the expectancy is less intense, but quite another to deliver in the goldfish bowl of Merseyside, where the pressure to deliver is unrelenting. Stewart Downing, who has just reclaimed his place in the England squad, once spoke of life at Liverpool as being a ‘culture shock’ and Lallana recognises what the West Ham midfielder meant. The spotlight in the city is always on. ‘It is a big difference coming from Southampton,’ he said. ‘I was expecting that. It is something I’m learning to deal with and you just have to take it on board. The expectation is there, so you are expected to play better and more consistently.’ This week, Lallana (left) is on international duty once more, pictured tussling with Arsenal's Jack Wilshere . Lallana says he would like to win a trophy with Liverpool this season . The same is true about England. Lallana, who grew up idolising Zinedine Zidane, could be classed as being a fixture in Roy Hodgson’s squad but, since that first run out against Chile, he has yet to establish himself as a regular starter. His 11 appearances added up to 575 minutes but last month was a breakthrough, as he completed the full game against Estonia in Tallinn and is looking to build on that when Slovenia visit on Saturday; such fixtures might not capture the imagination of the public but Lallana sees it differently. ‘It is about knowing what is in store at the end (of the qualification programme),’ says Lallana. ‘We don’t play for England week in, week out so when we meet up we know what the job is and we do all the preparation we need to. Lallana tries to take the ball past Chris Smalling during a wet and windy training session at St George's Park . Lallana's first season at Anfield has already seen him face the might of Real Madrid in the Champions League . ‘We are favourites to go through our group but we know we can’t get complacent, we have to respect every team we play. The minute you take your foot off the gas, there are teams out there who cause upsets.’ He will leave nothing to chance. Not on Saturday and certainly not next Tuesday, when hostilities are resumed across the border with Scotland. It will be a special night in Glasgow but Lallana is not sure it should become an annual occurrence. ‘Maybe it makes it special because it isn’t so regular,’ he says. ‘It makes it more interesting. Of course I understand it is a special fixture and everyone wants the bragging rights. It is a game we are looking forward to. The more competitive, the better.’ Adam Lallana was styled as French assassin, Arno Dorian, the hero of Assassin’s Creed ®Unity available now on Xbox One, the all-in-one games and entertainment system from Microsoft, PlayStation® 4 computer entertainment system and Windows PC.

"Michele Ferrero, the world's wealthiest chocolatier and owner of the Nutella empire, died on Saturday aged 89 . Michele Ferrero, the world's wealthiest chocolatier and owner of the Nutella empire, died on Saturday aged 89. The death of Italy's richest man opens the question of succession and potential tie-ups at the family-controlled Ferrero group, which has sales of around £6billion. Mr Ferrero created the chocolate-hazelnut Nutella spread, Ferrero Rocher pralines, Kinder eggs and Tic Tac sweets - turning a  provincial chocolate factory into a global empire. He died at home in Monaco on Valentine's Day after months of illness, his company revealed. Italian President Sergio Mattarella led the tributes to the 'born entrepreneur' and said he was deeply touched by the death of one of the protagonists of Italian industry. 'He was always ahead of his time thanks to innovative products and his tenacious and reserved work,' said Mr Mattarella. Twitter was flooded with messages from people who thanked Ferrero for 'sweetening up' their lives. Mr Ferrero's net worth of £14.4billion ranked him 31st, the highest of any Italian, on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as of February 2015. Forbes magazine described Ferrero as 'the richest candyman on the planet', putting him and his family in 30th place on their list of the world's wealthiest people. The entrepreneur  built the business founded by his parents in the 1940s into one of the world's biggest confectionery companies. His father Pietro started making Nutella when cocoa was still rationed during World War II and transformed a small coffee bar in Piedmont, Italy, into a sweets factory in 1946. With cocoa expensive as Italy rebuilt from war, the company experimented with locally abundant nuts as a substitute ingredient and developed Nutella using a cocoa-hazelnut base. The first pot of Nutella was made in Alba in northwest Italy in April 1964 and the company produces around 365,000 tonnes of Nutella every year in 11 factories around the world. Mr Ferrero's son Giovanni became chief executive of the chocolate empire after his older brother Pietro, the chosen heir, died of a heart attack in 2011 while cycling in South Africa. In late 2013, Giovanni denied suggestions that the company had been approached by the Swiss-based multinational Nestle, saying Ferrero was not for sale. Scroll down for video .

He created the chocolate-hazelnut Nutella spread, Ferrero Rocher pralines, Kinder eggs and Tic Tac sweets - turning a provincial chocolate factory into a global empire . But industry insiders say he is less interested than his brother was in running the company. Ferrero senior was a man of few words who shunned publicity, turning a local business from the Piedmont region into a global giant. He had a reputation as a forceful leader, but also as one who maintained generous working conditions and gave back to his community. Until a few years ago, Mr Ferrero commuted by helicopter every day from his Monte Carlo villa to company headquarters in Alba, northwest Italy, to taste and help design new products. He never let outsiders buy into the company, which his father set up in 1946. The Ferrero groupmakes Ferrero Rocher, Mon Cheri and Kinder chocolates and employs more than 22,000 workers. The group has an annual turnover of more than 8 billion euros ($9 billion). In 2013 Forbes estimated that Mr Ferrero and his family were worth $20.4 billion (14.9 billion euros). The group, which toyed with the idea of making a bid for its British rival Cadbury a few years ago, is present in 53 countries.

"President Barack Obama's 'Yes We Can' slogan has become one of the most famous in political history, but it seems he was not always sold on the expression. David Axelrod, Obama's media consultant at the time, has claimed that the then-presidential hopeful thought it was 'too corny.' Until his wife Michelle managed to change his mind. Scroll down for video . President Obama thought his 'Yes We Can' slogan was 'too corny' during 2008 election until his wife Michelle (above) convinced him otherwise . 'Michelle just happened to come by for the first ad shoot,' said Obama's former media consultant Axelrod in a recent interview, where she told her husband it was 'not corny' 'Michelle just happened to come by for the first ad shoot, and that was the ad that closed with the line “Yes we can.” He read through the script once, and after the first take he said, “Gee, is that too corny?”,' said Axelrod in an interview with the New York Times. 'I explained why I thought it was a great tagline, and he turned to Michelle and said, “What do you think?” She just slowly shook her head from side to side and said, “Not corny.” Thank God she was there that day.' This as Axelrod's memoir, Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, has just hit bookshelves. This as Axelrod's (above with Obama) memoir, Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, has just hit bookshelves . Axelrod previously made waves with his revelation that despite his public stance in 2008, President Obama had always been in favor of same-sex marriage. The President however claimed that his views had evolved when he finally voices his support for the issue in May 2012. President Obama responded to that claim earlier this week saying that Axelrod 'is mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue.' Axelrod also came under fire earlier this week when he claimed that during a post-election concession phone call in 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hinted to Obama that he won primarily on the strength of black voter turnout in inner cities. 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee,' Romney told the president, according to Axelrod's version of events. But Romney's personal aide Garrett Jackson said he was in the room, listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and nothing like that conversation ever occurred.","President Barack Obama thought his 'Yes We Can' slogan used during the 2008 election was 'too corny' when he first heard it .

"England's talisman batsman Kevin Pietersen, who has described team spirit on this desperate Ashes tour as ‘not that bad’, was nevertheless one of the squad who chose to miss the players’ Christmas lunch yesterday. It was the third time in a row on Ashes trips that Pietersen has opted to have his festive meal away from the England team environment, spending it instead with more than 10 family members in Melbourne. The players were under no three-line whip to attend and some, including Steve Finn, preferred to go to the beach, while Jonny Bairstow also opted out to spend time with his family. Keeping his ear to the ground: Kevin Pietersen has a word with the groundsmen at the MCG ahead of the fourth Test . The England function took place on the top floor of Melbourne’s swish Langham Hotel with Graeme Swann and family among the 100-strong turn-out despite the spin bowler’s retirement from all cricket last Sunday. Pietersen swerving the party comes after continued speculation that Swann — despite the subsequent denials — was aiming his ‘up their own backsides’ barbs at Pietersen in particular. And KP said himself this week about how difficult it is building a team’s unity when they keep losing. Meanwhile, the Australians held their traditional Ashes Christmas lunch at the Melbourne Crown Casino and captain Michael Clarke, who had been absent in 2006 and 2010, attended this time. Christmas lunch: Piers Morgan - one of KP's loudest and most influential friends - tweeted a picture from his lunch in Melbourne . Piers Morgan, keen village cricketer and CNN host, is in Melbourne and due to be a guest on BBC’s Test Match Special. No doubt master publicist Morgan will use that platform to promote his mate Kevin Pietersen at every opportunity and at the same time launch into Graeme Swann for quitting the tour with two Tests still to be played. The fact KP and Swann are not the . best of buddies seems to be very relevant to all of Morgan’s many . comments — particularly on Twitter — on the manner of Swann’s exit. IT will be down to ECB chief executive David Collier, who is at the Melbourne . Test, to decide how much Graeme Swann will receive of his . £500,000-a-year central contract having quit three months into the deal. The likelihood is that Swann will get around £200,000, plus the 30-day notice period, which he did not give. Team player: Pietersen's relationship with team-mates - and his attitude to batting - have once again been called into question in this series . Lawyers from all sides are set to get involved in the squabble over who should receive what for the aborted Graeme Swann Ashes video dairies following his retirement. Happier times: Swann was always the character in the England dressing room, which is why his Ashes diaries attracted a lucrative deal . Only one of the minimum four editions contracted with England backers Yorkshire Tea was released — and even that one followed doubts about the project after the abysmal start to the tour. The sponsors were due to pay £100,000 for endorsing Swann’s diaries — such a success on the victorious Ashes trip in 2010/11. But it is understood no money has yet been paid. BT Sport, who will be strong bidders in the upcoming tender for ICC’s 50-over World Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy rights, are expected to head the queue to employ Graeme Swann, who is likely to have a number of broadcast options. But Swann, who has a habit of making rash comments which later need apologies or clarification — such as England being ‘raped’ in Perth or unnamed players being ‘up their own backsides’ — is going to need a significant amount of media training before being trusted to go live on air. Spin doctor: Swann's outspoken views and loose tongue could make him a must-watch pundit for BT Sport or Sky Sports . However, Sky Sports boss Barney Francis, who is on holiday in Melbourne and Sydney for the cricket, showed no great immediate interest in adding Swann to his already over-populated pundits team. But Francis, wounded by BT’s capture of Champions League football, will certainly be using his time Down Under to shore up his close links with the ECB and Cricket Australia — both of whom have long-term Sky deals. Only Jonathan Agnew, who was relaxing in Perth while Graeme Swann was announcing his shock retirement in Melbourne, could highlight the BBC cricket correspondent not being around for such a big story by tweeting: ‘Goodbye Swanny, Hello Rotto’ – a reference to Rottenest Island which he had flown a light plane over that same day. Catching Cook: Captain Alastair practises at slip as England look to save face on this dreadful Ashes tour .

"Ed Miliband’s chief spin doctor, Tom Baldwin allegedly told BBC’s Nick Robinson that the Labour leader had seen the HSBC scandal as 'another Milly Dowler moment’ My first rule of political scandals is that they don’t matter unless people are talking about them in the pub. Any important scandal needs a moment that turns them from a storm in the Westminster teacup to a topic of debate in The George. With MPs’ expenses, it was Sir Peter Viggers’ duck pond. With phone hacking, it was Milly Dowler’s voicemails. And with Andrew Mitchell, it wasn’t the fact that he swore at police officers; it was that much-disputed word ‘pleb’. This week, the release of secret files on HSBC’s Swiss banking operations has set off a political firestorm, but as Westminster pores over the ashes and wonders where the scandal goes next, the real question is what – if anything – will get people talking down at the pub? It should be the facts that at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC’s Swiss banking arm to evade tax; that only one has so far faced prosecution; and that – at the height of the investigation into the case – the boss of HSBC was made a Government Minister by David Cameron. That stinks to high heaven. As someone who worked both at HMRC and at the Treasury, I am incredulous that Ministers were unaware of HSBC’s involvement in the Swiss scandal when Stephen Green, the bank’s former chief executive, was made a Minister. In theory, HMRC staff with access to confidential tax data are not supposed to share the details with Treasury officials and Ministers. The reality is that – whenever a case is deemed sensitive, either because of the individual or company involved, the scale of the evasion, or in HSBC’s case, both – the taxman will find a way of informing the Treasury, not least to cover their backs if it all goes wrong. They will usually do so face-to-face rather than in writing so there is no record of taxpayer confidentiality being breached. In 2004, I was warned by a Revenue official that his staff were planning to present a £100,000 tax bill to a pop star while he was signing records in London. He said: ‘Obviously, I can’t tell you who it is’, then walked out of my office singing Peter Andre’s Mysterious Girl. But when the Swiss case emerged in 2010, it wasn’t just HMRC’s job to inform the Treasury of HSBC’s involvement. It should have been the Treasury demanding to know what was going on, who was involved, what revenue was at stake, and what action needed to be taken. Ed Miliband was said to have seen it as an opportunity to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story involving murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler (pictured) broke . In December 2012, George Osborne announced a deal with Switzerland that he called the ‘largest tax evasion settlement in British history’. That was no small matter: the £5 billion the settlement was forecast to raise allowed the Chancellor to claim that Government borrowing had fallen not risen in 2012. Are we expected to believe that he and his officials prepared that deal without ever asking HMRC what they knew about tax evasion in Swiss banks? I am reluctant to believe the Treasury is lying, and I do not believe they are wholly incompetent, so I am forced to a third uncomfortable theory. They were never told because they chose not to ask, and put their fingers in their ears when HMRC tried to tell them. Why? Because in government, once you officially know something, you have to publicly do something, or you will one day be accused of a cover-up. In this case, Stephen Green would need to have been sacked, donations to the Tories from tax evaders would need to have been returned, and prosecutions brought against those 1,000 wealthy individuals, rather than settlements agreed with them. Far better for Osborne and his Ministers to act like the wise monkeys, and hope that HSBC’s involvement was never publicly exposed. THAT is the real scandal, and if Ed Miliband and his office had done their job, that is what would have been on tonight’s agenda at the pub. Miliband’s task was to expose the facts of the HSBC case in a way everyone could understand, and then forensically pick apart the Government’s ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ defence. Instead, the Labour leader was diverted into a demeaning squabble over the tax affairs of former Tory Treasurer Baron Fink, and then broadened his assault to the entire practice of tax avoidance. This week, the release of secret files on HSBC’s private banking operations- revealing at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC’s Swiss banking arm to evade tax-  has set off a political firestorm . Not only did that distract attention from the HSBC case, and allow Cameron to question Labour’s record on tax avoidance, it has also exposed the Labour Party, its donors, peers and MPs, and Miliband himself to a frenzied media investigation into their own tax affairs. Even worse, Miliband’s chief spin doctor, Tom Baldwin, then had a conversation with the BBC’s Nick Robinson, which led Nick to write: ‘The Labour leader’s aides say that he sees this as another Milly Dowler moment.’ The BBC man clarified that the phrase was not a direct quote, but that Miliband saw this as a moment to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story broke. That Baldwin did not say the actual words ‘Milly Dowler moment’ is welcome, just as it is welcome that Emily Thornberry’s picture of England flags in Rochester was not accompanied by the words: ‘Get me back to Islington.’ But what matters is the sentiment, not the words. As I noted earlier, the Milly Dowler story provoked a spontaneous outpouring of public outrage which brought the hacking scandal to national attention. Miliband did not make that happen, but he appeared to speak for the country when calling for resignations and an inquiry. Now all the public can see – based on his spin doctor’s own analysis – is that Miliband was not sharing their outrage; he was exploiting it. Baldwin’s thinking betrays a man who has played the Westminster chess game too long and thinks only of tactics and gambits. As someone who was a liability in my job long before I was forced to quit, I know the signs, and the fact Baldwin could not even hear how appalling his analysis sounded is one. As it is, he has ensured that if the punters’ conversation in the pub does turn to this week’s scandal, the cynical comparison with their anger over Milly Dowler will be what is best remembered and most guaranteed to offend. Ed Miliband has not just missed an open goal this week; he and his foolish spin doctor have crashed a spectacular 100-yard volley back into Labour’s net.","Leaked files on HSBC’s Swiss operations has set off a political firestorm .

The junior had been a threat all day, and with time running out, the Spartans gave Valentine the ball, hoping for another shot from beyond the arc . 'Give Valentine credit - that was an incredible shot,' Ohio State coach Thad Matta said. 'I thought we had them right where we wanted them in terms of how the action developed.' Ohio State's Sam Thompson had made a three-pointer for the Buckeyes, tying the game with 36 seconds left, but Michigan State patiently ran the clock down, and Valentine had room to shoot. 'I was ready to hit the shot,' Valentine said. 'I didn't want to go into another overtime.' Michigan State has gone to overtime five times this season, losing three of those games.

"Saudi Arabia on Sunday condemned the killing in North Carolina of three American Muslim college students as a 'heinous terrorist' act, and called for an end to incitement against Muslims. The statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency also condemned as a 'terrorist' act the recent attacks that killed two people in Denmark, one at a panel discussion that included an artist who caricatured the Prophet Muhammad and the other outside a synagogue. In neighboring Qatar, several thousand people held a march Sunday in the capital Doha in solidarity with the families of the North Carolina victims. Condemned: Saudi Arabia on Sunday condemned the killing of three American Muslim college students as a 'heinous terrorist' act. People have been praying in public (pictured on Friday in Washington) in their memory . The marchers appealed for protection against hate crimes for the tens of thousands of young Arabs studying in the United States on scholarships  funded by the energy-rich governments of the Gulf. Deah Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Abu-Salha, 21; and her sister, Razan Abu-Salha, 19, were killed on Tuesday by their neighbor Craig Hicks, 46, an avowed atheist who was a vocal critic of all religions. Family members say all three were shot in the head at the newlywed couple's home, though police aren't saying exactly how the three victims died. The victims' relatives are pressing for hate-crime charges against Hicks, and the FBI is now involved and investigating possible motives. Local police initially said a parking dispute sparked the murders and the U.S. attorney for the region described it as 'an isolated incident.' A Christian minister in Brooklyn addresses an Arab American Association in solidarity with the community . However, the day after the attack, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world, al-Azhar, described the murders as a 'cowardly terrorist act.' Al-Azhar, which is based in Cairo, said it was deeply concerned that the killings appeared to have been prompted by 'racism and Islamophobia.' Similarly, the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world's largest bloc of Muslim countries, said the murders heightened international concerns about 'rising anti-Muslim sentiments and Islamophobic acts' in the United States.","Deah Barakat, 23, Yusor Abu-Salha, 21, and Razan Abu-Salha, 19, were killed on Tuesday by an avowed atheist .

"Iain Duncan Smith has claimed his flagship Universal Credit scheme has been vindicated after evidence showed it is was helping people find work quicker and earn more. The Work and Pensions Secretary said research suggested that those receiving Universal Credit are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months than those on Jobseekers Allowance. They spent an average of four days more in work during that period, earning around £50 more, according to the analysis. Iain Duncan Smith said research showed those receiving Universal Credit are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months . But Labour said Universal Credit - which starts being rolled out across the country tomorrow - was massively behind schedule and saving far less than expected. The system replaces a bundle of  benefits - including job seekers' allowance, tax credits and housing benefit - and is designed to prevent situations where people can be worse off taking jobs than staying on welfare. From tomorrow, the government begins a staggered roll-out of the benefit, for claims by single people, at a further 150 job centres. Once this is complete, it will be available in one in three jobcentres in Britain, ministers say. About 50,000 people in selected areas have claimed the benefit since it was introduced in April 2013 - far fewer than the government originally said would be getting it by now. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The only person who believes Iain Duncan Smith's promises on Universal Credit is Iain Duncan Smith' Computer problems have also caused delays and forced ministers to write off tens of millions of pounds. Mr Duncan Smith insisted it had been better to delay the scheme rather than risk problems. 'I would rather have this work, I would rather have it that everyone's experience as we have seen already is positive, people are going into work quicker, they are staying in work longer, and they are earning more,' he said. He also said the programme was under its budget, dismissing a multi-million pound write-off of failed IT. Universal credit will be used by 150 extra job centres from tomorrow . 'All IT systems in development, the private sector and the public sector, of course you invest in them, some bits and pieces don't work, there's always a certain amount of a write down and some write off,' Mr Duncan Smith said. 'Compared to the expenditure of something in the order of £2.4 billion that was originally expected we are now spending £1.8billion, and included in all of that we are actually spending £600 million on this development less than was originally expected.' But shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The only person who believes Iain Duncan Smith's promises on Universal Credit is Iain Duncan Smith. 'Iain Duncan Smith promised Universal Credit would save taxpayers £1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud. But now he's admitted the Government has cut the amount of planned savings by two thirds. 'Iain Duncan Smith promised one million people would be claiming Universal Credit by April 2014. But the latest figures show only 26,940 people on the new benefit. At this rate it will take 1,571 years to roll out Universal Credit. 'Labour wants Universal Credit to work and we'll call in the National Audit Office to do an immediate review of this failing programme to get a grip of the spiralling waste and delays.'","Iain Duncan Smith has defended his flagship Universal Credit scheme .

"David Cameron's pledge to strip the obese, alcoholics and junkies of their benefits if they refuse help has previously been rejected . David Cameron's pledge to strip the obese, alcoholics and junkies of their benefits if they refuse help was previously rejected by the Coalition twice after experts warned it would drive claimants to 'crime and prostitution'. The Prime Minister said yesterday that it was 'not fair' taxpayers had to fund the welfare payments of the unhealthy and addicts who failed to undergo treatment. His comments come after The Mail on Sunday revealed that almost half a billion pounds is paid every year to Britons hooked on drugs and drink. A total of 46,810 alcoholics and 27,440 drug addicts were being paid £435 million in sickness benefit, while 1,380 obese people got £8.4 million in Employment and Support Allowance. Mr Cameron has ordered expert health adviser Professor Dame Carol Black to carry out a review of how those with treatable conditions should be helped back into work, and if they should face the threat of benefits cuts for failing to 'engage' with treatment. But it can be revealed that the Government has already rejected the tough regime twice after being warned it would see vulnerable people turn to the black market to feed their habits. The 'carrot and stick' approach was first proposed by the previous Labour Government in 2009. Shortly after the last Election, the independent Social Security Advisory Committee warned that the Welfare Drugs Recovery Pilot Scheme – to give addicts a 'treatment allowance' instead of sickness benefits or Jobseeker's Allowance – would have 'negative, unintended consequences'. In June 2010 the Department for Work and Pensions concluded that the scheme contained 'a number of significant flaws'. Four months later, the Home Office proposed an almost identical regime of 'sanctions', and once again the experts on the Social Security Advisory Committee rejected them – until Mr Cameron's intervention yesterday. But Jenny Willott, a former Lib Dem Minister who sat on the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: 'It's being suggested again because it makes a good headline but it will be dropped for the same reasons. The Prime Minister said it was 'not fair' that taxpayers had to fund the welfare payments of the unhealthy . 'Taking away someone's money isn't going to make them get over their problem. We need to be better at providing treatment.' The Coalition is also set tomorrow to start the roll-out of its controversial 'universal credit' plan amid claims its welfare reforms are getting the jobless back to work more quickly. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will unveil plans to ensure the credit, which replaces six benefits and is being piloted in the North West, will be available at all 700 Jobcentres in 12 months' time. But Labour, which has pledged to review the reform, said it was still only making 'glacial progress'. Welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves said: 'At the current rate, it will take 1,571 years to be rolled out.'","PM said obese and addicts who refuse help should be stripped of benefits .

"Audiences were more than curious to check out the big-screen adaptation of the racy phenomenon 'Fifty Shades of Grey' this weekend. The erotic R-rated drama sizzled in its debut, earning an estimated $81.7 million from 3,646 theaters in its first three days, distributor Universal Pictures said on Sunday. In addition to destroying Valentine's and Presidents Day weekend records, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' has also become the second-highest February debut ever, behind ""Passion of the Christ's"" $83.9 million opening in 2004. The chart-topping film cost a modest $40 million to produce. Starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, it could be on track to earn over $90 million across the four-day holiday weekend. Big winner: 'Fifty Shades of Grey' earned an estimated $81.7 million from 3,646 theaters in its first three days, distributor Universal Pictures said on Sunday . Worldwide phenomenon: Internationally, director Sam Taylor-Johnson's adaptation of E L James' book earned an estimated $158 million from 9,637 locations in 58 territories . The Hollywood Reporter reported that when compared to other films with female directors, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' now holds the record for having the largest North American box office opening. 'Our fondest wishes were realized,' said Universal's President of Domestic Distribution Nick Carpou. 'This is one of those moments where I can speak for the entire studio and say we're celebrating.' Carpou was especially pleased that audiences in large, mid-size, and small markets turned out to see the film despite weather challenges in the Northeast. 'We had a tremendous amount of interest from small-town exhibitors,' said Carpou, noting strong outings in the South. 'That speaks to their patrons really wanting to see the film as soon as possible and be part of what everyone is talking about.' According to Universal, North American audiences were 68 percent female. Internationally, director Sam Taylor-Johnson's adaptation of E L James' book earned an estimated $158 million from 9,637 locations in 58 territories. That's the second biggest international opening for Universal, right behind the $160.3 million debut from 'Fast & Furious 6,' and the highest international opening for an R-rated film ever. 'Those are summer-style blockbuster numbers in February,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box office firm Rentrak. 'Controversy, or at least the conversation that's created by ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" suddenly infuses this movie into the mainstream conversation,' he added. 'They had to very carefully create a movie that was edgy, push the envelope, but without going too far to make it socially unacceptable.' Runner-up: 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' also exceeded expectations, landing in second place with an estimated $35.6 million from 3,204 locations across the three-day period, according to Rentrak . For the kids: Animated children's film 'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water' came in third with $30.5 million in its second weekend in theaters, falling only 45 percent . Director Matthew Vaughn's 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' also exceeded expectations, landing in second place with an estimated $35.6 million from 3,204 locations across the three-day period, according to Rentrak. The R-rated comic book adaptation starring Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson cost a reported $81 million to produce and should earn around $41 million across the four-day period. Animated children's film 'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water' came in third with $30.5 million in its second weekend in theaters, falling only 45 percent. As one of the few family-friendly options in theaters, Paramount's PG-rated movie could pass $100 million by the end of the holiday weekend. Rounding out the top five were holdovers 'American Sniper,' with $16.4 million, and 'Jupiter Ascending,' with $9.4 million. The Oscar-nominated 'American Sniper,' now in its fifth weekend of wide release, has earned over $300 million in North America to date. 'We should learn in 2015 to not underestimate how well films can do,' Dergarabedian said. 'Coming off a 2014 where we were down 5.2 percent, where a lot of movies did not live up to expectations, 2015 is right now running like a freight train toward the first $11 billion year in North America.' Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

"Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the police after officers shot a man dead because he threw stones at them. Residents marched and staged 'die-ins' throughout Pasco, Washington, days after Antonio Zambrano-Montes, an orchard worker who was born in Mexico, was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection. The 35-year-old's death last Tuesday has sparked outrage across  the United States and Mexico with many claiming he was moving away from cops when he was shot multiple times. It is the fourth fatal shooting by police in the city in the last six months and has caused heightened tensions within the community. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reaction: Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Pasco, Washington, to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes. He was shot and killed by police after allegedly throwing stones at themN . Necessary: Family members and supporters have questioned why the 35-year-old wasn't shot in the legs and was instead dealt a fatal blow . Running away? Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, is captured on witness Dario Infante's cellphone just seconds before he is shot dead by police. He appears to be running away from officers in the Washington city of Pasco . Shooting: The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns . According to police, he had refused to stop hurling rocks - one of which was 'softball-sized' - at officers, despite having struck two of them. An attempt to Taser the man had apparently failed. However, multiple witnesses have argued that Zambrano-Montes - who was not armed with either a gun or a knife - was running away from officers and had his back to them when he was killed at 5pm. On Friday, the man's family filed a $25 million claim  with the city of Pasco. It came as the president of Mexico reiterated his country's condemnation of the violence against a Mexican citizen. Now, a county coroner in southeastern Washington has declared he will order an inquest into the shooting in a bid to defuse friction within the community. Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel said his decision to proceed with an inquest - which will be open to the public - is intended to calm 'some of the fears and outrage of the community'. On Wednesday, around 100 protesters marched outside Pasco City Hall, with some chanting 'It was only a rock,' according to KEPR. Later that day, more demonstrators gathered at the intersection. 'It's a stressful time for anybody who wears a badge,' said Sgt. Ken Lattin of Kennewick Police, spokesman for a group of outside police agencies investigating the shooting on Tuesday. Killed: Zambrano-Montes is seen lying on the ground after he was shot by police at the busy intersection . Grief-stricken: Erika Zambrano holds a photo of her father, Zambrano-Montes, outside the city hall building in Pasco, Washington. His death has sparked protests and has been condemned by Mexico's president . Protesting: Protesters gather at the corner where the shooting of Zambrano-Montes took place on Thursday . Sign: A man holds a sign reading 'RIP Antonio' following the shooting, which is now  under investigation . Controversy: A meeting is held inside Vinny's Bakery with Pasco police, some family members and community members about the shooting death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, who was an orchard worker . At a news conference on Friday afternoon, Lattin said members of the public have a right to march peacefully in the town of Pasco, an agricultural city of 68,000 people, 215 miles southeast of Seattle. He added that they also have the right to express their opinions on social media. However, he said the public needs to be respectful of other points of view and to each other. He also cautioned against making a decision about the death based purely on the harrowing video, which was filmed on  witness Dario Infante's cellphone and only entered the public domain this week. 'Our constitution allows people to gather and protest. That is perfectly OK,' Lattin said of a march planned for Saturday. 'Be respectful of others, their person, their property.' Memorial: Pasco residents, pictured from left,  Angel Morgan, five, and his brother Jose Morgan, six, and Alex Gonzalez, four, and his brother Angel Gonzalez, eight, gather around a candlelit vigil on February 11 . Scene: Police investigate the scene of the shooting at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Lewis Street . The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection. Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen. 'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City. Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation. Paying tribute: Laura Alvarado, who says she knew Zambrano-Montes, lights a candle next to Vinny's Bakery . Detectives are still gathering dash-cam video, evidence from the scene, citizen video and police equipment and will be interviewing at least 40 witnesses. Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor. 'Rest in peace': Melted candle wax, a rock and roses are part of an impromptu memorial for  Zambrano-Montes on the sidewalk in Pasco, Washington . The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.' Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers. The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies. Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said. Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond. The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said. In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team. One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations. Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.' The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,' She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort .","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, shot dead by police on Tuesday evening .

"A house in chaos, a baby covered in clown make-up and her mother swallowing a sword - these are just a few of the outrageous pictures of circus performer Mackenzie Moltov and her daughter Ulee. A sword-swallower and performer with an alternative cabaret circus troupe, Mackenzie, from Philadelphia, posed for the images to deliberately provoke people who criticise her way of life. In the jaw-dropping shots Mackenzie, whose face is painted with clown make-up, breastfeeds her baby as she knocks back a glass of wine, in another shot Ulee grasps a huge knife and in the most shocking - achieved through the magic of Photoshop - Ulee is in flames on a barbecue. Mackenzie Moltov, from Philadelphia, posed for outlandish pictures including a Photoshopped image of daughter Ulee on a barbecue . The circus performer who swallows swords for a living smokes, drinks and lets her baby hold a knife in her hand in one photo . The photo project came about after Mackenzie faced a backlash from the public after continuing to swallow swords in live shows late into her pregnancy. Photographer Lori Foxworth took the pictures with Paul Cofield and Mackenzie is their regular muse. She said: 'We decided to exploit people's misconceptions of single mothers and play to their prejudices. 'Our ""Bad Mommy"" photo shoot is part of a larger piece of work documenting Mackenzie's journey. 'In the rest of the series we have photographed the sexy, sword swallowing, fire breathing aerialist from her days as a young performer to falling in love, getting pregnant and becoming a single parent. 'Currently, we are photographing her in abandoned and creepy amusement parks in full clown make-up and various stages of undress.' The pair, who run Black, White & Raw Photography posted the pictures on their website. They wrote: 'MacKenzie is all about breaking the rules and challenging what the perception of pregnant women and ultimately motherhood is all about. William Tell is given a grotesque re-imagining as Mackenzie poses with a gun as though to shoot the apple off Ulee's head . The outrageous sideshow performer swallows a sword while her sleepy baby looks on from her makeshift cot - a barbecue . Ulee is placed in a cooking pot with a rubber chicken and some vegetables in this surreal shot, with Mackenzie clad in pearls . 'In our latest shoot with MacKenzie entitled “Bad Mommy”, MacKenzie is joined by daughter Ulee, as she deliciously sinks into the character many of the general public perceive her to be: A self-centered, self indulgent, sex pot, interested only in drinking, partying and being fabulous, much to the dangerous neglect of her infant.' The tongue-in-cheek post continues: 'As we went about the planning of this shoot, complete with Ulee being roasted in a pan, aborted on a bathroom floor, grilled on a barbecue and choked by a strand of pearls, I asked MacKenzie “Is it bad that all I think about is various ways to kill your baby?” They also explain that the image of little Ulee in flames on the barbecue was created by digitally doctoring the shot and the message ends with the footnote: 'No clown babies were harmed in the making of these photos.' Dressed as a glammed-up housewife, Mackenzie goes to place Ulee, who like her mother is covered in clown make-up, in the oven .

"A Chicago doctor has pleaded guilty to accepting $600,000 from a pharmaceutical company as a reward for prescribing high-risk anti-psychotic drugs to elderly and mentally ill patients. Michael Reinstein was treated to luxurious cruises around Miami and more than $100,000 in speaking fees paid for by drug firm IVAX for at least four years after he started handing out their product Clozaril in 2003. At least three of his thousands of patients died as a result of the treatment, a Chicago Tribune investigation found. Clorazil, a form of clozapine, is known as a 'last resort' treatment for schizophrenia or suicidal tendencies. Pleaded guilty: Michael Reinstein, 71, has admitted to receiving thousands in exchange for prescribing a drug . Though Reinstein describes the drug as 'an under-prescribed treatment for severe mental illness', data shows side effects include seizures and inflammation of the heart wall. After settling a civil suit with the family of a dead patient and forfeiting his medical license, the 71-year-old is now facing federal criminal charges for allegedly prescribing various forms of the drug to more than 140,000 patients. At one point Reinstein prescribed the drug to 300 out of 400  residents of a nursing home, the federal suit claims. Pleading guilty to the criminal charge, he will be forced to pay $592,000 and faces up to four years in jail - but could have the sentence reduced to 18 months if he assists the prosecution's investigation. Reinstein, of Skokie, Illinois, first accepted payment to promote Clorazil when it was created in the early 2000s, court documents read by the Chicago Tribune allege. He signed an agreement with IVAX in 2003 to prescribe an early version of the treatment in exchange for a yearly $50,000 consultation fee, which covered speaking engagements. Over the next three years, Reinstein and his wife were treated to trips to Miami, cruises, golfing holidays, and fishing trips, the Tribune reports. The perks allegedly continued after IVAX was sold to Teva, an Israeli firm which paid for Reinstein and his colleagues to board a boat cruise, reportedly worth $2,300, and dinners that each totaled $1,700. Teva paid $27.6 million in an out-of-court settlement last year after being sued over the alleged 'kickback scheme'. Reinstein had a long history of claiming expenses to Medicaid before he started prescribing Clorazil, according to a joint investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica. In the 1990s, he charged for treating 490 patients in five days, the investigation revealed. Defending his use of clozapines to the Chicago Tribune on Friday, Reinstein said: 'I'm not trying to be cavalier about it - anyone on Clozaril or any other psychotropic medication needs to be monitored carefully. But the drug is not by itself dangerous.' Reinstein is also facing a civil suit leveled by the state of Illinois over allegedly forged Medicaid claims. The suit alleges his prescriptions were influenced by pharmaceutical companies rather than his own diagnoses.","Michael Reinstein, 71, agreed to promote and prescribe Clorazil in 2003 .

"School pupils should have an hour a week of 'happiness classes' to prevent them costing taxpayers millions in mental health care, benefits and even jail time, a former health minister has warned. Influential surgeon Lord Darzi, who served under Labour from 2007 to 2009, made the call in a report which blasts 'exam factory' schools and warns of a youth mental health crisis. His proposals would see classes incorporated into the curriculum about emotions, caring for others, sexual relationships, diet, parenting, mental health, drugs, social media and 'positive life goals'. Stress: Pupils should be given an hour a week of 'happiness classes' to stop them needing mental health treatment, says a former health minister. Thousands are calling Childline over exam stress (posed by model) Many of the topics are already covered by Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE), but the subject's contents are not fully laid down by law. Lord Darzi's report called for a structured approach to emotional education and said teachers should be discouraged from 'improvising' based on their own experiences. The report, co-written with economist and former government adviser Lord Layard, is due to be presented on Tuesday to the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha, Qatar. It has called on the government, councils, schools, volunteer groups and the NHS to work together and said children's mental health can affect society years down the line. Influential: The report's author Lord Darzi was a Labour health minister between 2007 and 2009 . One of the focuses must be emotional well-being, it insisted - echoing 'happiness classes' which were introduced at Berkshire's £34,000-a-year Wellington College in 2006 and are said to have been a runaway success. 'Increasingly in many countries, schools are becoming exam factories,' the report said. 'To improve child wellbeing, this must be reversed. 'Our children are our future. So, we ignore their mental health at our peril. At least a half of all mental health problems emerge by the age of 18. 'Yet, even in rich countries, only a quarter of young people in need of help get any specialist treatment, and many fewer in poorer countries. 'Good psychological treatments exist but they are simply not properly available. This is grossly inhumane and also inefficient. 'Mental health problems place massive costs on the rest of society – educational failure, adolescent crime, teenage pregnancy, and ultimately benefit dependence.' One-off programmes offering 20 hours of 'life skills' classes were not enough to make a difference, the report said. 'If children are to develop good life skills, they need more than one or two 20-hour programs,' the report added. 'They need a whole curriculum of life skills, at least once a week throughout the school life. 'This curriculum should be evidence-based and depend as little as possible on inspired improvisation by the teacher.' Last week Childline warned the number of calls it receives about exam stress tripled in just one year. The charity said more than half of all its school-related counselling sessions - 7,546 last year - were about exams and work pressure rather than bullying or relationships. The sudden increase pushed school and education issues into the charity's top ten biggest concerns for the first time, with 87,500 views of its exam stress web page. One pupil told the charity: 'I just feel like crying all the time. I am stressed with exams and Mum is always shouting at me because she thinks I am not studying hard enough. Childline said more than half of all its school-related counselling sessions - 7,546 last year - were about exams and work pressure rather than bullying. One pupil said: 'I just feel like crying all the time' (file photo) 'She doesn’t seem to realise that because of my home life it makes it harder to concentrate and focus at school.' Another said: 'The amount of work I have from school is piling up and I am finding it hard to keep up. 'I am in my GCSE year and it’s important to be on track but all the extra work and deadlines is making me so stressed I end up taking it out on my family by shouting at them.' A Childline spokesman said: 'Not wanting to disappoint their parents, fear of failure and the general pressures linked to academic achievement were all major themes. 'Stresses about exams affected young people’s ability to sleep, triggered anxiety attacks, depression and tearfulness, and eating disorders. In some cases it also led to self-harm and suicidal feelings, or made them worse. 'School and education problems were mentioned as an additional concern in 10 per cent (2,477) of self-harm counselling and 10 per cent (1,743) of counselling with young people feeling suicidal.'","Proposal detailed in report by influential former minister Lord Darzi .

"An American citizen who underwent al Qaeda training only to later quit the extremist group revealed he was asked to carry out a mid-air assassination against Hosni Mubarak back in 1995. Ihab Mohammad Ali, testifying against alleged al Qaeda leader Khaled al-Fawwaz, says he was asked by Osama bin Laden to use his private plane to ram a plane carrying the Egyptian president. 'It took me by surprise,' said 52-year old Ali while testifying in New York federal court. 'I responded, ""Well, wouldn't I be killing myself?""' Exhibit: Osama bin Laden planned to use his private jet to ram the Egyptian president's plane, but a crash damaged the plane beyond repair . Bin Laden, who is believed to have only carried out small-scale terror attacks at that time responded: 'Well, then you would be a martyr.' Ali's testified against Al-Fawwaz at US Federal District Court in Manhattan. On Thursday the government rested its case against Al-Fawwaz, who pleads not guilty to conspiring to kill Americans in the 1998 US embassy bombings. The Egyptian-born Ali says he came to the US when he was 11, living first in New York and then Florida with his family, becoming a US citizen before moving to Pakistan in 1988. In 1990, the year he swore allegiance to al Qaeda, Ali says he met bin Laden, who had recently come back from Afghanistan having found success against Soviet forces. Ali also said he was there with more than two dozen al Qaeda members the day bin Laden announced he was shifting the jihadist group's base of operations to Sudan. Now working variously as a dispatcher and waiter, Ali described his own trajectory within the group, receiving $9,000 in 1993 to undertake pilot's training at schools in Oklahoma and California. Trial: The government rested Thursday against Khaled al-Fawwaz, pictured in this courtroom sketch, who pleaded not guilty to a role in the 1998 embassy bombings . Nairobi bombing: A file photo shows the aftermath of the bombing of the US embassy in Kenya, which killed 213 people . Twin blasts: al-Fawwaz is also being charged in connection with another bomb that exploded in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and killed 11 people . Crash: bin Laden's plane had faulty brakes, causing it to crash at the end of a runway in Khartoum, which led to the plot against Mubarak to be aborted . The next year, he received thousands more, having spoken about the training to bin Laden, who 'agreed with it.' The two were in close communication, according to Ali, who said he went camping with bin Laden when the two were in Sudan. The plot against Mubarak was planned while the king of Saudi Arabia was very ill, with bin Laden saying that Egypt's then president would fly to the funeral if the king died. 'He said if I had the chance, to ram his plane with mine midair,' Ali told jurors. But bin Laden's private jet, which Ali used and trained on while in Khartoum, had faulty brakes and crashed at the end of a runway in Sudan in 1995. Bin Laden requested the plane be fixed, but when Ali contacted a US company about repairs, they returned a $1million quote and the plan was scrapped. Ali, who had also instructed members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group that was later absorbed into al Qaeda, on reading flight maps and interpreting air traffic control radio transmissions. The group claimed responsibility for various bombings and attacks throughout the 1990s while it was fighting the Mubarak regime. Ali quit al Qaeda in 1996 to return to the United States, receiving $2,400 'severance' pay, but still communicated with leadership after his departure. Speaking in code, referring to Osama as'Sam' and the FBI as the 'Food and Beverage Industry,' Ali passed on communication to al Qaeda members. 'Lastly, again give my regards to Sam and tell him to take extra precautions because business competition is very fierce,' he once wrote in a letter as a warning that bin Laden faced the risk of arrest. Ali came under scrutiny in 1999 after the embassy bombings, but told FBI agents he had never been to Sudan. He later testified before a New York grand jury he did not know bin Laden. In March 2001, he pleaded guilty to perjury, criminal contempt and conspiring to kill Americans, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. At sentencing in 2009, he received time served and was released.","Ihab Mohammad Ali, 52, testified against alleged al Qaeda leader Khaled al-Fawwaz during a terrorism trial in New York .

"Paul Cummins, the Derbyshire artist who created dozens of ceramic poppies for the Tower of London installation has received death threats because proceeds will be donated to military charities . The artist who created the sea of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London has revealed he received death threats over the project. Paul Cummins created 888,246 poppies to be placed outside the Tower of London to remember all those who died in World War One for the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation. But despite the success of the project, which saw thousands of people visit, Mr Cummins said he has received threatening phone calls and letters after it was announced that some of the proceeds from selling poppies would go to armed forces charities. Around £10million has been raised for six military charities - including Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion - from the sale of the poppies, for around £31 each. But it appeared news of the fundraising angered some people and Mr Cummins, of Derbyshire, has received threats by email, letter and phone. 'Even the police got involved,' he told the Sunday Times. 'I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in the war.' Mr Cummins was made an MBE in the new years honours list for his role making the ceramic poppies for the installation. It was designed by Tom Piper, at his Derbyshire workshop. The Tower of London installation earned Mr Cummins such acclaim he has been approached about other similar projects around the world. Scroll down for video . He revealed his next project will involve not poppies but tulips and will be installed in Britain. But Mr Cummins has remained tight lipped about the precise location, which will be announced next month. The artist will be involved in another project with flowers in Europe in 2017 and then another in 2018 in a 'very distant country.' The 888,246 ceramic poppies almost filled the moat at the Tower of London for the WW1 installation . Organisers warned people not to visit the installation after millions of people queued for hours to see it . Around 150,000 people are still waiting for to receive their ceramic poppies from the installation and Mr Cummins has offered to replace those flowers that were delivered cracked. The poppies were hand-made in a painstaking operation by a small team and twice fired in Mr Cummins’ studio in Derbyshire. It then took around four months for them to be installed and the ceramic flowers almost filled the tower's 16-acre moat. Mr Cummins said the popularity of the installation was boosted by Royal visits, including from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry who visited in the early days of the project . The ceramic poppies were sold for £31 each, including packing and posting, and some are still being sent . Mr Cummins said the success of the poppy installation surprised him, but he believes royal visits by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry early on helped to increase its popularity. The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the installation later in October. The artist opposed proposals by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, for the poppies to remain at the Tower for a number of months because he said he did not want the work to become a strange tourist attraction.","Paul Cummins created ceramic poppy installation at the Tower of London .

"As jury selection continues in advance of the trial for the alleged perpetrator of the 2012 Colorado theater shooting, public defenders in the case have refused to reveal the cost of James Holmes's defense. The Office of the State Public Defender, which is defending 27-year-old Holmes because he cannot afford an attorney, has turned away all requests for information on expenses relating to the trial. The office has cited attorney-client privilege and claimed to be exempt from open-records laws. They also say revealing detailed expenses would give an advantage to state prosecutors. On trial: As jury selection continues in advance of the trial for the alleged perpetrator of the 2012 Colorado theater shooting, public defenders in the case have refused to reveal the cost of James Holmes's defense . Fox News has estimated the total cost of the trial to be $7million, including $2.9million in federal aid for those injured or affected by the shooting. Part of the money is designated to support their participation in the legal process. Lead public defenders in the case, Daniel King and Tamara Brady, earn $165,756 a year, while Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler earns $156,000, according to Yahoo News, which estimates the total cost to be $5.5million. Public defenders are rarely required to release information on a specific trial, though open information laws vary by state, according to Ernie Lewis, executive director for the National Association of Public Defense. Information on a specific trial's costs are also often hard to separate from the hundreds of cases public defenders try each year, according to Lewis. A bill by Colorado lawmakers that would have forced the taxpayer-funded Office of the State Public Defender to release information on expenses related to the trial failed in committee Thursday. 'As a steward of taxpayer dollars, I believe we should be able to see how they are spending the money,' State Representative Polly Lawrence Lawrence said. 'I don’t think that is asking too much.' Insanity defense: Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a movie theater in Aurora . Fox's estimate also includes expenses for the district attorney's office, including more than $775,000 set aside for the Holmes trial not attributed to salaries. Public defenders have pointed to the district attorney as the reason the case has been prolonged, as the office is pursuing death penalty charges, refusing to accept a guilty plea with life in prison. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a movie theater in Aurora. 'It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death,' Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said in court. Fox News, citing the Death Penalty Information Center, reported that studies have 'uniformly and conservatively shown that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.' Forbes, meanwhile, reports that in California, the annual cost of executing inmates is $137million yearly versus $11.5million for those serving life sentences. Specific aspects of the case have also added financial strains. $463,000 was spent on additional security measures up until 2014, and $90,000 was spent on closed-circuit television necessary for the victims who could not fit into the 110-person capacity courthouse. Attorney Steven Zansberg, who has represented the Associated Press and other news outlets, claimed a public right to know that warranted the release of expenses for public defenders. 'The people of this state have a right to know how much tax money is being expended, and how it's being expended,' said Zansberg. Public Defender Doug Wilson, whose office reportedly has a $83 million operating budget to cover 160,000 cases, told lawmakers the only records requests were 25 from various media outlets, and said they were directed specifically at information on the Holmes trial.","Jury selection for the trial began in January .

"It may not have the sweetest-sounding name - but apparently this Tawny frogmouth still has plenty to smile about. The remarkable-looking bird was spotted perching on a branch in eastern Australia with a startled expression on its face resembling a comical beaming grin. The colourful owl-like creature was captured on camera by Malcolm Catchlove, 52, who saw it while visiting relatives in Woodgate, Queensland, for new year celebrations. Smile for the camera! A Tawny frogmouth beams as its picture is taken in Queensland, eastern Australia . The architectural drafter, from Brisbane, looked on in amazement as the animal stared back at him from a treetop while two fellow Tawny frogmouths got in a flap next to it. He said: 'We were visiting my wife's family for the New Year at Woodgate, a small seaside village on the southern coast of Queensland. 'After arriving at Woodgate, I noticed an amazing golden shower tree, known as Cassia Fistula, and I really wanted to get a few shots of it. 'My brother-in-law's house has a huge front deck which normally is home to two frogmouths, but this year had increased by one - most likely an offspring of the pair. Comical expression: The owl-like bird was pictured with two fellow Tawny frogmouths in a golden shower tree, known as Cassia Fistula . Distinctive: Malcolm Catchlove, who took the photos, said he was struck by the bird's quizzical intense gaze . 'The New Years' revelry on the deck the previous night must have been too much as they were not there the next day. Native to: Mainland Australia and Tasmania. Diet: Insects, worms, slugs and snails. Small mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds are also eaten. Size: 34cm - 53cm. Song: A soft, deep and continuous low oom oom oom. Also makes a loud hissing noise when threatened. Breeding: Usually between August and December. Males and females take it in turn to incubate eggs. Behaviour: They are nocturnal and spend most of the daytime perched on branches while camouflaged. 'I figured something could be done with the blazing sun so I went off to photograph the tree. 'As I approached it I noticed that the deck's residents had taken refuge in the Cassia - their other, more natural habitat. 'As frogmouths are nocturnal it is not uncommon to find them roosting during the day, trying their best to look like part of the tree. 'Being wary creatures they watched my every movement and so I was able to get good eye contact for just about every shot however they did not appear to be disturbed in any way. 'In this shot they appear to be smiling however the smile is them panting, trying to keep cool, although it would be nice to think they were pleased to see me. 'These three are fairly used to humans and I was able to get right under the tree to get some reasonable close up shots. 'These photos struck me because of the intense, patient almost quizzical stare I was getting from all three.'

"Billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart's battle with the Nine Network over the second episode of a controversial TV drama about her family may not be over. The sixth richest woman in the world is considering her legal options, despite reaching a last-ditch confidential settlement with the network before the closing instalment of the House of Hancock was televised on Sunday night, AAP reports. Ms Rinehart's solicitor Mark Wilks said after the program that Nine had been aware of glaring errors in the second episode that were misleading and 'twisted'. Despite the network's disclaimer the show was a 'drama, not a documentary', it remained devoid of factual accuracy, he told AAP. After a legal battle on Friday, Rinehart only agreed to the controversial drama being aired if a disclaimer pointed out the show was 'fictionalised'. Scroll down for video . Gina Rinehart's final moments with her father were wrongly depicted in the Channel Nine drama House Of Hancock, according to her lawyers . Mandy McElhinney plays Ms Rinehart and Sam Neill is Mr Hancock in the two-part show about Australia's mining magnate family . No other details of the agreement were made public. However, in a new litany of complaints, Mr Wilks said scenes showing Ms Rinehart conversing with her deceased father were 'entirely false'. '(The scenes are) offensive and endeavours to question Mrs Rinehart's sanity, soundness of mind or acumen,' he told AAP. Mr Wilks dismissed what he said were suggestions Ms Rinehart had conspired to prepare a deed that would circumvent her father's final will. The suggestion Ms Rinehart confronted her father while he was in hospital was also offensive and inconsistent with the reality she loved her father and wouldn't upset him in hospital, he said. Ms Rinehart's solicitor also complained the show got dates wrong. Rinehart took urgent legal action in the NSW Supreme Court in a bid to stop the Nine Network from airing the second half of its program, House of Hancock, on Sunday night. The suggestion Ms Rinehart confronted her father while he was in hospital was also 'offensive', her lawyers argue . Solicitor Mark Wilks said scenes showing Ms Rinehart conversing with her deceased father were 'entirely false' 'Ms Rinehart did not arrange security glass for HPPL's offices until late 1997,' Mr Wilks said. The complaints follow a confidential settlement between Ms Rinehart and the network after the billionaire was granted an early viewing of the second episode by the Supreme Court. The court took the unusual step of sitting on a Saturday to the resolve the dispute before the show aired. The Nine Network confirmed the second episode of the controversial drama, which documents the trials and tribulations of the billionaire Hancock mining dynasty, would go ahead via a tweet on Saturday. It revealed the lawyers who were operating on behalf of Ms Rinehart had reached an agreement after she had watched the program. The comment on Twitter said: 'Gina Rinehart's lawyers reach confidential agreement in #Houseof Hancock case. The show will air tomorrow as per schedule.' Lang Hancock's third wife, Rose, throws lavish parties at their home in the drama . The Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson who married Lang Hancock is shown as the person who triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family . Gina Rinehart's lawyers reach confidential agreement over the House Of Hancock drama . The series dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart and her late father Lang Hancock. The first episode focused on the romance between the Ms Rinehart's father and his Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson, which triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family when she became his third wife in 1985. Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose. More than 1.4 million viewers tuned in for the first instalment last Sunday. Ms Rinehart, pictured here with youngest daughter Ginia, wanted to see if there are any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing on Sunday . Mr Hancock and his daughter (pictured here in real life) had a strong relationship in the eighties, but it later deteriorated following his relationship with Rose . Tad Watroba, executive director of Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement to Nine's network boss David Gyngell following the first episode saying it was 'tacky' and 'damaging the memory of good Australians'. He said many of the scenes aired were fictitious, unfounded or grossly distorted. 'I know the facts, and this show has turned out to be a tacky grab for ratings, damaging the memory of good Australians along the way,' Mr Watroba said. 'Since starting promotion of the show, Channel 9 has not bothered to fact-check anything despite repeated offers when people have pointed out mistakes. Scenes from the series showed Hancock (played by Sam Neil) having sex with housekeeper Rose Lacson (Peta Sergeant) and Rinehart discovering their affair. 'You're the subject of dirty old man jokes from one end of Australia to the next,' Ms Rinehart, who was played by Mandy McElhinney, says. The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart (played by Mandy McElhinney) and her late father Lang Hancock (Sam Neil) A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money' A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money.' Her headstrong father retorts: 'You're the embarrassment, not me, you've let yourself go since having kids.. Look at the baby elephant you've become,' he barks. Hancock, once Australia's richest man, was smitten with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap and pursues the relationship smashing the bond he shared with his only child. What ensues is an increasingly bitter public feud spanning two decades involving murder accusations, drug charges, court cases, illegitimate children and betrayal until his death in 1992, aged 82. Among the alleged errors in House of Hancock, according to Mr Watroba, is the fact Mr Hancock and Ms Rinehart had a loving, father/daughter relationship. Mr Watroba also said Ms Rinehart was very close to her mother and did not continue to holiday or honeymoon in the United States when her mother was dying as the show has suggested. 'Mr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her. The scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother loved her son-in-law also,' he said. The show depicts Hancock's smitten relationship with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap . Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose . Rose was initially hired by Ms Rinehart to help her newly widowed father after her mother Hope Margaret passed away in 1983. She went on to marry her boss two years later in 1985. Ms Rinehart was bitterly opposed to the relationship and made a point of not attending the wedding in Sydney and even opposed Rose's business visa when she her father first began dating. The mining heiress now remains locked in a bitter legal fight with two of her children, John and Bianca. The pair are trying to remove their magnate mother from the position of trustee of the multi-million dollar family trust, set up by Hancock for his grandchildren in 1988.

"A six-year-old schoolboy became the surprise star of England's Six Nations clash against Italy after he bellowed God Save the Queen with all his might. Rugby superfan Harry Westlake's heartfelt performance of the national anthem yesterday was praised by players, fans and chiefs at England Rugby. His father Kevin, 36, revealed the youngster fell asleep the instant he arrived back at the family home in Plymouth, Devon - but had the day of his life. Giving it his all: Six-year-old Harry Westlake, right, became an online 'legend' for belting out God Save the Queen at London's Twickenham stadium ahead of the Six Nations clash between England and Italy . Passionate: All tired out, the six-year-old fell asleep as soon as he arrived home in Plymouth, Devon . The building firm health and safety manager, who lives with Harry, older son Alfie, seven, and wife Nicola, 34, a wedding venue manager, said: 'This is my boy. He is the most passionate person I know. 'He loves England. He loves rugby. He met his idols - he met Owen Farrell in the stand. 'He sings the national anthem like that regardless of whether he's in a huge stadium or whether he's sat in front of the telly. He even knows the second and third verses. 'We're not overly patriotic as a family, it's just something that he's picked up because of the passion the rugby invokes. Harry's father Kevin, left, says his six-year-old son is one of the most passionate person he knows and wasn't surprised by his performance . Ambition: Six-year-old Harry says he dreams of becoming a centre or a fly-half for England when he grows up . 'He's not the best player in the world yet but he tries his hardest, he leads by example and I'm incredibly proud of him. 'I introduced him to rugby in the park when he was three and we went to his first international last year when he was five years old - England against Wales in the Six Nations.' Harry now has one dream - to be a centre or a fly-half for England when he grows up. The six-year-old told MailOnline: 'Those are my favourite players because they're strong and quick. 'I was happy to sing in front of all those people. I was nervous but it was amazing. My favourite player is Owen Farrell and I got to meet him.' The under-7s player was unruffled by his own performance, adding: 'That's just how I sing normally'. Pride: Kevin's singing soon won him the attention of fans, player Mike Brown and England bosses on Twitter . The grandson of a former Plymouth Albion captain, Harry won the chance to stand in front of England captain Chris Robshaw yesterday after he wrote 100 words about why he liked rugby. He was one of two mascots who gave it their all at London's Twickenham Stadium - helping the national side to a thumping 47-17 victory over Italy. After millions of viewers saw him sing, Harry was quickly praised online by Twitter users with the hashtag #doitlikeharry. England and Harlequins ace Mike Brown wrote: 'Why I love playing rugby for England! How much of a legend is this little man Harry'. And the official England Rugby Twitter page said: 'The passion etched on Chris Robshaw's face is echoed on the young mascot's below. It means so much to so many.' It was an exhausting experience for Harry, who had to begin the 400-mile round trip at 5.30am yesterday - and only got home at 11.30pm. Idol: Harry had the chance to meet the entire England team, alongside national coach Stuart Lancaster (left) But his father said: 'He's still full of energy. He was up and playing a match against Newton Abbot this morning. 'We've shown him some of the reaction but he doesn't grasp the concept of Twitter or Facebook. He's just happy that the players are proud of him.' The pupil at St George's Primary School, who plays for Devonport Services RFC under-7s, also met England coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the team's victory over Wales last weekend. The previous meeting was set up as a thank you present after a photo of Harry, then five, on his father's shoulders at his first Six Nations match last year was used for publicity by the RFU. Mr Westlake, a rugby coach, added: 'Harry was given VIP access on a one-to-one basis with the entire England squad and management. 'He was interviewed for a piece on Sky Sports news and England Rugby TV.' Victory: Captain Chris Robshaw, Harry's idol, jumps for the ball during England's victorious performance .","Harry Westlake bellowed the national anthem before Twickenham match .

I marvelled at a 300-year-old twisted stunning banyan tree, one of the oldest in the Maldives, which sported sky-high twisted branches of story-book beanstalk beauty. This, paired with the island's hydroponic garden and eco centre housing a giant sperm whale skeleton makes Kuranathi a uniquely educational offering in the Maldives.

"Alan Howells caught a 2ft  rat at his Swindon home . A grandfather was forced to set a trap to catch a 2ft long super rat that had been plaguing his home as experts have warned of a new army of rats that are immune to most poisons. Alan Howells took action after he found a rat leaving droppings and scurrying around his Swindon home, as the town struggles with a growing number of the pests. The pensioner's plight comes as experts have warned about the danger of populations of super rats emerging in England as local authorities slash their pest control budgets. Mr Howells, 76, used a trap and cat food to snare the rat, measuring around 12 inches long. 'I couldn't believe the size of it,' he said. 'We are bird lovers and have lots of things hanging out in the garden as feeders, so we thought that might have been attracting them. 'The other day we saw one climb up the bird feeder and start eating the food. 'We have been wondering how it got in, and there is a window with the white guttering outside which has a gap in it. 'The concrete had been chewed, so we reckon it either got in there or got in the back way where the lead flashing in the roof had been lifted up.' The pensioner has found other rodents in the house he shares with his wife Maureen since, but nothing as big as this rat. Last week pest control expert Justin Holloway, of Prokill, warned people about the danger of the emergence of pesticide-resistant super-rats after he found a 20-inch rodent in the yard of a restaurant. He said: 'As far as resistance to poison is concerned it is a growing issue, and over a period of time I expect this to be a greater problem than it currently is.' Across 200 local authorities in England, pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010. This means more people have taken to removing vermin themselves - which can make the problem even worse. Two rats, measuring around 2ft long, were found in Liverpool as clusters of super rats were found in the UK . David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: 'Any reduction in pest control budgets is potentially going to result in more people attempting DIY solutions. The figures were released by Labour and also found that budgets for street cleaning had been slashed by around 16 per cent. Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poison - with vermin tested in Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent having immunity. Last year a number of parts of England reported an increase in the number of large 'super rats', with large vermin reported in Liverpool and Kent. In Liverpool two large two foot long rats were found and experts warned the number of rats was likely to outnumber humans by two to one. The find comes as experts have warned of emerging populations of 'super rats', immune to normal poisons .","Alan Howells, 76, trapped a 2ft-long super rat at his Swindon home .

"Police turned a blind eye to  allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely Pakistani men for more than a decade, it was claimed yesterday. Research, reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls. The research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 were ignored by the authorities. In many cases, police action was taken only against the victims. The girl wrote that the men who groomed her told her they loved her (posed by model) Confidential documents have revealed the scale of sexual exploitation of young white girls in Rotherham, South Yorkshire . Among the alleged crimes for which no one was prosecuted were: . South Yorkshire Police headquarters in Sheffield where details of the problem of sexual exploitation are revealed in internal reports prepared by the force . According to previously confidential . documents seen by The Times, police in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, found . evidence of thousands of similar crimes and described ‘networks of . Asian males exploiting young white females’. The groups were reported to have trafficked victims to cities including Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham. Despite this, just two prosecutions of groups of men for sexual abuse have taken place in South Yorkshire since 1996. The revelations about sexual exploitation in Rotherham echo the activities of a street-grooming gang which preyed on dozens of young girls in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Nine members of the group, including ringleader Shabir Ahmed, 59, were jailed for a total of 77 years by a judge at Liverpool Crown Court in May. An 11-week trial heard that the men would target vulnerable teenage girls and pass them around for sex. If the girls did not submit, they were plied with cheap vodka and raped. It emerged during the trial that police and social services had missed opportunities to stop the abuse. Ahmed, pictured above, was jailed for 19 years for his role in the street-grooming ring. In August he was given a separate 22-year prison term, to run concurrently with the first, after he was convicted of raping another child in his community. Earlier this month, Rochdale Borough Safeguarding Children Board announced that a serious case review into the exploitation would be held. The board's chairman Lynne Jones told the BBC that the review would look at the experiences of four young people and how agencies responded to their needs. The review would focus on what help was available to the girls in the early stages of their ordeal and how reports of concern about the victims were handled. In 2002, Home Office-funded research . criticised officers for treating young victims as ‘deviant and . promiscuous’ while ‘the men they were found with were never questioned . or investigated’. Revealing the fears over the racial . element to the abuse, a 2010 report from the Rotherham Safeguarding . Children Board said the crimes had ‘cultural characteristics ... which . are locally sensitive in terms of diversity’, but warned of . ‘sensitivities of ethnicity with potential to endanger the harmony of . community relationships’. Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham, . said: ‘There’s a culture here of denial and cover-up and a refusal to . accept the reality that we have men living in the Rotherham community . who treat young girls as objects for their sexual pleasure. It’s time to . tell the truth. We must root out this evil.’ The . revelations come only three months after it emerged that social . services in Rotherham had known for six years that a teenage mother, . murdered for bringing shame on the families of two men who had used her . for sex, was at clear risk from predatory gangs. Laura . Wilson, 17, had been groomed by a string of men before she was stabbed . and thrown into a canal to die for informing her abusers' families of . the sexual relationships. Her . killer Ashtiaq Asghar, who was 18 at the time, was given a life . sentence and will serve a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he . pleaded guilty to murdering Laura in October 2010. But . it emerged in June that Rotherham Council's social services were well . aware she was at risk and had received information about certain adults . suspected of targeting her from the age of 11. A . serious case review report confirmed that Laura had dealings with 15 . agencies and identified 'numerous missed opportunities' to protect her. It stated that she eventually became 'almost invisible' to care professional. Rotherham Council's Cabinet member for services for children, young people and families, Councillor Paul Lakin, said: 'There is no question that we will do whatever we can to protect our young people from harm in whatever form that threat takes. 'The Council has already acknowledged publicly that there have been lessons learnt from previous work, cases and investigations and that the support offered to a small number of vulnerable young people has not always reached the high standards we always look to provide. 'From that learning, improvements have been made and new services introduced and those developments will continue. 'Following the recommendations from a serious case review, inspections and our own learning on other cases, the sexual exploitation team has recently evolved from the original youth serviceproject into the new multi-agency service to improve preventative and support work along with boosting efforts to investigate cases and bring people to justice. 'We are also maintaining our major investment in protecting children at a time when public sector budgets are under increasing pressure. Eight men who gave young girls small change and cuddly toys in exchange for sex were jailed yesterday. The predators, who picked up victims aged between 13 and 15 from care homes and the streets, slept with them for as little as £5. Others received cigarettes and ‘treats’, including toys. Anthony Lambert, 51, Stefan Godfrey, 44, John Shaw, 55, Ijaz Ahmed, 35, Mark Adaoui, 40, Colin Simpson, 55, David Shardlow, 56, and Ian Yeoman, 60, were jailed for a total of 41 years and seven months at Derby Crown Court for a series of sex offences. 'We have pledged our commitment by prioritising the amount of money being put into safeguarding services along with prevention and early help work with families to help ensure they get the support they need. 'Sexual predators do come from different sections of the community and are criminals who need to be brought to justice regardless of their background. 'We have worked closely with communities and community leaders across Rotherham in recent years to enlist their support in helping to tackle some of these issues and to educate people about sexual exploitation. 'The response has been very positive and our commitment to continue to tackle this issue is shared by local agencies and our communities.' A South Yorkshire Police spokesman . said any suggestion that it ‘and its partners have been reluctant to . tackle child sexual abuse is wrong’. He added that safeguarding children . was not just about prosecuting individuals.","Documents reveal scale of sexual exploitation of girls in South Yorkshire .

"A woman whose residence stands both in New York and Connecticut lost half of her home to her neighbor, a spiritual life coach, all because her mortgage servicer didn't pay her New York property taxes. Roseanne Di Giulio's neighbor Althea Jacob, a self-proclaimed medium, clairvoyant, and healer bought half her land unbeknownst to Giulio for $275 and says she'll only return it for $35,000. Giulio's home has an address in Brewster, New York and New Fairfield, Connecticut and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $200 annual property tax for the New York portion of her property thereby forfeiting her ownership of the land. Roseanne Di Giulio, whose residence stands both in New York and Connecticut, lost half of her home to her neighbor Althea Jacob because her mortgage servicer didn't pay her New York property taxes . KHOU reports that it wasn't until Roseanne Di Giulio decided that she wanted to build a shed near the property line with her neighbor that she became aware of the sale. 'They told me I no longer owned my land,' Di Giulio recalled. 'I was like, 'What do you mean I don't own that property? I've owned this property since 1997.' CBS reports that no one is trying to evict Giulio and her neighbor apparently wants the yard and not the house but Giulio has been paying her homeowner's insurance and the upkeep of her neighbor's property without even knowing it no longer belonged to her. Jacob's lawyer Robert Karlsson said that a sign posted on a tree reading 'property sale' led his client to buy the land and that she had no motives other than to acquire more land legally. 'There was a yellow sign posted on the tree announcing a real-estate sale, and she decided she wanted to snap it up,' Karlsson said. 'Who wouldn't want to make their property larger? She bid on the property, and to her delight, there she goes — she has a larger property.' Two state solution?:  The tax confusion began when Giulio refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006 but her bank didn't pay her New York property taxes . When Giulio asked for her land back Jacob said she could buy it for $150,000 but later lowered her asking price to $35,000. 'I'm just an average person living my life,' said Di Giulio, an electrical contractor. 'My neighbor is an opportunist. She was looking for something for nothing.' Giulio says she received no notice that her taxes weren't being paid and  feels as though she has been victimized. KHOU reports that the tax confusion began when Di Giulio refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006. Giulio used to pay only her Connecticut property taxes via an escrow account and wrote a check to Patterson, New York for the land. In 2004, JP Morgan Chase officials told her they also needed to put money for the New York taxes into the escrow account. Two taxes: Giulio's home has an address in Brewster, New York and New Fairfield, Connecticut and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $200 annual property tax . However, the bank never paid the bill and it sold the loan in 2010 to Seterus Inc. New York State law says that a property owner must be notified by mail if there will be a foreclosure. Giulio only receives mail at her Connecticut address and her New York mailbox is sealed which may explain why she didn't receive the notice. Giulio's lawyer Michael Caruso says that if mailing a letter to the resident fails, the postmaster must ask for an alternate address or publish the foreclosure in a public place like a newspaper or county clerk's office. Giulio wants to overturn her foreclosure case in front of Supreme Court Justice Victor Grossman but because she didn't bring action within the two year statute of limitations it’s problematic. In  talks before the court date, Di Giulio said she was aghast by her neighbor's initial demand of $150,000, now down to $35,000. Jacob's lawyer said the mortgage company would make the payment not Giulio, but Di Giulio hasn't accepted the settlement yet. 'I feel like I was the one who was damaged and victimized,' she said. 'I don't think it's fair that my neighbor should profit.'","Roseanne Di Giulio's neighbor Althea Jacob bought half her land unbeknownst to Giulio for $275 and says she'll only return it for $35,000 .

"Bread has become the latest household to be slashed in cost in the supermarket price wars which have reduced milk to cheaper than bottled water. Branded loaves have now been reduced to as little as 75p and own-label bread can be bought for 55p in some stores, according to new research. Sainsbury's has led the battle by reducing the cost of a Hovis loaf to 75p - the lowest since prices of bread plummeted to similar levels in 2011. The price of loaves of bread has been slashed by supermarkets and has reached lows of 75p for branded loaves and 55p for supermarket own brands in the latest price wars, which last month cut the price of milk . The supermarket dropped 800g Hovis white and wholemeal loaves and 750g Best of Both from £1 and cut nine of its 800g own-label loaves from 75p to 55p. Trade magazine The Grocer said the price cuts come at a particularly bad time for bakers when the supply of wheat with the right levels of protein needed for baking have been tight and prices are expected to remain high until at least August. Sales of branded and own label breads have also fallen 4.5 per cent year on year - making business a struggle for bakers. A milling industry insider told The Grocer: 'With this pressure on margin, bakers won't be particularly happy about what is happening with retail pricing.' According to analysts BrandView.com, the bread price cuts mean that Sainsbury's currently has the lowest base price for a large branded and standard own-label loaf of the big four supermarket chains. The drop matches the promotional price of Hovis in Waitrose which has been selling the loaves at two-for-£1.50 since mid-January. The Grocer said the last time the base price of branded loaves was this low was in 2011 when Kingsmill was 75p. Sainsbury's has led the cuts, dropping the price of white and wholemeal Hovis loaves from £1 to 75p . After Sainsbury's, Morrison's is the next cheapest with own-label 800g loaves priced at 59p each. Last month supermarket price wars were having a devastating impact on dairy farmers, as the cost of a pint of milk was reduced to just 22p. Farmers criticised Asda for putting their livelihoods at risk after it reduced the cost of a four-pint bottle of milk to 89p. Waitrose and Sainsbury's followed close behind with a £1 price tag. The reductions mean milk is now cheaper than bottled water in some circumstances.","Supermarket price wars have seen the price of a loaf of bread slashed .

"A border collie named Tex jumped, wove and ran to a win Saturday at the Westminster Kennel Club agility contest. Tex beat a field of 330 dogs while a husky mix named Roo! repeated to earn a separate award for the highest-scoring mixed-breed dog in a fast-growing element of the nation's premiere canine show. Five-year-old Tex powered through the course with barks and squeals, seeming not to waste a nanosecond. A border collie participating in the Westminster Kennel Club Agility Championship. Tex, a border collie like the one pictured above, beat 330 dogs to win the competition . 'He doesn't have a foot out of place — he's amazing,' owner and handler Rose Savkov of Long Valley, New Jersey, said afterward. 'And he would go in again.' In the contest's second year, the number of competitors grew by more than 45 per cent, though the club raised the bar for qualifying by requiring more advanced agility titles. The dogs spanned 74 breeds and varieties and included 15 mixed-breed hopefuls, which hadn't had any place at Westminster for at least 130 years until last year's agility contest. The traditional, or 'conformation', judging had some mixed breeds before 1885. While the relentlessly energetic Roo! won the mixed breed title last year, owner and handler Stacey Campbell said she arrived with 'no expectations'. Sadie, a cocker spaniel, jumps over an obsticle during the contest. The dogs spanned 74 breeds and varieties and included 15 mixed-breed hopefuls, which hadn't had any place at Westminster for at least 130 years until last year's agility contest . 'Anything can happen,' said the dog trainer from Menlo Park, California. 'They're dogs. We're humans.' The entries were as tiny as Chihuahuas and as big as Rottweilers. While many came from herding or sporting backgrounds — border collies and Shetland sheepdogs made up more than a quarter of the entrants — less obviously athletic breeds such as pugs and French bulldogs also competed. Wendy Lu and her Pomeranian, Daisy, traveled from San Jose, California, 'to show the world that these little dogs are athletes, and they can do anything big dogs can do,' Lu said. And she did. Daisy made it to the 50-dog final round. Wendy Lu, of San Jose, hugs her Pomeranian, named Daisy, while competing in the Championship on Saturday .

Some were considerably older, including a 12-year-old Chinese crested named Cindy that survived a 2013 bout with spleen cancer. Gus, a Maltese with multiple championships, made his retirement run Saturday, his tenth birthday. 'He'll miss the excitement of it,' said owner-handler Maggie Schoolar of Austin, Texas. Fans say the sport can help excitable dogs channel their energy and shy ones gain confidence. It builds a bond between the animals and their handlers, who use voice and body signals to guide the animals through a complex route of jumps, tunnels and ramps. 'It's an interspecies communication,' says Dr. Colleen Copelan, who handled her Labrador retrievers, Maggie and Lacey, through Saturday's course. Morgan, a Chinese crested, competes in contest. The entries in the championship were as tiny as Chihuahuas and as big as Rottweilers . Besides training and competing in their favorite sport, the Labs put in 50-plus hours a week as therapy dogs with Copelan's mostly child and adolescent psychiatry patients in Camarillo, California. Stanley, a five-pound, wiry terrier mix that made it to the final, soared over jumps as though he'd been bred to do it. But when Stephanie Thies of Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, adopted him from a shelter organization four years ago, he was so nervous he'd never have been able to compete in front of an audience at Pier 94 in Manhattan. Their teamwork in agility helped Stanley learn to trust that Thies would always look out for him, and now 'he's very confident, very outgoing,' she said as he licked a visitor's hand.

"The stunning ice caves of Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier appear in a kaleidoscope of colours as the light and conditions change in these remarkable photographs by local guide Einar Runar Sigurdsson. About 200 British tourists annually brave the network of caves in Europe's largest glacier mass found in the south of Iceland where Einar runs tours for keen photographers throughout the winter, the only time visitors can go inside. The ice takes on the form of giant teeth or huge waves trapped in suspended animation in the maze of interconnected frozen chambers and they can be a luminous blue or near fluorescent oranges and reds when a fire is lit inside or when the sun outside is rising or setting. Scroll down for video . The incredible ice caves inside Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier as photographed by local guide Einar Runar Sigurdsson . An ice climber takes the hard way out of the ice cave, which tourists can visit only during the cold winter months . Einar runs photography tours to the ice caves in the south of Iceland in the largest glacier in Europe . Sometimes the waves look like a giant wave in suspended animation but with light and conditions they are ever-changing . Einar runs tours for keen photographers throughout the winter, the only time visitors can go inside the cave network . Sigurdsson shot these images on the south side of Vatnajokull glacier, which covers more than 8,100 square kilometres or more than eight per cent of Iceland and is estimated to have a volume of 3300 cubic km. 'In autumn each year we start looking for the ice caves for the winter,' he says on his company website. 'Normally we find caves in several different locations on the south side of Vatnajokull. Sometimes they are very special, sometimes not as special but become special in the right light and conditions.' Einar comes from a long line of Icelandic adventurers, with his grandfather Pall Jonsson in the first group to climb Iceland’s highest peak, Hvannadalshnukur, 1891 when he guided the Britain's Frederick Howell to the top. His father, Sigurour Bjarnason, packed in sheep farming to give bird watching and history tours in Ingolfshofdi in 1991. Einar then began taking tours of his own to the peak of Hvannadalshnukur in 1994 and say his 275 ascents of the mountain is a record. He now runs the ice cave tours with his wife Matta and son Aron through their company Local Guide of Vatnajokull, formerly known as From Coast To Mountains. About 200 British tourists annually brave the network of caves in Europe's largest glacier mass in the south of Iceland .

'Some caves we find are very stable and we can go in there in any weather, but others are less safe and we might not even go there at all, even if they are very beautiful. 'Some caves are only accessible in below zero conditions for example if there is water in the floor that needs to be frozen over to walk into the cave.' While some glacial caves are created by geothermal springs, Einar says the caves on the south side of Vatnajokull 'simply form because in the summer the surface of the big glaciers meld due to warm weather and sun and the water falls into thousunds of mullions (sink holes) and finally come out of the glacier tongue as a river.' He adds: 'When winter is cold enough we can enter many of those tunnels that formed the previous summer. When the sun is lower, the glacier doesn’t meld much and the tunnels are dry.'

"Their hands no bigger than postage stamps, this is the heartwarming moment that tiny twins Blair and Innes reached out to touch one another for the first time. Just one week earlier, the brothers had been born weighing little more than 3lbs and rushed to intensive care, where doctors feared they might not make a full recovery. But as soon as the twins were reunited side-by-side, the newborns reached out across the incubator and clasped onto one another, forming a brotherly bond that will never be broken. Brotherly love: Adorable twins Blair and Innes reach out to hold each other's hands across the incubator as they are reunited for the first time since being born prematurely at 30 weeks . The adorable moment, which their parents captured on camera, melted the hearts of the doctors and nurses who had been looking after them at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. For parents Laura and Craig, from Duddingston, Edinburgh, it was also one of the most special moments of their lives. Mrs Lowden, who went into labour at just 30 weeks, said: 'It was the most wonderful thing to see. So touching. This will always remain a very special moment for us. 'We were amazed to see them reach out for each other after being parted.' Blair and Innes were born ten weeks early on February 5 this year and transferred immediately to intensive care. Blair had been born first, weighing just 3lbs 2oz, while Innes weighed 3lbs 3oz. But doctors were amazed when, one week later, the baby boys began to breathe on their own. The non-identical brothers were then placed back together in an incubator, when the special moment took place. Proud parents: Craig and Laura Lowden, with their newborn sons at their home in Duddingston, Edinburgh . Mr Lowden, 32, said: 'It was so cute.' The boys had been born by Caesarean section before being transferred to their separate incubators. Mrs Lowden, a senior gas and oil analyst with Lloyds Bank, said she had been totally unprepared for their sons' arrival. 'The antenatal class on labour wasn't until the following week and we still had a few baby clothes and equipment to buy,' she said. 'Babies, though, are unpredictable and you just have to go with the flow, as they say.' She added: 'Staff at the hospital have been wonderful and the boys are being treated with the utmost care and attention. 'The midwives tell us the boys are a good weight for twins 10 weeks early.' Most babies are not able to breathe on their own until 34 weeks into pregnancy because their lungs do not mature until then. But Mrs Lowden was injected with steroids after she went into labour, which helped the young twins make a quicker recovery. 'It appears to have worked and we are delighted they are doing so well,' added Mr Lowden. 'They have progressed enough to be breathing on their own in special care which is a great step forward from intensive care.' Twins are 57 per cent more likely to be born three or more weeks early, say obstetricians. Their special bond starts developing prior to birth according to emeritus psychology Professor Elvidina Adamson-Macedo. The expert said: 'These twins are very likely to be replicating something they did before birth. 'Memory is formed before birth and babies touch from just over seven weeks gestation.'","Laura Lowden, from Edinburgh, went into labour at 30 weeks on February 5 .

"Susan Oliver, 48, is living in fear after armed robbers burst into her home in Scunthorpe where they tied her up and threatened to kill her . A homeowner was tied up by a gang of robbers who threatened her with a 12-inch carving knife before stealing her £30,000 life savings. Susan Oliver, 48, was at home in Scunthorpe in August last year when the three intruders burst into her property and carried out the terrifying raid. The balaclava-clad gang beat their victim, leaving her with a broken nose and a suspected broken cheek, before threatening to kill her if she reported the horrifying attack to police. The men, one of whom was also carrying a hammer, even threatened to cut off Mrs Oliver's toe during the hour-long ordeal. Pardeep Kandola, 23, from Walsall, West Midlands, has now been jailed for nine years and four months after pleading guilty to armed robbery. But his accomplices have still not been caught, leaving Mrs Oliver afraid of being alone in her home. She said: 'I cannot even begin to come to terms with what's happened. 'I lived in the three-bedroom property quite happily for 15 years, now I can't be home alone. 'I have post-traumatic stress disorder and am undergoing weekly counselling sessions to help me overcome the ordeal.' Grimsby Crown Court heard how Mrs Oliver was relaxing on her sofa when she heard a loud knock. When she opened her front door, the men burst in, pushing Mrs Oliver  to the ground. She was also struck on the back of the head with a hammer, before being dragged across the floor. The men then tied Mrs Oliver's ankles, wrists and knees up with tape, before Kandola began brandishing the large knife he had taken from the kitchen. They then punched and threatened Mrs Oliver, as she begged for mercy. The men ran off, ransacking the property until they found her safe. She said: 'I was in so much shock I could barely comprehend what was happening, and hoped it was just a nightmare. 'The pain barely registered at the time, I was numb with terror. My hands were bound behind my back so I felt even more vulnerable. I didn't cry or scream. I just begged them not to hurt me. 'The whole time they were shouting insults at me, calling me a ""white slut"". I was terrified they were going to rape and kill me.' Although Pardeep Kandola (right) has been convicted for the robbery, Mrs Oliver (left) says she is terrified that two of the men have still not been caught . The gang then forced Mrs Oliver to reveal where her safe was, before ransacking each room until it was found. She added: 'I tried saying the safe was at the gym, but they knew I was lying. He knew exactly what he was after. He ransacked the upstairs rooms searching for my safe. 'Then he came downstairs to search. He found it in my study under the stairs in about ten minutes, but obviously it was locked. 'Downstairs, Kandola started slapping me round the face, demanding to know the code for the safe. 'I wouldn't tell him, and when I refused, he continued to hit me.' The men also took a £2,500 Rolex watch during the raid. But Mrs Oliver's home insurance only covered up to £2,000, meaning she has lost her savings. Kandola was caught after police found his DNA on saliva left on tape used to gag and bind Susan. Mrs Oliver has now installed CCTV in every room of her house and linked it to her smartphone so she can check rooms are empty before she goes in. Humberside Police said they were still hunting the other two men. Detective Constable Mark Lilleyman said: 'Two further arrests have been made and two men aged 30 and 24 have been released on bail as our enquiries are continuing. 'This is still very much an ongoing investigation and anyone who feels they may have information which could assist our enquiries is asked to call us.'","Gym owner Susan Oliver, 48, attacked at her home in Scunthorpe in August .

"When the winter months set in, and the days get shorter, your mind inevitably drifts towards a touch of the sun. Egypt probably isn’t the first place that springs to mind for a quick getaway, but contrary to what you might think, it’s not out of bounds, so that’s exactly where we ended up going for a 48-hour jaunt. Full disclosure: we weren’t interested in any culture for this quick trip – we just wanted a beach and the sun on our heads. El Gouna was our destination. Artificial paradise: El Gouna was built out of nothing and everything is imported, right down to its plants . Tranquility: The hotel has four pools to choose from - this one was right on our doorstep . Rooms with a view: From El Gouna and you can see the sea as well as the breathtaking mountain range . El Gouna is a real life mirage. When you land at Hurghada Airport, you are in the middle of the desert, you drive for half an hour and suddenly you’re confronted by a huge resort. And yes, like a mirage, some of it was too good to be true. The resort, built out of nothing around 20 years ago by businessman Samih Sawiris, caters to those who fancy a bit of golf, diving and snorkelling or kite surfing. All of El Gouna is artificial, right down to its plants, so the whole thing feels a little like a Disney-fied version of Egypt, and although very relaxed, you get the impression things are tightly under control. Indeed, when we walked through the hotel’s front door, we had to go through a metal detector which was slightly disconcerting. However, it is stunning and you do feel a long way from the cold, dark nights of London. In our case, we stayed at the Mövenpick Resort and Spa, a five-star hotel, the biggest in the area with some 554 rooms. Our room was spacious, clean and had a great view of the swimming pool. Crystal clear: Head inside for another spectacular pool in the relaxing spa area within the resort . Smug: I was very pleased with the snorkeling trip, although unfortunately it did nothing for my Scottish tan . On our first full day, we started off with a full body massage (it’s a tough life but somebody has to review it) which got us properly into holiday mode. That was followed up with the undoubted highlight of the stay – our snorkeling trip. We met our boat captain Karim and our guide Shaban before setting off out into the big blue beyond. As a snorkelling novice, I don’t have anything to compare it to, although to my untrained eye, the water was crystal clear, warm and full of fish. Shaban was a great guide, pointing out the vast array of sealife and making sure we didn’t fall too far behind. While the photograph of me after my first successful snorkel session shows me smiling, what the picture didn't show however was the amount of water swallowed while struggling to work out the breathing apparatus... Perhaps offering the ultimate in El Gouna's five-star delights, the Movenpick Resort & Spa leads on to its own private beach and for those who would prefer to laze by the pool, there are four. Inside the stylish Movenpick Resort . The golf course tempts energetic types to hit a few fairways in the sunshine and the watersports on offer range from kite surfing and diving to snorkelling. The El Sayadin Restaurant sits right on the beach, while my Italian experience came courtesy of the Il Limone Mediterranean restaurant. Palavrion offers buffet fare and Bua Khao serves up Thai dishes. The sleek interior design of the hotel was minimalist, all white walls and splashes of colour, with views right out over the resort - it was a shame we didn't spend more time inside. Another area of the hotel we didn't get time to fully explore was the spa. All sorts of treatments are offered, from facials to massages and the Eastern-inspired haven from the sun. On our first evening, we opted for il Limone, Mövenpick’s Italian restaurant. I appreciate that heading all the way to Egypt and opting for Italian food might seem a bit 'off', but in my defence, I’m allergic to nuts and felt it was the safest, and probably tastiest, option. The second day was a slightly more surreal affair. We began at the beach, only disturbed every so often by one of the two camels, Dudu and Dede, that roamed up and down the sand through the day. I can’t say the guide was successful in convincing us to hop on top of them. The minimalist rooms are decorated in sleek white shades with amazing views over the resort . Fancy a ride? Sunbathing was surreal at times, with the camels Dudu and Dede  patrolling up and down . The more traditional part of El Gouna was quiet, but the beautiful marina had multiple yachts bobbing about . Our afternoon was supposed to be a boat ride through the lagoon with a few Egyptian pensioners and indeed for the first 60 seconds it appeared that would be the case. But it was clear the captain was having an issue with the engine and as we drifted off from the harbour, it predictably died. We meandered through the water for five minutes, before another boat eventually came along to collect us and put our hapless captain out of his misery. It was a reminder that no matter how artificial and controlled the whole experience was, some things just don’t go to plan. Desert getaway: El Gouna is located on the Red Sea, an hour's flight from Cairo . Nonetheless, we took this as an opportunity to head out of the hotel to the downtown area for a more ‘authentic’ Egyptian experience. I can’t say my culinary choices over two days were exactly adventurous. As I say, I am allergic to nuts and pulses, and our final meal was in Palavrion, the buffet restaurant. Although there was a wide selection of food, I didn’t feel I could trust what was being offered up. We finished off our night with a glass of wine in the bar, although the wine came out of a box rather than a bottle, which seemed a bit odd. But it was probably just as well - with an early flight the next day we called it a night instead of partying into the small hours. After spending exactly 48 hours in Egypt, I was glad I had gone, even if for such a short time. The scenery was spectacular, the snorkelling breathtaking and the resort offers everything you would expect from the Movenpick name. I’m not sure the destination offers anything extra that you wouldn’t get from a shorter trip to somewhere in Spain or Portugal. Next time I would go for longer to make the most of the facilities and take up the day trips, such as the tour to the fascinating city of Luxor. EasyJet has direct flights from London Gatwick to Hurghada Airport, half an hour's drive to El Gouna. Prices start at £87.99. EgyptAir also offers flights from Heathrow to Hurghada via Cairo . The Mövenpick Resort & Spa El Gouna is a five-star hotel which opened in December 1995 and has 554 rooms and suites spread out over eight clusters. It comes complete with four restaurants, four swimming pools, health club, two well equipped gym rooms, two tennis courts, one squash court, spa, 'Euro Divers' Kitepeople' kitesurding centre, surfing, watersports, golf 1km away.","El Gouna resort in Egypt was built out of nothing 20 years ago .

"About 140 pilot whales that stranded themselves on a remote stretch of New Zealand beach have died, after the creatures initially became stranded on Friday. Tragic scenes show the carcasses of the whales half-submerged and stretched out along kilometres of the Farewell Spit on the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island. Conservation workers and volunteers are hoping the remaining 60 or so will survive after they managed to get them refloated and back out to sea. The stranding of the 198 whales on Friday was one of the largest in recent years and prompted 80 workers and volunteers to help out. Scroll down for video . About 140 pilot whales that stranded themselves on Farewell Spit on the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island have died . Volunteers were unable to get all of the 198 that were stuck back out to sea . The geography of Farewell Spit on the South Island seems to work against whales, which regularly become stranded there. By late Saturday, 140 of the whales had died, said Department of Conservation area manager Andrew Lamason. He said the workers and volunteers worked throughout the day to keep the surviving whales watered and covered before refloating them during Saturday night's high tide. 'We've had a really good crew of volunteers, and people have been wanting to come from all over the country,' Mr Lamason revealed. He also said the surviving whales had moved to deeper water. But he cautioned that while hopes for their survival were high, whales had been refloated in the past only to return and get stranded again. A woman and children observe the carcasses of dozens of pilot whales beached over the weekend . Experts said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers, both physically and emotionally . Mr Lamason said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers, both physically and emotionally. 'It's very sad, they're very intelligent animals,' he said. 'The pragmatic view is that it's part of nature.' The focus will now turn to the dead whales, and the enormous task of dealing with the carcasses, Lamason said, adding that while in the past helpers have typically buried them in the sand, he's not sure what the approach will be this time. He said the department had been experimenting with tethering or moving carcasses into the water, which has the advantage of providing food for other sea creatures. Experts describe Farewell Spit, located on the northwest corner of the South Island, as a whale trap due to the way its shallow waters seem to confuse whales and diminish their ability to navigate. On Saturday authorities expressed concern for the remaining whales as weather conditions proved too warm for the animals,The New Zealand Herald reports. A first attempt to re-float the whales during high tide at about 5pm failed, with many whales becoming re-stranded. Mr Lamason asked the public to leave the rescue to trained volunteers, most of whom are from the community group Project Jonah, due to the risks involved in refloating operations. Tragic scenes show the carcasses of the whales half-submerged and stretched out along kilometres of the beach . 'It's very sad, they're very intelligent animals,' Department of Conservation area manager Andrew Lamason said . However, he estimated up to 500 volunteers would be needed to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide on Saturday. 'We'll just keep on trying,' Mr Lamason told the New Zealand Herald. 'Re-floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety,' he said on Friday. However, he added that there was a possibility the whales would need to be euthanized if they remained stranded. Stranded whales can become dehydrated quickly, suffer sunburns and can die from their own weight crushing their organs. The stranded pod, which includes many young whales as well as adults, are beached up to 6km up the shoreline. 'It's like a hapu or a village. It's a whole mixed family group,' Mr Lamason said. The stranded pod, which includes many young whales as well as adults, are beached up to 6km up the shoreline . Up to 500 volunteers were predicted to be needed to keep the animals cool and wet on Saturday . Attempts to refloat the whales during a high tide failed, with volunteers planning try again at the next high tide . The reason that whales become stranded is not completely understood, however it is considered a natural phenomenon. 'Possibly the leader is sick or disoriented and the herd simply follows the leader or a young whale may strand by accident and the rest of the herd try to come to the rescue,' the DoC's website states. 'They may run into problems when the shoreline is gently sloping; sand and mud absorb the sonar signals they use for navigation, giving a false indication of deeper water.' Mr Lamason said the shallow hook-like nature of the beach was likely to have influenced the event. 'People should bring buckets, spades and old sheets. A bus will be put on from Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit. People need to be prepared with sunscreen, hats, water, food and warm clothing if they want to assist,' he said of Saturday's operation. Both young and adult whales are part of the pod that are stranded up to 6km up the beach . The reason whales become stranded are not completely understood by scientists .","A total of 198 pilot whales are stranded on New Zealand's south island .

"Sometimes even the fiercest birds of prey need a little rest and relaxation. You can find falcons getting that and plenty more at the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital, the largest of its kind in the world and the leading center for falcon medicine.

"Hundreds of teenagers caused chaos in central Florida, brawling each other after they could not get into a movie theater. Police in Ocoee,west of Orlando, said that 300 high school and middle school students 'caused a disturbance' outside an AMC theater at the local mall on Saturday night. After security guards kept most of them out, the crowd was moved to a parking lot where they began fighting each other and shots were fire into the air. Security guards kept most of 300 high schoolers and middle schoolers out of a Ocoee, Florida, AMC theater . Gunshots were heard coming from a parking lot near the theater, where the crowd was moved after not getting in to the cinema . The resulting investigation led to the discovery of drugs and a stolen car, according to WESH. The chaos spread from the mall to a nearby Taco Bell to a gas station where the students were stealing goods and trying to fight the store's owner. Around 100 teens were able to get inside the cinema. Police eventually got the children under control, and they called their parents. The resulting investigation into the incident, where youths also allegedly stole from a gas station, led to the discovery of drugs and a stolen car . The Ocoee Police Department received help handling the large crowd from nearby towns and the county police . One juvenile was arrested for battery and resisting an officer without violence and another was arrested on misdemeanor drug charges, the Ocoee Police Department said. The local police department called in assistance and received help from the neighboring towns Windemere and Winter Garden, along with county officers. 'Our main concern is this: These are middle and high school kids going to a public movie theater, some armed with guns, some firing guns, some fighting in the parking lot, disturbing everyone else there. Not only that, but putting them in danger with the the violence they're creating,"" Orange County Sheriff's Office Lt. Paul Hopkins said.

"Charged: Victalina Mendoza Cruz, 24, seen here, was arrested on Thursday in connection with a boyfriend's two-year-old son's death on February 6 . A pregnant mother of two who admitted throwing her boyfriend's son on the floor, then leaving him unsupervised in a bathtub has been charged with injury to a child after the toddler died. Victalina Mendoza Cruz, 24, who is seven months pregnant, was arrested on Thursday in connection with the two-year-old boy's death  on February 6 at her boyfriend's house in Louisiana. Cruz had been taking care of the boy since January 11, when her live-in boyfriend left for work in Louisiana. But after the child was found dead, she told investigators a story that simply did not add up. She initially said that she fed the toddler and then put him in a half-full bath tub while she fed her other children. Then, when she came back to the bathroom 10 minutes later, she found him face down in the water and called 911, according to The Houston Chronicle. However, a doctor who treated the boy at Texas Children's Hospital said he showed signs of brutal abuse. He had bruises on his eyes,  a bruise on the left hip, a patch of skin missing from the back of his head a bruise to the left shoulder, and a scar on his lower back. The doctor also noted that he was  malnourished and was not expected to live. After this evidence was collected, Cruz was questioned again about the events of that day. This time, she told police a completely different story and admitted she fed the boy but he didn't eat much, so she told him to get into the bath tub. When he began to cry she shoved him from the back and he fell forward into a door frame, hitting his face causing injury to his body. Attack: During a second line of police questioning, Cruz  told police she shoved the boy from the back and he fell forward into a door frame, hitting his face causing injury . Defense attorney David Bries said: 'She is seven months pregnant so we'll revisit the issue [that she cannot have contact with kids] again in a couple of months' The boy continued crying and Cruz told police that she picked him up by the arm, slapped him and threw him on the floor. She then picked up the quiet child and put him in the bath tub where she found him face down in the water 10 minutes later. A forensic pathologist at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science said a skull fracture to the back of the boy's head and blood in the skull cavity were consistent with blunt force trauma caused by striking a door frame or the floor. Cruz, who is free on $50,000 bail, appeared in court on Friday in the 209th State District Court. She cannot have contact with children under the age of 18. Defense attorney David Bries told KPRC Houston: 'Now she is seven months pregnant so we'll revisit that issue again in a couple of months.'","Victalina Mendoza Cruz, 24, was arrested with the two-year-old boy's death .

"Karl Lagerfeld has long been a favorite among grown-up fashionistas, and now he is set to try his hand at a whole new category - children's clothing. The German designer, 81, has partnered with France's Groupe CWF to create a line of rock 'n' roll-inspired childrenswear, featuring apparel and accessories for boys and girls aged zero to 16 years old. No doubt the designs will have been approved by Hudson Kroenig, Lagerfeld's adorable five-year-old godson and muse who frequently walks the catwalk in his high-fashion shows. Karl Lagerfeld (pictured on Friday at New York Fashion week with godson Hudson Kroenig, five) is launching a line of childrenswear in spring 2016 . A sketch of the future collection depicts two boys - one decked out in a suit reminiscent of Lagerfeld's signature look, and the other wearing a white and red T-shirt emblazoned with the word 'Karl' The children's collection will be unveiled in spring 2016, with two seasonal collections released each year thereafter and prices reportedly averaging £17. A sketch of the future collection depicts two boys - one decked out in a black tie and suit reminiscent of Lagerfeld's signature look, and the other wearing a white and red T-shirt emblazoned with the word 'Karl' and a silhouette of the designer's face. Pier Paolo Righi, president and chief executive officer of Karl Lagerfeld, said in a release that the Karl Lagerfeld Kidswear collection 'presents a unique opportunity to share our cool, ironic, iconic DNA with a wider Karl Lagerfeld audience.' Calling the venture a 'natural fit', he added: 'The announcement reflects the brand's ongoing commitment to newness and will allow Karl Lagerfeld to share its ironic, playful, creative vision with a young audience.' Lagerfeld regularly features his godson Hudson (middle, with Cara Delevingne in January 2014), the son of model Brad Kroenig, in his shows . This may be Lagerfeld's first foray into children's-wear, but it's a move that makes sense, seeing as he regularly features his godson Hudson, son of model Brad Kroenig, in his shows. Hudson made his runway debut in the Chanel spring/summer 2011 show, and he's racked up quite the portfolio since. The photogenic youngster has graced the pages of German Vogue, been photographed by his godfather - whom he calls 'Uncle Karl' - multiple times, and last October was chosen to model in a Chanel campaign alongside Joan Smalls. He held hands with Cara Delevingne while his godfather took a bow at the Chanel spring/summer 2014 couture show in Paris, and he has starred in a Fendi campaign with supermodel Anja Rubik. Before Hudson, his father Brad (pictured with Hudson at the Chanel Metiers d'Art Collection 2014/15 in Paris) was Lagerfeld's longtime muse, having first met the designer on a shoot in 2003 . Before Hudson, his father Brad was Lagerfeld's longtime muse, having met the designer on a shoot in 2003. Lagerfeld, who does not have any children of his own, even made a four-volume book of photos, Metamorphoses Of An American, devoted entirely to Brad. But now, it appears 35-year-old Brad has been replaced by his son, and with Hudson's impressive track record, it will come as no surprise if he is chosen to model the new collection when it launches next year.","Designer, 81, releasing children's line in spring 2016 for children up to 16 .

"High street banking giant HSBC issued a humiliating public apology to its customers today, amid allegations it used its private Swiss arm to help hundreds of . clients dodge taxes. The bank took out a full-page advert in many of today's newspapers admitting the standards it claims are in place today . 'were not universally in place' in the past. 'We therefore offer our sincerest apologies,' the . advertisement said. It is addressed to customers, shareholders . and colleagues and is signed by Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver took out a full-page advert in many of today's newspapers admitting standards at the bank 'were not universally in place' in the past . Most of the message echoes an email sent to staff on Friday, . when Mr Gulliver said that the bank had sometimes failed to live up . to the standards expected of it. HSBC has admitted failings in relation to its Swiss private bank after revelations that it may have . enabled clients to conceal millions of dollars of assets. But Mr Gulliver has insisted that many people alleged to have been customers . had long since left and some never were. The disclosures have sparked a political row in Britain over . practices at HSBC and whether tax authorities had done enough to . pursue possible wrongdoers. Britain's Treasury Committee has called the bank's chairman . and chief executive to give evidence on the matter on Feb. 25, . according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday. Business minister Vince Cable said that he is seeking . reassurance that such practices have been consigned to history. 'It's one thing to say that these things happened 10 years . ago, and we do need a proper explanation of that, but what is . absolutely essential is that the practices are not continuing,' Mr Cable told the Murnaghan show on Sky News, adding that he had . written to HSBC.

HSBC has admitted failings in relation to its Swiss private bank after revelation it may have enabled clients to conceal millions of dollars of assets . Mr Cable also said that the tax authorities need to take a . firmer approach. 'The treatment of small people and poor people is very . severe, but the big fish -- the companies and rich individuals . -- are not being treated as seriously,' Cable said. 'That is . wrong and it must change.' The revelations have proved embarrassing for a government . that included HSBC's former boss Stephen Green as minister for . trade from 2011 to 2013. '(Green) hasn't yet spoken on his role in the matter and I . would certainly like him to do so,' Cable said on Sunday. Green stepped down as chairman of financial services lobby . group TheCityUK on Saturday. The bank said that the vast majority of the 140 people named . in reports as customers of its Swiss bank had left and that it . has since established much tighter controls on who it accepts as . customers. 'We have absolutely no appetite to do business with clients . who are evading their taxes or who fail to meet our financial . crime compliance standards,' Gulliver said.

"The British director of a new action movie that was released this week has denied that a scene in which a U.S. president gets his head blown off is meant to depict President Barack Obama. Matthew Vaughn said Kingsman: The Secret Service is not an attack on Obama and that the U.S. commander-in-chief character is only meant to be 'reminiscent' of him. The film, which stars Colin Firth as a British secret agent attempting to save the world from a billionaire bad guy played by Samuel L Jackson, made headlines as a number of critics pointed wondered if it was the first major studio movie to kill a sitting U.S President. Scroll down for video . Kingsman:The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid, played by Taron Egerton, who is recruited by Colin Firth's secret agent character . Kingsman, which is based upon an acclaimed comic book, doesn't refer to President Obama by name but the inference is clear. In one scene Jackson's character Valentine is seen pitching his evil plan at the White House and he shakes hands with a man who - although he only see him from behind - bears a striking resemblance to the current president. Vaughn said in a recent interview that he only used an actor who looked similar to Obama to illustrate for viewers how powerful Samuel L. Jackson's character was in the film, he told Entertainment Weekly. 'The easiest way to making the point where people knew that Valentine was in power was to have the White House,' Vaughn said. 'We needed someone who was reminiscent of Obama, so that people got the point.' He also pointed out that the film's ending was an attack not just on the U.S. president but on 'all politicians'. Vaughn had previously called the controversial character 'Obama-ish'. 'The White House and Obama-ish president — there's no other symbol about a global power than the White House,' he told IGN. 'If I used 10 Downing Street, most people would go, ""What's that little black door? Where is that? Who is that?"" So I needed to show that Valentine was — when you hear Valentine saying, ""Politicians are s***,"" you pull back and go, ""Oh, f***! He's in the White House! This guy's powerful.''' Director Matthew Vaughn has denied that the final scene, which features a U.S. president bearing a striking resemblance to the current commander-in-chief, is meant to be Obama . Vaughn said he only used an actor who looked similar to Obama to illustrate for viewers how powerful Samuel L. Jackson's character was in the film . Star Colin Firth likewise would not confirm if the character was meant to be President Obama and believed the movie was 'going more for the mischievous hint that it’s him,' he said in an interview with Vulture. Whatever the theories, Vaughn believes the movie would make Obama laugh if he decides to watch it. 'I know he’s a big comic book fan, so I think he’ll go with it,' he said. 'I think Obama is a good man. This whole movie is meant to be fun.' Kingsman tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius who decides to start a mass genocide in order to save humankind from going extinct. Jackson's character achieves this by turning people into homicidal killers using subconscious signals sent out by his tech company. Meanwhile the world's most powerful people, from politicians to royalty to celebrities, are protected with a neck implant that keeps them safe from getting turned - but also blocks them from trying to exert their own control over the situation. If they try to save the world, they lose their head. But the controversial scene comes not from a heroic attempt at rescue but rather from a sinister plan by the recruited street kid - who decides to activate all the implants. Kingsman has drawn comparisons to The Interview, which featured North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un being assassinated. It also stars Mark Strong, Taron Egerton and Michael Caine.","WARNING SPOILER ALERT!

"Agony: Jade Stevens from Shillington, Beds, who suffered a 'year-long hangover' until doctors finally discovered she had suffered a brain haemorrhage . A mother-of-two endured endured a 'year-long hangover' until doctors finally discovered she had suffered a brain haemorrhage. Jade Stevens, 34, was tormented daily by crippling migraines which left her feeling listless and wobbly, as if she had been out clubbing the night before. But despite the extent of her ordeal, doctors had insisted Ms Stevens had nothing to worry about until she was struck by a particularly extreme migraine which she said felt like an 'ice pick being stabbed through her head'. But after she told them she was suffering 'the worst pain in my life', doctors discovered a mass of tangled veins and arteries in her brain which had burst under high pressure. Her life was only saved by a marathon operation in which surgeons peeled back her scalp, cut a hole in her skull and removed the tangled lump of blood vessels. Ms Stevens started suffering extreme headaches in late 2013, and after struggling for months finally visited a doctor who diagnosed migraines and prescribed strong painkillers. Soon she was taking the pills every day. Then last November she was taking a shower after putting her children to sleep when she was struck with what experts call a 'thunderclap headache'. She crawled to her bed, where she was discovered curled up by her partner, Clive Phillips, 39. He tried to persuade her to go to the hospital, but she initially refused because she was worried about her children. But the next day she was taken to Bedford Hospital in an ambulance. Doctors initially diagnosed an extreme migraine, but ordered a CT scan after fed-up Ms Stevens insisted it was 'the worst pain in my life'. After the scan revealed a bleed on Ms Stevens' brain, she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where brain specialists diagnosed arteriovenous malformation. The rare condition causes a mass of tangled weak veins and arteries to form in the brain which are vulnerable to bursting when high pressure blood is pumped from the heart. Too busy to get sick: Miss Stevens with her son Taylor, nine, and daughter Alesha, eight, who she had just put to bed in November last year when she suffered a 'thunderclap headache' while taking a shower . Describing her condition as like 'permanent hangover' Ms Stevens said each morning she would 'wake up feeling like I had come in from a club at 4am after drinking my bodyweight in alcohol.' 'I had a headache, but not the migraine type, I felt sick and generally sluggish and it almost felt like I was still a bit drunk from the night before. I would also feel quite un-coordinated and off balance,' she told South West News Service. 'Even before I woke up properly in the mornings I would reach across and take some tablets. 'The doctor said it looked like I was having migraines and I just took tablets, but I was having to take them every day in the end. 'But as soon as I had the CT scan after I went to hospital all of a sudden all hell broke loose. 'The doctor said to me ""you've had a bleed on the brain"" and I couldn't believe it. 'The operation to remove the mass was so scary - I didn't know if I was going to come out of the operation, and if I did, how much damage was going to be done.' Scars: Surgeons peeled back Ms Stevens scalp before cutting a 5cm square in her skull to remove the tangled mass of arteries and veins which had developed there then burst - causing her agonising pain . In a risky, eight-hour operation, surgeons painstakingly peeled back Ms Stevens scalp and cut a 5cm square in her skull to remove the mass. But that wasn't the end of her ordeal. She was temporarily blinded and even forgot how to read following the procedure, but has since suffered recovered her faculties and suffered no more headaches. 'It was the only way they could get rid of it completely. 'My vision when I first woke up was like I was underwater, but now it is not perfect but much better,' Ms Stevens said. 'I also lost my ability to read. I picked up a magazine and I looked at the letters and I couldn't read a word. It was like a foreign language. 'They think it was the swelling putting pressure on that part of the brain. 'I'm much better now, but I have to take longer words quite slowly. 'I feel very lucky. Normally when you have a bleed on the brain it causes lots of damage, but I was mostly fine.'

"The senior insurance broker in his late 40s whose office sex romp with a junior went viral is fighting to keep his job while living at home alone since the incident took place more than two weeks ago. The man had sex in his Christchurch office with a woman almost half his age as stunned witnesses filmed the incident from a pub opposite. He is a regional manager at Marsh Ltd insurance firm, and is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter. While the man hasn't been back to work for two weeks, an insurance industry insider said he was desperate to save his senior management position, the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . The man at the centre of the New Zealand office sex romp which went viral has been revealed as a husband and father of two aged in his late 40s . ‘He's fighting tooth and nail to stay,’ the source said. ‘There are a lot of legal difficulties that Marsh are having to go through, and they are going to take their time. ‘But [the man] is hoping that he can return in some capacity to a job that he loves.’ This information was contradicted by another source though, who claimed that Marsh Ltd wants him out because of the bad publicity it brought to the firm. A neighbour of the family, who wished to remain nameless, said only the man had been around this week, and appeared to be home alone all day on Saturday. ‘The wife and kids haven't been about and he's been keeping a very low profile.’ The regional manager is still refusing to comment to the media on whether he hoped to get his job back or whether his wife was standing by him. The couple's office sex scandal which took place more than two weeks ago went viral after patrons at the pub across the road captured the intimate moment . It took place in this office (inside the window on the right) and neither party has returned to work since the incident . The New Zealand Herald also reported that the female employee involved in the sex romp, understood to be in her mid-20s, was not at her Christchurch home on Saturday and did not respond to messages. The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action. Video footage and photographs by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man’s wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. Last week the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man’s brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved. The man's wife only found out about the affair when it went viral on Facebook, and is said to be devastated by the revelations . ‘When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,’ the friend said. ‘After he didn’t reply he even asked, ‘It’s not you is it?’ He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.’ When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager’s house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him last Saturday, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions. ‘Get off these premises, get off these premises,’ was all he said from behind his front door. He then refused to reply to questions at all. The man appeared to be home alone at this time too. Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery captured the scandalous behaviour more than a fortnight ago . The regional manager wants to keep his job, but the firm claims the internal investigation is still ongoing . The man, aged in his 40s, would not answer questions and was home alone last weekend . However, when the Daily Mail Australia visited the premises the day before it was his wife that answered the door. She said that her husband was not at home and would not comment on the incident. ‘I’ve got nothing to say. He’s not here,’ she said. The wife's friends were supporting her, a neighbour said. It’s clear the marriage has an uncertain future. The ex-fiancé of the woman involved in the sex romp said their engagement was already over before the incident, and that it's sad 'for everyone involved'. He said he knew the other man who appeared in the video, but had never met him.

"John Boehner, the Republican . U.S. House of Representatives speaker, said on SUnday that he is 'certainly' willing to let . funding for the Department of Homeland Security lapse as part of . a Republican push to roll back President Barack Obama's . executive actions on immigration. With a Feb. 27 deadline looming for funding the department, . Senate Democrats three times this month blocked consideration of . the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which has already . been approved by the House. 'Senate Democrats are the ones standing in the way. They're . the ones jeopardizing funding,' Boehner told Fox News on Sunday. Asked if he was prepared to let financing for the department . lapse, he said: 'Certainly. The House has acted. We've done our . job.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'CERTAINLY': Boehner threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, saying he's prepared to see the Homeland Security Department strapped for cash if Senate Democrats don't agree to a vote on the agency's budget . Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer warns that Republicans will pay a political price if DHS funding runs out, but the GOP gained big at the polls in 2014 following a partial government-wide shutdown a year earlier . Last week in an angry moment, Boehner called on Senate Democrats to 'get up off their a** and do something.' Arizona Senator John McCain, a leading Republican voice on . national security matters, told NBC's 'Meet the Press' of his . alarm at the situation. 'The American people did not give us majority to have a . fight between House and Senate Republicans,' McCain said, . referring to Republicans taking control of both the House and . Senate after November's congressional elections. 'They want . things done. You cannot cut funding from the Department of . Homeland Security. We need to sit down and work this thing out.' Democrats want to fund the department but oppose House . amendments stripping funding from Obama's 2012 and 2014 . executive orders lifting a deportation threat for millions of . illegal immigrants. The Republican legislation passed by the House put Senate . Republicans in a tough position because not only do they lack . the votes to prevent Obama's fellow Democrats from using . procedural hurdles to block the bill but also some Republican . senators have expressed misgivings about tying homeland security . funding to the immigation issue. 'The House has acted to de-fund the department and to stop . the president's overreach when it comes to immigration and his . executive orders,' Boehner said. 'The Congress just . can't sit by and let the president defy the Constitution and . defy his own his oath of office.' Senate Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, warned Boehner that he risked incurring the wrath of voters if the standoff persists into March. 'He knew exactly what he was doing,' Schumer said of the speaker in a staetment, 'saying ""Unless I get my way, I'm going to shut down a large part of the government"".' 'To now blame Democrats when members of his own party, conservative leaders and others have all asked him to back off this game of chicken is disingenuous at best.' If Boehner sticks to his guns 'as he did in 2013,' Schumer predicted, 'he will be responsible for shutting down a large part of the government, the American people will perceive it that way, and his party and the country will suffer for it.' 'Senate Democrats are the ones standing in the way. They'rethe ones jeopardizing funding,' Boehner told 'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace (right) BLAME THE TEA PARTY: Far-left House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Boehner is being held captive by the far right . Voters, however, punished Democrats, not Republicans, in 2014, the national election following the 2013 partial government shutdown. The GOP gained control of the Senate where Schumer is now in a shrinking minority, and added to its majority in the House. Nancy Pelosi, who lost the speakership to Boehner in the tea party landslide of 2010, added to the carping from the left. 'With only four legislative days left until the Republican . Homeland Security Shutdown, Speaker Boehner made it clear that . he has no plan to avoid a government shutdown that would . threaten the safety of the American people,' Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told Reuters. 'The speaker's reliance on talking points and . finger-pointing was a sad reflection of the fact that (the) Tea . Party continues to hold the gavel as they insist on their futile . anti-immigrant grandstanding.' Obama has threatened to veto the House-passed measure. Democrats insist on a 'clean' funding bill with no immigration . restrictions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a .

The former Downing Street communications director also claimed every politician in Britain should seek psychiatric help. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were urged to get 'couple's counselling' to repair their relationship, it was revealed today . The detail features in Mr Campbell's latest book, Winners and How They Succeed, which is being serialised in the Sunday Times. In it he argues that modern politicians are less effective leaders than senior figures in sport and business, where psychologists are routinely employed to improve performance. 'If you look at the best of elite sport, it does stuff better than the best of business, and the best of business does it better than the best of politics,' Mr Campbell said. He added: 'Sport is predominantly a physical activity, and yet hardly any of these top sports guys go without proper psychological support. And yet politics, which is primarily intellectual, mental, psychological - most of them don't have any psychological support at all.' Mr Campbell said politicians were afraid of headlines like 'Cameron has a shrink'. But the spin doctor said he hired Andy McCann, a mental skills coach to the Wales rugby team, to help him prepare for his appearance at the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War. Mr Blair meets with Palestinian businessmen in Gaza City today. He is in Gaza for meetings with officials about the reconstruction of the territory which has been devastated by a 50-day summer war between Israel and Hamas militants . Alastair Campbell said all politicians should seek professional psychiatric help to make them better politicians . Mr Campbell said New Labour finally lost power because Blair and Brown failed to pull together. 'We didn't do so well on teamship, and I think if we had we'd still be there,' he said. Speaking to the Sunday Times, he revealed that he offered Mr Blair the services of the psychiatrist who was helping him battle depression in the run-up to the 2005 election, when the then-prime minister was under pressure from Mr Brown to announce when he would stand down. Mr Blair replied: 'I am prepared to think out of the box. But not that far.' Mr Campbell said current Labour and Tory frontbenchers lack the necessary determination to win. 'Can the Cabinet or shadow cabinet really say that they are waking up every day ... putting in the work and effort needed? None of the UK main parties communicate that sense of absolute focus and determination,' he said. Mr Campbell criticised Labour's decision to oppose the bombing of Syria in August 2013, because 'what has followed is in some ways even worse'. But he said Miliband had shown 'leadership'. 'Ed does big, bold things,' he said. 'The circumstances in which Ed became leader, that was a test of mettle on lots of levels.' While complaining that Labour should be 'battering' the Tories, Mr Campbell hit out at 'noises off' from Blairites such as Alan Milburn and John Hutton who have questioned the party's direction. 'I've said what I've said about the economy, but there is a time and a place. Where we are now in the electoral cycle, across the party everybody's got to get out and fight.'","Mr Campbell urged Labour rivals to use  resolve their differences with help .

"The United States has apologized to a man who was wrongly arrested, questioned and humiliated over the 9/11 attacks in a saga that cost him his family and his livelihood, . Kansas-born Abdullah al-Kidd, now 41, was arrested at a ticket counter at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he prepared to board a flight to Saudi Arabia in March 2003 - just 18 months after the September 11 attacks. The University of Idaho graduate had been on his way to study Arabic and Islamic Law in the Middle East. Detained, the former college running back was strip-searched repeatedly, left naked in a jail cell and showered for more than 90 minutes  in view of other men and women. 'Ruined my life': Kansas-born Abdullah al-Kidd, now 41, lost his job and his marriage broke down after he was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he  boarded a flight to Saudi Arabia in March 2003 . He  was also routinely transported in handcuffs and leg irons - which a federal marshall refused to remove so he could use the bathroom - and kept with people who had been convicted of violent crimes. After 16 days he was released without charge - but was then forced to surrender his passport, limit his travel to four states, allow law enforcement to search his home regularly, and report to probation officers in Nevada and Idaho once a month. Twelve years later, following years of court proceedings, he has been awarded $415,000 and an apology. Wendy J Olson, Idaho's state attorney, wrote to Mr Al-Kidd on January 15 with the statement: 'The government acknowledges that your arrest and detention as a witness was a difficult experience for you and regrets any hardship or disruption to your life that may have resulted from your arrest and detention.' But Mr Al-Kidd says the damage is irreparable: his marriage broke down and he lost his job at Nellis Air Force Base, forcing him into cab driving. 'It put a lot of stress between us,' Mr Al-Kidd said of his marriage in an interview with the LA Times. 'A lot of constraints on us. It led eventually to our demise. In court: The case questioned whether former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft was personally liable . 'Once a month they came in and searched the home. It was just a really toxic environment.' One of the four planes hijacked in 2001 took off from Dulles, where Mr Al-Kidd was detained. He was one of about 70 men, almost all Muslims, who were arrested and held in the months and years after September 11 under a federal law intended to compel reluctant witnesses to testify to grand juries and at criminal trials. Mr Al-Kidd was wearing his Muslim clothing and long dark beard at the time, and said he could imagine what people were thinking as he was handcuffed and marched through the airport. 'I could only assume that they thought I was a terrorist,' he told a court in 2011, describing it as 'one of the most, if not the most, humiliating experiences of my life'. In a Supreme Court case tabled in 2011 that changed the U.S. law on detaining witnesses, Mr Al-Kidd accused the United States of violating the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The case questioned whether former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft was personally liable. Mr Ashcroft and other high-ranking officials publicly described the importance of using the material witness law against suspected terrorists, including U.S. citizens.","Abdullah al-Kidd, now 41, was detained at Dulles Airport in March 2003 .

"Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly, 34 (pictured) has been sent back to prison for selling pornographic photographs of herself online . The vile mother of tragic Baby P is back behind bars after she tried to cash in on her appalling crimes by selling pornographic pictures of herself to perverts obsessed with her notoriety. Tracey Connelly, 34, breached the terms of her parole by attempting to make the ‘depraved’ sales online. She had been released less than 18 months ago on licence from a minimum five-year sentence for letting her lover and his brother torture 17-month-old Peter to death. ‘Authorities believe she was uploading images of herself and trying to flog them – possibly to sick perverts getting a kick out of her notoriety,’ a source told The Sun on Sunday. ‘It doesn’t get any more depraved than this.’ Connelly is now back at women’s jail HMP Styal in Cheshire waiting for a Parole Board hearing expected to be held this week. Her toddler son died in Haringey, North London in 2007 after suffering more than 50 injuries at the hands of her partner Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen over an eight-month period. Overweight Connelly changed her name and dyed her hair before moving to a seaside town when she was freed in October 2013 on a life-long licence. Her release sparked outrage. Connelly’s mother, Mary O’Connor, and father, Richard Johnson, said at the time their daughter should never have been freed. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, argued the case showed that the prison system ‘isn’t working’ for criminals like Connelly. He said: ‘It screams out there is no genuine rehabilitation for this type of offence. We see people that have committed these dreadful crimes are coming out and continuing along a similar pattern.’ In May 2009 Connelly was ordered to be held indefinitely, with a minimum jail term of five years, until ‘deemed no longer to be a risk to the public and in particular to small children’. After being released from prison in 2013, Connelly was given a new surname and a new disguise (pictured) Peter (pictured) was just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate injuries, including a broken back . Evil: Connelly's partner Steven Barker (left) was jailed for life, while his brother Jason Owen (right) was sent back to jail after breaching his parole . Child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith (pictured) was sacked from Haringey Council following Baby P's death in August 2007 . When she was freed from Durham’s Low Newton jail in October 2013, she begged for an anonymity order and police protection but was refused. Her release on a life-long licence came with the condition that any breach of her parole terms would land her back in jail. The Ministry of Justice said: ‘Offenders on licence are subject to strict controls and conditions and are liable to be recalled to prison if they breach them.’ The horrific nature of tragic Peter’s death – despite being on Haringey Council’s at-risk register – shocked Britain. He was found dead in his blood-stained cot at his mother’s flat after 60 visits from social workers and police. Peter was also twice admitted to hospital with suspicious injuries but the council failed to take him away from Connelly and her new boyfriend Barker. At their 2008 trial, Owen and Barker were found guilty of ‘causing or allowing the death of a child’ while Connelly had pleaded guilty to the charge. Barker was jailed for 12 years for the Baby P case and a life sentence for raping a two-year-old girl. Owen was also jailed indefinitely and ordered to serve three years minimum. He was paroled in 2011 but sent back to jail after breaching conditions. He was released again last year.","Tracey Connelly allowed 17-month-old son Peter to be tortured to death .

"I have been thinking about getting jowl surgery — but before I take that step, I wondered if there was a clever way of disguising the skin with make-up? I’ve never had any cosmetic procedures and haven’t had my make-up done professionally for 30 years. Avril, 69, Surrey. Contouring is a make-up technique creating light and shadow using highlighter and darker powder — and it can have magical results. It adds volume where there is none, reveals cheekbones you didn’t know you had and gives the illusion of lift to the bits that need it. Before: Avril Hadden, 69 (pictured), said she had been considering getting jowl surgery but first wanted to see whether there was a clever way of disguising the skin with make-up techniques . Even though I have watched top make-up artists do it, I still struggle with contouring, often ending up with a face that simply looks dirty. As we get older our skin can sag, especially on the cheeks, around the mouth and on the chin and neck, so highlighting can add lift and structure to the face. Avril was keen to try it, so using the new Rodial Instaglam Compact Deluxe Contouring Powder, £52, make-up artist Gemma Wheatcroft gave her a lesson. Contouring works best if your base is even and dewy. More mature skin tends to be dry, so use a primer over your face and neck first. Try something like No 7 Instant Illusion Airbrush Away Primer. Gemma suggests using a highlighting pen and drawing a ‘V’ shape underneath the eyes to brighten dark circles. This makes the cheeks look more youthful and shifts the focus up the face away from the jowls. Gosh Click’N Conceal in Light, £6.99 (Superdrug) provides the best results. THE TRICKY BIT . If you are using contour powder, a good brush is essential. Gemma used Rodial’s contouring brush, £40, which has a diagonally sculpted head that sits perfectly under the cheekbone. A quick tip to find this perfect place to apply powder is to suck in your cheeks to make a ‘fish face’. It will help to show the natural shadow beneath your cheekbones. To make the jowls and a double chin look less noticeable, apply the contour powder in a semi-circular shape, taking it from the hollows of your cheeks to under the jawline. FINISHING TOUCHES . Once you have finished the sculpting, you need to bring an element of warmth back into the skin. Gemma suggests dusting bronzing powder on to the areas on the face that sunlight would naturally hit — the temples, cheeks, nose and chin — in a swirling figure of eight. Try Avon Glow Bronzing Powder, £10 (avonshop.co.uk). For a final touch, add a light dusting of illuminating powder to the cheekbones, down the centre of the nose and on the Cupid’s bow. This creates a luminous finish, which helps define features and add a youthful glow to the skin. VERDICT . After: Avril (pictured) was thrilled with the results of make-up artist, Gemma Wheatcroft's, lesson . Avril was delighted with the result. Two weeks later, I asked her how she was getting on. ‘Last Tuesday evening I was at a meeting and one of the attendees said to me: ‘Avril, you look different. What have you been doing?’ ‘I didn’t let on, but said I have been using new make-up. I will persevere with the regime and hopefully I won’t need any additional help.’ Make-up by Gemma Wheatcroft for Rodial. Hair by Stefan Bertin at Richard Ward. UNSUNG HERO . Maybelline Dr Rescue Baby Lips, £3.49 . Colder weather can leave your lips feeling dry and chapped, so a soothing lip balm is a must. One with a hint of colour can be extra useful. The new Maybelline Dr Rescue Baby Lips, £3.49 (Boots) contains menthol and eucalyptus to treat winter-worn lips. BARGAIN BUY . If you’re looking for a new, affordable skincare range, Superdrug’s Vitamin E collection is excellent. Nine new products have been added, including Vitamin E Dual Phase Cleansing Oil, £2.99 and Vitamin E Moisture Boost Facial Serum, £3.99 (Superdrug). You can buy a whole skincare range for less than £10. ELSA'S PICK . Bristle Brush, from £24 . The right hairbrush can make all the difference to your hair. I love the Bristle Brush, which is lightweight, with a wooden barrel to absorb the heat. The bristles stimulate blood flow on the scalp, promoting hair growth. From £24 (thebristlebrushcompany.com). Miss Dior Hair Mist, £34 . Miss Dior was the first bottle of scent I owned. My dad bought it on his way back from a business trip and I still remember how sophisticated it made me feel. Its feminine, floral scent, with rose, patchouli, musk and citrus, has become a world favourite. Dior has now created Miss Dior Hair Mist, £34. This light fragrance refreshes hair and helps protect it from pollution. Pure Super Grape Glow Mask, £12 . This new treatment — Pure Super Grape Glow Mask, £12 (Marks & Spencer) — includes Cornish clay from St Austell, which is excellent for removing impurities. Apply a thick layer and leave for ten minutes, then remove with warm water. Use twice a week to see skin significantly brightened.","Avril Hadden, 69, from Surrey was considering jowel surgery .

"Islamist militants have reportedly beheaded dozens of soldiers at a Syrian army base and mounted their heads on poles. Extremists from the group Islamic State, previously known as ISIS, seized the base in the northern province of Raqqa, leaving more than 85 soldiers dead and 200 more unaccounted for. The Syrian Human Rights Observatory said at least 50 of the soldiers had been executed - many of them beheaded - as horrifying footage began circulating online which appeared to show the bodies. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Footage circulating online, which has not been independently verified, appears to show several soldiers' heads impaled on poles at an army base in Raqqa, Syria, after an ambush by Islamic State militants . The Associated Press news agency said the footage appeared genuine and corroborated by other reports . The video, which has not been independently verified, features a voiceover by one of the militants as several decapitated heads are shown mounted on poles on top of a fence. At least two of the bodies at the Division 17 base were crucified, according to the Associated Press, which said the video appeared to be genuine. Other photographs posted on jihadist social media accounts showed fighters inside the military base in control of several tanks, trucks and ammunition boxes. In one, extremist militants raised the black flag of Islamic State above a building. In another, IS fighters are shown apparently inside Division 17's living quarters burning a portrait of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Brutal: More than 200 soldiers at the base are unaccounted for, said the Syrian Human Rights Observatory . Fence: The poles were then propped aloft along a fence. The UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria has said Islamic State fighters who are accused of atrocities will be added to a list of war crimes indictees . The head of the British-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP hundreds of troops 'withdrew on Friday to safe places - either to nearby villages whose residents oppose IS or to nearby Brigade 93 - but the fate of some 200 remains unknown'. He added: 'Some of the executed troops were beheaded, and their bodies and severed heads put on display in Raqqa city.' More than 50 troops were summarily executed, 19 others were killed in a double suicide bombing and at least 16 more died in the assault launched on Thursday, he said. The display was intended as 'a message to the people of Raqqa, to tell them it is strong, that it isn't going anywhere, and to terrify' opponents, he added. The city has become a stronghold for Islamic State militants who have swept through Iraq and Syria, seizing civilian areas and escalating the deadly conflict in the region. They have declared an Islamic 'caliphate' throughout the region in fighting which has killed thousands of people. Fighting: Images were released by the Jihadist media outlet Welayat Raqa two days ago which claimed to show Islamic State fighters firing at soldiers from the Syrian regime in the Division 17 army base . Takeover: Another showed militants apparently in control of Syrian army resources at the northern base . Syria's uprising began in the form of peaceful Arab Spring-inspired protests in March 2011 but escalated into an armed revolt when government forces launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The country is now in the grip of a complex civil war in which several armed groups, including Islamic extremists, are fighting government forces and rival rebels. Syria's conflict has killed at least 170,000 people, nearly a third of them civilians, according to activists. Nearly three million Syrians have fled the country. There was a victory elsewhere for the Syrian government in the central Homs region, where forces recaptured the Al-Shaar gas field which had been seized by IS a week before leading to the death of 270 troops. The Syrian army said its forces and regime paramilitaries 'killed many terrorists from the so-called Islamic State' in the recapture. Raising the flag: The black flag of the fighters was held aloft above a building in one photo released by fighters . Fighting: The conflict in Syria has claimed an estimated 170,000 lives and created three million refugees . The UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria has said Islamic State fighters who are accused of atrocities will be added to a list of war crimes indictees. Meanwhile a car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border yesterday, killing and wounding a number of people hours after Syrian rebels shot down a helicopter gunship over a slum in Aleppo, activists said. The Aleppo Media Center said the car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in the town of Azaz near the border with Turkey. The blast reportedly killed at least four people.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A bear in Cambodia has learned how to walk after being found with spinal problems that made it difficult for the young cub to move. Blue, a sun bear who lives at Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre near the capital Phnom Penh, used to be able to only take a few steps before becoming tired. The  cub was found in a blue basket by Free The Bears, an organization that works to rescue bears that have been captured by black market bear farmers. Scroll down for video . Blue the sun bear cub was rescued in Cambodia with spinal problems after suffering physical trauma at a young age . Free the bears faces the 'difficult consideration of euthanasia' after rescuing Blue, but the cub has been gaining strength after 24-hour care and medical treatment . Sun and moon bears are used in traditional medicine or sometimes kept as pets by hotels and restaurants for tourists' amusement. Blue, who weighs 24lbs would have likely been kept as a pet in a small cage and 'he would likely be dead as he has a curved spine,' Free The Bears told Daily Mail Online. Physical trauma at an extremely young age most likely caused the cub's spinal troubles. Sometimes he would give up altogether and stop moving. The organization consulted veterinarians after Blue's rescue and said that it faced 'difficult consideration of euthanasia if he began to show signs of chronic pain'. However, after months of exercise and medical treatment, the young bear has been able to join its speedy playmate Baker, a cub also rescued in Cambodia. 'Blue is still a very young, growing bear and is not out of the woods yet, but he is dearly loved and we at Free The Bears are so happy with his progress,' rescuers said on Facebook. When the young cub was first rescued in a blue basket, he had difficulty moving more than a few steps at once . Blue is now able to walk and even climb in the enclosure he shares with his more energetic playmate Baker . The cub can now enjoy the rocks and hammocks where he lives at the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre near the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh . The bear is able to climb now and uses his teeth to help him. He still becomes tired, but is building up his strength. Free The Bears used money from donations of care kits to provide 24-hour assistance to the animal from local bear keepers. He was bottle-fed at least eight times a day and given joint supplement and anti-inflammatory medicine. Blue and Baker live in an enclosure with pools, rocks, hammocks, climbing frames, plants and toys. They will eventually grow to around 145lbs, but it will be difficult to release them into the wild because of their time spent in captivity and the rapid destruction of their habitat. Thousands of Asian bears are farmed for their bile, which contains a chemical called ursedeoxycholic acid used in traditional medicine, according to the New York Times. There are an estimated 10,000 farmed bears in China, where it is legal. The animals live in cages where they are unable to move and some of their gall bladders swell to the size of watermelons. Selling bear bile is illegal in Cambodia. Free The Bears also rescues animals in Cambodia that would have been eaten as bear claw soup or put in cages in hotels for the amusement of tourists. Sun bears are one of the Asian bears that are placed in tiny cages and hooked up to catheters to extract their gall bladder bile for traditional medicine . There are still 12,000 Asiatic black bears held captive in bile farms across southeast Asia . Captive bears are kept in 'crush cages' measuring 2ft 6ins by 4ft 2ins, giving them no room to move . Many rescued bile bears are found with head injuries from repeatedly bashing their heads against their cages . China produces 7,000 kilos of bear bile a year - but only consumes 4,000 . Bear bile sells for roughly $10 per milliliter . Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the active ingredient found in bear bile . In traditional Chinese medicine, UDCA is used to treat kidney problems and digestive problems . Many people in Asia also use bear bile as hemorrhoid cream or to treat cuts and bruises . Asian men have also used bear as an aphrodisiac and to cure hangovers . Scientists have developed synthetic versions of UDCA that could be used as an alternative in Chinese medicine .","Free the Bears rescues cubs whose gall bladders are milked for medicines .

"Grandmother Joyce Moore, 83, died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a botched insulation job . A grandmother who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a botched insulation job might as well have been ‘murdered by an intruder’, a judge said. Joyce Moore’s son had been cold-called by a firm offering to carry out the work for free. But employees installing the insulation blocked the 83-year-old’s boiler flue and did not tell her or son Bob, 61, that it was unsafe. As he turned the heating on that night, the house filled with poisonous gas. On Friday a judge slammed HIS Energy – run by multimillionaire Neville Wilshire, star of fly-on-the-wall BBC series The Call Centre – as ‘second-rate’. Fining the firm £500,000 for health and safety breaches, he added that accountant Mr Moore was ‘as much a victim of this as if his mother had been murdered by an intruder’. But it was unclear yesterday how much of the fine would be paid as the business went into liquidation within weeks of the prosecution being launched. Last night, Mr Moore said he felt Mr Wilshire was responsible for his mother’s death. Months after the widow died, another of the entrepreneur’s firms was fined £225,000, for ringing homes that had opted out of cold-calls. Mrs Moore, a retired pub landlady who had recently visited her grandchildren in Australia, lived with her son at his £250,000 detached home in Middleton, Greater Manchester. In September 2012, he was cold-called by an agent for Mr Wilshire’s Nationwide Energy Services Ltd. Mr Moore agreed to an offer of free home insulation in a Government-backed scheme to cut carbon emissions. Within weeks, three workmen from HIS Energy came round to insulate the loft and pump insulation beads into the wall cavities. But some of the beads blocked the boiler chimney, a well-known risk from the process, Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard. The jury was told the supervisor called his head office, but the manager responsible for safety had gone home, and a colleague decided it could wait until the next day. The workers failed to notify a gas engineer or tell Mr Moore the boiler was unsafe, saying they would return in the morning to finish the job. Mr Moore told the Daily Mail: ‘As the last one was walking back to their van, he said, “I wouldn’t put your central heating on tonight”. I asked “Why not?”, and he just said, “It doesn’t really matter, it’s in the garage and it’s well-ventilated”.’ A judge branded HIS Energy – run by multimillionaire Neville Wilshire, star of fly-on-the-wall BBC series The Call Centre – as ‘second-rate’ When Mr Moore put the heating on that evening, his mother was upstairs. He said: ‘Next thing I notice, I’m starting to get a bit groggy. I opened the back door then went upstairs … my mum was dead.’ Mr Moore rang 999. He and two paramedics suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. The trial was told HIS Energy, which did not offer a defence, failed to mention carbon monoxide in its risk assessment policy for workmen or supply warning labels to mark appliances as unsafe. Recorder Charles Garside, QC, said the firm had used ‘smoke and mirrors’ to hide how it was organised, adding: ‘No fine I can impose will compensate for his mother’s death … or undo the harm that was done. All his effort to keep her in comfort in old age was destroyed by this incident.’ HIS Energy was put into liquidation three weeks after the prosecution was instigated, so the fine is likely to be paid by its insurers.","Grandmother Joyce Moore, 83, died of carbon monoxide poisoning .

"A U.S. Coast Guard ship has rescued an Australian fishing boat that became stuck in heavy ice in Antarctica   for three days with 26 people aboard. The American vessel rescued the ship on Saturday and begun towing the 63-meter (207 foot) longliner to open water after freeing it from Antarctic pack ice. According to reports, the Chieftain became trapped in ice some 900 nautical miles (1,650 kilometres) north-east of McMurdo Sound after damaging its propeller a week ago. Rescue: This US Coast Guard handout photo shows the Antarctic Chieftain as the US Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star begins breaking up the ice around the stranded fishing vessel . Sighting: Members of the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star stand watch at the bow as the stranded fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain comes into view . Contact: US Coast Guard handout photo shows members of the deck force aboard Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star, uses a bolo to send a messenger line to the crew of the disabled fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain left. Tow: The disabled fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain is shown being towed astern of the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star through sea ice near Antarctica . All 26 crew members on the longliner are not at risk and there has been no oil leak in the environmentally sensitive area. The US coast guard cutter Polar Star was ordered to cross through 720 km of iceberg-strewn waters to the ship's aid. According to the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Center, which oversees the Southern Ocean search and rescue zone the US ship reached the trawler early on Saturday. The New Zealand-flagged trawler Janas is also travelling to the area to provide assistance if required but is not expected to reach the vessels until late Monday. The rescue boat, which had a reinforced icebreaker hull had to break the ice around the stricken ship, according to ABC.net.au . Rescue mission coordinator Conrad Reynecke said in a statement: 'The crew on the Polar Star then rigged up tow lines and began to tow the Antarctic Chieftain to open water.' 'They are making slow but steady progress and are currently approximately 60 nautical miles from clear water.' Open water: The US ship was towing the Australian fishing trawler to open water after freeing it from Antarctic pack ice, rescue authorities said. The 63-metre (207-foot) 'Antarctic Chieftain' became trapped in ice some 900 nautical miles (1,650 kilometres) northeast of McMurdo Sound on February 10, damaging its propeller . Icebreaker: The United States' only operational heavy icebreaker sails through an ice field in the Southern Ocean . Crew: A female crew member of the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star watches out of a window aboard the cutter as the Antarctic Chieftain came into view . The Americans had earlier deployed a remote-controlled mini-submarine to assess the damage to the Antarctic Chieftain's propeller and gauge if it could travel under its own steam. 'The [propeller] blades were assessed as too badly damaged for the vessel to be able to use them for propulsion from the ice field,' Reynecke added. At present the weather conditions are favourable but Polar Star commanding officer Captain Matthew Walker said earlier the ice conditions were 'much more formidable than expected'. Australian Longline, the ship's owners, said that the vessel spent six months at a time in Antarctic waters fishing the prized species, which was also known as 'white gold' for the profits it could yield. The Antarctic Chieftain, built in 2002, is licensed to trawl for Patagonian toothfish, a slow-growing species that has a type of anti-freeze in its blood to deal with the punishing southern conditions.","The American vessel has begun towing the Australian ship to open water .

"The single mom of four who claims to have won a share of the $564m Powerball jackpot has led a life of heartbreak and hardship, Daily Mail.com can reveal. Marie Holmes sacrificed her education to care for her four children and took minimum wage jobs to provide for her family . With little or no help from her fathers' of her four young children she has struggled financially for most of her adult life. The 26 year old has also seen her father repeatedly jailed and her favorite cousin shot and left paralyzed after a home invasion. Scroll down for video . Hardship: Mother-of-four Marie Holmes, who won $118million on Wednesday sacrificed her education to care for her four children and took minimum wage jobs to provide for her family . Earned: Family members say the money could not have gone to a more deserving person . Family members insist winning a third share of the Powerball jackpot could not have gone to a more deserving person. 'Marie is very grounded and she will know what to do with all that money,' said her uncle William Bryant. 'I'm sure she will want to buy a new home for herself and her kids, but I can't see any extravagant purchases. She's a nice girl who loves her family and loves her church.' Holmes has yet to officially claim her third share of the prize money estimated to at $188m before taxes. She was one of three winners who picked the numbers 11,13,25,39,54 and 19 in last week's draw. The other winners were in Texas and Puerto Rico but they have yet to claim their prize. North Carolina Lottery officials have confirmed the winning ticket was bought in the town of Shallotte where Holmes lives with her mum Marika and four children. A lawyer said to represent Holmes has contacted lottery officials in Raleigh to say the ticket holder is taking financial advice before claiming her prize money. Holmes has 180 days to make her claim. Since revealing she was one of the winners to her local TV station Holmes has gone into hiding. She has left the $30,000 modular home she shares with her 49-year-old mum and children for a secret location. Family members who live in the same road describe Holmes as a loving mother who always put her children first. The four children, Brayden, Charisma, Andrea and Ebony, are aged from seven to seven months. Home: Since 2010, Holmes has been living in this modular home with her 49-year-old mother Marika. Since winning the jackpot she has gone into hiding . Lucky: The 26-year-old called into this Scotchman in Shalotte, North Carolina, to take her chance at winning a share of the $564million jackpot . Brayden is believed to suffer from cerebral palsy. Holmes has little contact with the two fathers of her four children. The three eldest are with her former high school sweetheart who now lives in California. Her youngest child is with a local man but friends say he is not involved in his daughter's life. Don Bryant, a cousin of Holmes, said she had to quit community college as she found it hard to combine studies with brining up her children. Her mother Marika looked after the kids while Holmes went to the Brunswick Community College. He said:' It was hard for her. She wants to do best for the little children but four can be quite a handful. The college thing did not work out, but I am sure she wants to go back to finish her education.' Bryant, who lives in the same road in a remote part of Shallotte, said his cousin was 'very upset' when he was shot and left paralysed during a home invasion in 2002. A stripper Bryant and his friends had hired to come to his home in Shallotte tipped off two other friends who later burst into the house demanding money and valuables. Bryant was shot multiple times and his house set on fire. He managed to escape but was left paralysed from the waist down and is wheelchair bound. The men who carried out the shooting were later jailed for 26 years. He said his cousin, who was aged 13 at the time, was very upset by his brush with death. 'Marie lived down the street from me so of course she knew all that was going on and what happened,' he said. 'I still see her often and she is a good mum. Everyone in the family is really excited for her.' Last year Holmes's father Elroy was jailed for seven years for drug offences. He has a long criminal record and has spent almost ten years in jail and is due to be released in 2020. Support: Her uncle William Bryant said she does not see Ms Holmes making any extravagant purchases and insists: 'She's a nice girl who loves her family and loves her church ' Family members confirmed to Daily Mail.com that Holmes, known as PJ, was the Powerball winner's father. Like many in the 3,700 strong community in Shallotte Holmes was a regular churchgoer . Her pastor the Revd Dr Vaughn Cherry said Holmes comes from a tight knit family that has helped her cope with four young children. 'They made sure that she was not alone in bringing up the four children,' he said. 'Marie is a regular at the church and we would see her at bible classes in midweek. She is a devoted mother and we are all delighted that she has won.' Holmes recently quit her part time jobs at the local McDonalds restaurant and Wal-Mart and was looking for employment when she struck it lucky with the Powerball. She had called into the Scotchman gas station about a mile from her home to take a chance on the $564m draw. Her uncle Mark Bryant,53, was working a shift at the gas station and sold her the winning ticket. Holmes spent $10 on five quick pick numbers with the lottery terminal choosing at the five numbers and Powerball. Her winning line was the fourth of the 'quick picks'. The odds of winning the Powerball are one in 175million. The gas station will get $50,000 as a retailer incentive award. When Holmes realized she had a winning ticket she confessed to screaming so loud that it terrified her children . She told WECT TV6: 'I was screaming in the house. Telling my kids, we made it, and they ran away talking about, 'I scared them.'. Sacrifice: Don Bryant, a cousin of Holmes, said she had to quit community college as she found it hard to combine studies with bringing up her children . Holmes said becoming an instant multi millionaire would give her the freedom she has never had before. 'I don't have to worry about depending on nobody, I can do it all by myself. I can go back to school and make an even better life for my kids,' Holmes said. Unlike many of the Powerball winners Holmes said she has not intention of splashing out on luxuries. She has said a new home is her first priority and she plans to set up college funds for her four children. Holmes also said she plans to make a donation to her church, The Mount Pleasant Baptist Church. 'I wouldn't have none of it if it wasn't for God,' Holmes said in a TV interview. 'I'm thankful that I can bless my kids with something that I didn't have.' Holmes said he was ready for such a life-changing amount of money. When asked if she's ready for the impact the lottery win will have on her life, Holmes said 'I'm ready for it. I'm ready to embrace the change. I'm very grateful for what's about to happen for my family.' Pastor Cherry said he is thrilled Holmes has spoken about his church but does not know what to expect. 'Marie will be welcome back here whenever she wants. She is a local girl who was born and raised in Shallotte. I don't know if she will stay here or want to move on.' Friends said Holmes had talked about moving across the country to Seattle where her grandmother Hattie May lives. ' I think Marie was finding it hard to cope and being with her grandmother would have given her some much needed help,' said the friend. Providing for her family: The lucky lottery winner used to work at Walmart and this McDonald's before she quit to take care of her kids . ' She has not had it easy in her life and she has not had a lot of spare money to go around. I am so happy for her. She can give her children what she has never had.' Since 2010 Holmes has been living in the modular home with her mother Marika. The shades and blinds on the home were all drawn and a child's red bike left outside the front door such was the haste that the family left after their Powerball win. Her uncle William, 64, lives opposite but said he had not had a chance to speak with his niece. He revealed details of some of the hardship Holmes had faced as she struggled to bring up four children as a single mum. He said she had lived in low income housing with her children but had been forced to move back in with her mother. Her father, PJ Holmes, was jailed two years ago for five years. Bryant said: ' It has not been easy for her, but she has had her family behind her and that counts for a lot.' Mr Bryant said his niece was sensible but was worried that having won so much money – and gone public – that she could fall prey to people who want her money. 'I don't expect to see her back for sometime. I hope she is getting the best advice what to do with the money. 'She's a sensible lady, but there are people out there who will take advantage. When you win millions people come out of the woodwork and they can trick you. 'I hope she is very careful.'","Marie Holmes, 26, from Shalotte, North Carolina, won $118million .

"Kit Kats for one cent, razors for 50 cents and toothpaste for $1 - these are the crazy brand name sales up for grabs as a new online retailer heats up the supermarket price war. Online retailer Kogan.com, which is known for selling cheap electronics, is taking on supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths with a new grocery delivery site and promises to cut 50 percent off the price of weekly groceries. Kogan Pantry, which stocks non-perishable food items, household cleaning products and beauty and personal care, launched earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Founder and CEO of Kogan.com, Ruslan Kogan, is taking on supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths with a new grocery delivery site . Kogan Pantry, which stocks non-perishable food items, household cleaning products and beauty and personal care, launched earlier this month . Consumer group Choice has backed the new grocery site saying products they compared on Kogan were about 40 to 50 percent cheaper than equivalent products at Coles or Woolworths. The site has Kit Kats on sale for $0.01 and women's Schick razors for just $0.50. Colgate sensitive toothpaste is $1, Radiant (1.5kg) is $6 and BAM cleaner is on sale for $0.99. Founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan said the site was able to provide discounts by cutting out the middle man and selling directly to the consumer, news.com.au reports. 'We knew there was a lot of negative sentiment around supermarkets in Australia, we knew people didn't like them very much, but we had no idea to what extent,' Mr Kogan said. 'It feels great when we can take it to the big two.' Founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan said the site was able to provide discounts by cutting out the middle man and selling directly to the consumer . Laundry products . Radiant Laundry Powder (1.5kg) – Kogan: $6.92. Coles: $11 . Vanish Napisan Plus (1kg) – Kogan: $3.80. Woolworths: (2kg) $13.96 or $6.98/kilo . Razors .

Rice . Tilda Steamed Rice Brown Mushroom (250g) – Kogan: $2.54. Coles: $3.74. Woolworths: $2.00 (on special) But where Kogan Pantry differs from Coles and Woolworths is the site doesn't offer the full product range and doesn't offer fruit or vegetables. The site currently offers between 500 to 600 products. Mr Kogan says his site still offers brands that customers want, including Dove, Colgate, Palmolive, Pringles, Powerade and Gillette. The products on Kogan Pantry also carry a disclaimer saying they may be parallel imports, which means it may be an international variation and may differ from local products. Kogan Pantry has Kit Kats on sale for just $0.01 as it heats up the supermarket price war . Radiant laundry powder (1.5kg) is on sale via Kogan Pantry for $6 and BAM cleaner for $0.99 . Colgate sensitive has been slashed from $9.60 to just $1, according to the website . Choice compared the cost of products on Kogan to the online stores of Coles and Woolworths and found in various instances the price was nearly 50 percent less. But they also said consumers may get a better price if products were on sale in the supermarkets. While Kogan Pantry offers unlimited products for a fixed delivery rate of $9.99, Choice points out delivery takes longer than Coles and Woolworths. 'As long as you are happy to pay your $9.99 delivery fee and are happy with the fact that it might take a little longer to arrive, the prices are pretty hard to beat,' Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey.

"Not many people could drag us out of bed on a Sunday morning when it is -8C (18F) outside. But, true to form, Victoria Beckham drew a stellar crowd at her New York Fashion Week show today including Rachel Zoe, Anna Wintour and proud husband David, who sat front row next to the Vogue editor-in-chief with their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three. The designer, 40, seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this fall/winter 2015 collection. Knits were the order of the day with slinky midi-length dresses  opening the show. Cool factor: Victoria Beckham seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this fall/winter 2015 collection - there were lots of knits . Pale and interesting: The neutral palette, which included plenty of cream and taupe, showed just how luxurious winter white can look . In a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy (save a splash of orange and mustard yellow), the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe. Drapey cream skirts, sweaters designed to hang 'just so', and calf-scraping culottes. In fact, the latter contributed to a touch of what we can only describe as Borrowers-chic, in the oversized proportions of the coats and jumbo buttons on the dresses - though clever tailoring kept silhouettes elegant. But, says Mrs Beckham in her show notes, 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.' The shoes are certainly 'what women really want to wear.' Following her footwear debut last season, these were designed by Mrs Beckham too. The calf-length boots came in black and beige and had substantial heels in which one could actually envisage stomping around New York. Bright ideas: A pair of mustard yellow culottes and a vibrant orange coat were the designer's only concessions to bold colour . 'What women really want to wear': Mrs Beckham debuted a new footwear style (left) while bags were small and boxy (right) Turn up the volume! Mrs Beckham's oversized buttons and plays on proportion (left) called to mind costumes from the 1992 BBC children's TV series The Borrowers (right) Though bags are an important category for Mrs Beckham's brand, there was less focus on them than in seasons past. We did see a few tiny boxy styles, almost small enough to fit in the palm of a model's hand, and one sleek, minimal foldover number. The creative process for this collection, Mrs Beckham says in her notes, was a little different from usual. 'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote. 'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process. 'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges... 'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.' Flower power: The final looks included asymmetric skirts seemingly assembled of iridescent petals . Future perfect: In a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy, the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe . Take a bow: The designer was greeted by applause when she stepped out from backstage after the show . Family affair: Mrs Beckham's husband, David, sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Daughter Harper, three, sat on his lap, and sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12 and Cruz, nine, to his right. Ms Wintour was joined by her daughter, Bee Shaffer (pictured far right) ALSO AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK... By Olivia Fleming at New York Fashion Week for Dailymail.com . Victoria Beckham wasn't the only London-based designer to show at New York Fashion Week this weekend. Isa Arfen's creative director Serafina Sama, who is originally from Ravenna, Italy, presented a beautiful fall/winter 2015 collection inspired by Italian Vogue fashion spreads from the Nineties and late Seventies glamour at Milk Studios in downtown Manhattan. Instead of a runway show, however, models posed on boxes covered in large sheets of canvas fabric, like an exquisite painting brought to life. A velvet-looking maroon corduroy suit worn with a lacy green shirt sparked nostalgia for the Seventies, while sophisticated evening looks - a black midlength tube skirt decorated with sequined fringe detail at the hem (like the bottom of a delicate chandelier) and a slinky pink satin slip dress with a knotted bow on the waist - recalled Nineties glamour. The exotic dark plum lipstick also helped.

Evans says of the way he looked back in 2010 (pictured right) The My Kitchen Rules judge shrugs off the overwhelming amount of flack he receives for advocating the strict diet which includes him not drinking coffee because it's a stimulant. 'Pete bashing has become a sort of national pastime,' he said with a laugh. Evans insists that he doesn't miss the fatty and rich food that he used to eat but friend and fellow MKR judge, Manu Feildel, admits he misses ordering enough for 12 people with his old pal. 'Show me some evidence that this does not work. Show me all the people who are getting sick from adopting this way. You are not going to find it.' Experts have described the diet as potentially dangerous which gets Evans' blood boiling saying if it could be proven that Paleo put people at risk then he would eat his 'f***** hat'. But the French chef also admires his mate adding: 'It takes balls to do that.'

Evans' blood boiling saying if it could be proven that Paleo put people at risk then he would eat his 'f***** hat' Going one step further, Evans says people need to consider how eating grains can affect the health of future generations. 'I'm going to cop a lot of grief for this but if you want to look at it from a generational or an observational viewpoint of our species, we are producing weaker and weaker offspring as the generations progress,' he said. Evans also believes food such as 'inhumanely raised meat' and 'conventional dairy products' should be banned from every kitchen. From cheap bread, sugary cereals to processed foods made from refined carbohydrates and sugars, the Sydney chef shares his controversial beliefs on what healthy eating means to him. Manu (left) says Evans has a lot of balls to take on the diet but thinks the regime is extreme . Evans says people need to consider how eating grains can affect the health of future generations . Evans sparked a food war against concerned health experts for promoting the 'caveman diet' that cuts out grains, legumes, sugar and dairy. But the father-of-two said not only is he in the best shape of his life – he's also the happiest he's ever been. 'Critics don't really seem to grasp what Paleo is,' Evans told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's not a diet, nor is it nutritionally incompetent nor is it a fad. All these labels serve to do is disconnect Paleo far away from its reality. 'At its heart, Paleo is a way of life and a balanced approach to returning to eat the most natural foods available, straight from the source. 'Scientific research shows that by consuming what our ancestors and modern-day hunter-gatherer tribes continue to consume today, we can take back control of our health and live a life of optimal wellness. 'These societies don't tend to suffer from the modern chronic diseases that plague the developed world and for me that's powerful information worth investigating.' The Paleo diet includes a lot of meat but not the 'inhumanely raised' kind . Manu (left) says Evans' brain now works at ' 100 miles an hour' since being on the Paleo diet . Banned: 1. Processed foods  from refined carbohydrates and sugars 2. Sugary cereals and 3. Cheap bread . The Paleo style of eating has been sweeping across the globe with its focus on high intake of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, some fruit, seeds and nuts. 'Paleo is very beneficial,' Evans said. 'It's a way of returning to a far more natural way of eating and a way of using the foods you eat to drive optimal health and balance in your body. 'By ditching refined carbohydrates and sugars and replacing them with moderate amounts of protein, good-quality fats and lots of nutrient-dense vegetables, you'll have energy to burn. 'And you can concentrate for long periods without experiencing the brain fogginess and blood sugar roller-coaster ride that comes with eating a diet full of refined carbs and sugars.' Banned from the cupboard: 4. Conventional dairy products 5. Inhumanely raised meat 6. 'Toxic' cooking oil . The Paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of Australians to embrace the lifestyle but one of the country's leading dieticians Susie Burrell recently slammed the 'diet' as 'questionable'. 'Every single person is different and we are not saying they should not eat less-refined food and sugar, but to say don't eat grains and all sugar is bad – these blanket statements are the problem,' Burrell said. But Evans said there has been lots of scientific research proving just how bad refined carbs and sugars are for long-term health and for those who suffer from auto-immune diseases. 'Indeed, in the Western world, we have never been sicker or fatter. The way we have eaten in modern-day society is not working and change is critical. 'I've also met some of the most influential and inspirational people on the planet, whose scientific research around the future of nutrition backs up the potency adopting a Paleo lifestyle can have on your overall health and wellness.' The Paleo lifestyle, which Evans is a long-time supporter of, bans all dairy, grains, preservatives and sugar .","Controversial king of Paleo reveals that he loves what he sees in the mirror .

"A hacking ring has stolen up to $1billion from banks around the world in what would be one of the biggest banking breaches known, a Russian cybersecurity firm says in a report. Questions were raised in late 2013 when an ATM in Kiev, Ukraine, began dispensing money at random times, when no one had put in a card or touched a button. Security cameras shows that money would be picked up by customers who appeared to be in the right place at the right time. But when Kaspersky Lab was called in to investigate, it was revealed that the ATM was part of a much-larger banking breach. A hacking ring has stolen up to $1billion from banks around the world in what would be one of the biggest banking breaches known.The hackers have been active since at least the end of 2013 and infiltrated more than 100 banks in 30 countries, according to Russian security company Kaspersky Lab . The hackers have been active since at least the end of 2013 and infiltrated more than 100 banks in 30 countries, according to Russian security company Kaspersky Lab. After gaining access to banks' computers through phishing schemes and other methods, they lurk for months to learn the banks' systems, taking screen shots and even video of employees using their computers, the report says. Once the hackers become familiar with the banks' operations, they use that knowledge to steal money without raising suspicions, programming ATMs to dispense money at specific times or setting up fake accounts and transferring money into them, according to Kaspersky. The report is set to be presented on Monday at a security conference in Cancun, Mexico. It was first reported by The New York Times. The hackers seem to limit their theft to about $10million before moving on to another bank, part of the reason why the fraud was not detected earlier, Kaspersky principal security researcher Vicente Diaz said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. The attacks are unusual because they target the banks themselves rather than customers and their account information, Diaz said. The goal seems to be financial gain rather than espionage, he said. 'In this case they are not interested in information. They're only interested in the money,' he said. 'They're flexible and quite aggressive and use any tool they find useful for doing whatever they want to do.' Most of the targets have been in Russia, the United States, Germany, China and Ukraine, although the attackers may be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, Kaspersky says. Kaspersky did not identify the banks and is still working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks . In one case, a bank lost $7.3million through ATM fraud. In another case, a financial institution lost $10million by the attackers exploiting its online banking platform. Kaspersky did not identify the banks and is still working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks, which the company says are ongoing. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit that alerts banks about hacking activity, said in a statement that its members received a briefing about the report in January. 'We cannot comment on individual actions our members have taken, but on balance we believe our members are taking appropriate actions to prevent and detect these kinds of attacks and minimize any effects on their customers,' the organization said in a statement. 'The report that Russian banks were the primary victims of these attacks may be a significant change in targeting strategy by Russian-speaking cybercriminals.' The White House is putting an increasing focus on cybersecurity in the wake of numerous data breaches of companies ranging from mass retailers like Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment and health insurer Anthem. The administration wants Congress to replace the existing patchwork of state laws with a national standard giving companies 30 days to notify consumers if their personal information has been compromised.","Kaspersky Lab reports that hackers have been active since end of 2013 .

"Businesses lost thousands of pounds over Valentine's weekend after a technical problem meant card transactions could not be processed . Dozens of businesses lost thousands of pounds over Valentine's Day weekend after a technical problem left them unable to accept card payments. Problems with chip and pin card transactions started on Friday night and continued throughout Saturday because of issues with the network, run by Global Payments Inc. Shops, restaurants, cafes and pubs complained about losing business because they could not process card payments throughout Friday evening most of Saturday - one of the busiest weekends of the year.

"An autistic boy has described how his teachers would pin him down, drag him through a hallway and lock him in a concrete 'scream room'. Carson Luke still has nightmares about the harrowing experience four years ago at a school for the disabled in Chesapeake, Virginia. The 13-year-old was sent into the secluded chamber - hidden behind metal doors and separated from the main school building - after an aggressive outburst in 2011. When he was inside workers turned on a ventilation fan to drown out his screaming. The ordeal were so haunting the youngster would fly into a panic when the room was talked about. One on occasion, faculty members broke his hand after trapping it in the heavy door as they tried to force him inside. The wound was so deep the bone was exposed and he required surgery. He told his story as newly-released documents from the Department of Education reveal some teachers use handcuffs, bungee cords and duct tapes to restrain students. Horrifying: Carson Luke, 13, still has nightmares about the experience at a school in Chesapeake, Virginia, four years ago when he was locked in a concrete seclusion room . 'That's code for a concrete room with deadbolts that looks like it's out of an old Russian prison,' said Carson's mother, Heather Luke. The use of seclusion rooms, as they are known, is contentious, but they are widely used across the country. Because of stories like Carson's, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation to rein in the use of seclusion and restraint as methods of controlling children in public schools. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is expected to soon sign the bill into law, making the state the 33rd to govern the use of seclusion and restraint in schools by law or regulation. Critics say such techniques are almost always unnecessary to keep order in the classroom and are actually counterproductive, exposing kids to physical and emotional injury and long-term trauma. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Education, the school Carson went to used seclusion 559 times and restraint 177 times in 2011, the year Carson was injured. The new Virginia legislation requires the state Board of Education to develop statewide regulations governing the use of seclusion and restraint. It was passed over the objections of lobbyists for school boards and principals who said it would allow school administrators too little discretion. Injuries: On one occasion he broke his hand when teachers trapped it in the 'quiet room's' door. The wound was so deep the bone was exposed and doctors had to operate on it . Seclusion and restraint 'can be an appropriate and necessary technique to utilize in order to avoid dangerous situations and to maintain order in the public schools,' attorney Kathleen Mehfoud wrote on behalf of Virginia school boards and superintendents. The legislation was recommended by the Virginia Commission on Youth, which has studied the issue over the past year. The commission received more than 60 public comments, some from parents describing abusive treatment of their children at school. The mother of an autistic child described how he was held down face first on a concrete floor by five adults until he had a seizure, wet himself and passed out from exhaustion. The mother of another disabled child told of visiting her son's school and discovering he had been strapped into a chair facing a blank wall for a 'time-out.' In many cases, the parents said they weren't told when the methods were used on their children. In almost all cases, the complaints involved children with disabilities. Nationally, according to the commission, while students with disabilities make up just 12 percent of all students, they represent 75 percent of those physically restrained and 58 percent of those secluded. There have been repeated attempts in Congress over the past five years to establish nationwide standards, but they have gone nowhere. Nightmares: Carson's mother Heather has said her son's physical wounds may have healed, but the emotional ones were still there . A 2014 survey found that 32 of Virginia's 133 school systems had no guidelines on how or whether the methods should be used. The new legislation requires that the Virginia regulations be consistent with 15 principles developed by the U.S. Department of Education. According to those principles: . — Seclusion and restraint should not be used except in situations where the child's behavior poses imminent danger of serious physical harm to himself or others and other interventions are ineffective. — Teachers and school staff should be trained on safe use of the techniques and on alternative measures. — When seclusion and restraint are used, parents should be notified as soon as possible. The Luke family now lives in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and Carson attends a school where seclusion and restraint are almost never used. 'His aggressive tendencies have almost been completely extinguished,' Heather Luke said. 'The progress he's made has been remarkable. 'His physical wounds have healed. The emotional ones are still with us.'","Carson Luke, 10, was locked inside the so-called quiet room in March 2011 .

"Cyber insecurity: Marc Goodman, a security consultant for organizations like the United Nations and Interpol, has a forthcoming book  about how technology may give the upper hand to criminals . It isn't just researchers finding applications for brain scanning and artificial intelligence, but rather criminals who may be able to exploit these emerging technologies faster than they can be secured. A new book from security consultant Marc Goodman called Future Crimes exposes the possible threats that a technologically advanced future poses. 'I could see a horrific scenario wherein somebody is kidnapped and threatened that unless they pay an exorbitant sum, their lifelong memories of their wife or daughter would be erased,' Goodman told Singularity Hub. 'We're a long way away' from that scenario, according to Goodman, a Global Security Advisor for Singularity University, which publishes Hub, though technology like neuropharmeceuticals, which the Army is exploring to minimize traumatic brain activity caused by PTSD, make it a possibility in the future. Having also consulted for law enforcement organizations like Interpol as well as the United Nations, Goodman cautions that criminals may be among the first adopters of emerging technologies. One particular area of concern for Goodman is the advancement of artificial intelligence, the ability of computers to perform traditional cognitive functions such as reason, learn and plan. 'We’re using AI every day,' says Goodman. 'Whether it’s in our GPS devices, in our Netflix recommendations, what we see on our Facebook status updates and streams—all of that is controlled via AI.' But even these forms of 'narrow' artificial intelligence could be pressed into service by criminals, and Goodman points out one instance where Siri was used to help cover up a murder. 'In one case, a University of Florida student was accused of killing his college roommate for dating his girlfriend,' said Goodman. 'What does he do with the dead body before him?' 'He had never murdered anybody before, and he had no idea how to dispose of the body. So, he asked Siri. The answers Siri returned? Mine, swamp, and open field, among others.' Other existing technology that is growing more sophisticated, like EEG headsets, could also be utilized for criminal activity. Infiltration: Cyber criminals could find a way to insert malware that could access an EEG headset, like the Emoriv Epoc, pictured with its developer edition device, which could be used to scan for personal info . A study by researchers from Oxford, UC Berkley and University of Geneva in 2012 found electroencephalogram devices, which measure the electrical activity in the brain, could be used to steal banking information. The study found that just by showing an image of a pin pad to a person strapped to an EEG headset, an attacker revealed the victim's PIN 20% of the time, much better than random chance. While the term 'cyber Pearl Harbor' has been tossed around as a way to warn about the grave risks associated with not improving the United States' electronic security, Goodman has argued that a 'cyber Manhattan Project' is really what is needed. The convergence of public and private expertise, like the effort that led to the development of nuclear devices, could lead to technology that secures computers against increasingly frequent attacks. Goodman writes that computer systems at banks and major retailers like Target and Home Depot that were attacked over the last couple years, as well critical infrastructure are vulnerable. 'We’ve wired the world, but failed to secure it,' Goodman said.","Security adviser Marc Goodman predicted criminals will exploit technology like artificial intelligence and brain scanning .

"Double murderer: convicted murderer Patrick C. Daniel allegedly planned to escape from prison . Muskegon Correctional Facility workers have foiled the escape plot of a former Ann Arbor man convicted of two murders. President Tom Tylutki of the Michigan Corrections Organization says corrections officers at the Muskegon facility discovered Patrick C. Daniel’s, 44, plans to escape from a medium-security unit on Wednesday. Daniel was is a medium-security unit for 'good behavior.' Tylutki says homemade items, including maps of West Michigan, a compass, two flashlights and a yarn rope were found in the man’s cell. The Muskegon Chronicle reports a prison uniform painted white, additional clothing and packaged food also was found in the cell. During a search of the prison auditorium, corrections officers discovered items that could have been used as weapons. A Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman says Daniel was placed in segregation after the discoveries. He says the Michigan State Police is investigating. 'We have some very alert staff who foiled what appeared to be a planned escape,' said MDOC spokesman Chris Gautz. 'We're very appreciative, and we really want to commend the staff who found what they found and derailed this plan.' Tylutki claims that a corrections officer was making rounds Wednesday morning in the prison yard and while looking a garbage bin found a prisoners uniform that had been painted black. The uniform led  officers to Daniel's cell, where they later found the other items. Patrick Daniel, who was arrested in Utah, was convicted in the deaths of of 35-year-old Robert Stanley Bilton Jr. in September 2001 and of his girlfriend 31-year-old Becky Britton in March 2002, whose body also was found in his car. The bodies were found after Daniel was pulled over March 14 in Sevier County, Utah, for a missing license plate. Police  said Daniel hired Bilton at a Detroit rehabilitation center and homeless shelter. Daniel promised to pay him $10 an hour to be a caretaker for an apartment complex, they said. Several days later, Bilton, of Dearborn, was dead. Prison: Muskegon Correctional Facility (pictured) workers found suspicious items that led them to Daniel's cell . He had been strangled, his body wrapped in plastic and stuffed into the trunk of a car. Police also found the frozen and dismembered body of Britton, Daniel's former girlfriend. Authorities suspect Daniel was trying to steal Bilton's identity. Police found Bilton's empty wallet in the basement of Daniel's Ann Arbor condominium, according to court records. Daniel had a copy of a birth certificate and Bilton's Social Security number. The two men also had similar physical characteristics, police said. Daniel is being held in the Washtenaw County Jail without bond. A preliminary exam was set for July 3.","Muskegon Correctional Facility workers have foiled the escape plot of Patrick Daniel, 44, a man convicted of two murders .

"Homeowners have a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash job carried out by gardeners, cleaners and handymen, Ed Balls said yesterday. The Shadow Chancellor said he always asked for a written record even if it was for £10 to trim a hedge – because it was the ‘right thing to do’. His crackdown on cash-in-hand jobs was branded ‘completely out of touch’ yesterday as he extended Labour’s war on tax avoidance to ordinary families. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls was accused of being 'completely out of touch' after claiming people had a duty to collect receipts from gardeners and cleaners . Mr Balls has vowed to clamp down on ‘tax planning’ by the middle classes, suggesting Labour could go even further if it wins power in May. But pressed about what constitutes tax avoidance, he told the BBC: ‘The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.’ Asked if he followed this rule himself, he replied: ‘Absolutely. That’s because I am the Shadow Chancellor and I’m extremely careful about these things. ‘Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not been given a receipt for it? Probably yes. But he said he had not done so ‘since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters’. Tory MP Peter Bone said it was ‘ludicrous’ to expect people to collect receipts and personal information for minor work. And he accused Labour of wrongly implying that all small businesses were trying to dodge taxes. ‘There are so many cash businesses,’ said the Wellingborough MP. ‘If you go into a cafe for a cup of tea you would not expect a receipt for it. If you were running a fish and chip shop you do not always give receipts. It shows a complete lack of understanding of business. Is he trying to imply that if you are a small business that deals in cash, you are trying to dodge tax? ‘I think it shows how completely out of touch he is with small business. There is an implication that everybody is out to fiddle their taxes. It is just wrong.’ Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt' The row comes as a study reveals that paid work not declared to the taxman is worth an estimated £150billion a year, but is lower than most other western countries. Britain’s so-called ‘black economy’ was equivalent to 10 per cent of national income in 2013, but half the level of cash-in-hand work in Italy, Greece and Spain. It was also lower than the 13.4 per cent average for all 34 leading nations in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Ed Balls today defended Labour's decision to accept a £1.65million donation in shares rather than cash as 'tax efficient' - despite hitting out at people avoiding paying their fair share. Shopping channel tycoon John Mills made the donation 2013. But by giving the party shares instead of money it reduced the tax Mr Miliband's party had to pay. Mr Balls, speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 live, said this was 'small beer compared with what the Tories are up to'. He also insisted he didn't 'know the details of [the Mills donation] and it would be wrong for me to do so because as I think it is important that I can be objective on these matters.' However, he insisted that David Cameron should have carried out a more comprehensive analysis of Lord Green, the former HSBC chairman, before he was made a minister. Grant Shapps, the Tory Chairman, said that 'Labour say one thing on tax avoidance, but do another.' 'Last week Ed Miliband criticised the practice, but today Ed Balls has admitted that the Party accepts 'tax efficient' donations because they 'need the money,'' said Mr Shapps. Free market think-tank the Institute for Economic Affairs, which carried out the study, found no evidence for a surge in undeclared work during the recession, adding that cash-in-hand work in the UK is at a lower level than in 1997-8 when it was equivalent to 13 per cent of national income. In 2010, however, HMRC claimed that it missed out on £42billion in revenue because of tax fraud, avoidance and underpayment – £4 billion higher than the previous year. A survey last year found that four out of five families had paid a workman cash-in-hand during the previous 12 months. Almost a third said they had done so three times or more. Some 14 per cent said they would rather pay less money for a service by paying cash, even if they knew the tradesman was avoiding tax.Treasury minister David Gauke sparked controversy on the issue in 2012 after claiming it was ‘morally wrong’ to pay cash-in-hand. Mr Gauke said making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was on a par with tax avoidance, which ministers have already called ‘morally repugnant’. He added: ‘Getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the Revenue and means others must pay more in tax.’ Asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice, he said: ‘Yes, I think it’s morally wrong.’","Ed Balls accused of being 'completely out of touch' over suggestion .

"It was the wedding of their dreams, at a beachfront Caribbean hotel surrounded by family and friends. But while most of the other hotel guests happily congratulated newlyweds Kate and Robert Whitaker, one was left distinctly unimpressed. In a scathing 560-word review on the TripAdvisor website, a holidaymaker at the Mango Bay on Barbados vents her frustration at showjumper Mr Whitaker, 32, a member of the Whitaker equestrian dynasty, and his new wife, 37. Beachfront wedding: Robert and Kate Whitaker's wedding at Mango Bay, Barbados last month angered a fellow hotel guest to the point where she wrote a scathing review on Tripadvisor . She does not name them but refers to a ‘very well-known showjumper’ and his ‘exceedingly loud Essex fiancee’ before complaining about their guests ‘causing havoc to the ambiance, with their middle of the night drinking and shouting’. The identity of the unhappy guest at the 76-room hotel – which costs around £1,500 per person for seven nights – is a mystery, but her TripAdvisor profile says she is a woman aged over 65 living in East Yorkshire. She has the user name adrienne3. Mr and Mrs Whitaker – who live in Kent and are not from Essex – were alerted to the review by one of their bridesmaids back in Britain. ‘So many people congratulated us the following day at breakfast, but obviously we must have upset this one person,’ said Mrs Whitaker. The review begins: ‘After three days at Mango Bay I was ready to give the hotel five stars. However the impact of a so-called upper-crust wedding party spoiled the serenity.’ Mr and Mrs Whitaker were joined by 60 friends and family, including Mr Whitaker’s father John, 59, the British equestrian and former Olympian, and his uncle Michael, 54, also a showjumper . Happy day: Mr Whitaker and his wife, who have a one-year-old daughter, Evie, married on January 13 . Accusations Guest called Mrs Whitaker an ‘exceedingly loud Essex fiancee’ and said the wedding made her stay at the hotel feel 'more like a week with a load of lager louts' The reviewer says she asked a security guard to tell the party to be quiet but was told ‘I can’t do that’, she claimed. In her TripAdvisor review of the hotel, the pensioner calling herself adrienne3 wrote: . ‘After three days at Mango Bay I was ready to give the hotel five stars. However the impact of a so-called upper-crust wedding party spoiled the serenity. ‘A very well-known showjumper (you know who you are) arrived with his exceedingly loud Essex fiancee and 80 guests causing complete havoc to the ambience, with their middle of the night drinking and shouting etc. ‘A request to the security guard to ask them to be quiet was met with, “I can’t do that”. ‘When I mentioned it to Pedro in the morning, all he would say was that mine was not the only complaint. ‘Obviously the hotel were making an awful lot of money from this wedding but why should other guests have to suffer because of their obnoxious and rude behaviour. ‘It was more like a week with a load of Blackpool lager louts than a stay at a 4.5-star hotel. ‘The wedding of a Northern couple two days later was done in the best possible taste and no problems, as far as I am aware, was caused to the other guests. ‘Other than the presence of the gross Essex wedding party we had a wonderful time and possibly would return in the future.’ 'When I mentioned it to Pedro in the morning, all he would say was that mine was not the only complaint,’ she wrote. Complaining about ‘obnoxious and rude behaviour’, she adds: ‘It was more like a week with a load of Blackpool lager louts than a stay at a 4.5-star hotel.’ The writer praises the hotel itself but complains about the noise from the karaoke bar – although she does add: ‘But it is only on a Sunday night and not EVERY night as it was with the wedding crowd.’ Mr Whitaker, originally from Huddersfield, and his wife, who have a one-year-old daughter, Evie, married on January 13. They were joined by 60 friends and family, including Mr Whitaker’s father John, 59, the British equestrian and former Olympian, and his uncle Michael, 54, also a showjumper. Last night Mrs Whitaker said: ‘There was not one Essex person there – not that there would have been a problem had there been. She stereotyped everyone.’ She said that while some of their party enjoyed drinks and dinner at the hotel during their holiday, the TripAdvisor comments were ‘quite far from the truth’. She also said they held their evening wedding reception at a nearby restaurant, not at the hotel. ‘I don’t believe anybody acted untoward, especially on the wedding day because it was the middle of the day and we went on elsewhere to drink and eat,’ she said. The author of the review did not respond to a request for comment.","Wedding of Kate and Robert Whitaker angered fellow hotel guest .

"A super-fan has spent a whopping £10,000 on what could be the UK's biggest Dolly Parton collection - including CDs, magazines and life-size cutouts of the singer herself. Obsessed Joe Skelly, 46, a retail manager from Cockermouth, Cumbria, bought his first Dolly Parton CD at the age of just eight years old, and instantly fell in love with the queen of country music. Since then, he has dedicated his life to the singer, spending thousands on his impressive collection - but he insists the memorabilia is 'priceless'. Joe Skelly, 46,  from Cockermouth, Cumbria, bought his first Dolly Parton CD when he was eight years old . Joe's Cumbria cottage is crammed with records, CDs, DVDs, books and life-size cutouts of the singer herself . Joe has even been lucky enough to meet his idol, and travelled all the way to Dolly's home state of Tennessee to visit the Dollywood theme park. Despite his collection filling every nook and cranny of his idyllic Cumbrian cottage, Joe is always on the hunt for new items. 'I absolutely love Dolly and everything she stands for,' he said of the 69-year-old performer. 'My collection started off with a few CDs, and before I knew it I had everything that she's ever recorded.' He added: 'It grew from there and I now I have all sorts of Dolly memorabilia - from books and movies to jigsaws and teapots.' In 2002, Joe finally met the object of his obsession, and it exceeded all his expectations. 'When I met her it was the best day of my life, she was so warm and welcoming,' he said. 'Some people do get a bit surprised by the Dolly cut out in the window of the cottage, but everybody knows I'm her number one fan - I'm always getting Dolly related stuff for my birthdays and Christmas - I love it.' Joe (pictured with Dolly in 2011) attends all her concerts and always attends chat shows she appears on . In 2002, Joe finally met his idol (pictured). He said: 'It was the best day of my life, she was so warm' As a child, Joe kept his love of Dolly a secret due to being raised in a strict religious environment until he moved out as a teenager. 'Listening to popular music wasn't really the done thing in my house as a child,' he explained. 'I used to play Dolly's CDs in secret over and over again and I kept any memorabilia in a draw so that no one could see it. I'd go to record stores and just buy anything that was available.' Once he moved out, his obsession became even stronger. 'As soon as I left home, I had more freedom so I started to build my collection and it just grew and grew. 'Now I've got about 150 CDs, 50 books, every album she's ever released including compilations and re-releases, posters, photographs, drawings, mugs, lunchboxes, T-shirts, jumpers - everything you can get. 'I've spent a lot of money over the years - about £10,000 - but to me my collection is priceless.' One of his most prized possessions is a life-size cut-out of the 69-year-old country singer .

Joe attended all nine concerts, and was even invited to meet Dolly in her dressing room after a concert. 'She was dressed head to toe in gold and was just so lovely,' Joe remembered. 'I gave her some flowers and she signed a few CDs - it was very sweet of her to take time out of her day to do that. 'I was on a total high for days afterwards. 'Since then I've met Dolly a few more times, and I'll always sit in the audiences of chat shows that she appears on. Joe has now founded the Dolly Parton Fan Club - Dolly Part'ners UK for like-minded British people . 'She even recognises now and knows me by name, it's wonderful.' The most expensive item in Joe's giant collection is a set of rare original recordings. The much sought after recordings cost Joe a cool £2,000 - but he says they're well worth the hefty price tag. He said: 'I'd been on the hunt for the recordings for ages, so when I got my hands on them it was great. 'But my favourite piece in the collection is actually an album called Real Love that is signed by Dolly herself. 'I just love the album and the fact that she's signed it is really special.' Joe's love of the country singer isn't unsual, his fan club Dolly Part'ners UK now  has hundreds of members . Joe has been building his collection since he was a child listening to her music in secret . Joe, along with a friend, has even set up the UK's top Dolly Parton Fan Club - Dolly Part'ners UK. The club, which was started in 1997, now has hundreds of members from across the UK. Joe said: 'I was looking for a fan club to join and realised that there wasn't really an active one in the UK - so I decided to set one up myself. 'At first it was just a newsletter that people could sign up to that talked about the latest Dolly releases. 'But now we have a full blown website - it's great to think we're helping Dolly share her amazing music.'","Joe Skelly, 46, a retail manager from Cockermouth, Cumbria, has spent an estimated £10,000 on Dolly Parton-related memorabilia .

"It was a moment that even the strong-willed Ben Parkinson must have doubted would ever arrive. More than eight years after a Taliban bomb shattered his body, the extraordinary soldier has walked unsupported for the first time. After four weeks being treated with pressurised oxygen, Lance Bombadier Parkinson’s seemingly dead nerves and muscles are regenerating like something out of science fiction. Scroll down for video . Progress: Former paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs during a bomb blast, can now walk two miles using his crutches and has taken his first six steps unaided thanks to a pioneering oxygen treatment . The 30-year-old war hero has felt the tingle of nerves in his upper legs and the resulting ability to move his hips himself means he can walk on prosthetic legs without crutches. His speech is clearer, he is regaining control and use of his left arm and, astonishingly, tiny bits of shrapnel embedded since 2006 have been emerging from his body. His mother Diane Dernie, 57, said: ‘We could count about 20 changes in the past month – some big, some small. What’s happening is astounding.’ The most seriously injured soldier to survive in Afghanistan, he lost both his legs and broke his back, hips and ribs, as well as suffering brain damage, when his Land Rover hit a mine. He was unconscious in a military hospital for three months. Treatment: The 30-year-old war hero is one of the first soldiers in Britain to be given the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), which works to rebuild his tissues and muscles . The procedure involves sitting in a huge metal cylinder for up to two hours, during which time the patient breathes in pressurised pure oxygen . Ben underwent the treatment for six days a week over the course of the month. By the third week, he had taken the steps unaided and his speech is also said to be 'rapidly improving' Fighter: The inspirational former soldier (pictured left and right before the bomb blast) has also regained the feeling in his legs for the first time since the incident eight years ago . Probably the most significant moment in L/Bdr Parkinson’s long journey back from the brink came last week at the Castle Craig Hospital in Edinburgh. Ben Parkinson’s astonishing progress may help convince the medical establishment of the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, still regarded with suspicion by many doctors. Patients breathe oxygen through a mask in a chamber at twice atmospheric pressure. Oxygen is a key part of the healing process, helping repair and regenerate tissue and cells and reducing inflammation. Professor Philip James, an expert in hyperbaric medicine at the University of Dundee, says there is overwhelming evidence that brain cells can be revived and stem cells stimulated to grow new nerve cells. Oxygen therapy is cheap – with chambers costing as little as £45 a session – and as well being used to treat injured soldiers could help stroke patients recover. There were tears from him and his mother when he walked ‘three or four steps completely unsupported’ in the clinic’s gym after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and putting himself through eight gruelling hours of physiotherapy a day. Mrs Dernie said: ‘He got us all up one night saying he’d awoken because he could feel all the nerves in his legs wake up. It has been incredibly emotional.’ He has now returned home to Doncaster but will continue with his treatment at a chamber in Rotherham. Previously he could walk on his false legs only in a style that meant he would never be free of crutches. The development of muscles and movement in his hips has enabled him to walk in a rocking style like other amputees. This progress is only the start. Experts hope that in the coming months there will be signs the oxygen therapy is repairing Ben’s brain damage, which has affected his memory and speech. Mrs Dernie, who found out about the therapy on the internet, said: ‘Ben is absolutely over the moon with his progress so far. We hope that eventually Ben’s brain will recover. It’s done wonders for the rest of his body so far so you never know.’ Ben was injured in 2006 when the Land Rover in which he was travelling hit a mine in Helmand Province . Wounded: Ben, pictured left at Colchester Barracks, and right with his mother Diane and brother Danny .

"It is a busy photographer's hurriedly composed snapshot of a puppy-faced teenager in a Hollywood backstreet. But this photograph was the very first step in Marilyn Monroe's journey to international superstardom. Now the original negative has been sold at auction for more than £3,000. Joseph Jasgur took the picture of smiling Monroe, her then-brunette hair loose in soft curls, in March 1946. Weeks later he took her for what's regarded as her first modelling shoot, on California's Zuma Beach. Fresh-faced: Joseph Jashur's very first hurried photograph of Marilyn Monroe, then a 19-year-old  factory girl called Norma Jean Dougherty, after she turned up at his studio and told him she wanted to be a model . Stripling: Another early picture of Monroe, this one by an unknown photographer, showing her light brown hair and slim but plump figure in a bikini on a California beach. It was taken in 1949 . Transformation: This photograph by Laszlo Willinger, taken around the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, shows Monroe as she transformed into the blonde bombshell she became known as . To those of us more used to seeing Monroe as a blonde bombshell in such Hollywood classics as Some Like It Hot and The Seven-Year Itch, this picture of the star is almost unrecognisable. Jasgur was commissioned in 1946 by the Blue Book agency to take pictures of various aspiring models, among them a 19-year-old factory girl called Norma Jeane Dougherty. Strapped for time when the aspiring model visited his studio in Hollywood, he photographed her on the run, in an alleyway behind Beverly Boulevard using a Rolleiflex camera. Afterwards, the story goes, Monroe went to a nearby diner for a hamburger and fries. Over the following weeks Jasgur snapped Marilyn in a number of locations, most famously on Zuma Beach in a swimsuit, before presenting the portfolio to Ben Lyon, casting director at 20th Century Fox, who signed the wannabe and turned her into Marilyn Monroe. The pictures are believed to give the truest depiction of Monroe, who went on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars and is still widely regarded to be one of the most-beautiful women to have ever lived. Sex bomb: Monroe went on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Left shows her in the gold lamé dress from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Right is an iconic scene from her 1955 film The Seven Year Itch . Changes: Monroe photographed in bed in November 1961, aged 35, less than a year before her death . America's favourite: A still from a Pathé newsreel showing Monroe in South Korea, where she travelled in 1954 to appear in USO shows entertaining American troops after the Korean War ceasefire . The auctioneer said the true value in the image sold yesterday lies in the fact that it is sold with the copyright to reproduce and distribute the image as the winning bidder wishes. It was sold to a private collector for £3,100 in an auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, on Saturday, smashing the £2,000 pre-sale estimate. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: 'The image was taken on March 6, 1946 as part of some informal test shots that proceeded a formal shoot. 'This image is a true genesis as it is one of the first professional images ever taken of Marilyn. 'Jasgur first photographed her on a small street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard, where this image was taken. 'He didn't have time in his studio so went outside in the street. It is a very candid picture and she is looking very young with a bit of puppy fat still in her face. 'Over the next few weeks Jasgur photographed her on top of Don Lee Towers, above the Hollywood sign and at Zuma Beach. 'This photo offers a unique glimpse of the young girl who was to become the global phenomena that was Marilyn Monroe.'","Snapshot was taken by Joseph Jasgur at the prompting of a model agency .

"Philip Levine, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience - died at his Fresno, California home on Saturday, at age 87. Former US poet laureate from 2011 to 2012, Levine passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer, his wife said Sunday. He was among the country's most decorated poets, winning the Pulitzer in 1995 for The Simple Truth and the National Book Awards for the 1979 collection Ashes and for What Work Is. Levine's other honors included the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for lifetime achievement and a National Book Critics Circle Award. Philip Levine (pictured in 2006), a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose intimate portraits of blue-collar life were grounded in personal experience and political conscience, died at his California home on Saturday at age 87. While he taught in several colleges, Levine had little in common with the academic poets of his time, as he was not abstract, insular or digressive. Levine captured the ways 'ordinary people are extraordinary,' while writing poems that are accessible to readers, said Edward Hirsch, a friend of Levine and president of the Guggenheim Foundation. 'They move between the most ordinary diction and high romantic heights.' He added: 'We've lost a great presence in American poetry.' Born in Detroit in 1928 and the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Levine was profoundly shaped by his working-class childhood and years spent working in jobs ranging from driving a truck to assembling parts at a Chevrolet plant. As a poet, he consciously modeled himself after Walt Whitman, as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder. This was evident in his tactile, conversational poems that focused on his childhood, living in Spain, marriage, parenting and poetry itself. Levine was also a lover of the earth and sky as much as any poet of nature, but his poems explored the pangs of work and workers, such as Buying and Selling or Saturday Sweeping, in which employees toil under a leaky roof and 'blue hesitant light.' In What Work Is, the title piece of his celebrated 1991 collection, he offers a grim sketch of standing on line in the rain, hoping for a job: . This is about waiting, . shifting from one foot to another. Feeling the light rain falling like mist . into your hair, blurring your vision . until you think you see your own brother . ahead of you, maybe ten places. The former poet laureate from 2011 to 2012 passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer, his wife said Sunday. He was among the country's most decorated poets, winning the Pulitzer in 1995 for The Simple Truth and National Book Awards for the 1979 collection Ashes and for What Work Is . Levine's father, who was an auto-parts salesman, died when he was five years old. And although his mother found work as an office manager, he remembered his childhood as 'a succession of moves from first a house to a series of ever-shrinking apartments.' As a kid, he was scrawny and imagined himself in peril on the streets of Detroit, 'the most anti-Semitic city west of Munich.' He would picture himself walking home from school with a rifle, shooting at Cadillacs, Lincolns and other cars owned by rich people. By the end 1942, when he was 14, and had worked at a soap factory and, like a first kiss, he discovered poetry. Levine became fond of it while attending Detroit's Central High School in 1945, after a teacher let him borrow a book by poet Wilfred Owen, according to the Detroit Free Press. He would walk the streets late at night, speaking to the 'moon and stars about the emotional revolution that was raging' inside him. Levine later attended Wayne State University, where he read the verse of Stephen Crane, T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams, and 'immersed' himself in the history of poetry. 'I believed even then that if I could transform my experience into poetry I would give it the value and dignity it did not begin to possess on its own,' he later observed. The exhausting factory hours made Levine so determined to write that he showed up in 1953 at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop even though a planned fellowship had fallen through. He was told he could sign up for one course, but he enrolled in three, and Poet John Berryman became his mentor. 'He seemed to feel I had something genuine,' Levine told The Paris Review in 1988, 'but that I wasn't doing enough with it, wasn't demanding enough from my work. He kept directing me to poetry that would raise my standards.' As a poet, he (pictured in 1999) consciously modeled himself after Walt Whitman, as he strove to be a writer of everyday experience and cosmic wonder. This was evident in his tactile, conversational poems that focused on his childhood, living in Spain, marriage, parenting and poetry itself . Levine's other honors included the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for lifetime achievement (above Levine pictured in 1987 after receiving the prize) and a National Book Critics Circle Award . Poet Yvor Winters allowed Levine to stay with him at his home in California and also selected him for a Stanford Writing Fellowship in 1958. Around the same time, Levine joined the faculty of California State in Fresno and remained there for more than 30 years. He also taught at Princeton University and Columbia University among other colleges. Levine was married twice, to Patty Kanterman and to Frances J. Artley, his wife since 1954. He is survived by Artley, his twin brother Edward and another brother Eli, his three sons, Mark, John and Teddy, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, according to the New York Times. Levine's debut collection On the Edge came out in 1963, and other books included Not This Pig, They Feed the Lion and 1933. During a time in the 1960s, he spent time in Spain, and developed a deep bond to the country and to its people, especially those who had fought Francisco Franco during the country's civil war of the 1930s. He wrote poems about Spain and helped translate works by the Spanish poets Gloria Fuertes and James Sabines. When he was back in the US, Levine was an opponent of the Vietnam War and defender of civil rights and the rights of working people. In Coming Home, Detroit 1968, he took in 'the charred faces' and 'eyes boarded up' of his hometown, which had been devastated by riots the year before. In 1968, he also was among the writers who vowed not to pay taxes until the Vietnam War ended. 'I can remember feeling full of the power of a just cause and believing that power would not fail me. It failed me or I failed it. We didn't really change the way Americans lived, unless you take hairstyles seriously,' he once said. 'I'm not a man of action; it finally comes down to that. I'm not so profoundly moral that I can often overcome my fears of prison or torture or exile or poverty. I'm a contemplative person who goes in the corner and writes.'","One of the country's most decorated poets, Levine died at his Fresno, California home on Saturday from pancreatic and liver cancer .

"Fewer than one in seven child sex abuse cases probed by Britain's largest police force have led to criminal charges, figures have revealed. Scotland Yard investigated 7,205 reports of serious attacks on under-16s between 2010 and October last year - just 989 of which (14 per cent) ended with a person being prosecuted. Fewer offenders still were convicted after prosecutors, who were handed details by London's Metropolitan Police, tested cases against them through the courts. Failed: One in seven child sex abuse claims in London end in prosecution, figures show (posed by model) The figures, obtained by Mike Sullivan for the Sun on Sunday, show police success rates lagging despite a major crackdown on child sex abuse. The Met reportedly brought in up to 100 extra officers in 2013 to tackle sex abuse cases including child exploitation and the threat of grooming gangs. The shake-up was an attempt to improve the Met's controversial Operation Sapphire rape unit after it was accused of failings in previous years. An IPCC report in 2013 found 'under-performing and over-stretched' officers in Southwark, south London, had encourage adult victims to retract their allegations to boost detection rates. Today's figures are said to include rape, gang rape, child trafficking and sexual assault. Changes: The Met Police reportedly brought in up to 100 extra officers in 2013 to tackle sex abuse cases . Last year the NSPCC warned child rape rates were even worse than official figures suggest because many cases are never reported to the authorities. 'Not all cases come to the attention of the police and, even if they do, they may decide it is not in the best interests of the child to investigate an incident as a criminal offence,' a spokesman said. The charity previously said some child sex abuse cases were collapsing because children were being denied the support they needed to give evidence in court. Claiming fewer than a quarter of 23,000 offences in 2012 ended in a prosecution, the charity said all children giving evidence should have an intermediary to help deal with 'hostile' questioning. Responding to the call, the government issued new guidelines saying child sex abuse cases should only be dealt with by specialist prosecutors who ignore 'myths, stereotypes and prejudices'. Victims must also be offered 'appropriate support' such as counselling and criminal cases should be heard in court with as few delays as possible, the guidelines added. The Metropolitan Police did not immediately return requests for comment on today's figures.","Figures show Met Police told of 7,205 serious sex attacks on under-16s .

"When Eleanor Scotchbrook turned 30 she lost weight and find out that nothing in her wardrobe fit her any more. The marketing manager from Harlow, Essex, 33, had reached 12st 7lb and at 5ft 6in it was the heaviest she'd ever been - but after shedding nearly 3st over the next year, shrinking from a size 16 to a size 10, she had a new problem on her hands. She said: 'My confidence soared. The only problem was that now, each morning, I was faced with a rail of clothes which were all too big for me.' Eleanor Scotchbrook could no longer fit into her clothes after dropping 3st - so she revamped her wardrobe using charity shop finds. Pictured: Eleanor in a £4.50 Monsoon skirt and vintage £15 Longchamp bag . The £3 vintage bag and £4 Forever 21 lace collar top she wore on day 29 of the challenge (left) certainly don't look like charity shop finds . Eleanor had let her weight creep up, indulging her sweet tooth and eating large portions until she hit her landmark birthday and decided to go on a health kick. But a new body demanded a new wardrobe. She said: 'I was in danger of looking like a small kid playing dressing up in her mum's closet and my over-sized wardrobe wouldn't cut the mustard in my new marketing officer job at a hospice either. 'Although I could afford to buy a few pieces including an extra skirt or two on eBay, it wasn't enough.' And before working at St Clare Hospice as a marketing officer, she'd never have stepped foot inside a charity shop. 'Spending hours rummaging through rails in the vain hope of discovering a genuine vintage gem seemed far too much like hard work,' she said. Eleanor was very pleased with a Dorothy Perkins beige dress (left) which she bought for £5 . In her first week she found a pair of Kurt Geiger leather tan and gold studded sandals for only £15. 'A friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £100!' she said . She bought a month's worth of secondhand clothes, which set her back just £200. One find was a fitted River Island dress (right) which cost just £7 . 'And I'd always thought charity shops were just full of Aunty Mildred’s musty old cast-offs.' But St Clare Hospice had charity shops all around Essex. And so she decided to set herself a challenge. She said: 'What if I could replenish my wardrobe with second-hand items? I liked the idea of a challenge and I decided to take it one step further. Every day for a whole month I'd wear a different item bought from one of their charity shops. 'I'd also post a selfie of me in my new outfit on social media.' But she decided if she was going to go ahead she'd want it to be authentic. That meant finding clothes and accessories that she would genuinely pick off the shelf and buy from any other high street shop. She says: 'My personal style is fairly conservative but I do know what suits me and my body shape. And my finds would have to see me through all different occasions - work, social events and the gym. Eleanor (pictured left and right before weight loss) was at her heaviest weight, 12st 7lb, when she decided it was time to adopt a healthier lifestyle . Now, the 30-year-old marketing officer (in a £6 Nike top found in a charity shop in Essex) feels fitter and healthier than ever before . 'But would I be able to find 31 days' worth of items? And more importantly, would I look a wally?' Her family and friends were doubtful, as was she at first. She says: 'People kept saying I wouldn't be able to do it, while others pointed out I wouldn't know who’d warn them, or that they might smell. And I must admit I was a bit dubious.' But she needn't have worried. She says: 'On the first day I found a brand new, chic Topshop pencil skirt with the price tag still on it - but instead of £30 it was only £6. She picked up a tailored white dress for just £6 (left) and a Levi denim jacket for £15 (right) She asked took selfies and posted them on Instagram and Twitter, with the hashtag #SecondHandstyle . 'The next day I found a gorgeous pair of Kurt Geiger leather tan and gold studded sandals for £15. A friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £100.' Subsequent finds included a Levi denim jacket, also £15, a new River Island dress for £7 and a Planet snakeskin shirt for £3.50. 'During other visits my luck continued with all sorts of great pieces, including a Monsoon fusion patterned skirt for £4.50, a Patra blue silky vest top in medium for £4, a Dorothy Perkins beige dress for £5 and a stripy purple and white Gap top for £4.50. 'I also found some fantastic accessories, including a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses for only a tenner and one of my best finds - a real vintage black leather Longchamp bag for £15. 'It had suffered slight wear and tear but I took it home, put some boot polish on it, gave it a buff and it came up looking brand new.' Amazingly, after just six visits Eleanor had more than enough and couldn't wait to show off what she'd found. So on the first day of the next month she kicked off her challenge by wearing a pale blue and white nautical dress that she'd picked up for £6. She asked a colleague to take a picture of her in it and posted it on Instagram and Twitter, with the hashtag #SecondHandStyle and that morning she was inundated with likes, comments and retweets. Eleanor, who works at St Clare Hospice in Essex, visited several charity shops in the area to find her 31 pieces of clothing and accessories . Eleanor received a 'like' all the way from America for a Mad Men-inspired £4 St Michael pleated skirt (pictured) As the month unfolded, her charity finds suited every occasion, a £6 Nike top she'd picked up for the gym, a pair of £4 floral lounge pants from Primark for a girly pizza night, the H&M skirt and denim jacket she'd found the first week which she wore out shopping with her sister. She says: 'As I mixed and matched the pieces people couldn't believe what I'd managed to find. I had to convince some that it really was all secondhand and I wasn’t pretending.' By now she'd picked up 600 followers on social media and as the month went by she received endless compliments. She says: 'People were saying how much I’d inspired them and some asked if I’d go shopping with them. One of her found treasures was a pair of £4 floral lounge pants from Primark (left), which she for a girly pizza night, and a £4 denim skater skirt £4 (right) Eleanor (in her £15 Levi denim jacket) says the charity shop challenge has made her appreciate secondhand style, because 'you are very likely to find a one-off item that no-one else will have' 'I was also thrilled to get a ""like"" all the way from America when I wore a Mad Men-style St Michael’s beige and black check pleated skirt which I had bought for £4, because it reminded me of my maternal nan who used to work at Marks and Spencer. 'Probably at least 20 years old, I paired it with a simple black vest and smart black heels, bringing it bang up to date.' By the end of the month Eleanor couldn't believe how much success she'd had. She says: 'I had a wardrobe bursting with new clothes and the best part was it only cost me £200. 'I'd also managed to raise some money for the hospice as well as inspiring others to do the same. 'Now I still wear secondhand clothes every day. I've discovered the beauty of charity shops is you are very likely to find a one-off item that no-one else will have.'","Eleanor Scotchbrook, 33, lost weight and was too thin for her wardrobe .

"Zohra Amrani, 59, and her husband Hassan are believed to have been killed by their son at their home in Westbourne Grove . This is the mother who was allegedly murdered alongside her husband by her convicted rapist son, just days after he was released from jail. Zohra Amrani, 59, and her husband Hassan, 72, were found dead at their home in Westbourne Grove, west London, 24 hours after their son plunged to his death. Ashraf Amrani, 30, fell to his death on Friday in a suspected suicide. He was found by residents on the first floor of a block of flats, on the same street where police later discovered his parents’ bodies. The second discovery was made when officers went to inform the couple of their son’s death. Detectives have launched an investigation following the suspected murder-suicide but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. The case has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The young man had been released from jail after raping a 23-year-old woman and was also arrested on suspicion of affray days earlier. Amrani was sentenced to seven years and two months in June 2010 after filming the vicious sex attack then threatening to send the footage to his victim’s family. The offender, who had a sexually transmitted disease, carried out the attack at his family’s flat in Notting Hill, where his parents were found dead on Saturday. Last night, neighbours said officers had been called to the property a day before the murders and Amrani had refused to let them in. He was arrested on suspicion of affray last Tuesday and was due to answer his bail on Wednesday. It also emerged that Amrani had committed a series of attacks on women. Police confirmed their handling of the case is being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In November 2009 he raped the 23-year-old after ordering her to carry out ‘humiliating’ domestic tasks. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court were shown film of the naked victim crying as Amrani barked orders and threatened to slash her. Judge Gregory Stone described the crime as ‘a sustained attack of violence, humiliation and coerced sexual acts.’ Neighbours said Amrani had recently been released from jail after serving half of his sentence and his retired Moroccan parents - described as a 'very sweet couple' - had been upset when he turned up at their flat. A woman who lives next door said Mrs Amrani had told her on Thursday that ‘there was some trouble in the house’, adding that police had been called to the address on Thursday, but a man, believed to be the couple's son, had tried to block them from going inside. A 30-year-old recently out of jail and on bail for assault is believed to have killed his elderly parents, pictured is a forensic tent outside Landor House, west London, where a man and woman were found dead . The body of Ashraf Amrani, 30, was found on Friday lunchtime on the first floor roof of a house in Westbourne Park, pictured are forensic officers outside his parents' house . She said: 'The last time I saw the wife was on Thursday and she didn't look happy. She looked a bit fed up and sad. 'She said her husband had called her and said there was some trouble in the house. 'On that same night when I went home, my brother told me that police had been round and they were looking for the son and opened the door. 'He got the impression he was in there and not letting them in. I hadn't seen the son for a few years, and then I saw him again about a month and a half ago.' The woman added that she had heard nothing suspicious from the couple's home on Friday. She said: 'There was no noise, nothing to indicate what might happen.' She paid tribute to the 'lovely couple' who also have a grown-up daughter and a grandson. 'They were just a really nice couple. I'm just so shocked. They were always so nice,' she said. 'She would always go and see her daughter and grandson.' The neighbour said the couple, originally from Morocco, were very house-proud and doting grandparents to their grandson, who is around seven or eight years old. She said: 'The husband was a very quiet man. They had an extremely beautiful house. She kept everything immaculate. They would often go back to Morocco and see their family. It is awful.' No arrests have been made and Scotland Yard detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . Three bouquets of flowers were left as a tribute to the grandparents who were described as a 'lovely couple' But the son was described as 'trouble for his family' by neighbours. Neighbour Farhad Chowdhury, 28, said: 'The mother was very nice to us. She would always say hello and have a chat. 'It’s very sad because she treated me like a son. And she even went to my sister’s wedding. 'She was a lovely woman and every now and then she would come over and cook with my mum and share recipes. 'She was very nice to our whole family. When I first heard what happened I was shocked. 'The father we didn’t see so much because he would be coming and going from Morocco. 'I came home from work and saw all the police and they had taped off all the homes. It gave me a heart attack because I didn’t know what was happening. 'I would see the son every now and then and we would say hello to each other. He disappeared for a while and I didn’t see him for a few years. I think he had been trouble for the family. Three people believed to be from the same family have died in a suspected murder-suicide. A man and a woman were found dead in Landor House, west London . 'He came back about six months ago and when I saw him again he had changed, he just looked different almost depressed.' Other neighbours on the estate shared their disbelief about what had happened. Sotira Savva, 75, said: 'It's just devastating, and to have it happen in this estate. I have lived here for 40 years and it has changed but it’s always been quiet. This is just horrible for the whole estate.” Floral tributes have been left by friends of the couple outside the home. One woman, who wished not to be named, who was friends with Zohra Amrani through the local Muslim community said: 'I just wanted to come down and say some prayers for them. 'When I found out yesterday what happened I couldn’t believe it. I was so upset I couldn’t stop crying. 'She was a lovely woman, so so nice to everyone. It’s so sad.' A friend of Ashraf Amrani, who asked not to be named, said: 'I don't know much about it, but I know he was in prison before. 'I think he must have got out recently. I'm not going to talk about why he was locked up.' Last night, a police forensics tent had been erected in the back garden of the ground floor flat in Landor House, a two storey block near Royal Park. Police cordoned off the nearby estate area and forensics teams scoured the crime scene. Flowers were laid outside the flat where the couple were found. Scotland Yard detectives are treating the incident as a suspected murder suicide and they are not seeking anyone in connection with the three deaths. The case is due to be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission on Monday, according to a Met spokesman.","Zohra Amrani, 59, and her husband Hassan, 72, found dead at their home .

"David Cameron persuaded the Queen to star in the opening ceremony of the Olympics during one of his weekly audiences at Buckingham Palace, it has been revealed. The Prime Minister raised the prospect of the monarch making a cameo appearance on behalf of the Olympic Games chief Sebastian Coe. She immediately said yes and vowed to 'play' herself walking with James Bond star Daniel Craig, Lord Coe revealed to former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell. David Cameron persuaded the Queen to star in the opening ceremony of the Olympics - where she played herself alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig . The Tory Peer told Mr Campbell, who has written a book on leadership in which he praises the Queen, that he assumed the best he could hope for would be for the monarch to agree to a lookalike playing her. When the organisers first mooted the idea of a scene with the Queen and the James Bond actor Daniel Craig, they assumed the best they could hope for was her permission to use a lookalike. But according to Lord Coe, the chairman of the organising committee for the Games, when it was put to her by the Prime Minister she said she would have a lookalike in the scene where she jumps from a helicopter – but would play herself in the Palace. Lord Coe said: 'We were aiming very, very high. We were stunned when she agreed.' Mr Campbell said the decision was part of the Queen's leadership qualities which have made her popular with the public. 'She signed off every element,' one of her team told Mr Campbell, he writes in the Sunday Times today. 'It was a great moment for us, because she was in her mid-eighties by then, her standing was totally secure, and what that did was show a truly global audience not just that she had a sense of humour, but that the British public had huge affection for her and recognised her unique place in their lives.'

'It's a kind of ruthless common sense. She is very uncomfortable if you try to suggest she does something that is not authentically her, but she does understand that even institutions like the monarchy must change and adapt.' Mr Campbell said even as a life-long republican he has 'developed a huge admiration for the Queen, not least for her skills as a leader'. He said: 'In challenging times she has secured the monarchy for at least another generation and, given the way Prince Charles and the younger princes have developed as part of a concerted strategy by 'the Firm', probably much longer than that.' Mr Campbell also revealed that the Queen came close to breaking her rule not to give interviews by 'doing something with Clare Balding for a horse show'. 'In the end decided the 'no interview' rule had served her well and it became a lifelong vow,' Mr Campbell writes.","The PM raised the prospect of the monarch making a cameo appearance .

"Police officers in Moscow could be fired after a leaked video appeared to show them mocking a schizophrenic woman who had stripped naked and danced on a desk. The clip prompted outrage in Russia after the woman, identified as Irina K, was arrested for allegedly shouting abuse at passers-by in the Russian capital's western district of Shchukino. When she arrived at a police station, instead of restraining her, calming her down or fetching her clothes officers appeared to mock the woman while filming her on a phone. Abuse: These images of a mentally ill woman dancing naked in a police station in Russia - where officers laughed and filmed her instead of coming to her aid - prompted outrage and have triggered an investigation . Russian media reports suggested the police officers involved were due to face disciplinary action. According to the Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, the incident took place on January 11 after the woman, who suffers from schizophrenia, was discharged from hospital. The newspaper said the woman was not properly monitored and drank to excess in her apartment before walking into the street outside. There she allegedly jumped on passing cars and frightened passers-by with loud shrieks before she was arrested. When she was taken to a police station, she was allowed to strip naked and jump on a table while an unnamed person - allegedly a police officer - filmed her on a mobile phone and laughed. The video, believed to have been filmed in the police station's reception area, showed the woman singing incoherently and rubbing her body against a wall. Horror: The incident happened in the west of Moscow. Pictured: Red Square in the centre of the capital . She then picked up her trousers, threw them down again and grabbed the bars of a cell, pulling at them violently. The woman was eventually helped and taken for treatment at a psychiatric hospital, but the footage of her apparent mistreatment by police provoked horror when it was leaked online. A police spokesman told Central European News: 'The behavior of the officers was completely unacceptable. 'The woman had been taken to the police station where a doctor and ambulance had been called to take her to a local psychiatric hospital. 'That the officers allowed her to strip off and then filmed her whilst laughing and mocking her is disgraceful. 'An investigation is now under way and the officer who shot the video as well as the senior officer on duty may well be fired. 'The other policemen seen in the video will be disciplined.'","Footage showing clearly disturbed woman prompted outrage in Russia .

"Claim: McKenna says his £4.99 Hypnotic Gastric Band app is a ‘surgery-free weight-loss solution’ A war of words has erupted between leading obesity surgeons and celebrity hypnotist Paul McKenna over whether hypnotherapy weight-loss apps actually work. The smartphone market is flooded with downloads that promise to help users shed pounds. Some, like McKenna’s, even claim to use hypnotherapy to mimic the results of drastic and costly weight-loss surgery. However, top surgeons have warned that, in their opinion, giving customers the impression they will see the same results as gastric-band surgery is wrong. The surgical procedure, which costs about £6,000, involves doctors implanting an inflatable band around the top of the stomach to create a small pouch, so patients feel fuller quicker. McKenna says his £4.99 Hypnotic Gastric Band app is a ‘surgery-free weight-loss solution’ that ‘can help convince the unconscious mind that a gastric band has been fitted, so the body behaves as though a band is physically present’. But Dr Carel le Roux, a lead physician at London’s Imperial College Healthcare’s obesity service, dismisses these claims as ‘a gimmick’. He says: ‘Hypnosis isn’t powerful enough to be effective in the long term.’ Consultant surgeon Paul Super, from the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, agrees. He says: ‘It might be called a hypnotic gastric band, but is no more a physical operation than a hypnotic pacemaker or hypnotic hip replacement. If it worked, then why aren’t thousands of patients having it on the NHS?’ Currently, patients must have a Body Mass Index of 40 or above, or 35 or above with a serious health condition, to meet the criteria to have weight-loss surgery on the NHS. Top surgeons have warned that, in their opinion, giving customers the impression they will see the same results as gastric-band surgery is wrong. Above McKenna's£4.99 Hypnotic Gastric Band app . Results are proven in numerous clinical trials: patients should expect to lose a third of their excess body weight within six months, and half within two years. Why do my eyes water when I chop onions? Professor Barry Smith, director of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: ‘Spicy flavours like mustard and onions can irritate the trigeminal nerve in the brain, which is linked to the eyes, nose and mouth. When you chop onions, you release molecules into the air that get into the nose and cause a sting that irritates the trigeminal nerve. The nerve thinks your eyes are being attacked, so it sends a signal that makes them water to flush away the irritant.’ NHS treatments for obesity are based around a healthy diet and exercise, and in some cases medication such as Orlistat, which prevents about a third of fat from food being digested by the body. Bariatric surgery is offered to people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments have failed. Some 6,500 weight-loss procedures were performed in 2013. These included fitting a gastric band, and gastric bypass – where the digestive system is rerouted to bypass most of the stomach and small intestine, meaning that patients can only eat small amounts of food. However, in response McKenna says that hypnotherapy is, as a matter of scientific fact, a proven means of weight loss. His spokesman explains that the gastric-band hypnotherapy app is ‘merely an innovative variation on a scientifically tried and tested means of weight loss’. This includes a 1985 trial which showed 109 hypnosis patients lost significant amounts of weight, and continued to do so over a two-year period, when used alongside other ‘behavioural’ treatments, compared with patients who only had behavioural treatment. NHS advice is that hypnotherapy can help with problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and the pain of childbirth, but there is not enough evidence to recommend it for weight loss. McKenna says that hypnotherapy is, as a matter of scientific fact, a proven means of weight loss . Hypnotherapist Greg Forde, who has helped patients tackle their own weight issues, believes that linking a hypnotherapy product to a physical operation is ‘a complete waste of money’. He says: ‘People are vulnerable – people are spending money on something they think will be a magic bullet. Everyone’s trigger is different so they need one-to-one support and you can’t get that through an app or CD.’ Help could soon be at hand for those who suffer cold sores. Studies have shown that an amino acid called lysine prevents flare-ups by inhibiting the herpes simplex virus that causes the sores, and blocking its attempts to replicate in the body. The richest natural sources of lysine are meat, dairy products, eggs and beans. A daily 1,000mg supplement should be taken as a preventative measure, but if the telltale signs are already there, taking 3,000mg a day should speed up the healing process. Gianluca Bonanomi, clinical lead for general and bariatric surgery at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, also warns that calling the app a ‘hypnotic gastric band’ could deter some dangerously obese patients from opting for surgery. He says: ‘Gastric-band surgery is a big commitment. It is expensive if done privately and carries some risk, even though it is a very small one. Patients might see it as scary surgery, and then they come across a “hypnotic gastric band” that seems to be as effective and costs a lot less. ‘A physical band creates a barrier to food intake and reduces the appetite by having an effect on satiety on the brain. Mental-health approaches like hypnotherapy and psychotherapy can be beneficial, but it’s potentially misleading to associate them with a surgical procedure.’ Yet GP Michael Carmi, an expert backing McKenna, says the app is a safer and cheaper option that should be offered to patients contemplating gastric- band surgery. He maintains that the term ‘hypnotic gastric band is merely a metaphor for significant weight loss’. Mr Carmi adds: ‘If a hypnotic approach was offered to patients contemplating surgery, then this would reduce mortality and morbidity and be a considerable financial saving for the NHS.’ Procedure: A surgeon shows how how the centre membrain of a gastric band inflates. This inflation places pressure around the outside of the stomach to restrict the movement of food .","Paul McKenna is calling his new app a ‘surgery-free weight-loss solution'

"Women are 'hardest hit by dementia': Actress Prunella Scales (pictured) was last year revealed to have been diagnosed with 'mild Alzheimer’s' Women are hardest hit by dementia, say experts. They can spend years caring for loved ones with the illness only to fall victim to it themselves. A report by the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK warns that dementia is leaving women ‘marginalised’ both as carers and later as patients. It states that women are two and a half times more likely to look after someone with dementia, most often their husbands. And they are also more at risk of developing the condition themselves, with around 500,000 women having it compared to 350,000 men. Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at the research charity, said women suffer a ‘triple whammy’ – as carers, living with the effects of dementia and then dying from it. She added: ‘Women are carrying the responsibility of care for their loved ones, only later to be living with the condition. ‘Women are dying from dementia but not before it has taken a considerable toll on minds and bodies. In the UK, dementia hits women the hardest.’ ‘Dementia is a life-shattering condition and represents a triple whammy for women. More women are dying of dementia, more women are having to bear the burden of care. ‘The experiences of these women underlines the urgent need to tackle the diseases that cause this life-shattering condition. 'In recent decades we’ve seen increased investment in areas like cancer have a real impact, and we need to emulate that success for dementia. ‘Only through research can we find ways to treat and prevent dementia, and transform the lives of the hundreds of thousands affected.’ An estimated 830,000 people in Britain have dementia, a syndrome characterised by a gradual loss of brain functions such as memory and mental agility. The numbers with dementia are predicted to rise to 2 million by 2051. The illness is becoming increasingly common as more of us live to an age when it is more prevalent. It is partly thanks to medical advances in the treatment for heart disease and cancer, which had previously claimed more lives earlier on. Women’s life expectancies also are longer than men, meaning they are more likely to get the illness. Dementia is now the leading cause of death in women having overtaken heart disease and stroke. But in men it is third, after heart disease and lung cancer. The report, which will be published next month, warns that women over 60 are twice as likely to get dementia as breast cancer. It will call for far more funding to be put into research to develop effective treatments. Plan: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured in Derby last Thursday) pledged to make dementia a 'national priority' in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research . Despite the increasing prevalence of the illness and its toll on society, there is no cure and there are only a limited number of drugs – which can only temporarily halt its progression. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to make dementia a ‘national priority’ in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research. But charities say it is still too little when compared to the investment into new treatment for cancer. In 2013, £503million from charities and the Government went to research for cancer compared to £73.8million for dementia. The report will conclude that the toll of dementia on society in Britain will get worse unless it is properly addressed by the Government. ‘The UK already has a larger proportion of people over 65 than the EU average, and as the number of older people rises steeply, the need for carers will continue to increase,’ it will conclude.","Alzheimer's charity warns dementia is leaving women 'marginalised'

"A woman was stung on the hand by a scorpion just as she was getting ready to fly out of Los Angeles. The eight-legged creature landed on another passenger's shoulder before it was flicked on to the woman right before the Alaska Airlines flight took off towards Portland, Oregon. Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove says Flight 567 was taxing on the runway Saturday night when the passenger was stung. An Alaska Airlines flight was getting ready to take off from Los Angeles International Airport when a woman was stung by a scorpion that landed on her . He says the plane returned to the gate and the woman was checked by medics. She refused additional medical treatment but didn't get back on the plane. Meanwhile, flight attendants killed the scorpion and checked overhead compartments for any additional arachnids. The flight then took off at 8:40 pm, about an hour late. It's unclear how the scorpion got on the plane, but the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico. Members of Oregon State University's men's basketball team were on the flight, Mr Cosgrove said. 'The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck. They had to take her away in an ambulance,' Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle said. Oregonian reporter Tyson Alger posted on his Twitter account that the arachnid first landed on a man's shoulder but he flicked it off and it landed on the unidentified woman . The stung woman was two rows in front of Mr Tinkle, according to ESPN. The plane was also carrying the University of Portland's women's basketball team and Oregonian reporter Tyson Alger. He posted on his Twitter account that the scorpion first landed on a man's shoulder before it was flicked towards the woman and stung her. 'Chivalry is dead,' Mr Alger added. Only about 30 types of the 1,500 scorpion species can inflict deadly stings, according to Mayo Clinic. While for healthy adults the stings are painful but not lethal, such incidents can be dangerous for children. It is not known which type of scorpion stung the woman flying to Portland.","Unidentified woman stung  on Alaska Airlines flight while it was taxing .

"Residents in a north London council block have spoken of their terror as a lone gunman spent three hours firing a pistol from his ground-floor flat. The incident took place on Saturday afternoon and ended with the gunman being shot by police marksmen. The 48-year-old man has been described as 'deranged' by one of his neighbours in the council block in Hendon, London, which is due to be demolished next month. Shot: The 48-year-old gunman was one of only a handful of residents still living in the 13 storey council block in Hendon, north London, which is due to be demolished next month . Police were called to the scene after neighbours reported hearing loud bangs and seeing a gun being fired from the man's flat between 5pm and 8pm on Saturday night. More than a dozen marked police cars and vans raced to the block of flats and sealed off nearby streets. The council block remained cordoned off on Sunday as police forensics officers marked spots on the pavement where the 48-year-old's bullets hit the concrete. Kate Anderson, 55, said: 'I'm scared to death. I heard the shooting last night and thought it was fireworks. 'I looked outside, but I couldn't hear anything. I've only heard gunshots on the television, but after a while I realised it must be a handgun and I thought someone was shooting at birds. The gunman remains in hospital where he is in a 'serious but not life-threatening' condition, a police spokesperson said today (file photo) 'I could hear helicopters and sirens everywhere and I went back inside as I was frightened. 'I must have heard the shootout with police but its hard to distinguish one gunshot from another. 'Whoever he was, he was clearly deranged. It's awful.' Another local resident Joe Killeen, 71, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said: 'When I came back from watching the rugby around 10pm the police were all here, ambulance, forensics, everything. 'Everybody's frightened now around here. The problem is they're tearing all these flats down and so the council don't mind if their tenants are riff raff. Annie Wilcox, who also lives nearby, said: 'We could all hear the gun shots - these loud pops from about 5pm. They went on for three hours. 'We couldn't see anything, but I think this guy was firing out towards the building site. 'Because he was round the back it took ages to work out where the sound was coming from. 'At first we thought it could have been pieces of wood falling from a nearby building site.' The gunman remains in hospital where he is in a 'serious but not life-threatening' condition, a police spokesperson said.","Man, 48, fired several rounds from his flat in Hendon, north London .

"Builder Lee Slocombe (pictured), 32, who defrauded his victims out of £43,000 has been jailed for more than three years . A 'cowboy builder' who conned his victims out of £43,000 when he left their homes 'ripped to pieces' has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. A court heard how Lee Slocombe, 32, from Pontypridd, south Wales, started work on properties but then demolished the houses and asked for more money to complete the jobs. But he never paid the cash back leaving families out of pocket and with homes that required extensive renovation. Among his victims were PC James Gardner, 32, and Sheri Hall, 24, who hired the builder to undertake some minor work at their new home in Aberbeeg, Blaenau Gwent. Miss Hall, a PR account executive at Golley Slater Wales, told MailOnline: 'The builder was recommended to us and so we had him round for a quote for re-decoration. He also said he could put in an extended kitchen out the back of the house as well. 'He said he could do the job using leftover spare materials. 'Because it was quite a lot of major work to the main area of the house, James (who was already living in the house) moved out to live with his mum in Cardiff. 'We popped round to see how it was getting on. But because we were not living there at the time, it was hard to see what was going on. 'He was slowly demolishing the house but it looked like lots of work had been done. We didn't really know what was happening.' Among his victims were Sheri Hall, 24, and PC James Gardner, 32 - the builder demolished their new home . The couple were left devastated when Slocombe left their home in Aberbeeg, Blaenau Gwent, ruined . When the couple returned to their cottage they found their floorboards lying in the back garden . Miss Hall, 24, and PC Gardner, 32, had been dating for a year when they moved in to the house together . In fact, Slocombe had gone round their house damaging the ceilings, interior walls and floors. He had left the couple without a staircase or radiators and when they returned to the house they found their floorboards lying in the back garden and had to negotiate a four-foot drop into rubble to get into the front door. Miss Hall added: 'He then started saying there were bigger problems with the house, saying there was chronic damp and claimed he needed double the money to fix it. 'He said if he didn't have the money he wouldn't get the job done. We didn't want to aggravate him too much as he had our money.' The couple had paid the 'cowboy builder' around £14,000 before he disappeared. 'We couldn't get hold of him,' said Miss Hall. 'James sent text messages begging, saying ""please, please, please where are you?"" 'There was nothing he could do – he had no money left – the family had no money left because they had lent it to him.' When Slocombe did eventually text back his excuse staggered the couple. 'He replied to say he didn't have the money but would pay us back because he was expecting a lot of money from compensation because his testicle was cut off.' Slocombe had gone round their house demolishing the ceilings, interior walls and floors . A court heard how Slocombe would ask for more and more cash in order to complete the job, claiming in some instances the work was more complex than he had originally thought . Following a call to Cowboy Builders, the Channel 5 show, the couple finally had their cottage renovated . Two rogue builders who ripped off pensioners for £100,000 for bodged and unnecessary work have been jailed. Serial offender Nelson Richards, 51, was jailed for five years and his brother in law Johnny Jones for three-and-a-half years at Truro Crown Court. The average age of their victims was 75 and the oldest was an 89-year-old woman who lived alone. In one case, an 83-year-old woman forked out £18,000 on work that did not need doing. The two men drove her to Falmouth to take the cash out of her bank. Richards was jailed in 2006 for defrauding people out of £600,000 but within weeks of being released from jail, he was conning new victims. Judge Simon Carr said the pair, from Tregajorran near Redruth, west Cornwall, 'deliberately targeted vulnerable people' At that point, Miss Hall convinced her boyfriend the builder was not going to fix their house and so contacted Cowboy Builders, the television programme aimed at exposing rogues. They helped restore their cottage and also expose Slocombe, which led to the police getting involved. In Newport Crown Court this week prosecutor Claire Pickthall described Slocombe as having told 'barefaced lies' to his victims. He would ask for more and more cash in order to complete the job, claiming in some instances the work was more complex than he had originally thought. Ms Pickthall said: 'The defendant kept saying to one victim that they had invested so much that if they didn't continue they would lose everything.' She said Slocombe even asked for money towards his grandmother's funeral. He was handed a 43-month sentence, having pleading guilty to defrauding one family of £26,000, another of £13,450 and a third of £4,000. In a statement read to the court, Marie Lancaster, the wife of another victim, said: 'Our once-happy carefree life has gone. We are left with a mountain of debt. We will be struggling with for a very long time.' Elsewhere, PC Gardner is still paying back his relatives, left out of pocket by Slocombe. They think his prison sentence was 'a really, really good result'. Miss Hall said: 'He doesn't even show any remorse at all. 'I don't think he could actually comprehend what he did to us. People like that almost think because it's not a violent crime it's not an assault, they seem to think of it as lesser crime. 'He's the type of person who wouldn't realise what damage it does.'","Builder Lee Slocombe, 32, of South Wales, jailed for three-and-a-half years .

"Former Government Chief Whip Philip Ruddock has hit back at Tony Abbott's decision to sack him, saying he would have expected the Prime Minister to raise concerns about his job performance. Mr Ruddock, dubbed the Father of the House because he is the longest serving MP in Parliament, was stood down on Friday, days after a failed leadership challenge to Mr Abbott. Mr Ruddock, who had held the position since September 2013, was guarded with his comments on the reasons for his sacking but denied he was  a 'scapegoat' for the government's woes. 'The position I held is one that the leader chooses, and I have no complaint about that,' Mr Ruddock told Sky News on Sunday. 'My expectation is if the Prime Minister has concerns about how I undertook the task, he would put them to me.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) sacked chief government whip and veteran Liberal MP Philip Ruddock (left) But Mr Abbott has defended his decision to sack Mr Ruddock, saying he should have been more aware of the concerns of backbenchers and seen off any possible leadership issue before it reached the spill motion, which was held last Monday. 'I wasn't as aware as I should have been on all of this, I never want to find myself in this position ever again,' Mr Abbott told Network Ten on Sunday. 'I'm confident that with the whip's team that we've got, I will be very much aware of what's going on inside the party.' Mr Ruddock has been replaced by Queensland MP Scott Buchholz, who was very vocal in his support of Mr Abbott in the days before the spill motion.

Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, as he first elected to for the seat of Parramatta at by-election in 1973 . The Prime Minister caused outrage among his MPs, with whom he had promised to be more consultative, when he dumped Mr Ruddock on Friday without prior warning, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. However, Mr Ruddock denied the claims that his demotion was affected after he failed to rally ahead of the spill motion. 'To be a barracker rather than refusing to comment was in my view not the appropriate way forward,' Mr Ruddock said. 'The Prime Minister had my support, and I did what I believe was the appropriate role. I did what I believe was the appropriate role and I don't intend to comment further. 'The decision I held is the Prime Minister's choice and if he had any concerns, I would expect him to raise them with me.' Tony Abbott poses for a selfie at a community event in Castlereagh in western Sydney on Sunday . Mr Abbott shakes hands at a community event in Castlereagh in western Sydney on Sunday . Some even went as far as describing Mr Abbott's decision as 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions' amid claims the move was Mr Ruddock's punishment for not seeing off the leadership challenge, the ABC said. Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives and he was first elected to the Sydney seat of Parramatta at a by-election in 1973. He went on to hold many titles, including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs from 1996 to 2003 during John Howard's time in office. He was also Attorney General between 2003 and 2007. He was appointed Chief Whipe in September 2013, soon after Mr Abbott was elected PM. Queensland backbencher Andrew Laming publicly expressed his disapproval for Mr Abbott's decision, saying it was 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions'. 'We really needed a week of healing, not wounding, and I think it really has set us back a fair bit particularly because Philip Ruddock was such a respected character,' Mr Laming told the ABC. One backbencher, who has not been named, described Mr Abbott's decision on Friday afternoon as 'another disastrous call', the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'The PM had my vote on Monday even though he refused to get rid of Peta Credlin [the chief of staff],' another MP told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'He has now lost my vote because he had no right to get rid of Philip Ruddock.' Others told The Australian that Mr Abbott felt Mr Ruddock had not been supportive enough of the Prime Minister. Mr Abbott however denied such claims, saying his decision was based on having 'a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the whips team'. Mr Abbott's move to dump his chief whip on Friday not only angered his backbench but also risks the questioning of his leadership once again . In a statement released on Friday, Mr Abbott did not offer any reasoning behind his decision and instead thanked Mr Ruddock for his contribution. 'As Father of the House, Philip has given over four decades of service to the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. He was a senior minister throughout the life of the Howard government and was shadow cabinet secretary in opposition. Later this year, he will become the second longest serving parliamentarian in our history. No one has done more than Philip helping immigrants to feel at home in their new country and helping members of migrant communities to participate in our national life,' the prime minister said. 'I look forward to his future contribution to the government and to our country. He remains an important counsellor for Coalition members of parliament and will continue to serve as Member for Berowra with distinction. 'These changes will be in place for the next parliamentary sitting period.' The announcement the spill was to be held last Monday was made the day before, just after Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Mr Abbott for holding the ballot on Tuesday to give his colleagues time to discuss the matter on Monday before casting their vote. The Prime Minister held onto his leadership after 61 MPs voted against a spill motion and 39 for it.","Liberal MP Philip Ruddock has hit back at the Prime Minister's decision .

Storm chaser Hollingshead, from Nebraska, goes in search of tornadoes, supercells, lightning bolts and other natural phenomena throughout the United States' mid-west where extreme weather wreaks havoc. The 38-year-old  drives about 20,000 miles every year trying to find and shoot weather patterns that can rip up crops and blow houses away. These images, from lightning strikes in South Dakota's Badlands to the supercell that produced a record volleyball-sized hail stone, are the incredible fruits of his labour. Scroll down for video . Mike Hollingshead risks his life chasing storms through the mid-west of the United States to capture images such as these two lightning bolts . A massive bolt of lightning strikes in the distance over the colourful Badlands National Park in southwestern South Dakota . A supercell, the name given to a thunderstorm with a rotating updraft, approaches this church in Nebraska . A UPS driver races out of the way of a periolously close supercell in McCook, Nebraska . Hollingshead says this supercell produced world record eight-inch hail stone on July 23, 2010, in Vivian, South Dakota . The rush he gets is, understandably, immense. 'Seeing a supercell take on other worldly structures has its own way of amazing you,' Mike says. 'You can't believe you are seeing moisture take on such shapes and power.' Hollingshead speaks matter-of-factly about the risks associated with his job as he recalling a moment when storms collided and lightning bombarded the town of Valentine in Nebraska's north near the South Dakota state line. 'At first it wasn't that great to look at, but the lightning frequency was almost scary - It was probably averaging a bolt to the ground every second,' he says of a supercell formed near the Black Hills of South Dakota. 'As it was crossing the interstate it began to look a bit more angry. Then a huge nasty hail core bomb formed. It really looked like an upside down bomb went off over the interstate. It was just a white wall of hail and looked especially nasty on the radar too. A supercell merges with other storms to produce high winds and hail near Valentine, Nebraska . A menacing supercell circles over less green pastures in Nebraska, as captured by storm chasing photographer Hollingshead . Tennis ball-sized hail and flooding rains came from this terrifying cloud cover in Beloit, Kansas . The Storm Prediction Center says supercells are usually thunderstorms, but not always, that 'contain updrafts that rotate about a vertical axis'. This rotating updraft means they can 'overcome the self-limiting mechanisms that bring demise to regular storms'. Destructive winds, huge hailstones and  tornadoes can come from supercells. 'Most strong to violent tornadoes are associated with supercells,' says the SPC. 'As it entered the town of Valentine it got cut off by a new storm firing right next to it. As I drove through town the most intense barrage of lightning bolts was peppering the town. It was especially frightening to the northeast side of town.' In a bid to get the perfect shot, Mike tests the limits of Mother Nature to the point he is sometimes at her mercy. As was the case here. 'It wasn't scary until right after I took the picture of the two lightning bolts,' he recalls. 'I was trying to get those lightning shots knowing I was running out of time to bail south before that gust flung east over the highway. 'I thought I had enough time to snap some and then zoom south really fast. But no, that thing came racing over the highway much faster than it had been doing all along. 'Suddenly I was in very strong outflow winds buried in rain and hardly able to stay on the road as the winds push me east. But the possible tornado could have been in there, so I didn't have much choice in slowing down.' A black 'summer supercell' contrasts with the bright green field below in this 2014 shot taken in Missouri . Mammatus clouds, formations that are seen beneath other clouds, and a curved lightning bolt decorate the pink and purple Nebraska sky . A tornado that Hollingshead says came 'from a tornadic supercell' approaches in York, Nebraska, back in 2011 . That's not snow but enormous hail stones on the ground and plummeting down in the Black Hills of South Dakota .","Mike Hollingshead, 38, drives about 20,000 miles every year trying to find and shoot extreme weather .

"Royal piano tuner Gordon Bell has admitted he can't play the instrument . He is one of the country's top piano tuners and counts the Queen herself among his customers. So it may come as a surprise that Gordon Bell can't actually play the instrument. The 39-year-old, who has been tuning pianos since he was 16, is one of only three piano experts with a Royal Warrant, which he was awarded in 2008. 'I can't play the piano. It's an advantage to be able to play, but not essential,' Mr Bell admitted. The father of two, from Aberdeen, visits Balmoral regularly. He said he once went to get some tools from his van and saw the Queen and Prince Philip right next to it – while his pregnant wife sat oblivious inside. He also revealed the strangest place he's tuned a piano was in a jail's recreation room. 'Prisoners were mopping the floors around me. No one spoke.' Mr Bell was always interested in music as a youngster, but confesses he was not good enough to be a performer. His mother noticed the three-year Higher National Diploma course in strings, keyboard and instrument technology at Edinburgh's Stevenson College and he signed up. After graduating, he went on to launch his own prestige business in Aberdeen's Rosemount Viaduct in 2003 and landed the Royal Warrant five years later, aged 32. He said: 'The staff at Balmoral called Aberdeen's Music Hall to find out who tuned their pianos and they recommended me.' His first visit to the Royal residence was nerve-racking, but they invited him back and he was later awarded the 'by Royal Appointment' tag. 'Being a piano tuner has its moments,' he said. 'When my wife Lisa was pregnant she decided to come with me to Balmoral and joked with her friends that she was going to see the Queen, never thinking she actually would. Mr Bell, who has been tuning pianos since he was 16, is one of only three piano experts with a Royal Warrant . 'I was inside the castle and came out to get some tools from the van when I noticed Her Majesty and Prince Philip with the corgis standing right beside it. 'They were chatting to their house keeper and my wife was inside the van reading her magazine. She didn't even look up or notice they were there.' He says he is one of a dying breed, with few young people signing up for the last of the training courses in the trade. Meanwhile, he says demand for 'acoustic' pianos - those that are not digital - is buoyant. 'The fact that the piano industry survives in this day and age is remarkable,' admits Mr Bell. 'The piano is 300 years old, it has seen off X-Boxes and 3D TVs. If anything, the digital era has helped. People who learn on electric pianos often want to move up to the real thing.' He has hit the right note where business is concerned. He and his buddies in the trade - Elgin-based Moray Firth Pianos and Scotland's oldest piano specialists, Allan Makin and Sons in Edinburgh - have never been busier in the tuning and remodelling stakes. They are also kept on their toes with sales. 'I can't play the piano,' the father of two said. 'It's an advantage to be able to play, but not essential' The Makins have Susan Boyle for a client. And Glyn Morris at Moray Firth Pianos (which specialises in hire) has had a string of star customers including Jools Holland. Glyn provided pianos for the weddings of Take That singer Mark Owen and Madonna. He said: 'The most treasured moments I brought away from Madonna's wedding were meeting Sting and seeing Madonna teaching Gwyneth Paltrow the dance move from her then latest single, Don't tell me' - only four feet away from where I was installing and tuning the piano.' Mr Bell, who was educated at the Biggar Academy, says he fell foul of Julian Lloyd Webber during one of many tuning sessions for the stars of stage and screen. 'I was once working on the piano accompanying Julian Lloyd Webber. As I went to move my tool case, he swore at me and told me to watch his cello.' Mr Bell said he once went to get some tools from his van and saw the Queen and Prince Philip right next to it – while his pregnant wife sat oblivious inside .","Gordon Bell is one of only three piano experts with a Royal Warrant .

"A South African student who survived the horrific triple axe murder of his own family may have been high on drugs at the time of the attack, police believe. And a 'runner' who claims he delivered dope and crystal meth to Henri van Breda, 20, has been tracked down by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper. Henri was left with minor injuries following the horrific slaying of his parents and older brother last month at their upmarket security estate in the winelands outside Cape Town. Scroll down for video . Henri van Breda, 20, was left with minor injuries following the horrific slaying of his parents and older brother in Cape Town last month . His 16 year-old sister Marli was left fighting for her life, with severe head and neck sounds, and remains under police guard in hospital, too traumatised and injured to answer questions. The Sunday Times tracked down a youth who claimed to have been Henri's drug 'runner'. Calling himself 'Mark', he identified physics student Henri from a photograph and said he was a regular customer. The 'runner' lives in a shack at the edge of a small shanty town, less than a quarter of a mile from the luxury De Zalze golf estate where the van Bredas lived. He claimed Henri bought marijuana and crystal meth. Known by its local name of 'tik', the drug is cheap, easy to buy, highly addictive and known to fuel agression. Rife in the Cape Flats – a poor, gang-ridden area of Cape Town – 'tik' has become increasingly popular with young wealthy whites. 'He started coming here a couple of months ago, sometimes by himself, and sometimes with a friend. They drove a motorbike,' Mark told the newspaper. 'He would give me between R40 and R200 (2.50 and 12.50 pounds) at a time. Then I would go and get his drugs from the dealer. He bought tik, and from another dealer in Jamestown he bought dagga (marijuana).' The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town . Henri alerted emergency services four hours after the blood bath on the first floor of his family home, and at one point was heard to giggle during the seven minute call. Police doctors believe the blond student's cuts and bruises may have been self-inflicted, although he claims he was knocked unconscious when the killer threw the axe at him. Police are investigating several possible motives for the brutal attack at the luxury home on a heavily-guarded golf estate where access is strictly controlled by guards, cameras and electric fences. Detectives are investigating reports that Henri's parents had cut off his allowance in the days before the savage murder, which killed Martin, 54, his wife Teresa, 55, and their oldest child 22 year-old Rudi. Investigators may apply to have Henri's medical records released. It is understood he spent time at an exclusive drug rehabilitation centre last time. Police also took blood samples from him shortly after they were called to the murder scene. The student, whose family returned to South Africa last year after spending a number of years living in Australia, told an emergency operator how they had all been 'attacked by a guy with an axe'. Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch - about 50 kilometres, east of Cape Town . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . He claimed he was in the bathroom when the killer went on the rampage and was the last to be targeted when the murder weapon was thrown at him, knocking him out for some time. When he came to, he dialled for help. At one point during the call, he is heard to giggle. He is being cared for by relatives, who have vowed to stand by him. They have secured the services of Pieter Botha, a high-profile barrister, who helped secure the acquittal of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani in December. 'The family is supporting Henri. He is receiving counselling and is being monitored,' said Ben Rootman, a spokesman for the family who refused to comment on the newspaper's reports. Meanwhile, schoolgirl Marli is being guarded by police around the clock at a private clinic, where she is said to be able to blink in response to questions, but her severe injuries still prevent her from speaking. Although he has not formally been interviewed by police, Henri has reportedly described how his father Martin rushed to defend his Rudi, but was cut down as by the killer. Mother, Teresa, was the next to be murdered, while Marli somehow survived her appalling injuries. Henri was not seen at the memorial service held in Pretoria for his family in the days after the January attack but relatives insist he had been present, but was kept hidden from reporters. Shrien Dewani (right) used defence lawyer Pieter Botha (left) and had his murder charge thrown out. The lawyer is now representing Henri van Breda after being appointed by the 20-year-old's family .","Henri van Breda, 20, was left with minor injuries following horrific slaying .

"This is an excellent time to plant a hedge. Spring is close and if you get your plants into the ground by mid-March, they'll enjoy the maximum number of growing days in their first year. Hedges are valuable in so many ways. Functionally, they make better windbreaks than walls and can muffle sound. You can use them to improve privacy, create enclosures, act as backdrops or mask unsightly objects. Hedges also make lovely features. Deciduous, evergreen, flowering, fruiting — they run through subtle changes with each season. You can plant low-growing ones for bordering paths, prettying up little beds or just to create formal patterns. Lots of woody plants are suitable for hedging, but some adapt more readily than others. Growth speeds vary, too, but here's a golden rule: never choose plants purely for speed. Leyland cypress — the fastest — is a terrible choice because it can't produce new shoots from mature branches. So if you cut back an overgrown leyland hedge, you'll be left with permanently hideous naked limbs. IT HAD TO BE YEW . Yew, on the other hand, is perfect. Even if cut back to a stump, it will grow as a dense bush. Though not speedy, it grows faster than most people expect and thrives in a variety of conditions. What's more, you can trim yew to any size and it needs cutting only once a year. Holly keeps its shape with a single annual clip and most varieties of common holly are suitable. Those with plain green leaves tend to have more vigour than variegated varieties. Privet grows much faster, but needs several cuts each year. Elaeagnus x ebbingei makes a fine hedge, too, but Viburnum tinus is an excellent evergreen that flowers through winter. Among deciduous hedging, beech and hornbeam keep their old foliage all winter. Hornbeam copes well with heavy soils, but beech is better for chalky or sandy conditions. BEAT THE BLIGHT . For little hedges, box has been grown for centuries. It's easy to clip and can be kept tiny, but there's one big drawback — box blight. This serious disease damages mature hedging, so if you're planting new, choose something else. The small Japanese holly Ilex crenata is an excellent substitute. It's robust, has tiny rounded leaves and clips to any size, even teeny. Choose the variety Green Hedge. Before planting your hedge, dig a roomy trench that will accommodate roots. To boost fertility, work compost into the trench bottom and mix in a little bonemeal. With bare-rooted hedging plants, make sure the roots never dry out. Keep them heeled into the ground until your planting trench is ready. Apply a mycorrhizal booster, such as Rootgrow, to ensure rapid establishment. You can buy this from garden centres or online. Tall plants will need support while they develop their root systems. Use canes or light stakes and tie the main stems gently to these with jute string. Water newly planted hedges regularly during their first summer, particularly during dry spells. And never allow weeds or grass to grow at the base of the developing hedge. After planting, I like to trim away as much as a third of the growth. This seems brutal, but will help stimulate new growth. When the young hedge grows back after its first trim, it should do so quickly and with denser branches. When your hedge is growing well, remove supports. Trim as necessary, making it fractionally wider at the bottom than top. It will take years to develop the dense growth needed for a sound and durable hedge. At first, there'll be ugly holes, thin zones and an uneven top. But that's normal. And with regular clipping and a few years' loving care, it will be less like a row of shrubs and more like a proper grown-up hedge.","With spring on the way, now is the perfect time of year to plant a hedge .
They are great windbreaks, create enclosures and mask unsightly objects .

"You might expect polar bears, the Artic Circle's apex predators, to be dab hands at dancing on ice. But as this specimen in Svalbard shows, even after thousands of years of evolutionary adaptation, some still suffer from two-left feet on the frozen ocean. Heinrich Eggenfellner, a 49-year-old videographer from Norway, said: 'I have encountered polar bears many times every year since I live up here and am used to them. 'This episode, however, was extraordinary.' Born slippy: A polar walks across thin sea ice in Svalbard, Norway, where it was caught on camera looking very unsteady on its feet as it made its way across the slippery surface . Spreading its weight: The polar bear does its best not to collapse through the fragile ice by spreading out . In its element: The beast finally gave up and pushed a hole in the ice to dive into the freezing water . Mr Eggenfellner and his friend Svein Wik spent hours in Norway's northernmost territory hunting for a polar bear to film and photograph, then hours more waiting for the slumbering beast to wake up. It was time well spent. The patient duo were treated to a farcical display of slipping and sliding across the frozen sea, with their subject falling flat on its face at least once. 'Maybe we waited 3-4 hours before the bear woke up and came out onto thinner and thinner ice,' Mr Wik told Caters News Agency. 'At one point, it spread out on all four legs to prevent falling thorough the ice until finally the bear gave up, pushed through the ice and started to swim. 'He dived for a few seconds and showed up again, looking up and then started to shake of the water.' Proud: Polar bears are the Arctic Circle's apex predators and have adapted to the habitat over millennia . Evolution: Regarded as marine mammals because of the many months they spend at sea, polar bears have nevertheless adapted large, flat paws to distribute their bulk as they pad across thin ice . Brains: However this beast seems to have realised that big feet are not enough to stop it smashing through the thin ice and is trying to spread its weight to lessen the pressure beneath it . Weighty: Polar bears can weigh up to 1,100lbs, more than enough to smash through thin layers of frozen sea . Taking a dip: The polar bear pictured just after deciding it was better off taking a swim in the freezing sea . Regarded as marine mammals because of the many months they spend at sea, polar bears have nevertheless adapted large, flat paws to distribute their bulk as they pad across thin ice. They can weigh up to 1,100lbs, more than enough to smash through layers of frozen sea that would easily hold a man. Mr Wik added: 'It is difficult to explain my feelings in situations like this. I think the Polar bear is one of the most charismatic animals in the world. 'It was a rare and very interesting situation to watch everything and this was, without doubt, the ultimate wilderness experience for me.'

"When Paul Williamson got back together with his former college sweetheart last May after 30 years apart - his story had all the makings of a fairytale. But the concert pianist's joy was snatched away just months after rekindling the relationship - when he was given the devastating news that he had terminal cancer. After hearing his prognosis last August, Mr Williamson, 48, made it his mission to marry Anne Hope before he died and yesterday the couple wed in an emotional Valentine's Day ceremony in the West Midlands. Rekindled romance: Paul Williamson and Anne Hope wed yesterday - fulfilling the groom's wish of marrying his college sweetheart before he died. The couple are pictured together aged 15 in 1981, left . They first dated when both were 18-year-old students at the old Coventry School of Music. But their two-year relationship fizzled out when talented Mr Williamson moved away after winning a place at Birmingham Conservatoire. Three decades later, Ms Hope, also 48, spotted Mr Williamson's name on a directory of music teachers and the pair decided to meet up - soon picking up where they left off. Yesterday they tied the knot at Elmdon Church in Solihull in a service organised in just a fortnight. The venue was particularly poignant as it was where Mr Williamson's parents were married 56 years earlier. Emotional service: The couple, both 48, tied the knot at Elmdon Church in Solihull in a ceremony organised in just a fortnight . Released doves: The newlyweds released the birds into the sky outside the church in the West Midlands . He bravely made his vows despite  struggling to speak as a result of his mouth and throat cancer. His sister Lynda Crabb said: 'I understood every word he said. It was wonderful.' Describing the couple's decision to marry, she previously said: 'Both Paul and Anne were very emotional. I was with Anne and she got upset and said that all she wanted to do was marry Paul. 'When I took Paul to the doctors, he got emotional and said that he wanted to marry Anne too. We just take everything one day at a time. 'He never gives up. He's full of spirit. He still plays the piano and can drag me around and then out to the pub. Anne is so good with Paul. She cares for him so much.' The venue was particularly poignant as it was where Mr Williamson's parents were married 56 years earlier . The ceremony began at 1.30pm with the bride, wearing a white dress with red and diamanté detailing, arriving at the church in a cream Beauford Open Top Tourer. Mr Williamson wore a tailored suit from the Suit Lounge in Coventry - provided after his family had struggled to find one that fitted him as his cancer has caused his weight to plummet to just eight stone. Ms Hope was walked down the aisle by John, Mr Williamson's father - with the groom's twin brother David acting as best man. The theme of the service, conducted by the Rev Toby Crowe, was a line taken from The Beatles' hit All You Need is Love. During the ceremony, the vicar said: 'All you need is love. Who better is there to give that message to the world than you?' The bride and groom held hands throughout the readings, given by friends and family, including Ms Hope's teenage daughter Ellie. 30 years apart: Mr Williamson and Ms Hope first dated when they were both students at the old Coventry School of Music .

"Scientists believe that all human life started in Africa six million years ago. But the evolutionary mystery of how monkeys arrived in South America has baffled them for years, however, this mystery may finally have been solved. New fossil evidence collected by curators at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, California suggests that the monkeys may have managed to journey across the Atlantic from Africa by sea. Different species: Brown Capuchin Monkey's (Sapajus libidinosus) are seen on a tree on the banks of the Paraguay river, in Caceres, Brazil,  at the gateway to the Pantanal . Discovery: The origins of just how South American monkeys arrived in South America, including these woolly monkeys in the Amazon in Brazil, may finally have been uncovered . The revealing fossils were discovered along a riverbank in the east Peruvian Amazon in 2010 near a notoriously challenging place for researchers to work. In 2012, Ken Campbell, a curator at the museum took a closer look at the fossils and soon realized that they belonged to a primitive monkey similar to ones found in Africa. He discovered that the fossils also showed that the monkeys arrived on the continent at least 36 million years ago. Previous fossil records dated the monkey's arrival back at just 26 million years. Campbell told Fox News.com:  'The Amazon is a bit of a difficult place to work because there are no outcrops to speak of because they're all covered by forest. 'And so the only outcrops that one finds are along riverbanks, and that means that you can only look for fossils during the dry season, when the rivers are at their lowest point.' Campbell said: 'One of the teeth [we found] is very, very similar to a fossil tooth from Africa. 'In paleontology, when the specimens that you have look very similar then that's a general indication of comparable ancestry. 'So the fact that these two teeth are very similar suggests - not prove, but suggests - that there might be a relationship between them.' Evidence: New fossil evidence collected by curators at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, pictured, suggests that the monkeys may have managed to journey across the Atlantic from Africa by sea . According to researchers the types of fossils found in South America show that it has always been home to many different  animals. Yet, just how monkeys arrived on the island nation has been shrouded in mystery. Campbell said: 'The general hypothesis is that - first of all, these monkeys were very small. They're about the size of a small squirrel with a long tail. 'So they're very small and as a consequence their food and water requirements would be much less than if they were very large. 'So the general hypothesis is that there were monkeys on a river bank. During flood season, trees get swept into the river and carried out to the ocean. 'As vegetation rafts, [the trees are] carried across on the Atlantic based on wind and current directions. 'This remains a hypothesis- there's no proof yet, although the similarities between the monkeys suggests that it did happen.' 'Finding primates was a possibility, but they are very rare and very small. So in the end, it was a surprise.'","Just how monkeys arrived in South America has been unknown for years .

"Boris Johnson is to renounce his US citizenship, clearing the way for him to become Prime Minister. The London mayor has dual nationality because he was born in New York - but has now revealed he wants to hand back his American passport. He said: 'The reason I'm thinking I probably will want to make a change is that my commitment is, and always has been, to Britain.' Scroll down for video . London mayor Boris Johnson has dual British and American nationality because he was born in New York . He added: 'It's an accident of birth that has left me with this thing. I've got to find a way of sorting it out.' Mr Johnson - who is running for parliament in Uxbridge and South Ruislip - said he would approach US ambassador Matthew Barzun about the change. 'It is a laborious business. They don't make it easy for you,' he told the Sunday Times during a week-long tour in the States. Constitutional experts believe dual nationality would not present any technical barrier to Mr Johnson becoming prime minister, but he would be likely to face questions about his loyalties. Aides said the mayor's priority was to avoid paying more to the US tax authorities, after he was recently forced to settle a large capital gains tax bill. Boris Johnson held talks with his New York counterpart Bill de Blasio yesterday on the last day of his US visit . US presidential front-runner Hilary Clinton joked about Mr Johnson's ambitions when she met him in New York on Thursday . Boris Johnson wants to be given a key role in David Cameron's planned EU renegotiation after the election in May, he has revealed. The London Mayor wants to put his expertise on Brussels, where he was a journalist in the 1990s, to advise the prime minister on how to win concessions from the EU. 'He knows the scene very well. If he wasn't mayor he would put himself forward,' a source told the Sunday Times . Mr Johnson admitted he had 'strong views about how a renegotiation could happen'. He added: 'I'd be very happy to help. I think there's a deal to be done. If I wasn't happily lashed to my oar as mayor of London, I would do it [full time].' Mr Johnson yesterday met the left-wing New York City Bill de Blasio, on the last day of his US visit. Although Mr Johnson was on a trade mission across the East Coast, much of the six-day visit had been dominated by talks on how to tackle the increased terror threat in major cities. Mr Johnson also took the opportunity to pay tribute to those killed in the September 11 attacks, insisting Britain and America will 'never to give in to those who mean us harm'. The mayor was given a tour of the memorial created to mark the 2001 tragedy by co-founder of the Tribute Centre Lee Ielpi, whose firefighter son Jonathan died trying to save others. He left flowers with a message that read: 'The people of London will never forget the thousands who lost their lives on 9/11 2001. 'We honour the memory. We remember the sufferings of their families and all the bereaved. Our two cities embody the highest values of our civilisation: freedom, democracy, pluralism amd tolerance. 'We are jointly resolved never to compromise those values and never to give in to those who mean us harm.'","London mayor has dual nationality because he was born in New York .

"It has often been the case that cheating partners who get caught have a long list of excuses to explain away their liaisons. But now scientists have discovered an 'infidelity gene' that could mean cheating women will be able to simply say their genes made them do it. Females who carry a specific variant of a gene which affects social behaviour and sexual motivation have a greater propensity to take part in 'extra pair mating', researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia found. Variations of the AVPR1A gene affect females' propensity to cheat but do not have the same affect on men . Variants of combinations of the AVPR1A gene have been found to be associated with promiscuity and ruthlessness in animals, the Sunday Times reported. Each person carries two AVPR1A genes - one inherited from each parent - so there are a number of potential combinations. But these variations only appear to affect females rather than males. Dr Brendan Zietsch, a professor of psychology at the university, worked with a team of geneticists and neuroscientists to examine the DNA and lifestyles of more than 7,000 people. They found that of the 6.4 per cent of women who had been unfaithful, a large amount of them had a specific variant of the 'infidelity gene.' 'Overall, these findings confirm genetic underpinnings of extrapair mating in humans,' the scientists said in a research paper. Women who contain a specific variation of a gene are more likely to cheat on their partner, scientists found . The scientists said the findings were surprising, as it is generally thought that behaviour is affected by a combination of different genes as well as social and cultural factors. Last year researchers from the University of Queensland found that infidelity could be inherited. They found that 63 per cent of unfaithful behaviour in men and 40 per cent in women could be put down to genetic interference, including variations of specific genes.","Scientists have found variations of a gene are linked to 'extrapair mating'

"There could be new rules on the use of commercial drones which zip through the sky in the U.S.  making them a part of everyday life, according to plans proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration. At some point in the near future drones could perform routine tasks such as aerial photography, mapping, crop monitoring and inspections of cell towers, bridges and other tall structures. But they may not be able to do other tasks like deliver pizzas, as safety restrictions will mean drones must be kept within sight of operators at all times and there'll be no night time flights. Scroll down for video . Drone: This Aerialtronics Altura Zenith drone is seen at an event at the National Press Club in Washington, they could soon become a frequent sight in the skies above . FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said: 'We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules. 'We want to maintain today's outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.' He said the agency intends to issue final rules as quickly as it can. Among the proposals being laid out are requirements that commercial operators will need to meet in order to be allowed to fly small drones weighing less than 55 pounds. It means that operators will have to pass a knowledge test administered by the FAA and a security check by the Transportation Safety Administration. The measures being unveiled by the FAA  are still in the works and it could be two or three years before the rules are made final. Brian Wynne, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group said: 'The proposed rules are 'a good first step' bringing the U.S. closer to realizing the benefits of drone technology' No fly zone: Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports. Data analysts recently created a map of the US that plots where owners can pilot their drones, and where specifically the drones are banned (pictured) However as drones are introduced, some will worry about their ability to impact their privacy, particularly over homes and offices. To allay these fears, Ben Marcus, a pilot from California teamed up with drone makers to create a global database called NoFlyZone.org that lets anyone set up no-fly zones above their homes. It works by users using a website to enter their location, name and an email address to verify the request. This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point, as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property. Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports. Yet federal officials said that once commercial drones are in place the economic and safety benefits of unmanned aircraft are expected to be enormous. Even with the restrictions, drones are expected to play a 'transformative role in fields as diverse as urban infrastructure management, farming, public safety, coastal security, military training, search and rescue, and disaster response,' the White House said. However, there will be measures that federal agencies must follow to guard against abuse of data collected in drone flights. Among other steps, the order requires agencies to review privacy and civil rights protections before deploying drone technology and to adhere to a range of controls. Personally identifiable information collected in drone flights is to be kept no longer than 180 days, although there are exceptions. It's questionable whether such steps will satisfy civil liberties advocates, who've objected strongly to the government's vigorous use of digital surveillance in the name of national security. The proposal also raises the possibility that final rules may include a separate category for very small drones — those weighing 4.4 pounds or less — that would include fewer restrictions.","Drones could be used for routine tasks including  aerial photography .

"MPs have demanded 'compulsory training' for mobility scooter drivers after a shock figures revealed three people a WEEK are being injured in accidents involving the 10mph disability buggies. In total, 164 accidents involving mobility scooters were recorded last year – including five drivers who were killed, 17 who suffered serious injuries and a further 102 who sustained 'slight injuries'. Nine more people, who were not the driver, were seriously injured after being hit by a scooter - and another 31 people slightly injured, the Department for Transport has revealed. Mobility scooters are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the Road Traffic Act . But experts said the true figure is likely to be far higher, because the crashes were only recorded by less than half of police forces. The vehicles, intended for disabled people and have a top speed of just 10mph, are cheap to run, do not need tax or insurance, and can be driven without a licence. They are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the Road Traffic Act, giving the police limited powers to prosecute dangerous driving. Alison Seabeck, MP for Plymouth Moor View, has spoken out over the growing menace caused by some drivers and accused the Government of not taking the dangers seriously. The Labour MP has written to Transport Minister Robert Goodwill to express her concern at the danger posed by the growing number of mobility scooters. More than 300,000 people are now thought to use mobility scooters in the UK. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is under pressure to introduce 'compulsory training' for mobility scooter drivers . Ms Seabeck says an ageing population will fuel the growth of scooters, and wants more stringent checks in place. She has also previously raised concern over able-bodied youngsters using mobility scooters as a cheap alternative to running a car. She told Commons in 2012 how she spotted one youngster spotted 'cruising along the seafront at a Devon resort' with his golf clubs on the back. But Ms Seabeck is convinced accidents are on the increase. She told the Western Morning News: 'With more and more mobility vehicles on the roads, the lack of knowledge amongst some users regarding safety and visibility, and in some cases poor roadworthiness, are all potential causes of accidents leading to injury and death. 'If the growth in numbers continues at the current rate then the Government must take action. The public seem to agree. 'We need to know who is using these vehicles and training on purchase, whether privately or from a shop, should become a mandatory requirement.'","In total, 164 accidents involving mobility scooters were recorded last year .

"Two children have been left orphaned after three people, including a woman and her baby girl, were killed after their car slammed into a tree near Victoria's western border. The driver, the 39-year-old father, died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after being trapped in the car for a number of hours. Two other children, a young brother and sister were airlifted to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and survived with injuries - but have tragically been left orphaned by the horror crash. Scroll down for video . Three people, including a woman and her baby girl, are dead after their car slammed into a tree in Victoria . The father and driver of the car, 39, was trapped in the car for a number of hours but later died in hospital . The woman, 29, and baby died at the scene of the crash, which happened about 7.30am on Casterton-Penola Road, near Lake Mundi. The boy, eight years old, arrived in hospital with critical injuries but it has since been revealed he is now in a stable condition, Nine News reported. He is suffering from head and abdominal injuries according to Fairfax Media. His surviving sister, aged three, escaped the accident with only minor injuries. It is believed Sunday was her birthday. The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia. Two children, a boy, 8, and a girl, 3,  have been left orphaned by the tragic accident . They arrived in Mount Gambier just 18 months ago, and had returned from a reunion with family in the Congo just hours before the accident, according to The Advertiser. The family has reportedly flown into Melbourne early on Sunday morning, immediately attempting the six hour drive home just after they stepped off the plane. The Conglonese community in Mount Gambier held a vigil in memory of the young family on Sunday night, and a woman who works at the son's school spoke on behalf of the family. 'They are absolutely destroyed ... they are just grieving because it was such a sudden accident,” she said,' Inna Tucker told The Advertiser. The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia . The accident takes Victoria's road toll to 39, compared to 36 at the same time last year. 'They’d already been through so much as refugees, endured so much trauma ... they came here for a better and brighter future and it has ended up like this,' she added. Superintendent Don Downs told the ABC it was a 'tragic collision' and part of a 'horror start' to the year in the area. 'People think they can drive in these back roads and there's not a big risk, but there is a big risk,' he said. 'When you come out to jobs like this it's heart-wrenching. Heart-wrenching on the community and heart-wrenching on the members who attended.' Victoria police say they think the driver may have missed a turn off, and fatigue may have been a factor in the horror crash.

"Russia's most popular American actor, a Minnesota native who stars in the country's highest rated sitcom, has come out as gay. Odin Biron, a 30-year-old from Duluth, revealed his sexuality last week in a magazine interview that came as a surprise not just to the nearly 4 million regular viewers of his hospital comedy Interns, but to his co-stars, as well. It also happens that one of those fellow actors, 48-year-old Ivan Okhlobystin, is a former Orthodox priest who's made a name for himself in part with his outspoken condemnation of both gays and America. Scroll down for video . Risky reveal? Odin Biron stars in one of Russia's highest rated television shows and has come out as gay . Outspoken: Biron's co-star Ivan Okhlobystin is one of the country's loudest and most vehement anti-gay and anti-American voices . But the homophobia of Biron's co-workers and, some might say, of the country where he's made a living for the last 10 years, was not enough to stop him from outing himself in New York Magazine last Monday. 'At a time when sexual minorities in Russia face greater adversity, both socially and legally, than at any time in recent memory, I feel compelled to use my unique platform to speak out,' Biron said in a statement that followed his New York Magazine reveal. A ban on propaganda of 'nontraditional sexual relations' that was signed by President Vladimir Putin into law in June 2013 provoked widespread international outrage from critics who believe the legislation discriminates against gays. But it also was met with applause from many in Russian. Among them was Biron's boisterous co-star Okhlobystin, who then took it upon himself to one-up even Putin. 'I would put all the gays alive into an oven,' Okhlobystin was quoted as saying. 'This is Sodom and Gomorrah! As a religious person, I cannot be indifferent about it because it is a real threat to my children!' Not surprisingly, Okhlobystin--who's also claimed he would gladly bomb America off the face of the earth--was not pleased when he heard Biron's announcement. He took to Twitter to announce him displeasure to the world, reports NBC News, and said he was 'cursing fate' after learning his friend and co-star 'is a Sodomite.' 'Some things are better not known. Lord preserve us from this devilry,' he said. The two men will be back on set for the sixth season of their popular show in a few weeks. But Biron told New York Magazine that the passing of the propaganda got him mulling a return to the United States. Whether his eventual departure from Russia is expedited by his coming out, Biron doesn't seem to care. 'If my coming out publicly can give hope to anyone, or encourage them to do the same, then the sacrifice of my privacy is worth it,' he said. Biron and Okhlobystin star in the 'Scrubs'-like comedy Interns. After learning of his co-star's announcement, Okhlobystin tweeted, 'some things are better not known. Lord preserve us from this devilry'","Odin Biron, star of Russia's most popular sitcom, Interns, risked his career last week with the big announcement .

"It is widely used by patients to seek diagnoses, research drugs and find out details about doctors. However, the notion of a medic using Google to research a patient is considered a breach of trust. But now, the authors of a new medical paper have claimed that doctors should, in some cases, be able to use the popular Internet search engine to seek information on the people they are caring for. The reason? Because sometimes it is necessary to protect patients - and others - from harm, say Maria Baker and Daniel George, co-authors of the paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine . Acceptable? The authors of a new medical paper have claimed that doctors should, in some cases, be able to use the  Internet search engine, Google, to seek information on the people they are caring for (file picture) Although the American Medical Association's (AMA) guidelines provide doctors with general advice on the use of the Internet, they do not explicitly refer to the practice of 'Googling', the co-authors claim. Despite this so-called 'Google blind spot', physicians' use of the search engine to find out patients' details is typically perceived (by both the public and doctors themselves) as an invasion of privacy. But in their paper, Baker and George say that there are 10 situations in which it may be 'ethically valid and even warranted' for healthcare professionals to engage in 'patient-targeted Googling'. These include when the doctor has a duty to 'warn of possible harm', if there is evidence of 'doctor shopping', if the patient gives 'evasive responses' or if they have made claims that 'seem improbable'. They also include when the patient's story is discredited by other 'reliable healthcare professionals' the doctor suspects physical or substance abuse, or if the patient is believed to be potentially suicidal. 'Notably, all of these potential situations... are at their core concerned with patient safety,' Baker, a Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute genetics counselor, writes in the paper, available online. Co-authors: Sometimes 'patient-targeted Googling' is necessary to protect patients - and others - from harm, say Maria Baker (left) and Daniel George (right), co-authors of  the Journal of General Internal Medicine paper . Speaking to Reuters, George, an assistant professor in Medical Humanities at Penn State College of Medicine, adds: 'There is something worth protecting in the physician-patient relationship.' Despite their list of 10 situations, the authors believe that, most of the time, 'patient-targeted Googling' is not acceptable. They hope their paper will spark conversation among medical experts about whether the AMA's guidelines should be updated in a digital age where search engines are ubiquitous. In the document, the pair detail two real-life situations at Penn State when they felt the practice of 'Googling' was not only warranted, but necessary, to ensure patients' and others' safety. Authors Maria Baker and Daniel George claim there are 10 situations in which it may be 'ethically valid and even warranted' for doctors to engage in 'patient-targeted Googling'. Five of these are as follows: . 1. The doctor has a duty to warn of 'possible harm' 2. The patient has provided 'evasive responses to logical clinical questions' 3. The patient has made 'improable' claims about their personal or family history . 4. The doctor has suspicions 'regarding physical and/or substance abuse' 5. The doctor has concerns over a suicide risk . Source: 'Navigating the Google Blind Spot: An Emerging Need for Professional Guidelines to Address Patient-Targeted Googling'. In one of the cases,  a 27-year-old breast cancer sufferer underwent a series of cancer predisposition tests and was counseled about the results. But several years later, an amended report was released. The new findings showed the woman had a rare bone marrow failure disorder that would affect all of her future children. The report also held 'clinically important information' for the patient's relatives. However, despite repeated attempts to contact the woman, a clinician was unable to do so. Therefore, 'Googling' was 'viewed as a requirement to fulfill a professional obligation', Baker and George write. In the other case, a 26-year-old woman requested that both of her breasts be removed to prevent breast cancer, even though she had not been tested to see if she was at risk for the disease. According to the co-authors, she reported an 'almost unbelievable' family history of breast, ovarian and esophageal cancer. She had also sought the same surgery at other hospitals, they write in their paper. When a medic 'Googled' the woman, she was found to be 'presenting her cancer story at lay conferences, giving newspaper interviews, and blogging about her experience as a cancer survivor.' She was also determined to be 'raising funds, perhaps fraudulently, to attend a national cancer conference'. The surgeon subsequently refused to carry out the surgery without formal tests. Although Baker and George aim to highlight the ways in which 'Googling' patients can be warranted in 10 cases in their paper, they also acknowledge it can undermine trust among the public and medics. Popular Internet search engine: Although the AMA's guidelines provide doctors with general advice on the use of the Internet, they do not explicitly refer to the practice of 'Googling', the co-authors say (file picture) 'You have a patient wanting to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the doctor helps him on a course of exercise and non-smoking,' Baker explained. 'But the doctor 'Googles' him and sees pictures he posted on Facebook smoking a cigar.' Mildred Solomon, president of the Garrison, New York-based bioethics institute The Hastings Center, congratulated the authors for raising questions surrounding the AMA's guidelines. However, she said that their 'acceptable' reasons for searching for patients' details are too broad. Instead, she claims the doctor's intention is the key in determining whether 'Googling' is wrong. 'Why is the physician motivated to do this? Is it going to bring benefit to the patient, or is it something self-serving or out of personal curiosity?' Solomon asked. A spokesman for the AMA declined to comment to Reuters Health, citing the issue as 'unresolved' by the organization. However, a 2013 policy statement from The Federation of State Medical Boards notes that physician use of digital tools must evolve as do technology and societal trends. It acknowledges the use of 'patient-targeted Googling' in medical crises, such as attempts to identify unconscious patients in emergency departments. But, according to the policy, 'it instead can be linked to curiosity, voyeurism and habit. Although anecdotal reports highlight some benefit (for example, intervening when a patient is blogging about suicide), real potential exists for blurring professional and personal boundaries.' The paper's authors say they wish only for more dialogue about this digital practice. 'I think this is just a starting point,' George said. 'Every conversation has to start with something. This is the raw clay that we hope the field sculpts into set guidelines.' Baker and George's paper, 'Navigating the Google Blind Spot: An Emerging Need for Professional Guidelines to Address Patient-Targeted Googling', appears in the journal's January print edition.","Co-authors Maria Baker and Daniel George claim that doctors should, in some cases, be able to use Google to seek information on their patients .

"Paedophile Rolf Harris could be earning as much as £1,300 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments, it is claimed. Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986.

Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, is making a fortune from his investments while in jail . At the time of his sentencing, his companies were worth £8.5million, the Sunday People reported. New figures suggest his earnings have shot by £290,000, according to the newspaper. His only daughter Bindi, who stood by him during his trial, resigned from her position as director . Harris also owns a home on the River Thames and his total assets could be worth more than £15million. He also earns interest on £2.3million in cash and the stock-market value of £6.2million of shares owned by his firms continues to rise. ‘It won’t go down too well that they are having to work to earn a few pounds when he is getting ­richer by doing nothing’ a jail source told the Sunday People. Harris is one of many celebrities jailed for historic sex crimes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Most recently, TV weatherman Fred Talbot was convicted of a string of offences after jurors heard how he coerced young boys into simulating naked orgies on school trips in the 1970s and 80s. Former glam rock singer Gary Glitter was found guilty of carrying out a string of sex attacks on young girls while at the height of his fame. He was found guilty of of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13.

"A Las Vegas mother of four shot in the head after a road rage incident that began as she taught her teen daughter to drive has died. Tammy Meyers, 44, died Saturday days after an attack that left her on life support. She was shot Thursday outside her home after a still-unknown assailant followed her and her 15-year-old daughter before opening fire. Now her bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the accomplices who were in the car along with him. 'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.' Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday . Suspect: A 6-foot man with blond., spiky hair aged around 25 opened fire on Meyers as her children watched. Her 23-year-old son returned fire on the suspect's car which held 'several people' according to reports. Those people remained at large as of Sunday morning . Police believe the shooter followed Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire. She died Saturday evening, a family member told ABC News. Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves. Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said. Vowed to find suspects: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 15-year-old daughter who was driving is distraught. He believes the family's car and that of the suspect crashed at some point before the deadly shooting . She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. He described the girl as emotionally distraught. Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car. Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said. Investigators were looking for the shooter and at least one other person in the vehicle, Garcia said. Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side.

"Welcome to the party where being a stick in the mud is not a bad thing at all. While feathers, sequins and skin are trademarks of Carnival celebrations in Brazil, there's no room for them at the Bloco da Lama. At this down and dirty fiesta it's all about swamp creatures and lashings of dark, black mud. And while bikinis are the outfit of choice, they're not visible for long as one woman in a white bikini quickly discovered. 'She's so clean, it makes me want to hug her,' said a reveller freshly emerged from the mud who helped the woman fit in with her muddy mates. Scroll down for video . Whether it's an elephant costume or viking horns, anything goes at Bloco da Lama in Paraty, as long as you're covered in mud . Bikini may be the costume of choice for women at the Mud Street party, but very quickly they are smeared with the black mud . Instead of the usual feathers, sequins and skin-revealing costumes of Carnival, Bloco da Lama features wacky swamp creatures . An acrobatic revellers does a flip into the black sludge of Paraty, a coastal town in Rio de Janeiro state . The dark, slimy mud might be a turn off for some but romance is still in the air at this Carnival 'street' party in Brazil . The coastal colonial town of Paraty, in Rio de Janeiro state, is home to the event that translated from Portuguese to English means Mud Street Party at which revellers make the most of the Atlantic's mineral-rich soil. 'Usually when you think of Brazilian Carnival, you think of sequins and feathers - not mud,' said French tourist Marion Douchet, 28, as she smeared the sludge onto the back of her neck and the few other spots clean skin was still visible. 'It's fun, it's original and it's exotic.' Patricia Azevedo, who owns a hotel in town, said the mud was helping her beat the intense mid-summer heat. 'When you go to a normal ""bloco"" you're all packed together like sardines and it gets insanely hot,' said Azevedo, 43, a vine tiara giving her swamp creature look the crowning touch. 'The mud is really refreshing - plus I don't even need sunscreen.' The Bloco da Lama, which translates from Portuguese to English as 'Mud Street Party', takes place every year in Paraty . Thousands of mud-covered party-goers parade during Bloco da Lama, although local shopkeepers don't let them traipse mud in their stores . Even with the dark slime this Bloco da Lama devotee manages a bright orange coloured outfit - not that it will be so vibrant for long . Men parade their chiselled physiques in front of a spooky swamp creature during the festival party on Saturday . While some choose to slowly smear the black stuff on their skin, this man dives into the muddy depths head first . A bright smile sparkles from the black sludge as this young woman takes to the mud during the party in Paraty . Far from a centuries-old spiritual or religious occasion, this 'bloco' is said to have been born in 1986 after local teens hiking in a nearby mangrove forest smeared themselves with mud to discourage mosquitoes and then wandered through Paraty. Since then the festivities have evolved steadily, although local shopkeepers grew so weary of the revellers traipsing the hard-to-remove mud through the downtown and staining white walls and walkways that they banned them. No worry though, as party-goers now dance on the beach to a soundtrack of Brazilian funk and house music while chanting 'uga, uga' like cavemen. Bloco da Lama is said to have started in 1986 when two teenagers paraded through Paraty covered in mud . It's not a great festival for those who wear glasses but this man doesn't seem to mind as he poses for a photograph . This woman won't let swamp creatures and black sludge deny her the chance to wear a princess crown for Carnival . Young and old enjoy the mud during the Bloco da Lama in Paraty, about 250km south of the city of Rio de Janeiro . Locals say using the mud is a great way to cool off in the heat during Carnival, a far cry from the sweaty and crowded city blocos . Two men play wrestle on the sand while mud-smeared revellers watch on . Roar! Being swamp creatures doesn't mean this family can't shoot a smile down the lens . As the afternoon wears on, the amount of empty beer cans on the beach multiply and mud pies begin to fly from the eager hands of teenagers while a pair of men play wrestle on the sand. 'It's good spirited fun,' Azevedo said. 'I mean, I haven't looked at myself in the mirror, I'm sure I look ridiculous. But then again, everyone does.'","The Bloco da Lama, or Mud Street Party, took place Saturday in the coastal town of Paraty .

"Live from New York... it's The SNL 40th Anniversary Special! The extravagant self-tribute, all three-and-a-half-hours, is set to air at 8 p.m. EST tonight on NBC, preceded by an hour-long red carpet special hosted by the Today show's anchor team. Everyone who has ever been a Saturday Night Live regular, guest host, musical guest or behind-the-scenes creative force is on the guest list, along with other bold-face names galore. Scroll down for video . Stage area: This is how the main stage looked on Saturday Night Live on December 3, 1988 . Stars: Dan Aykroyd as Elwood Blues, left, and John Belushi as Jake Blues became iconic for their performance as the Blues Brothers on 'Saturday Night Live,' in New York . Weekend Update: Chevy Chase performs during a 'Weekend Update' sketch on 'Saturday Night Live,' in the long-running sketch comedy series which will celebrate its 40th anniversary with a three-hour special .

Other stars in attendance will be Miley Cyrus, James Franco, Derek Jeter, Steve Martin, Fred Armisen, Eddie Murphy, Jerry Seinfeld, Kristen Wiig and Kerry Washington. The content of the show is still a well guarded secret and is yet to be determined according to SNL creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels. And as proof that the show was still a work-in-progress a few days ago the special subsequently grew by 30 minutes from its originally announced three-hour length. SNL which was titled NBC's Saturday Night in its first season premiered on October 11, 1975, with comedian George Carlin as host, and Billy Preston and Janis Ian its musical guests. It was born as the brainchild of Michaels, then 31, who today, at 70, remains very much hands-on. By the end of 1975, it had caught on as a rare TV venue for topical humor and sassy comedy. Eddie Murphy is among the series' biggest discoveries whose SNL tenure fell during Michaels' absence between 1980 and 1985. 'Eddie Murphy coming is a huge thing,' Michaels said with pride. 50 Cent .

During his breakout performance on the show's premiere Chase launched 'Weekend Update, which led to him becoming the cast-member who regularly voiced the catch-phrase that, after 39 years and counting, remains the show's trademark:  'Live from New York, it's 'Saturday Night'!' The anniversary show will include sketches and a mash-up of different generations, so people will work together who never actually worked together before on the hit show.

Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in 2008. The right-wing politician is set to appear once again on Saturday Night Live, where she will have the opportunity to joust with lookalike Tina Fey. (Palin is right) In 2008, Tina Fey's hilarious portrayal of then Vice President nominee Sarah Palin became one of the show's big hits. 'I can see Russia from my house,' she'd quip in a red suit, glasses and cheeky grin. There are rumors that Palin could also be set to reprise her ratings-busting turn on Saturday Night Live for the show's 40th anniversary special. She last appeared on the show in 2008, just two weeks before election day - although on that occasion viewers were disappointed when she did not appear side-by-side with Fey.

"A 98-year-old millionaire claims he and his wife were lured into paying $12 million to California's Chapman University then the school did not stick to their agreement. Real estate mogul James Emmi accuses university president James Doti of putting undue pressure on him to sign a contract without the consent of his 84-year-old wife, Catherine. In a suit that alleges breach of contract, fraud, deceit and elder abuse, Mr and Mrs Emmi, of Orange County, demand that the university return all $3 million of the donation already transferred, surrender their claim to the remaining $9 million, and pay $3 million in damages. Demands: James and Catherine Emmi (seated) claimed Chapman University president James Doti (center) pressured Mr Emmi into signing a contract to donate $12 million to the school after 'wining and dining' him . 'They really confused him and they pressured him,' said James Bohm, the Emmis' attorney, told The OC Register. 'They wined and dined him, and they took advantage of his advanced age.' It comes after the university failed to mention the couple at a recent graduation event, instead thanking another donor who gifted $15 million, the LA Times reported. Furthermore, the civil suit claims, the university was not on track to build The Emmi Science Center by 2016, which was stipulated in the contract. According to court papers, Mr Emmi was continually hounded by university officials for donations after he gifted $450,000 toward a new science center in 2009. The couple claim they rejected a request for $15 million toward a technology center in 2012. In 2013, over tea, Mr Emmi is said to have consented to donate $12 million to the university's science center, on the grounds that it would be in his name. 'Undue pressure': Mr Emmi, 98, claims Mr Doti took advantage of his old age in a 2013 meeting over tea . 'Broken promises': The couple claim the university was not on track to build a center by 2016 as promised . The university promised full-scale media coverage of the gift and said it would be built by 2016, Mr Emmi states. 'Chapman University is deeply saddened by the misstatements in the complaint filed by the Emmis,' Chapman spokeswoman Mary Platt said in a statement. 'Mr. James Emmi has been a close friend of both President James Doti and the university. The allegations do not reflect what occurred and completely mischaracterize the Emmis' interactions with the university.'","Real estate mogul James Emmi, 98, and his wife Catherine, 84, claim California's Chapman University took advantage of them .

"She's known for her straight-talking, no-nonsense manner and Mel B admits she has no qualms about speaking her mind. In fact, the X Factor judge, 39, famously dubbed Scary Spice when the Spice Girls formed in 1994,  said: 'I'd like to think I'm a bit scary every now and again.' The mother-of-three told The Times that it was a magazine, not the girls themselves, who coined their nicknames but more than 20 years later after the group formed, 'she wouldn't change it for the world'. The name fits: Former Spice Girls member Mel B (pictured in September) has revealed that even though she didn't give herself the moniker 'Scary Spice', she does like to think she's 'a bit scary every now an again' 'I'd like to think I'm a bit scary every now and again. I wouldn't change my name for the world. We never named ourselves - it was a magazine, and the nicknames stuck. I don't think you can mess with that, so I'm sticking with mine.' She  is also the driving force behind a Spice Girls reunion with Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell, Melanie Chisholm and Emma Bunton but that the others are dragging their feet. She said: 'I've been wanting this for 15 years. But everyone's doing their own thing and everyone has families to consider.' The group reunited for a sell-out tour in late 2007 and early 2008 but have yet to repeat its success. Since then Victoria, a hugely successful designer, has had a fourth child and Mel herself has three daughters, Phoenix Chi with ex Jimmy Gulzar, Angel, fathered by Eddie Murphy and Madison, with husband Stephen Belafonte. Despite recent reports of trouble in her marriage, Mel recently reaffirmed their strength together, saying they are 'madly in love'.

It appears she is keen to put the rumours behind her to focus on her duties as a mother instead and likens the idea of being a working mum to being 'a mini superwoman'. Yet she prefers not to call herself a feminist. Instead, 'I try to live by the girl-power motto,' she explained. 'It's about believing in yourself, no matter how bad a day you're having, and lending your support to other women. It's empowering to have that camaraderie with other women.' She certainly seemed to have it with her fellow X Factor judge Cheryl Versini-Fernandez. She told Grazia: 'I'm a girl's girl and Cheryl is lovely. How can you not love her?' And she's happy to express her admiration for former bandmate Victoria Beckham. 'She's witty as hell, very funny and an amazing businesswoman. I love her dresses.'","Mel B, 39, still loves her  nickname and is pushing for a Spice Girls reunion .

"Killed: Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, was one of an estimated 500 Britons who went to Syria to fight . A former supervisor at Primark who became a terrorist fighting for the world’s most feared terrorist group has been killed in Syria. Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, was one of an estimated 500 Britons who went to Syria to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS). The group has renamed itself Islamic State (IS), and now controls vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared as the world’s newest Islamic caliphate. This weekend, the U.S. bombed key IS targets in northern Iraq as the group threatened to wipe out a secretive sect known as the Yazidis, accusing them of being devil worshippers. Rahman, from Portsmouth, was shot dead in a gun fight a fortnight ago, a day before the Muslim festival if Eid, said his family. His father, Abdul Hannan, 52, an Indian restaurant worker, said the family received a text message from a friend of Rahman in Syria who informed them that their son was dead. The latest killing brings the death toll of British jihadists in Syria to 19, according to terrorism experts at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College, London, which monitors the war in Syria. Rahman is the second British jihadist from Portsmouth to die in Syria. The first was his friend Iftekhar Jaman, 23, who died in December. Rahman’s father, Mr Hannan, said that Jaman went to Syria first at the beginning of last year, and then took his son there by contacting him through social media. He said that Rahman did not tell any member of his family that he was going to Syria, but suddenly disappeared from Portsmouth. Days later, they received a call from him saying he was in Syria. Mr Hannan said: ‘He asked us to pray for him, and said he wanted to become a shaheed (martyr) for the sake of Allah.’ It is not known where in Syria Rahman died. But Shiraz Maher, a terrorism expert at the ICSR, said he spoke to Rahman on social media a month ago, when he said he was in the northern Syria city of Deir Zour, which is a stronghold for IS. Maher said: ‘From speaking to him, I got the sense that he was a man who wanted to become a martyr. He was a man of conviction.’ Rahman was working at his local Primark store, but was dismissed a month before he went to Syria last October. Friends: Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, and  Iftekhar Jaman, 23, who died in December . Rahman, from Portsmouth, was shot dead in a gun fight a fortnight ago according to his family . He was one of 10 Britons from Portsmouth – all of Bangladeshi origin – who have gone to Syria to join the Islamic State. Rahman flew to Turkey with five other friends, and then crossed the border by land into Syria. In May, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who accompanied Rahman, but returned to the UK, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of taking part in terrorist activity in Syria. He was arrested in October at Gatwick airport by anti-terrorist police, as he flew back from Turkey. It emerged that Choudhury found the training in Syria too difficult and became scared of the fighting. Choudhury will be sentenced on September 19 at Kingston Crown Court.","Muhammad Hamidur Rahman one of around 500 Britons who went to Syria .

"Police have reopened an investigation into rape claims made against Mohamed Al Fayed in 2013 . Mohamed Al Fayed is facing a police probe into a claim that he raped a young woman following a job interview. The police investigation against the 86-year-old former Harrods owner had been dropped after the alleged victim withdrew her complaint. But the 22-year-old has come forward with new information. Officers are now reassessing the case, which was not reported publicly at the time. Mr Al Fayed furiously denies the allegation and claims he will be cleared within days. He has hired the services of Ian Burton, the lawyer for celebrity publicist Max Clifford, who was jailed for eight years for sex attacks. The incident is alleged to have taken place in October 2013, when the woman was invited to a job interview with Mr Al Fayed. She says she was invited to stay on at the tycoon’s Mayfair apartment after the interview and claims to have been attacked while incapacitated between 11pm and 1am. The next morning she went straight to police, claiming that she had been the victim of a sex assault. Officers from Operation Sapphire, the Metropolitan Police’s specialist sex crime unit at the time, took a statement and arrested and questioned Mr Al Fayed the next day. A 36-year-old businesswoman who arranged the interview was also quizzed by detectives. The complainant is said to have withdrawn the allegation because she became frightened. Yesterday Mark Williams-Thomas, a former detective and investigative journalist who helped expose Jimmy Savile, told the Mail the woman had recently gone back to the police. He said: ‘She made the allegation of rape within hours of the attack. The following day police interviewed the victim and commenced a detailed investigation but the victim became very scared.’ Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, has denied all the allegations against him and said he is 'saddened' Yesterday a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the case was being reassessed after the woman recently returned to a central London police station where she spoke to specialist officers. Detectives are now re-examining all the potential evidence and statements made at the time before deciding whether to carry out fresh interviews. A spokesman said the force ‘can confirm the Metropolitan Police Service investigated an allegation reported to us in October 2013’. He added: ‘The matter was not proceeded with at the time. ‘However we are reassessing the original investigation as a result of new information.’ Detectives are understood to have told the alleged victim that they will liaise with the Crown Prosecution Service about taking the case forward. Mr Al Fayed, whose son Dodi was killed in a high-speed car crash in Paris with Princess Diana, said he had done nothing wrong. He added: ‘I am saddened that, after extensive investigations by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2013, the original complainant feels compelled to request the Metropolitan Police Service to review their original decision. I fully co-operated with the Metropolitan Police Service during their initial investigations after which no charges were brought against me and the file was closed. ‘As I said originally, I completely deny any wrongdoing in this matter and refute the complainant’s allegations.’ Al Fayed previously owned Harrods and sold the business to Qatar Holdings in 2010 for around $1.5billion . His lawyers are thought to be confident that police will clear him within days. A spokesman for the former owner of Fulham Football Club added: ‘In response to an allegation made against him in 2013, Mohamed Al Fayed today expressed his dismay and disappointment that a request by the complainant had been made to The Metropolitan Police Service to have the case reviewed. ‘The Metropolitan Police today confirmed no new evidence had been offered by the complainant and they fully expect their review to be completed early next week.’ Mr Al Fayed, who has amassed an estimated fortune of over £1.2billion, has had a feud with Scotland Yard criticising its inquiry into the deaths of his son and Diana, who he claims were murdered.

"The Block superstar couple Josh Terrett and Charlotte Ekas have failed to attract buyers to their newly overhauled apartment at auction. As contestants continue to battle it out in a series of design challenges, the stunning one-bedroom apartment has been passed in at $390,000 on Saturday, which is $70,000 below the reserve price. But currently up for a private sale with a price tag of $460,000 by Jellis Craig, agent Nathan Waterson told Daily Mail Australia there has been a number of interests since the auction ended. ‘We’ve had over 150 people turn up to inspect the apartment and it’s been well received with great offers.

'We’ll call it curse but that’s the reality of the Melbourne market, one out of three properties passes in at auction,' Valentic told the Herald Sun. It comes after last year's series The Block Glasshouse triggered an uproar across the nation after Gold Coast couple - Michael and Carlene duffy alongside Dee and Darren Jolly from Melbourne struggled to make a profit - both making only $10,000 over their reserves.

"For many children, all it takes to have their dream playhouse are some boxes, a blanket or two and a boundless imagination. But for those who want their dreams to become a reality it takes something extra – around £6,500. That was the sum paid for this Wendy house by an anonymous buyer. This Wendy house is a copy of one that was designed by Clive Hunter for his daughter Amanda-Jaye Hunter in 1988. And while the mock-Tudor, one-bedroom property is enticing for those looking to downsize, the sales particulars warn: ‘The Wendy house is only suitable for small children as it has very restricted headroom, but it is possible for an adult to squeeze inside when crouched down.’ Sold: The miniature house bought for £6,500 by a secret buyer, and is essentially a very small working house, complete with the option for water and electricity . To a causal observer it might seem that the house simply appears smaller, but on closer inspection the house is really only fit of children . The 102 sq ft, two-storey house comes . with twin beds, lights and a working sink which is ready to be hooked up . to a water supply. For further comfort there are armchairs and a . scaled-down grandfather clock. Vendors . Brian and Pamela McDonough, both 69, bought the cottage 11 years ago . for their granddaughters but have sold it because they are grown up. The . McDonoughs, from Shrivenham in Oxfordshire, had the property . re-thatched, repainted and re-glazed at a cost of £2,500 before putting . the Wendy house on the market. The . playhouse was advertised as ‘fully furnished’ by Cotswold estate agents . Perry Bishop and Chambers, who told yesterday how it had attracted . interest around the world. Sarah . Benson, from the agents, added: ‘My own 26-year-old son even enquired . about it. He wanted me to buy it and put it in the garden for him and . his girlfriend to live in.’ The . timber house sits on reinforced steel beams and will now be transported . to the ‘wealthy’ individual’s home in the North East. (Left) tiny stairs and a low roof, in a decadent children's playhouse that comes with the ability for running water in the built in sink (right) and electricity to power the light fittings . Bedroom: The original owners built the house for their granddaughters, designing it to be sturdy but removable, for when the children grew out of the tiny twin beds . The house is deceptively small, and has all the rough mod-cons that one might expect from a small apartment, but is actually very cheap when compared to other posh Wendy houses on the market . While this playhouse might be the most recent posh Wendy house, it is by no means the most expensive. In January 2011 a millionaire ordered the construction of a playhouse for his children that cost £150,000 - almost as much as the average house in England and Wales. The two-storey timber playhouse has double glazing, solid pine flooring with underfloor heating, a TV and a stone chimney, and was eventually flown to Switzerland. Ten craftsmen spent a total of 2,000 hours over five weeks building the play house, which has a 18ft by 15ft footprint, is 12ft tall and is made from 13,000ft of sandblasted pine wood planks. The extravagant interior took a . further ten days to fit and is so well insulated that the anonymous . businessman's children will remain snug even in sub-zero Swiss . temperatures. Around . £100,000 was spent on materials, construction and other costs, while up . to £50,000 went on shipping the play house to Switzerland. A miniature ski chalet: The £150,000 Wendy house is more like a home away from home, and was flown to Switzerland as a play house for children . Inside: The ski-chalet Wendy house was made from the finest materials using the finest crafting techniques including sandblasting . Another posh Wendy house, this one costing £55,000 and tailored to the specifications of the client who is ordering it . The two-storey playhouses contain a kitchen (left), lighting and finishings that you might find in a rustic country home and while the houses could be comfortably lived in, they are designed as a playhouse nonetheless, and comes with features to entertain children like a slide (right) The £55,000 Wendy house costed as much as a real three-bedroom home in Liverpool, but also had the ability to be landscaped . Another series of Wendy houses, built in October 2011 might actually suit most first-time buyers, and was sold for £55,000 in Liverpool. The 12ft by 10ft Wendy house was constructed by The Master Wishmakers, who constructed a few of the houses based on orders from clients and featured two floors, a kitchen, underfloor heating an a reception room. The company claimed that for what clients were getting they were the most expensive play houses readily available on the market. The clients were mostly intended to be investment bankers and footballers, who would buy the houses for their children, and were intended to be useful even after the children had grown up, with suggestions that they might be good as an office or wine cellar.

"More frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after five people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit. The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit. On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back. Scroll down for video . Five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after consuming the 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries . Australian farmers urge consumers to always buy homegrown products . 'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said. 'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.' The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products. Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world. Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging. 'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked. 'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said. 'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.' The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes. The outbreak comes as a number of Victorian hospitals are told to dispose of chocolate mousse, which has been found to contain listeria. Hospitals are contacting patients who might have consumed the dessert between January 29 and February 10. No cases of the illness have been reported and the product is not supplied to the general public. The contamination came to light after the company conducted routine testing of its products. Listeria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, their unborn babies and the elderly. Concerned consumers can call Patties Foods on 1800 650 069. The following products have been recalled: . Nanna's Mixed Berries 1kg, up to and including Best Before Date 22/11/16 . Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries 300g, up to and including Best Before Date 10/12/17 . Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries 500g, up to and including Best Before Date 06/10/17 .

"More than 10,000 mourners yesterday paid their respects to a spiritual leader that led a campaign to build one of Britain's biggest mosques. Sufi Muhammed Abdullah Khan, a Sunni leader originally from Pakistan, was given the privilege of burial inside the place of worship he founded, the giant Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque in Birmingham. Following his death last Thursday, aged 92, tributes were paid to him as a spiritual leader, an inspiration, a good friend and a 'pillar of the community'. Spiritual leader: Sufi Muhammed Abdullah Khan who was buried yesterday in a huge service attended by 10,000 Muslims at the giant Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque in Small Heath, Birmingham . Paying respects: Crowds flock to touch Sufi Abdullah's coffin as it is carried to his final resting place. He was given the rare honour of burial inside the grounds of the mosque, which campaigned to build . After planning permission was secured seven years ago in preparation for his passing, Sufi Abdullah was laid to rest in a mausoleum inside the grounds of the Small Heath mosque. One of the largest mosques in Britain, the funeral nevertheless had worshippers and mourners spilling out of the door, with thousands paying their respects in the car park and a nearby community centre. Surrounding roads were jammed by the event, which mosque leaders said was attended by 10,000 people. At the end of the funeral service, crowds  flocked to catch a glimpse of Sufi Abdullah's coffin, chanting 'God is great' as it was carried to his burial place. Mosque chairman Raja Saleem Akhtar said: 'In every sense he was our guide, our leader and our friend. He built this up. He was working in a foundry six-days-a-week and in the community for the rest of the time.' Braving the cold: The Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Mosque is one the largest mosques in Britain, but funeral still had thousands of mourners paying their respects in the car park and a nearby community centre . Devotion: Surrounding roads were jammed by the event, which mosque leaders said was attended by 10,000 . Pillar of the community: Originally from Pakistan, Sufi Abdullah came to Britain in 1962 to help organise Muslim worship among the thousands of new arrivals to the Birmingham from the Indian subcontinent . A spokesperson for the mosque also said: 'Over 10,000 people attended from all over UK for the funeral of Sufi Muhammad Abdullah Khan Sahib which highlights a clear acceptance of the passing away of an important figure within Islam not only for Birmingham but the whole of UK and Europe. 'Thousands from the community came together united for this beautiful occasion to pay their respects for a man who has dedicated his whole life to serve others and the religion of Islam. 'Sufi Abdullah is a man of God whose sincerity and love are universally witnessed. 'The funeral of Sufi Abdullah was definitely a historic day. It was by God's will and bounty that Sufi Sahib's farewell from this world was a grand occasion.' Inside the mosque: Hundreds of men were crowded into the building to see Sufi Abdullah's funeral . Sufi Abdullah served in the British Indian Army during the Second World War, including years held by the Germans as a prisoner of war. Always devout, when he left the army in 1962 he accepted a mission to Birmingham to help newly arrived immigrants from the Indian subcontinent to organise their faith and proselytise in their new country. His name indicates that he was a follower of Sufism, Islam's mystical tradition. Followers of the philosophy, which is opposed by fundamentalist Muslims, believe they can become closer to God through ascetism, meditation, dance and prayer, as well as pilgrimages to the shrines of Sufi saints. Also described by followers as 'Hazrat', an honorific of high regard, Sufi Abdullah led the £4million fundraising campaign towards the cost of the mosque that has become his burial place. He was also instrumental in developing the neighbouring community centre and a nearby hostel for the homeless. Local councillor Zaker Choudhry said: 'We are proud of our founder, his wonderful work and his message of peace, love and harmony. He was a pillar of the community.'","Sufi Muhammed Abdullah Khan died last Thursday at the age of 92 .

"A mother had the chance to hear her dead son's heart beat inside the chest of the woman he saved with a transplant 18 years ago. Tears were flowing as Vicki Brannon, 56, and Jennifer Lentini, 31, finally met on Valentine's day at the Tampa International Airport. Brannon's son Matthew McIntyre was accidentally shot in the neck in 1996 when a handgun his friend was loading nearby suddenly went off. Vicki Brannon, 56, finally got to meet Jennifer Lentini, 31, who received the heart of Brannon's son during a transplant after he tragically died 18 years ago . Lentini tracked down Brannon and her family on Facebook and flew down for the reunion on Saturday, which was also National Donor Day. Friends helped fundraise the trip . The friend had found the gun in an unlocked cabinet at another teen's home. Matthew was just 14. His mother decided to donate his organs, and Lentini, who was then a 13-year-old suffering from heart muscle disease, was waiting for a transplant. Brannon said at the time she had been scared Lentini's transplant wouldn't be successful. 'If it didn't work, if she passed, I would go through another loss of my son,' Brannon told the New York Daily News. It was Lentini who found Brannon on Facebook and set up the reunion. The two had not had any contact since after the operation, when Brannon sent Lentini a letter and a photo of Matthew. Lentini was grateful that she finally had the chance to thank Brannon. She flew down from New York after friends helped fundraise the reunion, which happened on National Donor Day. Brannon said at the reunion that she felt like she had gained a daughter. During the reunion Lentini gave Brennan a necklace inscribed with her son's initials and called him her 'guardian angel'. Matthew died when he was 14 after a gun his friend was loading accidentally went off . 'I want her in my life and I think she wants the same,' she said. At one point during the reunion Brannon held her ear to Lentini's chest to listen to her son's heart beat once again. 'My Matthew is in there,' she said. Lentini, who was in the hospital for months while waiting for a donor, promised Brannon she was taking good care of herself to keep Matthew's heart beating. She said that, although there had been some lingering health concerns following the operation, she remains happy and healthy and makes sure to exercise and eat right. Lentini showed Brannon pictures of the time she spent in the hospital waiting for a new heart. She also gave the mother a necklace inscribed with Matthew's initials and called him her guardian angel. Brannon remembered her fun-loving boy, who had dreamed of becoming a policeman but ultimately saved another teenager instead. 'My son had a good, strong heart,' she said. 'And it has kept her alive.' On her Facebook page Lentini memoralized the date of her life-saving transplant, which occurred the day after Matthew was shot. It was Brannon who decided to donate her son's organs .","Vicki Brannon's son Matthew was just 14 when he was killed after a handgun accidentally went off while his friend was loading it .

"Horrific photographs have emerged of a surfer who was left with staples in his head after he was speared by an out-of-control board when he tried to catch a wave. The photograph, which shows a bloody head with deep scars,  has raised concerns and the dangers that could put lives at risk among the surfing community. The man, who refused to provide his name, went for a swim at one of Sydney's Northern Beaches when he was speared in the head by a 'runaway long-board' on Thursday morning. Australian surf website Swellnet editor Stuart Nettle, who reported the incident, told Daily Mail Australia it was only a matter of time before a disaster strikes. The unnamed man went for a swim at one of Sydney's Northern Beaches when he was speared in the head . 'These incidents come around a couple of times a year and it's met with the same reaction,' Mr Nettle said. 'It's the same reaction time and time again and it's a disbelief that people continue to not wear leg-ropes - it's not getting any closer to a solution to convince everyone to wear one.' When the same encounter happened to him, Mr Nettle said he was outraged and soon felt motivated to pledge for a law in a bid to ban surfers who avoid using the leg-rope from the water. 'I have met with a feller from Slater and Gordon Lawyers but he told me it was an extreme case that's impossible to sue because there's no legislation for it,' he said. 'Unless it's shown and proven in court that the incident was done deliberately but either that - it's not possible. 'It's a simple issue that could be fixed - I understand that surfers just want to retain that freedom where they don't wear leg-ropes but it would be good if a majority of them start acting responsibly. 'Just remember that you're not alone out there in the surf and it's easy to lose your board - and that could seriously hurt someone.' The incident comes after Craig Warren was smashed in the head with a wooden board last year (pictured) The incident comes three months after a Gold Coast surfer was smashed in the head with a wooden's 1960's-style Malibu surfboard when a swimmer refused to wear a leg rope in the water. Craig Warren was swimming with his children and some friends at Snappers Rocks in October last year when he noticed a long board flying at him 'like a missile'. 'I noticed the board coming at me like a missile when the guy fell off with no leg rope,' the 41-year-old told Daily Mail Australia. 'I tried to dodge it and I could have potentially got out of the way if I dived down but the water was too shallow. 'Those old school boards are very heavy and big and they could seriously cause death. 'I'm not being a grumpy old man but a classic example is – if my head was one of my kids or someone else's son or daughter, the outcome would be a lot different. 'The one that hit me had a reasonable size fin on it and it took a chunk out of my head.' The father of two was dragged back to shore by his nine-year-old son Taj and was bandaged on the spot by his friend before getting 23 stitches at the hospital.","Shocking photographs have emerged of a surfer who was hit with a board .

"Australian embassy officials will attend a Jakarta meeting on Monday where Indonesia will convey the formalities in its plan to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed to the meeting, which could mean the executions will take place this week. When Indonesia executed one Indonesian and five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with embassies, the announcement of the 72-hours notice and the executions all happened within the week. The meeting won't provide the date but it will discuss the provision of 72 hours notice, access to prisoners for family, and the conduct of foreign media coverage, a ministry spokesman says. This comes after Chan's parents Ken and Helen Chan left Bali on Sunday night in the knowledge that they're unlikely ever to see their son again. Scroll down for video . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali . Helen Chan (right), the mother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan walks with Australian Consul-General to Bali, Majell Hind (left) as they leave after visiting Andrew at the Kerobokan Prison in Bali on Sunday . Ken Chan (pictured) and his wife Margaret flew out of Bali on Sunday night in the knowledge that they're unlikely ever to see their son again . The couple, looking drawn and exhausted, boarded a flight to Sydney knowing only a miracle would now save him from execution. Earlier on Sunday the whole family spent time together inside Kerobokan prison for what was likely to be the last time. It was only the second time in the past decade that the Chan parents have sat down together with all their children - Andrew, brother Michael, two sisters and their spouses, the Courier Mail reported. Michael said both his parents were leaving Bali 'with a heavy heart' and that he could see the pain in their eyes as they left. He said that at least his mother was comforted by the fact that on Friday and Sunday the entire Chan family had been together and shared lunch in the jail. 'It was the first time we have actually sat down and had lunch with the whole family in nine years. (On Friday) I think it was Macca's but it was still lunch. That was a defining moment for them,' Michael said. Andrew Chan's brother Michael (pictured) said both his parents were leaving Bali 'with a heavy heart' Australian lawyer Julian McMahon (centre) leaves after visiting death-row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran at the Kerobokan Prison in Bali on Sunday . In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Michael revealed that despite the pain and agony his family were experiencing, moments of joy also shone through. 'We all want to leave him happy. He's been able to see his nephew, Kai,' Michael said. 'He's six months old and he's rapt about seeing him. 'Basically, it's the first time we got together as an extended family in nine years. It's been our first lunch together.' One of the Chan family's most cherished memories will be how several prisoners wrote to Indonesian president Joko Widodo offering to die in Chan's place. 'It has just been phenomenal,' said Michael. 'I know Andrew reflects on that and thinks it is a big thing. 'There are other people on death row, there are big issues in the world. But to know its on the forefront of everyone's mind at the moment - it makes them think 'wow'.' However, there's still hope of a late reprieve after it was alleged by the men's lawyers on Sunday night that the Indonesian judges who sentenced Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to death offered leniency in exchange for money. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . But the pair's lawyers will seek a meeting with Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo on Monday to ask for the executions to be delayed, pending further legal challenges. Their legal team has made a complaint with the Indonesian Judicial Commission, based on public comments by Chan and Sukumaran's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan. They have also challenged of the presidential decrees denying the men clemency without examining their cases or giving reasons. Mr Rifan last week alleged there had been 'interference' in the case that saw the Australians sentenced to death when they should have been jailed for life. Their complaint claims the judges in the original trial offered a more lenient sentence in exchange for cash. Mr Prasetyo says this round of executions takes more planning, because prisoners have to be transferred from various jails to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java. On Monday morning Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was not 'hugely optimistic' that their death sentences would be overturned. 'It is the eleventh hour, we haven't given up hope but I am not hugely optimistic,' Mr Abbott said on KIIS FM. 'We've just got to keep working as hard as we can. Every different angle we've got to try and that's what we're doing. 'They should never have done what they did, they certainly deserve to spend a very long time in jail but both of them seem to be reformed characters and they deserve time in jail they don't deserve death.' Authorities have permission to move Chan and Sukumaran from Bali's Kerobokan jail, and would like to do it 'as soon as possible'. Kerobokan prison governor Sudjonggo told reporters he is ready for the transfer 'any time, any day'. Sukumaran and Chan are expected to be taken to Nusa Kambangan, where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation . He said Chan and Sukumaran - who are considered leaders in the prison for their tireless work to help the rehabilitation and welfare of others - seemed somewhat resigned to the executions. 'They have surrendered even though there's still legal efforts going on,' he said on Sunday. 'When clemency is rejected, there's no other option, what else can we do? 'Let's just pray. Who knows, there can be miracles.' The Brisbane Times said that in an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside Kerobokan prison, Mr Rifan said he was prepared to 'take the heat' and provide the 'never revealed evidence' to Chan and Sukumaran's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' Mr Rifan said cryptically. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' Following his dramatic, if imprecise, comments, Mr Rifan left Indonesia to travel to Mecca for a religious pilgrimage. A general view shows the death island of Nusa Kambangan island, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed . But as the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty. While Australians Sukumaran and Chan face execution for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime. Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge. But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reported. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy . Indonesian police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan . Death-row prisoner Sukumaran's sister Brintha Sukumaran, left, and his mother Raji Sukumaran, right, have been visiting him every day . Andrew's mother Helen Chan arrives to visit her son at Kerobokan prison on Thursday . This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug. When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39. But while the Australians' judicial review was rejected, in Gunwan's casae it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax. His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution. The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran. Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . In this photo taken on August 17, 2010, convicted Australian drug smugglers Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) gesture as they sit inside Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers. 'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said. 'My plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas.'

"These pictures show the incredible sights in Kathmandu when 35,000 Nepalese gathered in a field outside Kathmandu to break a world record for the biggest human flag. The previous record for the largest human national flag stood at 28,957 participants and was set just six months ago at the National Hockey Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. The flag was ‘created’ by Sports Board Punjab. Anything Pakistan can do its near neighbour Nepal can go one better. Just over 700 miles separate Lahore from central Kathmandu in Nepal where today the flag record was comprehensively smashed. More than 35,000 gathered together today at the Tudikhel open ground to create the Nepalese flag. Nepal is the only country in the world whose flag is not rectangular. According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the rhododendron, the national flower. The flag's blue border signifies peace . Aerial view of the Nepalese national flag, formed by more than 35,000 people at the Tudikhel open ground in central Kathmandu .

"Twelve people were killed in an horrific spate of crashes this weekend as families hit the roads for the half-term holidays. Three men died when a double-decker coach carrying cheerleaders from Kent University collided with a broken down car on the hard shoulder on Saturday morning. The cheerleaders – who said they were ‘lucky to be alive’ - were travelling on the M1 to an event in Birmingham when the bus collided with the Audi A3 near Flitwick, Bedfordshire. Scroll down for video . Mr Reeves has been named locally as one of three men who died when a coach struck a car that was on the hard shoulder on the M1 at Flitwick, Bedfordshire, . In a separate accident just over an hour later, a 40 vehicle pile-up in thick fog on the M40 in Oxfordshire left one man dead and nearly 50 injured, and another person fighting for their life. The crashes, closing two of the main motorways for traffic heading north from London, caused chaos for thousands of half-term holidaymakers on Saturday. The collisions came as eight others were killed on Britain’s roads during the weekend’s deadly start to the half term holiday. On Friday, two men in their 20s died when the car they were travelling in slewed off the road on and slammed into a lamp post in Featherstone, Yorkshire. This is the scene on the M40 after up to 40 vehicles were involved in a mass pile-up near, Bicester, Oxfordshire yesterday. Another crash today, on the A511 near Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire has claimed two more lives . One man died, another suffered life-threatening injuries and  six were seriously injured in the M40 collision . A three-car collision on Saturday evening on the A11 near Attleborough, Norfolk left two women dead, while a crash between a minibus and a lorry on the A511 close to Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire yesterday (sun) morning killed two people. Two other people died in separate collisions on Britain’s roads yesterday. A pedestrian was killed on Sunday morning when he was knocked down by a lorry in a Bedfordshire bus station, while a woman in her 80s died in a two-car collision on the A1 in Northumberland. One of the three men killed in Saturday’s devastating M1 motorway crash was named locally as Nathan Reeves. The scene of the carnage on the M40 motorway near Bicester yesterday. An NHS emergency medical team ambulance was also involved in the crash . Nearly 50 others suffered minor injuries during the pile-up as many families were taking to the roads for the half-term holidays . Police investigating the crash on the M40 have described it as 'extraordinary' and said it's a 'serious blessing' that more people were not killed . Eyewitnesses who saw the aftermath of the collision described the northbound M40 as being 'utter carnage' Neighbours said the 23-year-old died just months after his cousin Shane Willett was killed as his car hit a house and burst into flames. Mr Reeves, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was on his way back from a night out in London with two friends in their 20s, thought to be from Milton Keynes. The driver - a man in his 50s from the capital - is thought to have been someone they met on their night out who gave them a lift home. As they sat in the blue Audi on the hard shoulder, the double-decker bus veered off the carriageway and slammed into their car. Police said it is too early to say whether fog would play a part in their investigation into the crash on the M40 . The mangled wreckage of a car is taken away after the M1 crash in which three men died . A double decker coach is towed away from the scene of the M1 accident in Bedfordshire . The diver of the coach, which was carrying 63 passengers – three young men and 60 women in their teens and early 20s - was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, but was later released on bail. Mr Reeves, one of his fellow passengers, and the driver died in the crash on the north-bound carriageway on the motorway, while the fourth man was taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford with severe head injuries. His condition was last night said to be critical, but stable. None of the cheerleading squad - Kent Cheer - who were being driven to the UK University Cheerleading Nationals at Birmingham’s Genting Arena, were injured. The team tweeted after the incident: ‘Thank you to everyone for your thoughtful messages, we’re all now safely back home. Everyone handled the situation amazingly.’ The fatal accidents happened on the M40 at Bicester, Oxfordshire, and the M1 in Flitwick, Bedfordshire . The clean-up of the M40 carriageway took several hours because of the large amount of debris . Two young men died when the car they were travelling in slewed off the road and slammed into a lamp post. The men, both aged in their 20s, were in an orange Ford Focus ST when it careered off the road on a bend in Featherstone, Yorkshire. The victims, both from the local area, were travelling from nearby Wakefield when the crash happened just before midnight on Friday. The double death was being probed by the Major Collision Team at West Yorkshire Police. Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'Inquiries remain ongoing today into what has clearly been a significant incident on the districts roads which has sadly resulted in two fatalities. Cheerleader Amy Hazerhurst added: ‘Today I am feeling very lucky to be alive’, while another of the team, Jessica Hart, wrote: ‘Not gonna [sic] lie, someone up there was definitely looking out for us today.’ AA president Edmund King said: ‘These multiple deaths have brought a tragic, sad and devastating start to the weekend and half term holidays on the roads. ‘Our thoughts go out to all those who have lost family and friends in these incidents. What should be a happy day has turned into a Valentines Day Massacre on the motorways. ‘We don’t know the exact reasons for the crashes but they are a timely reminder that even though motorways are our safest roads, when there are incidents, they can have fatal consequences.’ The large number of deaths at the weekend comes despite a halving in the number of fatalities on Britain’s roads, from 3,409 in 2000 to 1,713 in 2013. The M40 became a car park with motorists getting out of their cars after the M40 crash. The AA said the area was busy with traffic as families hit the roads for a getaway as schools are on their half-term break . Eye witnesses who saw the aftermath of the collision described it as a 'sea of metal' and 'utter carnage.' Pictured: Traffic chaos on the M40 . A decommissioned Boeing 747 jubo jet caused more travel misery for motorists as it crawled down  the motorway behind a police escort.

"A mother-of-two died of cancer because she used to welcome her shipyard worker father home from work each night with a hug, an inquest heard today. Annette Bhatti, who was just 49, also helped her ill mother to scrub her father’s work uniform by hand more than 40 years ago. They did not know at the time that they were breathing in deadly dust particles from his asbestos-ridden clothes. Day of celebration: Annette Bhatti on her wedding day (pictured with her husband, Bal, and bridesmaids) Mrs Bhatti, a housing officer, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June 2010. She married her long-term partner Bal Bhatti a month later. Just 18 months later, in December last year, she lost her battle with the lung disease at her home in Southampton, Hampshire. Her death has left her surviving father, now a pensioner, devastated and inconsolable. Mesothelioma is normally associated with people over 50 and more commonly among men who worked at shipyards. The mother-of-two, 49, was exposed to the asbestos dust fibres from birth until she moved out of home aged 18 . Mrs Bhatti’s father Lawrence Ramplee, now a pensioner, was exposed to asbestos while employed by Hills Construction in Eastleigh, Hampshire. He was later further exposed to asbestos during shifts at ship repairers Harland and Wolff at the city's docks when Annette was just a toddler. Mr Ramplee's jobs involved cutting up 10ft corrugated asbestos sheets by hand, coroner Keith Wiseman heard. His work clothing was worn home where Mrs Bhatti was ‘exposed to the dust fibres in the air’ at a very young age. She helped to wash his clothes because her mother was ill with lung disease. Mr Wiseman said: ‘The clothing worn during the week was taken home to be cleaned at home. ‘Somewhat tragically, Mr Ramplee recalls occasions giving his daughter a hug when he got home before he changed. ‘In later childhood Annette was often doing the laundry herself because her mother was not always entirely well. ‘The washing was done by hand so she was exposed to dust fibres in the air. 'This was from a very young age.’ He added: ‘There was never any warning about working with this particular substance. ‘One doesn't have to be working oneself in industry to die in this way. ‘Annette's exposure to the industrial disease occurred very much indirectly, when her father Mr Ramplee was employed from the mid 50s. ‘There was significant asbestos exposure during a long period of time. Speaking after the inquest, her . brother Stuart Ramplee said his sister ‘was so full of life’ and . travelled extensively the year she died, visiting Hong Kong, New York, . Australia, the Seychelles and Dubai. Celebration: The new Mrs Bhatti raises a toast on her wedding day, just one month after she was diagnosed with lung cancer . He said: ‘Her life was on the up. He (her father) totally blames himself and he has not been the same person ever since. ‘He is broken - absolutely devastated.’ Recording a verdict of death due to an industrial disease, Mr Wiseman said: 'The way in which events happened in this case is not in my experience uncommon, but perhaps it is uncommon for someone quite so young. 'It doesn't ever seem to happen in that way.' Her brother Stuart said despite her condition, Mrs Bhatti, whose daughters Luci and Rachel, are both in their 20s, ‘never complained’. Speaking at his wife’s funeral, which was attended by hundreds of people, Mr Bhatti praised her caring nature. He said: ‘Annette was someone who always put others ahead of herself. ‘Anyone that ever had the pleasure of meeting her instantly took her to their heart. ‘She leaves a void in our hearts that will never be filled and a legacy that will never be forgotten.’ Lawyers are hoping to secure compensation for Annette's family. Compensation for relatives of asbestos victims in 'landmark' ruling . Thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos-related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a 'landmark' insurance liability ruling . Thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos-related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a 'landmark' insurance liability ruling yesterday by the UK's highest court. The Supreme Court decided that liability was 'triggered' when employees were exposed to asbestos dust - not when symptoms of mesothelioma emerged sometimes decades later. Solicitors said the ruling meant that victims were covered by policies in place when asbestos fibres were inhaled - and employers' insurers would have to meet compensation claims. Families said they hoped that the decision by a panel of five Supreme Court justices in London would end years of litigation and lead to speedy insurance payouts. Judges said industrial diseases which could lie dormant for long periods raised 'peculiar' legal difficulties - and liability for deaths caused by mesothelioma, a 'hideous' and 'inevitably fatal' cancer of lung linings, had 'pre-occupied' courts in recent years. Union bosses and victims' families criticised insurance firms who fought the case - saying they should have accepted responsibility and spent money given to lawyers on compensation. One insurance firm involved in litigation said it had wanted 'resolution' of the liability issue in order to 'provide greater certainty'. 'This is a landmark ruling which will affect thousands of victims of asbestos,' said Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union. 'It is a disgrace that insurance companies went to such lengths to shirk their responsibilities. For callous insurers this means the responsibility holiday is over.' Manchester-based solicitor Carol Ann Hepworth, whose firm John Pickering and Partners represents hundreds of victims' families, said she hoped that claims would be quickly met by employers' insurers. She estimated that some payouts could top £100,000.","Annette Bhatti also scrubbed his work uniform by hand over 40 years ago .

"Faced with a sniffly date, most of us would think twice about locking lips. Yet a leading professor says a cold shouldn't get in the way of romance – because you can't catch one by kissing. This is despite the fact a survey has found 57 per cent of us would reject a first kiss with someone suffering from a case of the sniffles. Professor Ron Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, explained that the virus is spread through mucus, not saliva. When it comes to avoiding a cold, it's safer to give your partner a kiss than hold their hand, experts say . So while 86 per cent of us would prefer to hold hands with someone with a cold, according to the research, you're actually more likely to be infected that way – as fingers easily become contaminated, passing the virus to the nose and eye. The research, carried out by nasal decongestant Otrivine, found that a potential partner turning up on a date with a common cold is a major turn-off. Indeed, a fifth of us (21 per cent) would cancel a second romantic rendezvous if our date had turned up with the sniffles. Seeing a date wipe their nose on their sleeve is too much for four in five Brits (79 per cent), who would not go on a second date. Over half (59 per cent) also said eating with an open mouth was a turn off while coughing (34 per cent) and sneezing (32 per cent) were the top turns off for others. The study of 1,000 Brits also suggests females are more wary of falling ill. Women are less likely to kiss someone with a cold (70 per cent wouldn't compared to 44 per cent of men). A cautious fifth of us (22 per cent) wouldn't share a bed with a partner if they had a cold and 46 per cent wouldn't lock lips. Professor Eccles said: 'The common cold virus travels in the mucus from the respiratory system. A survey found 57 per cent of us would reject a first kiss with someone suffering from a cold (file photo) 'So unless you have a bad cough, and some of the respiratory mucus has made its way into your saliva, the cold virus will not be transmitted by kissing.' He added: 'The cold virus is transferred by contaminated fingers that pass the virus to the nose and eye. 'Your fingers can easily become contaminated with viruses by holding hands with someone who has coughed or sneezed into their hands, or by touching door handles in public places. 'You may then touch your nose or eye and infect yourself. Tears from the eye drain via a duct into the nasal cavity and when we touch our eyes with contaminated fingers we pass viruses into the nose. 'To spread the infection you need to have close and prolonged contact with other people, to cough or sneeze on them, or pass on secretions from your nose via your hands.' Gareth Coady, from Otrivine, said: 'The research demonstrates peoples lack of understanding surrounding the common cold. 'Many do not understand how cold and flu viruses are transferred, putting themselves at greater risk of catching a cold.'","More than half of people would reject a first kiss with someone with a cold .

"The Indonesian judges who sentenced Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to death offered leniency in exchange for money, the men's lawyers allege. The Bali Nine duo could be executed within the week, with a meeting on Monday to advise the Australian embassy of the formalities. But the pair's lawyers will seek a meeting with Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo on Monday to ask for the executions to be delayed, pending further legal challenges. The team has made a complaint with the Indonesian Judicial Commission, based on public comments by Chan and Sukumaran's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan. Scroll down for video . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali . Mr Rifan last week alleged there had been 'interference' in the case that saw the Australians sentenced to death when they should have been jailed for life. He then went overseas without detailing his allegations. However, their lawyers now allege the six judges who sentenced Chan and Sukumaran to death were 'willing to give a lighter sentence than the death penalty to (Chan and Sukumaran) if the (judges) were given a sum of money'. The Brisbane Times said that in an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside Kerobokan prison, Mr Rifan said he was prepared to 'take the heat' and provide the 'never revealed evidence' to Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' Mr Rifan said cryptically. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' Following his dramatic, if imprecise, comments, Mr Rifan left Indonesia to travel to Mecca for a religious pilgrimage. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . But as the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty. While Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime. Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge. But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reports. This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug. When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39. But while the Australians' judicial review were rejected, in Gunwan's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax. His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution. The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran who are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed. Sukumaran and Chan are expected to be taken to Nusa Kambangan, where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation . A general view shows the death island of Nusa Kambangan island, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed . From there they will be given 72 hours' notice of their execution by firing squad. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers. 'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said. 'My plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas.' Australia has not decided how it would respond to the executions, including whether to withdraw its ambassador, but Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph newspaper: 'We will find ways of making our displeasure known.' Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on Monday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers . A date for the executions won't be provided at the meeting, but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed, as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage. Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir says officials representing Ghana, France, the Philippines and Nigeria have also been summoned. When Indonesia executed five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before Attorney-General HM Prasetyo announced the execution date. That announcement signalled the 72-hour notice period. But in this case, the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over Indonesia to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java. Indonesian police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan . Authorities have permission to move Chan and Sukumaran from Bali's Kerobokan jail, but haven't set a date. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Friday suggested the depth of feeling in Australia is so strong that Australians may boycott Indonesia if the executions go ahead, but she denied that she was urging for a boycott. 'I knew that there was very deep concern in the Australian public about the likely executions of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan, and that Australians will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told Macquarie Radio on Saturday. Death-row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran's sister Brintha Sukumaran, left, and his mother Raji Sukumaran, right, have been visiting him every day . Andrew Chan mother's Helen Chan arrives to visit her son at Kerobokan prison on Thursday . Boycott calls were growing on social media before Ms Bishop's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions. Ms Bishop's opposition counterpart Tanya Plibersek told the Seven Network she didn't think this was helpful. 'I'm really not sure that boycotting Bali is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in Jakarta,' Ms Plibersek said. Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search. Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad. Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . In this photo taken on August 17, 2010, convicted Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran (L) and Andrew Chan (R) gesture as they sit inside Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali . Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday. 'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said 'no'. He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio. The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids. Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail. Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free. Officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from Kerobokan jail in Bali .","It's alleged judges in the case offered leniency in exchange for money .

"An amateur photographer was walking along the water with his family when he captured a ten-minute sea battle between a seal and its latest catch. Bob Ianson, 59, from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, was strolling at Ogden Point when he got a front row seat to the struggle between the predator and an octopus. The snapper, who owns a linen store, said that he originally thought the shapes in the water were two harbor seals before the hunter triumphed and showed off its prey. Amateur photographer Bob Ianson, 59, of Victoria, Canada, was walking along the water when he saw the seal and octopus . The seal, which regularly eats octopus, fought the cephalopod for an estimated ten minutes before finally defeating it . Mr Ianson said that the seal was probably about four and a half feet long. Giant Pacific Octopuses regularly weigh 50 pounds . 'The seal came up with this thing in its mouth, and it was almost as if he looked me in the eye, and presented it to me and said, 'Look what I have!' He was looking right at me,' he told Huffington Post. Mr Ianson estimates that the seal, which regularly eats octopus, is four and a half feet long. Giant Pacific Octopuses can regularly reach 50 pounds, according to the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. He said that the cephalopod put up a good fight against his attacker during a fight for survival that saw the pair dip down into the water for minutes at a time before resurfacing again. 'The third time he came back up, the octopus was wrapped around the seal ... The octopus literally had the entire head of the seal,' Mr Ianson said. A crowd of several dozen people gathered around the spectacle as the octopus put up a good fight in its struggle for survival . Mr Ianson says that the seal showed off its catch to the camera before disappearing down into the water with its prey . The fight ultimately drew in several dozen people as spectators in addition to Mr Ianson's wife Joan, daughter Jenn and grandson, according to CBC. However the seal eventually proved victorious chomping down on the eight-legged animal it chose for dinner. Mr Ianson said the marine mammal made a point of flashing his food to the camera. It is rare to catch a seal-octopus tussle in action, though another bystander in the fight Mr Ianson saw was able to capture the aftermath, the seal's meal, on video.

"A couple who had been trying for a baby for almost a decade are celebrating the birth of quadruplet girls following a pregnancy that made medical history. Doctors were stunned when four babies of the same sex developed after a single embryo was implanted in the pair’s first attempt at IVF. And after nine years of longing to start a family, proud parents Christine and Justin Clark suddenly have a rather substantial one. Christine and Justin Clark tried for a baby unsuccessfully for nine years before having quads Darcy, Caroline, Elisha and Alexis after IVF treatment . A single fertilised embryo was implanted - so doctors were stunned when four babies developed, and medics said it was unheard of for four children of the same sex to be born from a single embryo . The babies are now seven weeks old, . doing well in hospital and likely to be allowed to go home next month, . when the whirlwind of sleepless nights and feeding will kick in. Dr Geetha Venkat, Director of the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, told MailOnline that if the babies are all from the same IVF embryo then they will all be identical. She explained that if they are not identical then some of the babies must have been conceived naturally within a few days of the IVF embryo being implanted. She believes that the presence of two placentas makes this the more likely explanation. She said that in 20 years of working with IVF treatment she has never before come across quads being born following the implanting of just one embryo. She said: 'This is a very interesting case because it is very rare.' But the Clarks, from Rotherham, are . simply overjoyed at their luck – with the odds of having quads from one . embryo estimated at more than two million to one. The babies had a combined weight of . just over 10lb when they were born at the Jessop Hospital in Sheffield . on March 25. Darcy weighed 2lb, followed  by Caroline at 2lb 3oz, Elisha . at 2lb 14oz and Alexis at 3lb. Mr Clark, a lorry driver, said: ‘The girls are all doing well. Now we can’t wait to get them home.’ He added that the couple were on the verge of giving up hope of a baby when they decided to try IVF. Just one embryo was implanted – and Mrs Clark, 36, found out she was pregnant only three weeks later. An initial scan suggested triplets, . but a second revealed four babies. Mr Clark, 43, said: ‘It was very . emotional. We were happy, but worried about the logistics.’ The pregnancy also proved difficult as Mrs Clark, a nurse, suffered from extreme morning sickness. The babies weighed 10lb in total and were born when Mrs Clark was 30 weeks pregnant . The girls were born at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital, and are now being cared for in the special care baby unit at Rotherham Hospital, close to their parents' home . She was admitted to hospital at 24 . weeks because she was breathless, but doctors kept her stable until 30 . weeks before delivering the four babies by caesarean. Experts believe the single embryo split into three before one of these split again, resulting in qudruplets. The couple hope to take all four babies, who were born on March 25, home in June . Adel Shaker of CARE Sheffield, who . carried out the fertility treatment, said: ‘I have been working in IVF . for over 20 years and this is the first case I am aware of where a . single embryo transferred resulted in a quadruplet pregnancy. ‘Previous IVF quadruplets have seen babies from both sexes and were reported after transferring two embryos at least.’ Darcy was first born at 2.46pm weighing . 2lbs, Caroline followed also at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs 3oz, Elisha was . born at 2.47pm weighing 2lbs 14oz and the last was Alexis, born weighing . 3lbs at 2.48pm. Mr Clark, 43, said he and his wife . had been able to take the biggest, Alexis, out of the special unit and . added: ‘It was the first time either of us had pushed a pram.’ The parents said three weeks after the single embryo was implanted, a pregnancy test confirmed Mrs Clark was pregnant. The . 36-year-old said: ‘When we found out we were having four babies, I just . couldn’t believe it. I was speechless and to be honest, I didn’t . believe it until I saw them for myself.’ Mr . Clark said: ‘They are the first set of quads to be born from a single . embryo, which then split into three. One of these three then split into . two, to make twins. ‘On . the birth of the children there were two placentas so we’re not sure . yet if we have two babies and the twins, or triplets and a singleton. ‘Tests will have to be carried out when they are 10 to 12 weeks old to confirm this.’ During the pregnancy, Mrs Clark suffered from extreme morning sickness - known as hyperemesis gravidarum. She said: ‘When the news came out . about Kate Middleton, I knew exactly what she was going through. It . didn’t stop until 27 weeks and it was exhausting. ‘I felt sick all the time, and I was tired and lethargic. I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.’ At . 24 weeks, Mrs Clark was taken into hospital with breathlessness, but . doctors managed to keep the pregnancy under control until week 30, when . the girls were born by Caesarean section.","Christine and Justin Clark tried unsuccessfully for a baby for a decade .

"Brian Williams may be off the air, but it seems NBC's problems are far from over. Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits on Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title. Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8million viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6million by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week. Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq. Ratings for NBC's Nightly News dipped by double digits on Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title (pictured) Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8million viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6million by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week . Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place. Nightly News lost nearly 400,000 viewers on Wednesday to ABC's competing World News Tonight,  a complete reverse in the Nielsen numbers from just last week, according to Deadline. And only two weeks ago, NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams had more than 600,000 viewers than the ABC news program. World News Tonight has only beaten Nightly News 10 times in the ratings since September, when David Muir took over the anchor chair for Diane Sawyer, according to Mediaite. But early numbers show ABC also beat NBC this past Thursday, hinting at a possible reverse in their viewer fortune. Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension from NBC this week after he falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire in Iraq . The loss would be a huge blow to NBC, whose Today Show is already losing the daytime battle to ABC's Good Morning America. And the network's former star anchor's credibility only continues to be questioned as a number of his stories, including seeing a dead body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin Wall, are being investigated. Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast, reporting statements made by NBC chiefs before promising the audience 'we will work every night to be worthy of your trust'. In his statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: . 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. NBC chief executive Stephen Burke said the suspension was 'severe and appropriate', but a number of  viewers voiced their disappointment with the punishment on the Nightly News Facebook page . Many viewers said NBC should have given Williams a second chance. Others said they wouldn't be watching the show until Williams returned and wrote they'd switched the channel to ABC instead . Williams had removed himself from the show for several days before NBC decided to hand down their own punishment. At least one former NBC News employee, who spoke to The Daily Beast anonymously, was shocked at the severe discipline. 'I'm flabbergasted, to be honest,' they said. 'What NBC just did, by handing down this kind of six-month sentence, really prevents Brian from redeeming himself in any kind of expedient way.' And there are a number of Nightly News fans who seem to agree. When the network posted a photo of the stripped-down Nightly News logo on their Facebook and asked East Coast viewers to comment if they were watching, a number of users admitted to missing Williams and demanded his return. One user wrote the hashtag #BringBrianBack, which got over 400 likes. Another fan said: 'I like and respect Lester but am going through Brian Williams withdrawals. Give him a second chance. That's what we like here right? Redemption, second chances.' And one commenter wrote: 'See you in six months.' Williams, 55, had been the anchor for Nightly News for 10 years prior to his suspension. He has so far declined to comment on the incident since an on-air apology and is not allowed to make appearances without the approval of NBC. Weekend anchor Lester Holt (pictured) has temporarily taken Williams place. Nightly News lost nearly 400,000 viewers on Wednesday to ABC's  World News Tonight, a reverse of last week's Nielsen numbers . Scandal: The newest allegations are concerning for Williams (pictured arriving for his appearance on Letterman's show in 2013) who is already facing an investigation by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Berlin Wall, 1989 . Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Viewers dipped from 9.8m at beginning of week to 8.6m on Thursday .

"She's one of the world's most famously slender royals but it seems even Queen Letizia isn't averse to whittling down her curves with an illusion dress. The Spanish royal took to the stage at a Spanish cultural awards show wearing one of the famously slimming frocks, which work by tricking the eye with blocks of colour. Joined by husband King Felipe, 47, the mother-of-two was all smiles as she arrived at the El Pardo Palace for the event. Glamorous: Letizia wore a black and white illusion dress for the National Culture Awards in Madrid . Illusion: The colour blocking creates an optical illusion that results in a more slimline silhouette . Although the ceremony took place on Sunday, officially a day off for the busy Spanish royal couple, the pair were all smiles as they handed out certificates to those deemed to have made a significant contribution to Spain's cultural life over the last year. Both Letizia, a former journalist, and Felipe are famous for championing Spanish culture, with Letizia even flying to Vienna last October to open an exhibition dedicated to Diego Velázquez. Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Happy: The royal pair appeared to be on cheerful form, despite giving up a Sunday at home . Chic: Queen Letizia looked wonderful in her dress, while Felipe was dapper in a grey pinstripe suit . Supporters: The Spanish royal couple are enthusiastic champions of Spanish culture . On her travels: So enthused by Spanish culture is Letizia, she even travels abroad to promote it . The National Culture Awards came at the end of yet another busy week for the Spanish royal couple, who, on Thursday, attended an event celebrating a very different slice of Spanish culture - the wine. During their visit to Freixenet Winery in the village of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia in north-eastern Spain, the pair posed next to a barrel of Cava wine that they had autographed during a previous trip. Freixenet, a global leader in traditionally-made quality sparkling wines, is celebrating the 100-year anniversary of its first Cava (sparkling white or rose wine). The company is run by the same family that produced the first bottle one century ago, and remains a leader in exports, selling 150 million bottles in more than 140 countries all over the world. Guests at the event included Esperanza Aguirre - a Spanish politician and former President of Madrid - and the Peruvian writer, Mario Vargas Llosa. The style chameleon wore her hair up for a change, twisted into a low plaited bun, as she enjoyed a tipple with her husband and honorary president of Spanish winery Freixenet, Jose Luis Bone .

"He left his family to train with extremists in Syria. Now British jihadist Nasser Muthana has threatened to use his terror ‘skills’ when he returns to the UK. In a chilling online message, the 20-year-old unveiled a photograph of what is thought to be a collection of improvised explosive devices or IEDs. Underneath the image, he wrote: ‘So the UK is afraid I come back with the skills I’ve gained.’ Messages: Cardiff Jihadist Nasser Muthana has tweeted that the UK should be 'afraid' about the skills he has learned while fighting for ISIS should he return . Boastful: The Briton, who was planning to become a doctor, posted this picture of home made bombs . Violent: Muthana also tweeted a picture of a weapon that he hoped would help decapitate an enemy . He also wrote about decapitating his enemies alongside a  picture of a chain-like weapon. Muthana . was exposed as a  terrorist in training after he appeared in a . recruitment video for insurgent group ISIS, devastating the family he . left behind in Cardiff. Formerly . a prospective medical student, he was joined in Syria by his younger . brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die . fighting. The Muthana . brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from . Yemen as a teenager, are among an estimated 500 young men from  Britain . who have flown to Syria to join the rebels. Last . week, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said . Muslim communities in Britain were guilty of ‘complacency and passivity’ over the threat from home-grown jihadists.

The accompanying message says: ‘Look . what we found on this shi’i, glad tidings we’ll make sure his head is . detachable.’ Nasser describes himself as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State . of Iraq and Sham [ISIS]’ on the social networking site. His profile . explains his beliefs are based on ‘a book that guides and a sword that . supports it’. Yesterday, his devastated father Ahmed Muthana said: ‘This is not the son I know.

If they want to speak to me they can reach me but I’m not going to ask them to speak.’ Another of Mr Muthana’s four sons, Aseel, also spoke of his devotion to the ISIS cause. In . an online conversation with the makers of a BBC Wales documentary . broadcast last night, he claimed there were ‘loads’ of other men from . Britain who have joined the group.

"A University students' union has been forced to apologise after  using a Nazi SS victory symbol to advertise a German-themed drinking event. Dozens of students at Aberystwyth University complained after spotting the resemblance between the double lightning bolt on the Bierkeller advert and the Siegrune used by Hitler's bodyguard. University chiefs insisted the logo was accidentally used to separate Welsh and English text on the poster for the sold-out night and removed it from the Facebook event. Aberystwyth University has been forced to apologise after using a Nazi SS victory symbol to advertise a German-themed drinking event . But students branded the organisers 'insensitive and inappropriate' for using a poster which glorified the brutal fighting force responsible for the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity. Final year student Abi Leach said: 'I think it's highly insensitive, inappropriate and really stupid. Who thought that was a good idea?' Tom Reed said: 'Although undoubtedly an innocent mishap, an organisation which claims to be a professional establishment should not be making sloppy mistakes like that. 'I'm sure nobody was offended but they need to be more careful.' The Siegrune (pictured in a 1940 recruitment poster for the Waffen SS, a wing of the Nazi party) was a common symbol on Nazi uniforms and on Nazi flags . The event, which is due to take place next Friday, will feature a performance from oompah and lederhosen band The Amazing Bavarian Stompers. Not all students recognised the doublie lightning bolt as Nazi insignia. Nathan, a Politics student, said: 'The first time I saw it I just assumed it was lightening bolts to be honest, I didn't make a connection.' Anyay Davoren added: 'I feel a bit bad I didn't recognise it as insignia. I should have paid more attention in history.' The SS, or Schutzstaffel, expanded from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as Hitler's bodyguard, the Nazi Party's 'Protection Squadron' and a force fielding almost a million men. Heinrich Himmler (left) was appointed head of the SS in 1929 and was influential in Nazi Germany, a soldier (right) with a helmet bearing the Siegrune symbol . They were chosen to implement the 'Final Solution' and led the killing, torture and enslavement of more than 12 million people. Heinrich Himmler was appointed head of the SS in 1929 and persuaded Hitler to run the fighting force as a separate organisation . An Aberystwyth Student's Union spokesman said: 'We very much regret that this symbol appeared on a social media posting and can assure you that it was a genuine mistake that was simply used to separate the Welsh and English text, and was removed as soon as it came to our attention. 'This has not appeared on any of the official promotional material. We apologise for any offence caused.' A spokesman for Aberystwyth University insisted the logo was accidentally used to separate Welsh and English text on the poster . The SS used runic insignia on flags, uniforms and posters to promote Nazi  ideology. They also represented virtues seen as desirable in SS members, and were based on völkisch mystic Guido von List's Armanen runes,  loosely based on the historical runic alphabets. The Siegrune, which looked like a lightning bolt, symbolised victory for the elite fighting force. It was adapted into the emblem of the SS in 1933 by Walter Heck, a SS soldier. Heck's simple but striking device consisted of two sig runes drawn side by side like lightning bolts, and was soon adopted by all branches of the SS. As well as standing for the initials of the SS, it could be read as a rallying cry of 'Victory, Victory!'.","Poster for Bierkeller student night featured Nazi SS victory symbol .

"Our memories of the past can be distorted by powerful emotions and pain, according to research. Psychologists have found that giving small electric shocks to volunteers was enough to distort their memories of things they had seen in the past. The findings will increase concerns about the reliability of eyewitness accounts during court cases from people who have suffered traumatic experiences. The findings might help explain why people's memories of what they were doing on the days around 9/11 in 2001 are often distorted by the terrorist attacks that on the Twin Towers in New York (shown above) Brian Williams, the former NBC Nightly News anchor, also suggested his own memory may have been affected in a similar way while covering the war in Iraq in 2003 due to his fear at being in a warzone for the first time. Innocent people can be fooled into believing they have carried out a violent crime that never took place, a study has revealed. Psychologists found that during just three hours of interviews, adults could be convinced  they had perpetrated a theft, an assault, or even attacked somebody with a weapon when they were a teenager. Using suggestive memory-retrieval techniques, the researchers were able to trick 70 per cent of the participants into believing they had committed an offence. After hearing a false account of their teenage crime - peppered with true details of their life at that time - the participants appeared to ‘internalise’ the fabricated story. The effect was so strong that the participants ended up providing detailed descriptions of things that had never actually taken place. Last week he was suspended from his job by NBC for making false statements about being in a helicopter that was shot down during the conflict. Instead he was on an aircraft an hour behind and later spoke to those on board the helicopter that was shot down. The new research shows that our memories of a seemingly ordinary event can be altered should we experience a powerful emotion like fear in connection with similar events at a later date. Writing in the journal Nature, Professor Elizabeth Phelps, a psychologist at New York University who led the work, said: 'Humans and other animals continuously monitor the environment, accumulating countless details. 'Much of this information is forgotten. However, meaningful events can selectively preserve memory for previously encountered information that seemed insignificant at the time it was encoded. 'We found that memories for neutral information can be enhanced by a future emotional event that involves conceptually related material.' The researchers showed 120 volunteers a series of 60 images of animals and tools and were asked to classify each photograph into one of the two categories. Volunteers in the study were shown images of either animals or tools, like those shown on the left of the diagram above, and then later shown similar images where one category of pictures were associated with an electric shock. When asked to look at another set of images and say if they had seen them before, those similar to the animals or tools associated with the electric shock triggered much stronger recall after 24 hours . Brian Williams, above, claimed his memory of events in the Iraq war in 2003 may have been clouded by fear . Around five minutes later, they conducted a similar task but this time half of the volunteers 30 of the pictures were asociated with electric shocks in a form of fear condition. The volunteers were then asked asked to look at around 90 pictures and classify whether they had seen them before or not after either six hours or 24 hours. The researchers found that while there was no immediate difference in recollection between those that had received conditioning and those that had not, after 24 hours significant differences appeared. Images simlar to those that were paired with shocks were stronger than for objects not associated with shocks. The researchers suggest that sleep may an important role in altering these old memories. The findings suggest that traumatic events, like being a victim of crime, and emotions like fear can change our memories and seem to be be able to alter the way we remember things that happened in the past . The findings underline the importance for police to obtain witness statements as soon after an event as possible before memories have the potential to become distorted by emotion. It may also help to explain why people are often wildly wrong when they try to remember what they were doing during major and shocking events like the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in 2001. The researchers believe the mechanism may also play a role in the development of post-traumatic stress disorders. Professor Phelps said: 'These new findings highlight the highly adaptive nature of our memory system and suggest that our memories not only can travel back in time to retrieve events from the past, but that it can update past memories with important new information or details.'","Psychologists at New York University tested the memories of volunteers .
Some were given electric shocks to see how this would alter their memory .

"While most of the delta plain of the Mississippi River Delta is losing ground, new land is forming in Atchafalaya Bay at the mouths of the Wax Lake Outlet and the Atchafalaya River, these stunning images show. Geologists first noticed mud deposits building up in Atchafalaya Bay in the 1950s, but new land first rose above the water line in 1973 after a severe flood. Since then, both deltas have grown considerably. Move the slider to see the change . This pair of images reveal the change in the delta. The first, taken in 1984 shows an empty area, filled in by 2014 (right . This pair of false-colour satellite images illustrates the growth of the two deltas between 1984 (left) and 2014 (right). Both images were acquired by sensors aboard Landsat satellites. A combination of shortwave infrared, near infrared, and green light was used to accentuate differences between land and water. Water appears dark blue; vegetation is green; bare ground is pink. All of the images were acquired in autumn, when river discharge tends to be low. Vegetation appears slightly brown in 1984 because the image was acquired later in the year. According to one estimate by scientists from Louisiana State University (LSU), the Atchafalaya and Wax Lake Outlet deltas have combined to grow by 2.8 square kilometers (1 square mile) per year. This pair of false-color satellite images illustrates the growth of the two deltas between 1984 (left) and 2014 (right). Both images were acquired by sensors aboard Landsat satellites. A combination of shortwave infrared, near infrared, and green light was used to accentuate differences between land and water. Water appears dark blue; vegetation is green; bare ground is pink. All of the images were acquired in autumn, when river discharge tends to be low. Vegetation appears slightly brown in 1984 because the image was acquired later in the year. Use the image comparison tool to slide between the two images. The Atchafalaya is a distributary of the Mississippi River that connects to the 'Big Muddy' in south central Louisiana near Simmesport. Wax Lake Outlet, an artificial channel designed to reduce the severity of floods in Morgan City, delivers about 40 percent of the Atchafalaya's water into the bay about 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of where the main river empties. The deltas' rate of growth has varied considerably, mainly due to the timing of major floods and hurricanes. Floods transport large volumes of extra sediment to Atchafalaya Bay, while hurricanes redistribute sediment within the bay and transport it offshore into deeper waters. Hurricanes also destroy coastal vegetation that would otherwise protect land from erosion. The Atchafalaya delta has grown at a faster rate than its neighbor—about 1.6 (0.6 square miles) square kilometers per year, versus 1.2 square kilometers (0.46 square miles) per year for the Wax Lake delta. The difference is due to regular dredging and channel widening on the lower Atchafalaya, which delivers extra sediment to its delta. Due to the lack of dredging, Wax Lake delta is more natural in character, with a more symmetric, lobate shape. Aerial photograph of Atchafalaya Delta. Geologists first noticed mud deposits building up in Atchafalaya Bay in the 1950s, but new land first rose above the water line in 1973 after a severe flood. 'We are looking carefully at the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya deltas as models for building new land and preserving some of our coastal marshlands,' said Harry Roberts, director of the Coastal Studies Institute at LSU. 'If we start diverting significant portions of the water and sediment from the main channel of the Mississippi River into adjacent wetlands, lakes, and bays—as happens now in Atchafalaya Bay—we'll be taking an important first step toward saving a significant part of Louisiana's coastal plain.'

"Council boss Joanna Simons, 55, whose staff failed scores of girls abused by a sex grooming gang, is in line for a payoff worth nearly £600,000 . The council boss whose staff failed scores of girls abused by a sex grooming gang is in line for a payoff worth nearly £600,000. The bumper redundancy package for Joanna Simons has been drawn up on the eve of a scathing report into the paedophile scandal. Officials insist the 55-year-old chief executive is leaving Oxfordshire County Council for cost-cutting reasons. But there is anger from victims that the deal will allow Miss Simons to dodge any blame. Catastrophic failings by the police and social workers meant the abuse carried on for years. In a further development, the chief constable whose force will be lambasted in the same report has been promoted to a new £185,000 a year job. Sara Thornton will step down next month as head of Thames Valley Police – after eight years in charge – to lead the new National Police Chiefs Council. Like Miss Simons, the 52-year-old refused to resign two years ago despite the failings of her officers in the Oxford sex grooming case. Police failed to act even though victims had repeatedly told officers they'd been raped or abused. Staff at care homes would simply watch while the girls went missing at night with men. Five of the victims were even abused while in the care of social services. The Mail has learned the serious case review report out next month will highlight appalling blunders, including how: . A witness in the trial, who grew up in care with girls who were abused, said: 'The officers and officials did not protect us and now those who were in charge of them have walked out the door. 'They know that by walking out they haven't got to answer any questions. How are they able to take responsibility if they no longer work for them?' Sara Thornton will step down next month as head of Thames Valley Police – after eight years in charge . Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . Miss Simons is due to leave her £186,000-a-year role at the council in June with a £151,000 severance payment and a pension package worth £423,000. She has been in her post for ten years. Council documents say her severance payment is line with its redundancy policy, and the early payment of the pension is a contractual requirement. The way to stop sexual exploitation of children by gangs is to have more sex education in schools, the Deputy Children’s Commissioner said yesterday. Her report claimed the lessons should tell young people ‘how to negotiate sexual consent’ and it criticised ministers for failing to compel schools to put it on the curriculum. The report from Sue Berelowitz continued to insist that the men who exploit young women come from all ethnic backgrounds and suggested that most of the perpetrators are white. Her verdict came despite damning reports that found gangs of Pakistani men have been overwhelmingly behind the abduction and rape of girls in a series of English towns. The victim, who is now a mother of one, said the council should carry the most blame for the scandal, making Miss Simons' departure 'very suspicious'. She said Miss Thornton had apologised to her family in person on behalf of police, but she was still waiting for a proper apology from the council. Labour Oxford East MP Andrew Smith said the victims were 'let down terribly' and deserved a full explanation for why things went wrong. 'If the serious case review fails to do that, there will need to be a public enquiry,' he added. Thames Valley Police's investigation into the child sex ring led to an Old Bailey trial in 2013 which saw seven men being jailed for a total of 95 years for crimes including arranging child prostitution, sex trafficking and child rape. Three more men have since been convicted for child sex exploitation crimes linked to the case. A man was convicted last month of sexually exploiting girls in Oxford as far back as 1996. Citing 'data protection' laws, a council spokesman declined to say whether it had paid compensation to any victims. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Sara Thornton applied for the position of chair for the National Police Chiefs Council and was offered the position in November last year. 'Sara will take up her new post on April 1 when the NPCC formally replaces the Association of Chief Police Officers as the body responsible for influencing policing at a national level.' A similar abuse scandal in Rotherham has led to a string of senior resignations including that of former police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright, council leader Roger Stone and chief executive Martin Kimber. This month the entire council cabinet resigned when another report revealed the authority was 'not fit for purpose'. The report into the Oxford child sex ring scandal is expected to throw the book at police, social workers, teachers and NHS staff. The Crown Prosecution Service is also expected to be criticised. All the victims were known to social services and five were living in council care while they were repeatedly raped and sold for sex. Police and social services had several warnings about the activities of a group of men in Oxford as far back as 2006, including at least six complaints from victims. But no one linked the intelligence together and there were no successful prosecutions. Detectives now believe there could be more than 50 victims of the gang. One source, who has knowledge of the report due to be published in a fortnight, said: ‘It will make very uncomfortable reading for police and social services, who didn’t deal properly with out-of-control girls who were repeatedly abused. One of the victims went missing from a children’s home on more than 100 occasions, but police who picked her up on the streets did not ask questions or act on any suspicions.’ One private children’s home was charging Oxfordshire county council an average of £3,500 a week, yet two victims living there would go missing for days on end. Social workers at the home in Henley were told by a girl in 2006 that she was having sex in exchange for alcohol and she was also taking cocaine. Another girl told them she was having sex with men she was afraid of.","Council boss Joanna Simons, 55, in line for payoff worth nearly £600,000 .

"Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has refused to throw his support behind Prime Minister Tony Abbott over the sacking of chief whip Philip Ruddock on Friday. Appearing on QandA on the ABC on Monday evening Turnbull dubbed the move to get rid of the 'father of the house' a 'captains call' when asked by an audience member about the dumping of the iconic Liberal Party member. In response to the same questioner journalist and Today Show host Lisa Wilkinson ripped into the prime minister, slamming him for his 'laundry list' of personal goals distracting him from leading the country. Scroll down for video . Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull took a swipe at Prime Minister Tony Abbott while appearing on QandA on Monday evening . Lisa Wilkinson also took aim at Abbott over his broken promises and 'laundry list of own goals' Speaking about the turfing of Ruddock, the communications minister would not 'run a commentary on the prime minister's decisions', but admitted the chief whip's loss was felt deeply in the party. 'Philip Ruddock is the father of the house, which means he's been in parliament for over 40 years, he's the longest serving member of the house of representatives,' Turnbull said. 'He is well-loved, he is well-respected, he is esteemed by all of the Liberal party right across the country . 'Tony Abbott, as Philip said, it entitled to appoint and replace the chief whip as and when he wishes that's his call,' he added. But despite refusing to openly condemn the move by the prime minister, Turnbull seemed to smile as he called the move a 'captain's call'. Turnbull said Abbott's decision to dump 'father of the house' Philip Ruddock was a 'captain's call' but refused to give his personal opinion on the matter . He said he would leave it up to public opinion to determine whether it was the right or wrong decision . 'He's the boss, he's the captain he can make a captains call,' he said, which was met with a smirk from fellow panelist Lisa Wilkinson and laughter from the audience. 'Whether the decisions are right or wrong, time and public opinion no doubt and other events will determine. 'All I'm prepared to say about Philip Ruddock is what a fine man he is and I was very sad to see his services terminated in that role. Full stop,' Turnbull declared. Just moments before the communications minister's response, Lisa Wilkinson slammed Mr Abbot for his 'broken promises' and 'laundry list' of self-motivated goals. 'I think that problem that Tony Abbott has now is that there are so many own goals, I mean there's almost a laundry list now,'  Wilkinson began. Wilkinson admitted that though Abbott was good in opposition, but also pointed out his shortcomings and hypocrisies as leader of the nation . 'It's just been one thing after the other and then we've had silly mistakes, silly decisions like the knighting of Prince Phillip' she said . She gave credit to the prime minister for his 'very effective' operation as opposition leader, but the Today Show host also pointed out his shortcomings and hypocrisies as leader of the nation. 'One of the strongest messages he would come back with during our interviews was that Julia Gillard broke a promise we will not break promises,' Wilkinson said. '(But now) we've got broken promises: we've got no cuts to the pension, no cuts to the ABC or SBS, no cuts to education, the submarine contracts look like they've been broken', she continued, pointing out where the Liberal Party had failed in her opinion. 'It's just been one thing after the other and then we've had silly mistakes, silly decisions like the knighting of Prince Phillip. 'In terms of these own goals the prime minister even... he said that the question was not whether or not the Australian people thought that Prince Phillip getting that award was appropriate it's whether the award was appropriate,' she continued. Throughout the Today Show host's response, Turnbull did not jump to the defence of the prime minister which left many speculating on social media . Turnbull, here with Abbott last week, admitted during the program he was not consulted on the shafting of Ruddock, and he did not know who was spoken to about it before it happened . Calling the knighthoods awards that Abbott 'bought back from the dark ages' and also took aim at the way he was out of touch with the members of his own party. 'Tony Abbott only has to look in the mirror to see why he's having so many problems, and on the issue of Philip Ruddock I would have thought its's the prime minister's job to be in touch with his back bench,' she said. 'He couldn't have been reading a newspaper and he certainly couldn't have been talking to anyone in the backbench because we all knew ... everyone watching knew that he had real issues with the backbench . 'And 40 per cent of people who sit behind him don't want him there as leader,' Wilkinson concluded her scolding. Throughout the Today Show host's response, Turnbull did not jump to the defence of the prime minister which left many speculating on social media about his motives. A number of commenters pointed out his body language during the exchange, while others drew attention to his slight smirk as Wilkinson laid into Abbott.","Malcolm Turnbull took aim at the PM on QandA on Monday night .
