"Jose Mourinho has hailed the way Didier Drogba reunited with Chelsea's squad as being like he had 'been on a holiday'. The Ivorian striker joined up with his new - and old - teammates in Ljubljana on Chelsea's pre season tour and looked to fit right in, almost as if he had never left the club two years ago.

"Rowan Williams: The former Archbishop of Canterbury told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival he knew two clerics who were being held hostage by Islamists in the Middle East . Rowan Williams used a literary festival speech to raise the plight of two Christian archbishops kidnapped by Islamic extremists in Syria. The former Archbishop of Canterbury told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival he knew two clerics who were being held hostage in the Middle East. He spoke of them in a wide-ranging talk on 'Rights, Law and Religion', in which he insisted the West can't ignore the 'poisonous' effects of religious-inspired tyranny in the region. Lord Williams had been asked by a woman in his audience if it was not time for the Church of England and the country to speak out about what is happening to Christians in the Middle East. 'Five hundred Christians including women and children have been buried alive,' she said. 'They have been executed and thousands of Christians have been confined. 'Surely it is time we spoke up on that? It cannot suely be open season on Christians entirely yet?' Lord Williams replied: 'I couldn't agree more. 'Many have been speaking up and I hope more will. One of the dangers we face at the moment is the rise of a particular kind of religious tyranny in that region whose results both locally and globally are lessons for us all. 'We cannot turn our backs on that. I have people I know who are currently being held in the Middle East including two Bishops in Syria and I am waiting to find out their fate. 'It is not academic - I am glad there are people speaking out.' He did not name the pair, but he was apparently referring to Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church. Gunmen pulled the pair from their car and killed their driver in April last year while they were traveling outside the northern city of Aleppo. Bishop Tony Yazigi of the Damascus-based Greek Orthodox Church said at the time that the gunmen were believed to be Chechen fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra, a radical Islamist faction in the Syrian opposition. Such radicals have become increasingly influential among rebels, attacking Christians — a sizable minority in Syria who they see as infidels — partly as punishment for their support of President Bashar Assad. Assad's government has meanwhile sought to portray itself as a protector of religious minorities, expending much effort in defending Christian holy sites and villages. The quick rise of the so-called Islamic State, a Sunni insurgent group which has gained control of much of north-east Syria and northern Iraq, has helped the pariah regime to position itself as moderate and multicultural. Kidnapped: Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church, left, and Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church, right, were kidnapped by Islamist gunmen close to Aleppo, northern Syria, last year . War zone: Lord Willams was apparently referring to Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church who were snatched near Aleppo, pictured . Mr Williams, asked to compare IS with the evils committed in the past by the Christian church, admitted there could be such a thing as 'toxic religion'. Pointing out that most Muslims see IS as breaking cherished religious laws, he conceded that in Christian history, too, there had been 'horrendous periods, where human dignity in the fullest sense has been overruled.' 'Christians endorsed slavery at one time but then provided the arguments which overturned it,' he said. Lord Williams was also asked whether he believes it is right for the Church of England to continue to have a 'privileged position as an established church in a liberal State.' 'My sense of it is that I wouldn't start from here!' he said. ''But at the same time, here is where we are.' His instinct to calls for the Church to be dis-established was to be 'bloody minded,' he said. 'I am a bit inclined to drag my heels and say it is one of the things which allows society to say that the religious perspective still has a foot in the door,' he said. 'Other religious communities feel it allows them to have a foot in the door as well. 'There are people who feel that the Church of England bishops in the House of Lords are there on their behalf. Odd though it is, and quite irrational though it is, I am not in any hurry to get rid of it I must say!'","Former Archbishop of Canterbury spoke at Cheltenham Literature Festival .

"Leicester City survived an impressive Walsall comeback to win their friendly 3-2, and extend a victorious run that stretches back to April . Goals from Wes Morgan and Dave Nugent appeared to put the Premier League new boys firmly in control, but Walsall fought back. Mathieu Manset, a trialist at the club, got one back just before the break and Ashley Grimes drew them level shortly after. Dean Smith's men almost held on for a draw but a late Danny Drinkwater goal ensured Leicester won their seventh straight game in all competitions.

Backroom: Leicester coach Kevin Philips takes training before the their game against Walsall . Second: Dave Nugent celebrates with James Pearson after doubling Leicester's lead . Leicester named a strong side that included Dave Nugent and Marc Albrighton, and it soon paid off as they took the lead within ten minutes. Foxes captain Morgan met Albrighton's corner and his powerful header found the back of the net. Dave Nugent then produced the moment of the match as he used the outside of his boot to guide the ball in to the top corner from distance. After an impressive pre-season, Leicester sensed another victory but the hosts had other ideas. Goals either side of half time from Mathieu Manset and Ashley Grimes suggested the game was heading for draw. There was still time for one more twist, though, and it came courtesy of Drinkwater. The former Manchester United man shot from 25-yards and his effort sailed into the Walsall net. The victory capped a brilliant few days for Nigel Pearson, whose side beat Everton earlier in the week. Leicester have now won every game since they drew with Reading in their Championship game back in April. Assist: Marc Albrighton took the corner from which Wes Morgan opened the scoring .

"They slept, read books, went shopping at the supermarket and may have even gone on an excursion to the library together. The father of Michelle Levy, the 11-year-old North Bondi girl who went missing from the family's Glenayr Avenue home for 40 hours at the weekend, has revealed how his daughter spent her time on the run in the company of a stranger. But Adam Levy, 40, said the family still have little idea about the identity of the 50-year-old man who befriended Michelle and provided her with shelter. Scroll down for video . Michelle Levy, dressed in her uniform, went back to school on Tuesday after she was returned to her Bondi home. Her father has revealed what transpired during her 40 hours on the run . Adam Levy helps his daughter into the car as she heads to school on Tuesday . Mr Levy spoke to Daily Mail Australia outside the family home on Tuesday afternoon . The Year Five student spent two nights in a Randwick flat with the older man, who she met in Bondi Junction shortly after leaving her home on Saturday. Michelle was found 'safe and well' on Monday morning after the man got in contact with the charity Anglicare. The man has been questioned by police but he was not arrested and was released without charge. Mr Levy also revealed Michelle insisted on returning to her school, Woollahra Public School, 'really late' on Monday afternoon where she saw her best friends, who were pulled from class to greet her. Outside the family home, Mr Levy said that while he would like to thank the man who cared for his daughter, he did not know much about him and the family doubted the police would tell them his identity. 'We don't know who he is any more more than the media do and we haven't asked, and I doubt the police would tell us even if we did,' Mr Levy said. Police and paramedics visit the home of the man who provided shelter to 11-year-old runaway Michelle Levy . The visit to the man's home in Randwick, which is believed to be within a public housing block, was made due to concerns for his welfare . 'It's entirely up to him if he wishes to talk with us. 'We'd be very happy to do so and to thank him for looking after her, but he would have to initiate that contact.' Mr Levy said Michelle was taking the ordeal 'in her stride'. He said the keen bookworm spent most of Sunday with her new friend reading a book, before the pair headed to a local supermarket, where they were spotted. 'I didn't ask her (what she was reading) but she reads voraciously, so it would have been a book that he had - or maybe they went to the library,' he said. Mr Levy said his daughter had told him some details about the man 'but I'm not going to repeat those.' Police and paramedics were called to the man's Mulwarree Avenue home around midday on Tuesday out of concern for his welfare. Three police rescue officers and two paramedics attended the man's unit where Michelle Levy stayed . A Police Inspector said the man is 'not being investigated and would like to return to his normal life' 'He was concerned about media being out the front,' Inspector Steven Egbers said. 'He's not being investigated and would like to return to his normal life.' Mr Levy said he believed the stranger had suggested that Michelle return to her parents' home multiple times over the weekend, but his daughter refused. 'She obviously didn't want to come home on Saturday night and clearly she still didn't want to come home on Sunday. 'The side effect of being well taken care of... is that there's not much compulsion to (go) home for safe haven, if you're being so well treated.' 'Not that I would have it any other way of course!' 'By Monday morning (the man) had persuaded her to get in contact with us.' Ms Levy has a mobile phone but she did not take it with her when she fled the house. In addition, her phone battery was flat and she was out of credit. Michelle's mother Anne and brother Daniel helped out with the school run on Tuesday morning . Michelle Levy, 11, who went missing from her North Bondi home on Saturday night is pictured returning home to her family on Monday . When asked what his response was to many Australians who believed the whole ordeal was bizarre, Mr Levy told Daily Mail Australia: 'I mean if you're looking from the outside and you're not aware of any of the background circumstances it could look like any number of things.' Mr Levy has said that Michelle left the family home after he had got into an row with his daughter over a chocolate bar. Michelle appeared pleased while departing the family home to go to school on Tuesday morning. Mr Levy earlier described his daughter as 'chirpy' and said that she had run up to him and his wife Anne and 'given them a cuddle' when they were reunited. Mrs Levy said she was 'crying with joy' when she heard the good news and thanked the man who looked after her daughter.

Adam Levy  and his wife Anne pictured outside their Bondi home after learning that their 11-year-old daughter had been found . Michelle Levy, who went missing after a 'family dispute' on Saturday, was found at an unknown older man's home . After being reunited with her parents and brother, Michelle said she had missed her parents. But her brother cheekily replied: 'If you missed them why did you run away?' before quizzing her parents on whether she would be grounded. Mr Levy on Tuesday evening described revelations that he was charged with common assault on a young male earlier this month as 'frustrating'. He is expected to appear at Waverley Local Court on November 20. Mr Levy has pledged to fight the charges. Distraught parents Anne and Adam Levy gave a press conference at their home on Monday morning . This grainy image believed to show missing girl Michelle Levy, 11, emerged online on Sunday evening. It is said to have been taken outside Westfield Bondi Junction at 7pm Saturday, just half an hour after she left her home . Michelle's parents had made a number of appeals while searching for their daughter, saying that she should come home, was not in any trouble and had 'gone off in a sulk'. 'I wouldn't say she’s run away', Mr Levy said at the time. 'She has sat on the front wall of the property once or twice. I don't think she's ever intended to leave home completely'. He said he wanted to tell his daughter: 'We love you. Everyone is worried about you. 'We just want you to be safe with your family. Come home as soon as you can. Be in touch and we'll come and get you.' Michelle left her home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm on Saturday, was caught on CCTV near Westfield at Bondi Junction at 8pm on Saturday night, and was found at Randwick unit at 10.30am on Monday. Missing posters (left) have been plastered around Sydney's eastern suburbs.

"A doctor who snored terribly for years says he has cured the problem by performing surgery on his own tongue. Dr Zhang Xiangmin undertook the remarkable operation to help his long-suffering wife sleep. He believes his snoring was caused by obstructive sleep apnoea, where the throat closes repeatedly during the night. Dr Zhang Xiangmin performed surgery on his own tongue to try and stop his snoring problem . He said the experimental op was prompted by his desire for his long-suffering wife to get a good night's sleep . During the procedure, Dr Xiangmin inserted two thin pipes through tunnels he made on the back of his tongue. At night, the loops these pipes onto his teeth to stop his tongue from collapsing and causing him to snore . Snoring occurs when the airway is partially obstructed - the sound is generated by air rushing past the soft tissues in the throat. In severe cases, the airway can become completely blocked, stopping breathing for up to ten seconds, before the brain jolts the body awake, causing the airway to reopen. During his experimental procedure, Dr Xiangmin inserted two thin pipes through tunnels he made on the back of his tongue. At night, he loops these pipes onto his teeth to stop his tongue from collapsing and causing him to snore. Three months on, he has now declared the procedure a success. Speaking at a press conference in Changsha, the capital of China's Hunan Province, he said: . 'The surgery won't affect normal speaking and eating functions at all, and is very safe.' Obstructive sleep apnoea is a risk factor for a number of conditions, including heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, daytime fatigue and weight gain. One of the most successful treatments for the condition is a continuous positive airway pressure mask or CPAP, where mildly increased air pressure keeps the airways open during sleep. However, many people dislike wearing the mask, with some estimates suggesting that only half of sufferers with a CPAP device regularly use it. Dr Xiangmin believes his snoring was caused by obstructive sleep apnoea, where the throat closes repeatedly during the night. Snoring occurs when the airway is partially obstructed .

"With the impressive Manhattan skyline as his backdrop, Jack Wilshere is stood reflecting on his previous visit to America. Of course, we all know what happened the last time Wilshere was in the States. Las Vegas. Pool party. Smoking. Drinking. The infamous photographs from Wilshere’s boys’ trip to Sin City tells its own story. And speaking publicly for the first time since those unsightly snaps emerged, Wilshere is hugely repentant. ‘Of course, I regret it,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘I’ve been seen doing it before, I said then I made a mistake and I made a mistake again. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger say he is not too concerned about Wilshere . New leaf: Jack Wilshere says he will learn from his mistakes ahead of Arsenal's new season . Shame: Jack Wilshere was pictured smoking and drinking during a boy's trip to Las Vegas . ‘People make mistakes. I’m young, I’ll . learn from it. I realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids . growing up. I have kids myself and I don’t want them growing up to . think their dad smokes and it’s OK for a footballer to smoke because . it’s not. It’s unacceptable and I will accept the consequences and I . will move on.’ We have heard . it all before, though. When caught smoking outside a  London nightclub . in October, just days before a Premier League clash against West Brom, . Wilshere was again apologetic. At . the time, he insisted he was not a smoker and that there would be no . repeat of the episode. Nine months later, Wilshere is in the same boat, . making the same mistake, making the same apology.

Va va voom: Arsenal players chat with Gunners legend Thierry Henry at the Izod Centre, New Jersey . However, . there is a sincerity about the 22-year-old this time — a sense that he . truly has learned his lesson. Time, of course, will prove whether his . latest remorseful pleas are as empty as the ones he made last year. But . he is certainly going the right way about righting the wrongs of his . trip to Vegas. Wilshere . returned to pre-season training four days earlier than planned and — . ahead of Saturday night’s friendly against New York Red Bulls — he has been . at the forefront of the Arsenal’s promotional campaign as they look to . tap into the USA’s vast earning potential. Of course, a couple of drags . on a cigarette and a few glasses of champagne are unlikely to have a . huge effect on Wilshere’s fitness. But it is the fact he has put himself . in that position yet again that has infuriated manager Arsene Wenger, . who is a staunch anti-smoker. ‘This . whole thing does motivate me to try harder in training. It motivates me . to improve because a lot of  people start to talk about me —  people . who don’t know me but want to have an opinion and it is down to me to . let my feet do the talking,’ said Wilshere. ‘I came back early to show . people my commitment. I don’t like to talk about to it too much, but . this is a big season for me.’ Making the effort: England midfielder insists smoking incident has motivated him to work harder in training . Stalled: Jack Wilshere is no longer guaranteed a starting place in Arsenal's first XI . Enter the dragon: Aaron Ramsey (L) has established himself as Arsenal's first choice central midfielder . Indeed. This is perhaps the biggest season of Wilshere’s fledgling career. Once . hailed as the leader of  Arsenal’s next generation, the  England . international’s career has stuttered over the past 18 months. And . with Aaron Ramsey now established as the club’s premier central . midfielder, Wilshere is no longer a certain starter for Wenger. Injuries . have not helped Wilshere’s cause. But he is also honest enough to admit . that he must start shifting through the gears if he is to fulfil his . undoubted potential. The . £30million capture of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona will make it even . harder for Wilshere to secure a regular spot in the team next season. Committed: The Gunners schemer returned to training early in an effort build his pre-season fitness . Incoming: Jack Wilshere is excited by the arrivals of Mathieu Debuchy (L) and Alexis Sanchez (R) He . insists, however, that the club’s new talent — including France . right-back Mathieu Debuchy — will only serve to make the team and . himself stronger. ‘I think . over the past few seasons I’ve had a few injuries. I’ve got going, had . to stop and get going again,’ said Wilshere. ‘This season I’m looking to . have a really great pre-season and get a really good base of fitness . and take that into the season. ‘The . new signings will definitely give us a lift. It has been different this . summer. This year we’ve been really positive and gone into the  market . and got a couple of really great players.

"If you thought you had to stretch before and after exercise to prevent injury, then you wouldn't be alone. But this is just one of a number of common practices that actually don't do anything beneficial for your health. The top five physiotherapy myths have been publicly busted by the world's largest physiotherapy clinical research website, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database). Scroll down for video . Number one physiotherapy myth : 'the type of mattress you sleep on prevents back pain' Number two myth : 'stretching prevents injury and muscle soreness in recreational runner' Based at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, researchers have studied reports of more than 28,000 guidelines, trials and reviews. And surprisingly what are commonly known as effective practises, are actually misconceptions and have no hard evidence to back them up. 'The most amazing things are so common place,' PEDro manager Anne Moseley told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any recommendations are really based on best guesses or marketing rather than hard evidence. 'That's the thing with myths, the downside of following a myth is that you're wasting your time and money.' 1. The type of mattress you sleep on prevents back pain . 'We couldn't find any well conducted trials to evaluate this,' said Anne Moseley from PEDro . 2. Stretching prevents injury and muscle soreness in recreational runners . 'Stretching before and after a run makes no difference to injuries and muscle soreness' 3. You should wear a neck brace if you have a whiplash neck injury . 'If there is no fracture and just whiplash, research has found that wearing a brace is detrimental' 4. Ultrasound for the recovery of ankle sprains . 5. An incentive spirometer - a device which patients use to help them take deep breaths to prevent complications during upper abdominal surgery or cardiac surgery . 'Unnecessary treatments which can cost a considerable amount' Number one on the top list of physiotherapy myths is 'the type of mattress you sleep on prevents back pain'. Well sorry to all those people who went out and bought an expensive mattress to ease their aching backs, but it's most likely not helping. 'This is a surprising one. We did thorough research of the physiotherapy database, including the best quality research done and we couldn't find any well conducted trials to evaluate this,' said Ms Moseley. Number two on the list is 'stretching prevents injury and muscle soreness in recreational runners'. 'Really well conducted research shows stretching before and after a run makes no difference to injuries and muscle soreness. 'There is high quality research that there are other things you can do - agility training, co-ordination training, active warm ups, exercise related to the sport. Number three myth : 'you should wear a neck brace if you have a whiplash neck injury' Number four myth : 'Ultrasound enhances recovery after ankle sprains' 'There's a lot of myths that just seem common sense and are common for people, because it's usually something to do with your everyday life.' 'When people get used to it, they relate to it and with myths it's hard to change what happens in practice,' said Ms Moseley. Number three is 'you should wear a neck brace if you have a whiplash neck injury'. Just like Aussie model Miranda Kerr who was recently seen wearing a neck brace after a car accident she had in Los Angeles, people often believe this is the way to heal their body quicker, but in fact that's not the case. Anne Mosley says for those who suffer spinal fractures at accidents, it is completely necessary, but if there is no fracture and just whiplash, research has found that wearing a brace is detrimental. 'The best treatments are to stay active and use graded activity, to increase the amount of activity. 'Wearing a collar contradicts that.' Anne Moseley from PEDro (Physiotherapy evidence database) says research suggests wearing a neck brace after a whiplash injury can actually be detrimental to your health . Four and five are based on the use of gadgets that people have to pay for, which can sometimes be expensive. Ultrasound for the recovery of ankle sprains and an incentive spirometer - a device which patients use to help them take deep breaths to prevent complications during upper abdominal surgery or cardiac surgery -  are two unnecessary treatments which can cost a considerable amount. 'Research shows an incentive spirometer doesn't change complication rates, and it happens in hospitals across Australia everyday.' Ms Moseley says most of these findings will be interesting to Australians and some will debate what have been labelled myths. 'I suppose the best way to debate this is to look at the research - it rigorously removes personal opinion based on hard numbers, research done well.' 'We really value the physiotherapist database, it provides high level evidence to support these claims and having treatment guided by research is a great way to make decision about health care.'","Top five physio myths busted by world's largest physiotherapy clinical research group .

"Tyson Fury’s on-off grudge match with Dereck Chisora will be rescheduled for this autumn even though the giant Mancunian’s initial reaction to Saturday’s chaotic postponement was to wash his fists of the London rival he has defeated once already. Fury’s frustration with Chisora’s breaking of his left hand was understandable after David Haye’s twin-set of injury withdrawals had stalled his career for so long. But then Fury himself pulled out of Saturday’s rearranged clash with late replacement Alexander Ustinov when his uncle Hughie, his first trainer at the start of his career, fell suddenly and critically ill as an arterial blood-clot formed after a minor operation. Face off: Dereck Chisora (left) and Tyson Fury square up to one another ahead of their fight that was cancelled . And a contract is a contract, after all. Promoter Frank Warren is meeting with the fight family Fury this week to review potential dates. By then Chisora will have received specialist advice as to how soon he can resume sparring, hopefully with a view to fighting before the end of October. Warren says: ‘What has happened to Tyson’s uncle is terribly unfortunate but we have an agreement to get the fight back on as soon as he and Dereck are available. And it will still be the final eliminator for a world heavyweight title challenge to Wladimir Klitschko.’ Fury says some silly things at times and his belief that obscene tirades sell fights is mistaken but his devotion to the family ethos of the travelling community to which he belongs is genuine beyond question. Although he knew he would be an easy target for the twitter trolls if he pulled out of a fight after being so critical of Haye and Chisora for doing the same to him, Fury’s emotional concern for his uncle was paramount.

Beneath the lurid public persona lives an engaging 25-year-old lad who is so likeable that his outbursts always come as a surprise to those who have spent time in his company away from the spotlight. In private, his fierce ambition to become world heavyweight champion is informed by an intelligent thought process which would confound those who despair of his penchant for play-acting as the wild man. That is part of the dilemma for the British Boxing Board of Control as they prepare to rebuke him for the most vulgar and offensive of his recent outbursts, for which he has apologised. Nor would it be prudent to press ahead with a disciplinary hearing while his uncle remains in a coma in hospital. Fury has expressed resentment at being summoned to explain himself and threatens to switch his fights from Britain to Ireland, from where this Catholic family originally hails. Behind the scenes: Snap from Tyson Fury during a training session at his gym in Bolton . Persona: Fury is a different man away from the camera then the portrayal of him in public . But after only one bout in 15 months – an inconsequential one at that – and with another delay now upon him, Fury does have to be careful how he and his other uncle, Peter who is now his trainer, manage his career at this point. Fury’s core following comes from in and around Manchester and the big TV pay-nights are to be had in this country. Also, England is a stronger base from which to launch both a world title challenge and an assault on the US boxing market. Fury is racing Hatfield’s Billy Joe Saunders for the honour of becoming the first boxer of gypsy stock to win a world championship. Saunders won the European middleweight belt on the Fury-deprived bill in Manchester by stopping Italy’s Emanuele Blandamura and hopes to meet Chris Eubank Jnr in a world title eliminator next.The sooner Fury can get Chisora back in the ring, the better. Australian legend Jeff Fenech believes his protegee Lucas Browne can become his country’s first world heavyweight champion. Fenech, a three-division world title holder in his own right, bases that prediction on his first-hand experience of the comparative punching power between Browne and world champion heavyweight phenomenon Mike Tyson. Strong man: Lucas Browne is a powerful puncher, according to his trainer Jeff Fencher . Now Browne’s trainer, Fenech also worked . the pads and the corner for Iron Mike during some of his days as the . most feared fighter on the planet. Fenech says: ‘Holding the pads for Lucas hurts me more than Tyson did. Two of the present world heavyweight belt holders will be vulnerable to Lucas, who is really heavy-handed. It will be tremendous for Aussie boxing if he can make heavyweight history.’ The British boxing public will have a chance to evaluate that claim on Friday night under Ricky Hatton’s promotional banner. Browne is one of three Australians in the stable of the Manchester Hitman, who fancies the chances of his man from Down Under against either Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora. Hard hitting: Browne's punching power is comparable to that of a young Mike Tyson . Browne is taking on Ukrainian Andriy Rudenko in Wolverhampton for minor WBC and WBA belts.Victory would lift him higher up the queue  to challenge WBC heavyweight champion Bermane Stiverne or WBA ‘regular’ title holder Rusian Chagaev, both of whom Fenech is convinced he could beat. Browne is the chief supporting attraction on the Wolverhampton undercard for Frankie Gavin’s European welterweight title fight with the tough Leonard Bungu. Gavin-Bungu and Browne-Rudenko will be televised live Friday night on BoxNation . Some are calling him the Baby-Faced Assassin and he does bear quite a resemblance to Terry Spinks, our late 1956 Olympic gold medallist and former British featherweight champion. Others are talking of him as the middleweight Mike Tyson and 27 knock-outs in an undefeated 30-fight record strengthen that comparison. Gennady Golovkin is blazing a trail of destruction through his classic division, as his latest victim willingly testifies. Right hook: Gennady Golovkin punches Daniel Geale during the WBA/IBO middleweight championship . Winner: Golovkin celebrates after knocking Geale out at Madison Square Garden . Smiles: And he celebrates with his belts after the bout on Saturday night . Daniel Geale, himself a recent world champion, was blown away inside three rounds of their title fight in New York’s Madison Square Garden this Saturday night and promptly said: ‘I’ve never seen, let alone been hit by, a harder puncher in my life. The first time he lands on you comes as a shock.’ Thus Geale tacitly confirmed all the scary stories emanating from gyms in America of how Golovkin, despite using gloves like pillows, is flattening sparring partners almost twice his size and wearing head-guards. One report claims that in order to get some kind of sparring, the man from Kazakhstan often has to promise not to punch his opponents in the head. So he drops them with disembowelling body-shots, like the one which took out Anglo-Irish challenger Matthew Macklin around this time last year. Golovkin, at 32,  is coming to prominence late. First there was a 350-fight world-title-winning amateur career in which he lost only five times. Then the pros kept ducking him. Like Mike (and Terry): Golovkin has been compared with boxing legends Mike Tyson (left) and Terry Spinks . Challenger: He could be set for a fight with Miguel Cotto of Puerto Rico . But now the big money is getting behind him and the US television moguls are pressing Miguel Cotto to meet Golovkin in a battle to unify their various world 160 lb titles. The huge Puerto Rican support for Cotto in New York and the frenzy growing around Golovkin  would make for a mega-night in the mecca of the Garden. The middleweight Iron Mike? Golovkin has not only the punch but the chin to suggest he may well be. A split-second before he was knocked out Geale connected with his best punch of those three rounds, a peach of a right cross flush to the Kazakh jaw. Golovkin, without so much as a flinch, instantly delivered his concussive left-right combination. Then he grinned, as all the ring’s Baby-Faced Assassins have tended to do down the decades as they help their fallen prey to their feet. Golovkin smiles a lot. Rather like an innocent kid. Not unlike how we remember Terry Spinks. But then he has a lot to smile about. Like it being six years and 17 fights since he was taken the distance.","Tyson Fury bout with Dereck Chisora set to be rescheduled for the autumn .

On a bright, clear morning today, a bugle played the Last Post, as all were buried with full military honours. Referring to Private John Richmond, one of those buried, his great nephew, Barrie Richmond, said: 'I got this letter saying they matched the DNA, and Great Uncle John was one of the 58 in this trench in France.' Mr Richmond, from Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire, added: 'It was mind blowing and humbling.' Sue Raftree, of the Commemorations Team which finds descendants, said: 'DNA has made it much easier. We are rewarded by being able to identify more of our soldiers and to trace their families and give final closure.' The inscription on Pte Richmond's headstone reads: 'He fell and was lost but now he is found. Rest in peace at last. His life given so that we might be free.' Also buried was Pte William Butterworth, aged 36 when he died on 18 October 1914. He was one of four brothers killed in the war. His great-grandson Ian Birnie, who travelled to France for the ceremony, said: 'When he were told that it was William, it was almost as if we'd lost someone only yesterday.

"Manchester United winger Ashley Young said Louis van Gaal's new 3-4-3 formation worked 'perfectly' in the wake of their 7-0 win over LA Galaxy. Young, who scored two late goals in the win in Pasadena, also reserved special praise for man of the match Ander Herrera.

Speaking of £29million signing Herrera, who controlled the midfield all night long, Young added: 'He'll be happy with his performance and I'm sure the manager and staff will have also been delighted. 'It's not easy coming into the Man United side.

Subs: L Jones . Goal: Peterson 47 . Host commentator . So that's it from us. Thank you for following our live coverage of Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Brondby. Join us again soon! F/T: For Brendan Rodgers he'll certainly have a lot to take from this match. He may be concerned how his Reds performed sluggishly in the first-half but he will be encouraged by the performances of many of his young starlets this evening. Jordan Ibe was instrumental in their equaliser and was a constant menace to the Brondby defence when he came on. His efforts should have been rewarded with a goal of his own however, when through on goal but Rodgers should be pleased with how the teenager performed. F/T: And breathe... For a friendly that was entertaining stuff in the second half. Hasani's goal was taken beautifully - beating five or six men before slotting home in injury time. If Lionel Messi had scored that people would be eulogising that strike for some time. F/T: That's it in Denmark. The referee brings a close to an exciting second-half in Brondby as the hosts grab a late winner against Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers shouldn't be too disappointing with his young side though in their first pre-season fixture. Jordan Ibe - certainly one to watch for the Reds. 91 mins: Late drama in Denmark! Fehran Hasani weaves his way into the box before wrong-footing Ward in the Liverpool goal. An exciting end to a entertaining second-half. 90 mins: There will be three minutes of added time. 86 mins: As Liverpool did in the first-half, it's Brondby who look the stronger with the last few minutes of this pre-season to go. 81 mins: Brad Jones is replaced by Dan Ward in goal. 80 mins: Deja-vu for the hosts as they hit the bar again from a free-kick. This time it was substitute Hasani who sees his effort cannon back off the frame of Liverpool's goal from 25 yards. 79 mins: Big chance for Liverpool! The impressive Ibe beats the offside trap but hits a tame shot at Hradecky in the Brondby goal when through one-on-one. 77 mins: The hosts make a triple change as goalscorer Norgaard is replaced by Phiri while Holst and Durmisi are taken off for Almeback and Da Silva. 72 mins: Brondby make another substitution as Alexander Szymanowski is replaced by Ferhan Hasani. 70 mins: The saying of a tale of two halves is an understatement here in Denmark. Both sides are now pushing to take the lead. 64 mins: So close from Brondby again! Riza Durmisi sees his left-footed free-kick hit the crossbar from 25 yards out. 63 mins: Jordan Ibe is definitely one to watch for the future. The winger goes on another dribble before cutting in and having his shot saved. 61 mins: Mikkel Thygesen replaces Martin Albrechtsen, while Johan Elmander comes off for Jose Ariel Nunez. 59 mins: Whatever Brendan Rodgers said to his players has clearly worked with his his much changed team having come flying out of the traps so far. A complete contrast to the first-half. 55 mins: Close! Brondby nearly regain the lead when captain Thomas Kahlenberg see's his free kick narrowly go past the Liverpool post. 50 mins: He's only been on pitch for five minutes and youngster Ibe is causing the Brondby defence all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery. An impressive showing from the winger. 47 mins: What a response from Liverpool. Substitute Jordan Ibe makes a beautiful run down the left wing before pulling a cross back for Kristoffer Peterson tap home. Game on. The players have got underway here again in sunny Denmark. And as said Rodgers rings the changes with Flanagan, Allen, Ward, Skrtel, Wisdom all coming on. H/T: Brendan Rodgers will have mixed feelings going into the dressing room after that performance. Understandably Brondby have looked the stronger side but Liverpool increased the pressure towards the interval. Expect plenty of changes. H/T: Liverpool have started to look sharper in the last 10 minutes of the match, but trail at half-time to Norgaard's strike for Brondby. 45 mins: Chance! Borini comes close to equalising for the Reds but his low effort is saved brilliantly by Hradecky. 43 mins: Waste. Having said that, Borini wins a free-kick 35 yards from goal but all Coutinho can conjure is a poor effort that Hradecky easily gathers. 43 mins: The visitors have started to increase their tempo in the latter stages of the first-half. The Reds have a corner cleared by Elmander. 40 mins: Both sides are failing to worry each other in the opposing attacking thirds at the moment but this hasn't dulled the fans spirits inside the ground who haven't stopped singing. 34 mins: It's clear at the moment this is Liverpool's first pre-season game of the 2014/15 campaign. Rodgers' side look rusty in comparison to the much sharper Brondby - who look much more assured in possession. 29 mins: Liverpool produce their first clear-cut chance of the match with Jordan Rossiter and Coutinho both seeing their shots saved by Hradecky in quick succession. 26 mins: Brondby's goal was deserved in the early balance of play as the Reds were forced to make a change moments before the strike with Kevin Stewart replacing the injured Ilori. 23 mins: Christian Norgaard scores a scorching shot from 20 yards out that leaves Brad Jones scrambling. 21 mins: Big blow for Tiago Ilori who pulls up with a suspected hamstring injury. 15 mins: Liverpool have their first shot of the match with Suso firing from 25 yards which Hradecky tips away for a corner. 12 mins: Brondby have started the stronger of the two sides and cause the first real scare for Liverpool with Johan Elmander turning Agger inside the box but unable to fire a shot away. 9 mins: Brondby win the first corner of the match which is cleared by the visitors for a throw in. 6 mins: Brondby deliver a free kick into the box which is comfortably saved by Brad Jones. 3 mins: Coutinho puts Borini though but he fails to control the ball inside the Brondby box. We're underway. Players about to come out with Daniel Agger standing tall as he leads his side out for their first pre-season fixture of the season. Here's the stadium they're playing at. Daniel Agger captains Liverpool on his return to Brondby after eight and a half years away from the club. This was the friendly that was meant to happen after his move to the Reds . Starting XI: B Jones, Kelly, Ilori, Agger, Smith, Lucas, Rossiter, Coutinho, Suso, Borini, Teixeira.

A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity. Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy. Ms Krasojevic is an avid supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison. She explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer. Made of concrete, the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section. The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. The section will float within the external structure as the tide rushes through it. As tides are more predictable than solar energy, Ms Krasojevic has included a two-part turbine, which, reacting with waves, will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine. The second part of the turbine uses magnets that move along a copper wire, also generating electrical energy.","Cloud Citizen project, was designed by Urban Future Organisation, CR-design and Chalmers Technical University .

"A man from Florida who was sick of cars in his street being broken into decided to take things into his own hands by using zip-ties to cuff a couple of crooks that he caught. James Ridgewell from Orlando managed to catch two teenagers who had broken into his SUV and allegedly taken some of his belongings. He chased them down the street and when he eventually caught up with them he used a couple of the plastic ties that he had in his pocket, left over from work. Neighborhood watch: James Ridgewell from Orlando managed to catch two teenagers who had broken into his SUV and allegedly taken some of his belongings . Caught: Two teenagers were caught and then had their hands tied behind their back using zipties . 'I happened to have a couple in my pocket still from doing work earlier and just put them to use like I've seen on TV,' said Mr Ridgewell. Ridgewell was working on a boat on Wednesday afternoon, then went for a dinner cruise, only to return at night to find his belongings missing from his SUV. Pinned in: 18-year-old Dylan Boon (pictured) and a 16-year-old boy were caught and charged by police . 'Our doors were open and we got hit. I lost my iPad, iPhone, wallet and credit cards,' he said to WKMG. After searching for the culprits by driving up and down some nearby streets, he found the alleged duo pinned in at the end of a cul-de-sac. Mr Ridgewell said he then held them there, using zip-ties on their hands, until police and a K-9 deputy arrived. Officers arrested 18-year-old Dylan Boon and a 16-year-old boy. Ridgewell said while chasing the teens wasn't the safest thing to do, he'd do it again. 'It wasn't one of my smarter moves maybe, but at some point, we got to take the streets back too,' Mr Ridgewell said. Boon and the 16-year-old are charged with two counts of burglary. Boon was also being held without bail at the Volusia County Jail on a probation violation.

"A brilliant goal from Gareth Bale wasn't enough for Real Madrid as they lost on penalties after a 1-1 draw with Inter Milan in the International Champions Cup. The Welshman took just 10 minutes to open his pre-season account as he burst through Inter's midfield before unleashing a powerful left-footed effort which swerved beyond Samir Handanovic .

"Masters champion Bubba Watson complained about the number of people following his group inside the ropes but admitted he had only himself to blame for a four-over round of 76 at the 143rd Open Championship.

"On returning home from their two-and-half week tour of America, Louis van Gaal’s players will not be able to complain about a lack of opportunity to impress. As the new Manchester United manager continues to seek the best way to implement his favoured 3-5-2 formation, there are few tweaks, twists and turns that he is not prepared to try. On Tuesday night, for example, United began this game against Inter Milan at FedExField with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck up front. They ended it with Nani and Wilfried Zaha playing in those positions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal looking for defensive reinforcements .

Booked: Andreolli . Attendance: 61, 238 . Ashley Young, meanwhile, played at . both left and right wing-back as the night progressed while Luke Shaw – . declared unfit for purpose just 24 hours ago – was given a surprise . outing on the left during the second half. It . didn’t add up to much in the end. United were the more progressive team . against an Italian side that included their former captain Nemanja . Vidic and created the better chances. They couldn’t score, though, and . eventually won courtesy of an immaculate penalty shootout. With . Young, Javier Hernandez, Tom Cleverley, Shinji Kagawa and Darren . Fletcher making it a perfect shootout for United, Inter were overcome . after Marco Andreolli smacked his team’s fourth kick against . the crossbar. Van Gaal and . his players were perhaps vindicated for thoroughness of their . preparation. In each of their open training sessions on this tour, they . have practised penalties. In . the United coach’s mind, however, none of this will really matter. One . gets the feeling that the Dutch veteran is simply answering questions . in his head about his players as he goes along. As . he explained here on Monday night, there are certain players who are . going to have to adapt if they are fit his system. He has decided, for . example, that Nani, Young and the much-maligned Zaha cannot function at . wing-back. The only chance they will have of making his team, therefore, . will be at centre forward. Too many men: Wilfried Zaha shoots as Inter players close in during his first appearance under Louis van Gaal . Elusive: Shinji Kagawa escapes the attentions of Juan Jesus as he looked to take over the midfield . Clean sheet: David de Gea makes a save to keep the score at 0-0 at the FedExField . Thank you Vidic: United fans in the States send their best wishes to their captain who left during the summer . Eyes on the ball: Ashley Young wins his header in front of Inter defender Danilo D'Ambrosio . Clamber: Chris Smalling goes for the ball by climbing over Inter's Mauro Icardi . Trip: Icardi goes down under challenge from Herrera during the first period . Getting fitter: Luke Shaw rides a challenge as he completed 45 minutes for United . Watchful eye: Former United captain Vidic watches on as Kagawa and Shaw escape with the ball . It . would appear unlikely that any of them will in the long-term, of . course, but at least they are being handed their auditions by their new . manager. Here in Maryland, . Young actually did quite well. There was more energy about his play than . we are used to seeing. Nani and Zaha – on the other hand – were rather . more fitful, even if the former did come close with a couple of low . shots in the second half and the latter had a penalty appeal turned . down. Certainly, United maybe should have won. After . a slow start that was noticeable only for a diving heard from a corner . by Phil Jones that was saved low to his left by Samir Handanovic, United . grew in to the game and began to threaten on the back of some effective . midfield passing between Juan Mata and Ander Herrera in particular. Wayne . Rooney curled one shot over the crossbar from 20 yards while a 22-pass . move from United in the 38th minute almost created a chance only for . Mata’s low cross from the right to be cut out by a defender. Good viewing, Louis? Van Gaal watches while Ryan Giggs laughs after Fletcher's winning penalty .

Mata himself then drove a shot wide from 18 yards before Van Gaal made his changes at half-time. Certainly . the introduction of Shaw was peculiar. The 19-year-old defender was . training here on the pitch with United fitness coach Tony Strudwick in . the hours leading up to the game and wasn’t even listed as a substitute . at kick-off by United’s own website. However, he was thrown on at half-time and went on to do reasonably well. Zaha . certainly looked keen as he tried to make the most of his first . opportunity on tour and one run down the left in the 55th minute left . two defenders floundering before Vidic of all people made ground from a . central position to take the ball from his toe. The . Serbian defender was also on hand to intervene when a low Young cross . was about to cause problems and the more Vidic went about his business . here, the harder it was not to think he would have fitted in quite . well in Van Gaal’s new three-man defence. As . it was, both Zaha and Tom Cleverley both could have been given . penalties late on before United substitute goalkeeper David de Gea was . called in to action with a few minutes left, diving to his left to . spectacularly touch away a free-kick from Inter midfielder Fredy .

"It has emerged that ECB chief executive David Collier jumped before he was pushed out of English cricket’s top administrative job. The ECB announced at the weekend that Collier, who has led the organisation for a decade, will retire at the end of the season. But his decision to quit, which was accepted at a meeting last week — the start of which was not open to executive staff — followed serious pressure from the counties for a change of outlook and personnel at the top. Standing down: David Collier has decided to quit his role as the ECB's chief executive . The counties, with ECB board members Colin Graves (Yorkshire) and Richard Thompson (Surrey) understood to be the most powerful voices, have not been happy for some time about the distribution of money from the ECB and the huge costs involved in staging international cricket. There were also concerns about the size of the £40million pot of cash the ECB are holding in case of disruption to Test series, while the recent appointment of Gordon Hollins as chief operating officer was seen as a move pushed by the counties for better liaison with the ECB. So Collier, who has been spending an increasing amount of his time on ICC business, opted for retirement and some likely lucrative consultancy roles rather than a fight with his board to remain at the helm. Surrey’s Richard Gould, son of former Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould, is strong favourite to replace him but he also has ambitions to become a football club chief executive. Many people will now hope that the ECB’s autocratic chairman Giles Clarke will follow Collier through the exit door. But Clarke has every intention of standing for election next year. Name in the frame: Surrey's Richard Gould is favourite to takeover at the helm . American captain Tom Watson invited the top 20 players in the US Ryder Cup rankings on a reconnaissance mission last week to Gleneagles ahead of the match in September.

Hot water: Ray Whelan has handed himself in to police . Ray Whelan, the British businessman implicated in an investigation into the illegal resale of World Cup tickets, had been acting as a sports advisor to the Government. Whelan sat on a committee for a number of years that advised the UK Trade and Investment department on sporting events. He stood down when his work for Match Services preparing for the World Cup in Brazil started to take an increasing amount of his time. Match insist Whelan, who has been recorded negotiating VIP hospitality package sales to renowned Algerian ticket tout Lamine Fofana, has done nothing untoward. Speaking out: Team Sky's David Brailsford . Team Sky cycling chief Sir David Brailsford has pin-pointed the main reason for England’s chronic problems at international football. The relationship between the Premier League and the FA is dysfunctional, he told the BBC’s Sportsweek, whereas the German Federation and the Bundesliga work as one. A significant proportion of blame has to go to Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore for the way he confronts the FA at every opportunity, although his many acolytes will no doubt say differently.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has hinted for the first time that he is keen to bring Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman to the club. Roma coach Rudi Garcia – who faces Van Gaal and United here in America this afternoon – said on Friday that the Dutch international would not be leaving Italy. However, Van Gaal said at his press conference on Saturday morning that he will wait for Strootman to recover from ligament surgery before deciding whether to make a bid. VIDEO Scroll down to watch The goals showing why Louis van Gaal wants Kevin Strootman .

Making his mark: Louis van Gaal (right) is overhauling United's squad and may move for Strootman . He said: 'I never usually say anything about individual players.

It is not easy to say how he comes back from injury, but we will wait and see.' Van Gaal conducted an open training session at Denver Broncos’ Sports Authority Field on Saturday. This time there were none of the histrionics that were a feature of training in Los Angeles earlier in the week but the 62-year-old’s hands-on approach was once again clear.

He said: 'The important thing is that I am training the players not in the legs, but in their brain. Brainpower. That is important thing. I say things how they are, it is my direct character.

"The BBC has gagged a string of female presenters and producers after forcing them out because of their age, one of its former stars has sensationally claimed. Former Countryfile host Miriam O’Reilly said she has been ‘inundated’ by calls from women who said they had been subjected to misogyny at the BBC, but were stopped from speaking out. She revealed details of anonymous statements from former employees, including one she said was a ‘household name’. Former Countryfile host Miriam O’Reilly (pictured) said she has been ‘inundated’ by calls from women who said they had been subjected to misogyny at the BBC, but were stopped from speaking out . One of the women said female colleagues were routinely sidelined as they became older, were made to feel unwanted, and were nicknamed ‘battle-axe’ and ‘matron’. Another said her editor ignored her in favour of her younger, prettier female colleague while a third said she felt ‘crushed’ after being forced out of the corporation. Miss O’Reilly, 57, said none of the women were able to speak out for themselves because they had been persuaded to sign redundancy agreements that included draconian gagging clauses. The former presenter successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination in 2011 after she was dropped from Countryfile to help it attract a younger primetime audience. She claimed she has since been ‘blacklisted’ from working at the corporation ever again. Miss O’Reilly made her dramatic claims at a hearing of the House of Lords Communications Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the shortage of women in the media. She read out seven statements to support her claim that the BBC fosters a ‘macho’ working environment. She said all of the women were aged over 50 and had worked in BBC news or current affairs. The first, who worked for years in Panorama and Newsnight and who was in her late 50s when she left, wrote to her saying women at the BBC were ‘ignored as they get older, sidelined, offered broken promises, made to feel unwanted and invisible.’ Miriam O’Reilly successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination in 2011 after she was dropped from Countryfile to help it attract a younger primetime audience . She added: ‘The men continue to function as normal, permitted to be ugly, grisly, fat, old and peculiar. They can be naughty, childlike, outspoken, opinionated and rule-breaking, but not the women.’ Another added: ‘You know it’s over when the editor starts looking at the pretty young thing next to you, listening to her opinion and ignoring yours.’ Miss O’Reilly said a further woman, who was a household name, contacted her after her tribunal case to say she too had been forced out. But two weeks after accepting redundancy, a producer called the woman to ask for her invaluable contacts, saying: ‘We can’t do it without you’. Miss O’Reilly said: ‘That particular letter is heart-breaking. She was a very, very strong woman but she was broken down over time to the point where she wanted to go.’ Another, also aged over 50, told her: ‘In the end I decided to accept the redundancy. I simply ran out of the will to fight it.’ Miss O’Reilly claimed the redundancy packages included gagging clauses that have prevented any of the women speaking out about their mistreatment until now. She added: ‘I’ve never signed one. I’ve refused to sign one, and that’s why I’m always speaking out.’ A spokesman said: ‘We don’t recognise the picture painted at the Select Committee. 'As we explained to the committee last week nearly half of the BBC’s news and current affairs workforce is female with 37.3 per cent in leadership positions in network news and 35.1 per cent in global news, and we have a large number of on-air and management positions filled by women in news.’","Miriam O'Reilly reveals details of statements from former BBC employees .

"England's David Horsey recovered from a front-nine collapse to force a play-off against Damien McGrane before pushing on to victory at the Russian Open. The 29-year-old from Alderley Edge shared the overnight lead with Peter Whiteford heading into the final round at the Tseleevo Golf and Polo Club in Moscow, but both men tumbled out of the top spots while McGrane was cutting through the pack with seven birdies. The Irishman looked set to beat Scott Jamieson, who finished 12 under for the tournament, by two strokes, yet he bogeyed the 18th as Horsey found a birdie and an eagle in his last four holes.

McGrane found the greenside bunker on 18 before missing his putt from 10 feet, and Horsey duly wrapped up his third European Tour win by two-putting for the win. Horsey, who carded 72 on Sunday, admitted he thought he had let the prize money slip through his fingers before realising he could still triumph before nailing an eagle on the par-five 17th. After winning his first trophy since 2011, he told Sky Sports 4: 'Relieved is the word that sums it up.

Hampshire's Sam Hutsby finished particularly strongly in the Russian capital, the 25-year-old signing for a four-under 68 to take fourth place ahead of Whiteford, whose three-over final round saw him mix four bogeys with a birdie on 17. Krister Eriksson of Sweden and Belgium's Thomas Pieters were tied for sixth place at nine under for the tournament while Italy's Andrea Pavan could not build on his Saturday score of 64, instead coming back to the clubhouse in 72 to take a share of eighth place with Maximilian Kieffer of Germany.","David Horsey has won the Russian Open in Moscow .

"A drunk Briton who threatened to kill an air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed. The 42-year-old, named only as A M, was eating food off the floor of an Emirates flight from London to Dubai when he started to throw his meal at other passengers and verbally abuse the staff. Dubai Criminal Court has ordered a medical committee to examine the man after his outburst on the flight in June during which he told a female flight attendant that she was a 'sex slave'. A British man who threatened to kill an Emirates air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed . The defendant began drinking shortly before take-off and continued 20 minutes into the journey, the court heard. Indian flight attendant, 30, known only as B S, said: 'He was eating and throwing away food on the floor, then eating off the floor. 'I went to him and asked him to return to his seat and have his meal there. I then brought a garbage bag and started picking up the food he threw away. 'He also threw food on passengers around him and jumped from his seat to the aisle and started making a mess. Some passengers asked to change seats from near him.' A Dubai court was told that the threat was made by the 40-year-old, named only as A M, amid several outbursts of verbal abuse directed at cabin staff and unseemly behaviour that included throwing food at other passengers . As she cleaned up after him, B S said the defendant aggressively pulled her shirt. When she asked him to stop touching her, he got up from his seat and began a torrent of insults. 'He stood up and told me I was trash, a sex slave and a b****,' she said, adding that the Briton also insulted some of her colleagues. He then threatened to slap B S, kill her and chop her up if she did not give him more alcohol. Fellow flight attendant, E M, 26, from Egypt said: 'I was ordered to attend to the problem and, when I did, I saw him jumping on his seat and pulling B S from her shirt, then insulting her with very bad words.' He proceeded to the toilet where he lit a cigarette, setting off the fire alarm and scaring his fellow passengers, the court heard. The unruly passenger fell asleep shortly before the plane landed in Dubai, and then started to also insult the waiting police, court records showed. He denied all the charges against him, including one of illegal consumption of alcohol. The court was due to issue a verdict on Wednesday morning but instead ordered the mental health check.

"1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 2. Valtteri Bottas (Williams) 3. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 4. Sebastien Vettel (Red Bull) 5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) Nico Rosberg completed the week of his life with victory in the German Grand Prix on a day when Lewis Hamilton produced a backs-to-the-wall drive to limit the damage to his team-mate and title rival. From 20th on the grid at Hockenheim, following a qualifying crash and five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change due to the damage sustained, 29-year-old Hamilton was third in his Mercedes behind Williams' Valtteri Bottas. Rosberg's triumph was the first for Mercedes on home soil since 1954, with five-times champion Juan Manuel Fangio taking the chequered flag that day. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some great videos of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton . Celebrate: Nico Rosberg sprays champagne after winning the German Grand Prix on Sunday . Nice to be back: Rosberg (front) Mercedes won the German Grand Prix on home soil . Married nine days ago, Rosberg then watched Germany win the World Cup final before signing a new long-term contract earlier this week, and has now recorded a lights-to-flag success in front of his own fans. All the action unfolded behind him, with the spotlight on Hamilton given his lowly grid position in the wake of a smash in the first part of qualifying following a front-right brake disc failure. Initally 15th for the start, Mercedes announced the gearbox change and subsequent penalty on Sunday morning ahead of the race, leaving him down in 20th and with a mountain to climb to even clamber onto the podium. But Hamilton produced a rousing performance, limiting the damage as best as possible with third, with the gap to Rosberg now 14 points. Over the opening laps it was captivating stuff from Hamilton, the kind of situation on which he loves and thrives.

Just 10 seconds into the race he received one helping hand when, for the second consecutive race, Williams' Felipe Massa was involved in an accident that brought his grand prix to a swift conclusion. Unlike at the British Grand Prix when Massa was taken out following an horrific smash involving Kimi Raikkonen, on this occasion his turn into McLaren's Kevin Magnussen resulted in his own shock moment. The Brazilian was flipped up and over, landing on the roll hoop on top of his car, which then somehow managed to right itself again. It immediately brought the safety car into play for two laps, with Hamilton 17th upon its release, following which he can began the process of picking off those ahead of him. By the end of lap 10 Hamilton was in the points in 10th, albeit with one moment of consternation, while former friend Adrian Sutil in his Sauber ran into the sidepod of the Briton's Mercedes, but without damage. Then on lap 13 came a breathtaking overtake on Raikkonen and the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo into the hairpin, with the Finn squeezed as Hamilton legally edged him out of the way. Out: Felipe Massa crashed in the first curve of the German Formula One Grand Prix in Hockenheim . Rolling: The high-speed crash saw Massa's car flipped upside down . With pit stops, by the end of lap 16 Hamilton was up to second and 7.7 seconds adrift of Rosberg, who had already made his first stop. It was another 10 laps before Hamilton finally made his run into the pits, taking on another set of soft Pirelli tyres - he was one of only three drivers to start off on the harder of the two compounds this weekend. That dropped Hamilton back to eighth, but from there he began another charge, although there was again contact at one point, this time with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button. It proved slightly more costly as Hamilton lost his left front-wing endplate, exposing his left-front tyre to degradation. It forced Mercedes into switching Hamilton from a planned two-stop strategy to a three, at that stage potentially scuppering his hopes of finishing runner-up to Rosberg. Relief: The Brazilian seemed to be OK after the heavy collision with Kevin Magnussen . Heat of the moment: Daniil Kyvat was forced out of the race as his car burst into flames . Trouble behind: Rosberg leads the way as Massa crashes at the first corner . It was not long before Hamilton was back up to second as those ahead pitted prior to the Brit switching to the far quicker supersoft tyres on lap 42, dropping him to fifth. When Adrian Sutil spun his Sauber on lap 50, leaving his car on the start-finish straight, it appeared a safety car would be called. Mercedes, perhaps expecting as such, immediately brought in Hamilton for a longer-than-planned run on a final set of supersofts.

'I had great fun,' said Hamilton. 'I did as good as I could. 'It was hard to get through the pack safely and I had a little bit of a collision with Jenson.

"Struggling Efe Ambrose ended a thoroughly miserable week with one tiny sliver of good news as referee Antti Munnukka indicated that he would not officially record the Celtic defender’s red card against Tottenham Hotspur, thereby sparing him a suspension from Celtic’s first Premiership match of the season against St Johnstone. That said, on current form, manager Ronny Deila might not be inclined to select the Nigerian defender anyway. Ambrose was sent off for the second time in four days as a shadow Celtic side took a heavy beating from Spurs in Helsinki, the Nigerian’s bad luck lingering on since his part in the team’s Champions League drubbing in Warsaw last midweek. Too easy: Tottenham's Harry Kane (centre) gave them the lead in an emphatic 6-1 win against Celtic . Seeing red: Efe Ambrose (left) was sent off for Celtic for fouling Emmanuel Adebayor (right) Swept home: Lewis Holtby (right) scored Tottenham's third just before half-time in an emphatic win . Celtic: Gordon, Herron, O'Connell, Ambrose, Twardzik, Lindsay, Irvine, Henderson, McGeouch, Pukki, McMullan. Subs: Fasan, Waters, McManus, McIlduff, Tierney, Balde, Fridjonsson. Goal: Lindsay 44 . Red Card: Ambrose 89 . Tottenham: Friedel, Naughton, Dawson, Kaboul, Davies, Mason, Capoue, Holtby, Kane, Townsend, Soldado. Subs: McGee, Fredericks, Fryers, Rose, Veljkovic, Bentaleb, Eriksen, Lamela, Lennon, Sandro, Adebayor. Goals: Kane 5, Soldado 12, Holtby 45, Lamela 60, Eriksen 83, Adebayor 89 . Ambrose’s ordering off against Legia gave the Poles a platform on which to build their 4-1 first leg victory and, despite performing reasonably well for much of this match, he conceded the free-kick from which Christian Eriksen scored Spurs’ fifth, conceded the penalty which made it 6-1 and was then sent packing for a foul on Emmanuel Adebayor. Assistant boss John Collins, in charge as Ronny Deila drilled his players for the second leg against Legia back in Glasgow, remarked: ‘I thought Efe was playing really well – it was a harsh sending off. I’m not going to talk about the referee but if he’s not including it in his report, that’s good news. That’s a relief for Efe and for us.’ While he may have dodged a bullet domestically – team-mate Charlie Mulgrew missed the SPL opener in 2012 after referee Bas Nijhuis reported his red in a friendly against Ajax to the Dutch FA – Ambrose will be missing as Deila’s team attempt to recover from the 4-1 defeat suffered in Poland last midweek. In terms of preparing for that recovery mission at Murrayfield, Celtic needed this fixture like a hole in the head. The club may have banked a cheque for turning up but the no show of Deila and key men like England internationalist Fraser Forster, Kris Commons and Virgil van Dijk would have left the organisers and much of the 14,000 crowd in the Olympic Stadium feeling short-changed. On the ball: Kyle Naughton (centre) started for Tottenham in their pre-season win against Celtic . Collins fielded what was essentially a development side with eight players aged 21 and under in the line-up and new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted he expected more from Celtic: ‘I was hoping for a stronger test. 'We brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game. It wasn’t a waste of time, sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies.’ Collins countered by defending Celtic’s team selection: ‘The bottom line is the game was arranged in February before we arrived. It’s fallen between big European games so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team. ‘For our team full of under-18s, it’s a massive step up for them from the Scottish youth league but they’ll remember it, they’ll watch these players on TV and be able to say they played against them. ‘Obviously it’s painful but I thought there were patches in the first half where we passed it and were brave on the ball. Liam Henderson in particular had a terrific game in there against quality players.’ Raring: Andros Townsend (left) featured for Spurs as he recovers from an injury-plagued season last term . The margin of defeat may have been greater but there was less shame in this team of kids going down by a 6-1 scoreline than in the heavy beating endured by their senior counterparts in Poland last midweek. Only Ambrose and local hero Teemu Pukki survived from Celtic’s wipe-out in Warsaw and while the former’s inclusion was a penance, the latter was handed the captain’s armband for his homecoming. Pukki scored for Finland against the Czech Republic on his last appearance at the grand old venue that was constructed for the 1952 Olympics and admitted he was more than happy to make the journey. ‘I really wanted to be here. To play in the Olympic Stadium again was a nice thing to do. It is a big thing to be the captain of a team like Celtic but I think it will be the last time. If you lose 6-1 that is not great. ‘Wednesday will be hard but the whole team believes. We want to do it and we hope we can do it.’ Getting stuck in: Kane (centre) gets tackled by Jamie Lindsay (right) during the Helsinki-based friendly . Pochettino is getting to know his own players but possesses a strong pool that made practice inevitable for goalkeeper Craig Gordon, starting his third Saturday friendly in a row as he continues to ease himself towards match fitness. The former Hearts man was soundly beaten after five minutes when Harry Kane slammed home Andros Townsend’s cut-back for the first goal and was again let down by his defence when Roberto Soldado scored the second on the rebound after he’d made the initial save. Jamie Lindsay claimed one back for Celtic as his header from Dylan McGeouch’s cross crept over the line but an agitated Spurs responded swiftly as Lewis Holtby restored the two-goal gap on the stroke of half-time. Maestro: Christian Eriksen came on as a second-half for Tottenham and scored a delightful free-kick . Spurs substitute Eric Lamela added the fourth via a deflection off Eoghan O’Connell. Eriksen’s free-kick, a whipped 20-yard effort that left Gordon flailing at fresh air, was the pick of the bunch and although the decision to punish Ambrose seemed harsh as Danny Rose stumbled near the byline there was no denying the conviction of Emmanuel Adebayor’s spot-kick as it rattled in off the post to complete the scoring. Pukki expressed sympathy with Ambrose after Munukka produced the second yellow following a tussle with Adebayor. ‘I feel for Efe. I think it was a stupid decision from the referee. Why would he give a card in a friendly?’ Everone in attendance might equally have queried just why Celtic were here at all.","Tottenham thrash Celtic 6-1 in their pre-season friendly .

"So where would you start? You have been thrust into the role of Liverpool manager and your first task is to fill the void created by Luis Suarez’s departure to Barcelona. Sitting in the club bank account is £75million and you are free to go and spend it. With supporters clamouring for a new hero, you will assume you need to find a replacement with a similar standing to Suarez, someone who screams box office. How about Karim Benzema, then? Fresh from a positive World Cup and winning the Champions League with Real Madrid, his class as a striker cannot be questioned. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez and his family arrive in Barcelona . Gone: Footballer of the Year Luis Suarez has left Liverpool for Barcelona in a £75million deal . He would cost in the region of £50m and demand huge wages but money isn’t an object for you, so why not? If Benzema isn’t for you, what about Marco Reus from Borussia Dortmund? Yours for £45m. When he recovers from the ankle ligament damage that cost him a place in Germany’s World Cup winning-squad, there is no doubt he deserves a place in European football’s ‘A’ list. Others would have to be considered. Why not Radamel Falcao, a striker who deserves to be playing in front of a bigger, more passionate crowd than Monaco's? Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint-Germain, maybe? Angel Di Maria, or even Mario Balotelli? Were Liverpool to land any of the aforementioned players, the news would be huge, the fee would be massive but, more than anything, the deal would represent a shift in a policy that goes back to the days of Bill Shankly. Liverpool, in the main, do not raid big clubs to sign big names – they identify talent and turn them into stars. Fitting the Bill: Shankly's way of developing talent is still practised at Liverpool . That has always been the preferred way. Kevin Keegan may have become a dual European Footballer of the Year later in his career but he arrived at Anfield in 1971 as an unheralded rookie from Scunthorpe, all fierce determination and boundless enthusiasm. Playing in a fine team, having a desire to squeeze every last ounce of his ability and benefitting from the guidance of two uniquely gifted managers helped propel him to stardom. Keegan blossomed on Merseyside, he didn’t come as the ready-made package. Similar sentiments apply to many others. Kenny Dalglish had been brilliant for Celtic but moving to Liverpool, where he crowned his first season with the goal that retained the European Cup, enabled him to scale completely new heights while dramatically enhancing his reputation. Packing a punch: Keegan lands a right hook on Leeds captain Billy Bremner in the 1974 Charity Shield . You can go on reeling off examples: Ian Rush and John Barnes; Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard; Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano and Suarez – all had Liverpool to thank for providing the stage to bloom. None first wore a Red shirt at the peak of their powers. It has never been Liverpool’s way to do, say, what Chelsea have done and buy Cesc Fabregas for in excess of £30m with huge wages from another European powerhouse and it certainly won’t be the way under Fenway Sports Group, as the ethos and economics don’t match. So while the idea of going out and bidding for a name that would get plastered all over the back pages sounds romantic to supporters, there is little chance Rodgers, his transfer committee or FSG will consider doing just that. Forward thinking: Manager Brendan Rodgers shares the philosophy of the clubs and its owners . Rodgers, for one, knows exactly what he is looking for in the players he signs. Last summer, when the window was closing, he was considering his options when the name of a Champions League winning player was put to him during a casual discussion. He nodded his head about this player’s ability and pedigree but then asked the question: ‘would he now want to run through a wall for you every day?’ That is what Rodgers wants: youth, energy, hunger; players with desire to get to the top and keep improving on the way, players such as Lazar Markovic, Adam Lallana, Emre Can – a player whom Manchester United extensively scouted last season – and Divock Origi. New arrival: England midfielder Adam Lallana has joined from Southampton . On the radar: Lille's young Belgium striker Divock Origi is on Rodgers' shortlist . Of course there is respect for the big names, those who have been around and seen all there is to see, but Rodgers is a manager who, primarily, wants his squad filled with individuals who are careering towards their peak, not those who are established and already had that experience. ‘The idea is to have that squad in place by the end of August and it is going to be a really exciting time for us,’ Rodgers said recently. ‘We will improve. We’ve got a lot of young players who will have gained from the experience last season. I’m looking forward to seeing the development of the team.’ Which is why, then, he will take a measured approach to spending that Suarez bounty, rather than just heading for the names that only vast, vast sums could buy.

According to Forbes, text messages sent from Peterson to his four-year-old son's mother show Peterson's nonchalant attitude about the wounds. In one text, he said one mark would make the mother 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch.' 'Got him in nuts once I noticed,' started another. 'But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!' The physical marks were noticed by the four-year-old's mother after he returned from Texas to her home in Minnesota. On May 22, the mother took him to the pediatrician, where the four-year-old underwent a well-child check and showed the doctor his 'owies.' These included switch marks, some of which were described as cuts, to the child's thighs, buttocks, scrotum, back and right hand. When asked what happened, the child said, 'I got whooped by a switch,' and said it was his father who did it. Sponsorship: Nike suspended its endorsement of Adrian Peterson, one of the NFL's biggest stars following the allegations of child abuse . Since details of the allegations have emerged, Peterson has been dropped from the Vikings' active roster while the criminal case against him is pending in Texas, where he has an October 8 arraignment. The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, taking him off the roster and bowing to pressure from outraged fans and sponsors. Hennepin County juvenile court staff attorney Maggie Skelton said prosecutors have asked that the order be suspended until the Texas case is resolved. County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement that the petition was required by law once criminal charges were filed, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune. The fallout from the abuse allegations have led to major sponsors dropping the NFL star from lucrative endorsement deals. Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well. Mugshot: This photo provided by the Montgomery County sheriff's office shows Peterson's booking photo . Castrol Motor Oil was the first of Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing Tuesday that the contract was suspended. On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed Peterson back on the field following his arrest. Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, has not responded to an email seeking comment. But the NFL and team owners are currently dealing with three other high profile domestic abuse cases. Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. And, a security video emerged last week of Ray Rice knocking his wife Janay Rice out cold. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely and said he had not seen that video when he handed down his original two-game ban in July. He had, however, seen a previous video showing Rice dragging an unconscious Janay out of the elevator.

Staying power: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized at today's tense press conference, but refused to resign . Today, Goodell apologized for his handling of the Rice scandal - but refused to step down from his position. As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision making in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving players. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator. 'Unfortunately over the past several weeks we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong and that starts with me,' Goodell said.","Hennepin County Human Services filed the petition in a bid to obtain a protective order for Adrian Peterson's four-year-old son .

It was not McIlroy's only incident with a fan all day, after earlier growing frustrated with a spectator whose noise interrupted his backswing at the 16th hole on Sunday. The . three-shot leader hit an almost perfect drive down the centre of the . fairway - but took exception to one member of the crowd, pointing them . out to be ejected with his club.

I said to myself that I’d try to never make that happen again. ‘It’s been huge what a difference a year makes. It was the worst of times at Muirfield but this is the best of times,’ said McIlroy who dedicated his win to his mother, Rosie, who was in tears by the 18th green. ‘To sit here 25 years of age and win my third Major Championship and be three-quarters of the way to a career Grand Slam, I never dreamed of being at this point in my career so quickly. ‘The more I keep looking at this trophy and seeing my name on it, the more it will start to sink in,’ added McIlroy who thanked the Liverpool golf fans for getting behind him, despite being a Manchester United supporter. 1989: Born on May 4 in Holywood, Northern Ireland. 2005: Plays in his first professional European Tour event as a 16-year-old at The Forest of Arden.

"Ever since Marty McFly made his getaway on a hoverboard in Back to the Future II, gadget fans have been dreaming of floating along on their own device. Now, Californian architect Greg Henderson has made that dream come true by developing a hoverboard that floats in mid-air just like the 1980s classic film. Dubbed the Hendo Hoverboard, the technology uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. Scroll down for video . The Hendo Hoverboard uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other . The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes. As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster. That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air. In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground. Ever since Michael J Fox made his getaway on a hoverboard in Back to the Future II (left), gadget fans have been dreaming of floating on their own device. Now, Californian architect Greg Henderson has made that dream come true by developing a hoverboard (design pictured right) that floats in mid-air . Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials to serve as a secondary magnetic field . Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum -  to serve as a secondary magnetic field. The Hendo Hoverboard uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other. The magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. So the board underneath the Hendo can be aluminum and copper to work, for instance. The innovation here is in the efficiency of the induction process and the ability to control the movements of the hovering objects. The system claims to be able to carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes. Maglev trains use similar technology but laying down a track costs around £464,000 ($750,000) per metre. Mr Henderson, however, claims its technology would only cost £6,200 ($10,000) per metre of track. Mr Henderson’s 19-person company, Arx Pax, is now making the technology inside the device available to the public on crowd funding site Kickstarter. The company is hoping to raise £155,000 ($250,000) for the campaign and will sell the technology for £185 ($299) in a box it calls the Hover Engine developer kit. Buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover. It can carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes. ‘We want to see what you can do with our technology,’ the company writes on their Kickstarter page. ‘You can use it for hovering, or for applications we haven't even imagined.’ Consumers can also buy the complete Hendo hoverboard from £6,200 ($10,000). In the meantime, the group is working on something called the G-Ray, which will allow people to control the hover technology remotely using a smartphone app. Californian group Arx Pax claims its technology would cost £6,200 ($10,000) per metre of track to work .

"Connor Essam was Dover's hero as the Conference side dumped League Two Cheltenham Town out of the FA Cup. The Kent side will line up alongside the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool in Monday night's third round draw after their deserved win at Whaddon Road. When Cheltenham failed to clear Nicky Deverdics' cross seven minutes from time, captain and centre-half Essam turned inside the box and finished in front of the delirious travelling fans. Connor Essam strikes seven minutes from time to sent Dover Athletic through into the third round at the expense of Cheltenham Town .

Conference North Worcester, who knocked Coventry City out in the first round, conjured more Cup heroics, with Daniel Nti earning them a replay with Scunthorpe United. The League One strugglers opened the scoring when Paddy Madden poked the ball into an empty net after Nathan Vaughan had turned Miguel Llera's curling free-kick onto the crossbar. But when Scunthorpe failed to clear their lines inside the penalty area a minute into the second half, Nti pounced to equalise and earn a replay at Aggborough. Worcester manager Carl Heeley said: 'All we said was 'no regrets today, let's do ourselves justice'. We didn't do that in the first-half but in the second you could tell what a good side we are. We're on a roll. 'It's a tough game to come at home but we've got a chance.' Conference side Chester held League One Barnsley to a goalless draw at Oakwell and had chances to win it.

Aldershot manager Andy Scott told the BBC: 'We probably had the four best chances. We kept going and they didn't really create something in the second half. 'Rochdale's goalkeeper was probably the man of the match. How he has made some of those saves I do not know. We should have won but we're in the hat for the next round.'

James Constable bundled home from five yards to give Eastleigh the lead after Craig McAllister had rounded Southport goalkeeper David Raya.

"Tiger Woods showed up at Royal Liverpool on Sunday and looked and sounded like a man with something to prove at the 143rd Open Championship this week. One analyst after another has been pouring scorn on his preparations with their thoughts all contributing to a premise previously considered unthinkable: has the fire gone out? Well, the fact he was in town a day earlier than expected might be considered something of an answer in itself. VIDEO Scroll down to watch as Tiger Woods falls to his knees in extreme pain . Playing in the sand: The 38-year-old chips from a bunker at the 15th green at Hoylake . Relaxed: Woods was all smiles as he answered questions next to the 18th green after a practice round . But it was the sight of Tiger . pain-free and clearly enjoying himself in the afternoon rain at . Hoylake, and the optimistic noises he made afterwards, that might cause . those who are ready to write him off to pause for breath. Woods . arrived at almost exactly the same time he did on the Saturday before . the Open at Hoylake in 2006. Is he secretly superstitious? Eight . years ago he was coming off his first missed halfway cut in a major, at . the US Open, as he came to terms with losing his father, Earl. We . all knew what the response would be by the time he got to Hoylake. Back . then, the fire was overpowering, and he duly won it for his dad with . one of the great exhibitions of links play of all time, and wept . unashamedly on the 18th green. It was the start of seven tournament victories in a row. He was 30 and appeared invincible. Now, . two-time US Open champion Curtis Strange is so scornful of his chances . he says Woods is ‘kidding himself’ if he thinks he can win. Tiger on the prowl: The 2006 champion laughs with his caddy Joe LaCava during his practice round on Saturday . Major concern: Tiger has endured a six-year drought since his last Major . Sir Nick Faldo is just one of . many who wondered why he did not play in this week’s Scottish Open, . since he has only played two competitive rounds in four months following . his surgery. Certainly, . the idea Woods would rush back to play before he was ready, simply to . appease a sponsor, as he clearly did at his own tournament in Washington . two weeks ago where he missed the cut comfortably, would have been . ludicrous  during his glory years. And Faldo would probably have been . taken up on his very reasonable suggestion to play the Scottish as well. So . a different Woods will  undoubtedly be on show this time. During those . eight years he has been battered by injuries, wounded by divorce, . damaged irrevocably by scandal and blessed with two  children. How could . things not be different? But is there anything wrong in a 38-year-old easing his way back into competition? Why . wouldn’t Woods think long-term after his recent surgery and look on . this tournament as the first major of the rest of his life? Comeback: Woods spent months on the sideline this year after undergoing back surgery . ‘This is how I used to feel when I . played,’ beamed Woods on Saturday. ‘I had good weeks and bad weeks before . my back surgery, but now they are all good. And it’s good to be back . here. 'I remember some of the holes but it’s much more green this time. I . have been out here trying to hit the ball again and as the weeks go on, . I am only going to get stronger. I was at a point where I could not do . anything because I could not get out of bed, and now I am completely . pain-free.’ One thing’s for . sure, and that is he will be given a raucous welcome by the locals, who . are thrilled he is beginning his major comeback at the place where he . created such indelible memories last time. Liverpool . is currently in thrall at the prospect of something known as the Giant . Spectacle, an amazing show on the city’s streets that is expected to . draw more than a  million people next week. Thousands . will flock to Hoylake to see Woods, but the game itself, as well as his . fans, should welcome him back. Rather than dwelling on what’s missing, . shouldn’t we just be glad to see him fit and healthy at this stage and . leave the critical analysis for later? Raring to go: Woods is determined to put in a good performance at Hoylake after months out through injury . Woods could not play last week, he . said, because he had a vacation pre-planned with his kids. Are we really . going to slaughter him for that? By pure chance, I was there by the clubhouse when he got his first look at Hoylake last time. ‘Where’s . the first tee, bud?’ he asked, cheerfully. So alongside old coach Hank . Haney and his former caddie Steve Williams, my eight-year-old son and I . accompanied him to the first tee. Woods . pulled out a three-wood on the opening hole, struck it beautifully — . and was dismayed to see it disappear into a fairway bunker. The . same thing happened at the second hole. And so the strategy that would . startle everyone at  Hoylake that week began to take shape. Over the . parched links, Woods would use his driver just once all week. On . occasion he would be 70 yards behind his playing partners but he wasn’t . to be moved from his strategy of taking the fairway bunkers out of . play. It was a stunning demonstration of strength of mind and skill and . it earned him a two-stroke  triumph on a total of 18 under par. Victorious: Woods celebrates winning The Open at Hoylake in 2006 . Emotion: Woods reacts as he walks off the 18th green in 2006 with his caddie Steve Williams . Write caption here . The test might be greener this . time but even so, two-time Open champion Padraig Harrington, who visited . Hoylake recently, sees no reason why the winning score should not be . similar. ‘Normally, if you . shoot a 72-hole score of a few digits under par you won’t be far away . but that might not be the case here,’ he said. ‘This is one of those . majors where you need to make a fast start, because a 73 or 74 will . leave you with an awful lot of catching up to do.’ Two . of the favoured names this week are recent winners Justin Rose and . Graeme McDowell, who have both made their reputations winning on tough . courses where the winning score is close to par. If they are to prevail at  Hoylake, therefore, it might require a change of modus operandi. A . good weather week will surely play into the hands of the strong US . contingent. Down the generations, Royal Liverpool has been good to the . great Americans, with victories for Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones, as . well as Woods. Trouble ahead: The four hardest holes at Hoylake that could decide The Open . There would probably have been wins . for Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson as well but for the course’s 39-year . exile from the Open rota from 1967. And still we haven’t mentioned the best player in the world, Adam Scott. Is . there another sportsman in his position who has perfected the art of . staying under the radar quite as well as the gentle Aussie? Scott . has not played since the US Open a month ago, but he pulled the same . trick before winning the  Masters last year, so no-one should have too . many concerns in terms of rust. The . last three winners of the Claret Jug — Darren Clarke, Ernie Els and . Phil Mickelson — were all aged 42 or 43 at the time of their wins and it . would come as no surprise if the trend continued. Warming up: The 2013 US Open winner Justin Rose will fancy his chances at Hoylake . Focused: Rory McIlroy will be one of the favourites when The Open starts on Thursday . And 41-year-old Lee Westwood will be the fervent hope of many. At . the other end of the career scale, 25-year-old Rory McIlroy will . probably start favourite, and deservedly so after showing at Royal . Aberdeen — on Thursday at least — how much he has learned about links . golf. But the start of the . week, at least, will be dominated by one man who turned up early at . Hoylake  on Sunday, as if to show he means business. Yes, . it’s true, he’s not the Tiger Woods of old. But he’s still Tiger Woods, . and that alone is enough to give this major championship the frisson of . anticipation missing from the Masters and the US Open.","The 38-year-old wept unashamedly at the 18th green following his 2006 win .

"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers made no attempt to hide his disdain for NSA leaker Edward Snowden on Tuesday at a meeting in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening in London. Rogers told his Members of Parliament that Snowden is a 'traitor' and is likely responsible for the deaths of both British and U.S. soldiers. 'The [US] government has pressed charges on Mr. Snowden. We are treating him, as I would argue, the traitor that he is,' Rogers said, according to the Huffington Post. 'And by the way, and this is important, I would charge him for murder,' Rogers added. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden poses for a photo during an interview in an undisclosed location in December 2013 in Moscow, Russia. Snowden has been living in Moscow since June 2012 after getting temporary asylum in order to evade prosecution by authorities in the U.S. The Huffington Post says Rogers, a Republican who represents Michigan in Congress, made the remarks at an event hosted by a conservative think tank called the Henry Jackson Society. The meeting for British MPs and foreign policy professionals was co-hosted by conservative MP Julian Lewis, who is a member of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee. It's unclear from the Huffington Post's article what triggered Rogers' rant about Snowden, . Earlier in the day the whistle blower resurfaced via a satellite interview streamed at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Snowden contended that the Boston Marathon bombing is an example of how acts of terrorism can occur even when the government is engaged in broad intelligence collection. 'The reality is that we knew who these guys were and who they were associating with,' Snowden told Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, according to the Boston Globe. 'But we didn’t follow up or watch these guys.' He also argued that mass surveillance has not made the United States safer. The U.S. is actually more vulnerable to threats because of wiretapping and website hacking, he said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, pictured here in 2012 at a news conference on Capitol Hill, said Tuesday that Snowden is a 'traitor' and that he would charge the whistle blower with 'murder' 'Once you make a backdoor into something, you can’t control who walks in through it,' he stated. Ex-Counterterrorism Center head Matt Olsen fired back at Snowden in an interview with CNN today. Olsen said that because of Snowden, 'We've lost collection against some individuals, people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications.We lost insight into what they were doing. 'They've changed how they encrypt their communications and adopted more stringent encryption techniques,' Olsen said. 'They've changed service providers and email addresses and they've, in some cases, just dropped off all together.' Congressman Rogers asserted on Tuesday evening that 'over 95%' of the data Snowden releaesd had 'nothing to do' to do with the government spying on private citizens. The bulk of it dealt with 'tactical things, military plans and operations.' He also accused Snowden of hampering the United States' ability to conduct enemy surveillance. 'He took information that allows force protection, not only for British soldiers, but for US soldiers, and made it more difficult for us to track those activities. Meaning it is more likely that one of those soldiers is going to get their legs blown off or killed because of his actions,' he said. 'Anybody that provides information to the enemy is a traitor, period, pure and simple.' Rogers said he thinks it's suspicious that Snowden has been embraced by Russia, which has become increasingly estranged from the U.S. Snowden has been living there in exile since the U.S. revoked his passport a little over two years ago. In August the country offered him asylum for three years and the option to become a citizen if he stays a for another year after that. 'Many don't find it odd he is in the loving arms of an SVR [Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service] agent right now in Moscow,' Rogers said. 'I do,' the intelligence committee head said.","'We are treating him, as I would argue, the traitor that he is,' the Michigan Republican said .

"Soaring numbers of of teenage girls are suffering iron deficiency because they consume too many energy drinks, experts have warned. The Health Food Manufacturers' Association has (HFMA) warned that caffeine can inhibit the body's uptake of minerals, including iron. Iron deficiency is Britain’s most common nutritional disorder and recent research has shown that around 40 per cent of girls and young women aged 11 to 24 have lower than expected intake. Rising levels of iron deficiency in young women have been linked to a rise in the number of energy drinks being consumed (file picture) Deficiency affects up to 18 per cent of women due to blood loss through menstruation. Other studies have indicated that one in 10 British teenagers consume as many of five cans of caffeinated energy drinks every week, the HFMA said. A survey of 10,000 British adults conducted by the Association  found that three-quarters of 18 to 24- year-olds do not know that caffeine can restrict a person's intake of these vital minerals. The HFMA's executive director, Graham Keen, said: 'Micro-nutrients are essential for good health and wellbeing, and iron deficiency is a wide-scale issue which shouldn't be ignored - particularly for teenage girls. 'The public needs access to straightforward, responsible information about how essential vitamins and minerals work. SYMPTOMS: Aside from tiredness, other symptoms of iron deficiency include poor concentration, poor appetite, pale skin, dark circles under the eyes. RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE (RDA): 14.8mg for women and 8.7mg for men. WHAT IRON DOES : It's needed to make red blood cells. A component of haemoglobin, which transports oxygen round the body. WHO NEEDS IT: Iron deficiency is Britain’s most common nutritional disorder, according to studies presented recently at the National Conference on Iron Deficiency in Infancy and Childhood. It affects up to 18 per cent of women due to blood loss through menstruation. GOOD SOURCES: Red meat, eggs, green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C helps the absorption of iron, so it’s a good idea to drink a glass of orange juice with a meat-based meal. 'Everyone should know that the best solution for most people is to consume key nutrients such as vitamins and minerals via as healthy a diet as possible . 'And it should also be recognised that a daily food supplement provides important insurance for millions looking to safeguard their nutritional intake.' It comes as another survey by consumer analysts Mintel found in the last year 61 per cent of British people have consumed a sports drink and 46 per cent a energy drink. The report also reveals 54 per cent of British people claim to often feel tired, rising to 60 per cent among women. Three out of four people  said they are more fun to be around when they're feeling energetic, rising to 82 per cent among women, while two-thirds (64 per cent) said they get irritated easily when they're tired. But while energy drinks might provide a temporary boost, there are documented health risks. The drinks have been associated with a number of negative effects, including cardiovascular symptoms such as an irregular heartbeat, sleep impairment, nervousness and nausea. A 2011 study carried out in the U.S. reported on a number of cases where excessive caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects such as 'seizures, mania, stroke and sudden death'. Caffeine: Table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances . Earlier this year the death of 19-year-old Joshua Merrick's, from Didsbury, Manchester  was linked to high-caffeine energy drinks. Despite the health warnings, sales of energy drinks are rising, from 454 million litres sold in 2011 to an estimated 550 million litres predicted to fly off the shelves this year. The drinks specifically claim to provide an energy or stimulant boost, supporting mental alertness and physical performance. They generally include active ingredients such as glucose, caffeine or taurine, and may include other ingredients positioned as beneficial to health, such as ginseng and various vitamins and minerals. But experts have warned that some 500ml cans of energy drinks contain the equivalent of more than 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine – which is about the same as in four cans of cola. The recommended daily limit for caffeine for adults is 400mg. Energy drinks have also been linked to sleep impairment, nervousness, nausea, mania and seizures . Energy drinks can contain around 52g of sugar, more than 50g a day recommended by the World Health Organisation. Some 500ml cans contain 160mg of caffeine – which is about the same as in four cans of cola. The recommended daily limit for adults is 400mg. University of Bonn scientists found energy drinks changed the way the heart beats and could increase the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm problems. Other reports have linked energy drink consumption with causing irregular heartbeat and even stroke. Researchers at the University of Michigan reported that teenagers who drink energy drinks are much more likely to also drink alcohol and use drugs. They are also more likely to start smoking. U.S. researchers found mixing energy drinks with alcohol could put people at greater risk of alcohol poisoning.","Health Food Manufacturers' Association warned caffeine inhibits the body's uptake of minerals, including iron .

"Sam Allardyce does not expect his West Ham contract to be renewed until the last minute — but believes only a change in ownership will scupper his chances of a new deal. Allardyce has overseen a stunning season despite not knowing if he will have a future at the club beyond the summer, when his contract runs out. No talks have yet been planned but Allardyce, whose previous two-year extension was signed in May 2013, insisted he is ‘comfortable’ to wait. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is confident he will be offered a new deal by the club soon . West Ham supporters displayed a 'Fat Sam Out ' banner during West Ham's defeat to West Brom in April 2014 . Allardyce has managed to prove his doubters wrong by turning around West Ham's fortunes this season . James Tomkins scored the winner against West Brom to propel West Ham to their seventh win of this season . ‘I think it will happen like it did last time when we get closer to the end of the season,’ he said. ‘We will decide on where we are going and what we are going to do. ‘Just after getting promoted [in 2012] there were no new contract talks in the Premier League until April and the back of end May. It will probably be the same this time round. I’ve always been comfortable with that. I was last time and I’m comfortable with it this time.’ By Allardyce’s logical rationale, which is that good results will keep him safe, his future should be all but assured after an excellent start to the season. They face Swansea at Upton Park on Sunday looking for an eighth win of the campaign, boosted by the possible return of Alex Song and Diafra Sakho from injury. Former Barcelona midfielder Alex Song could make his return from injury against Swansea on Sunday . Allardyce said: ‘Whether you have a contract or haven’t got a contract, if you have good results you’re fine. If you haven’t got good results, whether you have a contract or not, you get sacked. ‘If you get a set of new owners then they might not like you and it doesn’t matter how well you do, they’ll move you on. From that point of view, I can’t see West Ham being sold at this moment in time.’ And he added: ‘We are winning a lot of people over. But any fans at any club, when results are not going well, make themselves heard. You always win them over if you start winning, playing better and buy better players.’ Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho is also expected to return after recovering from a a shoulder problem .","Sam Allardyce's contract with West Ham runs out in the summer .

"When the axe swung at Aston Villa, defender Alan Hutton braced himself for a knock-on with Scotland. Luckily for the right back, national coach Gordon Strachan has never been one for following the rules.

Alan Hutton celebrates after Aston Villa ended a run of nine games without a win against Burnley last Tuesday . Hutton (left) takes the ball away from Yannick Bolasie's outstretched leg during the win at Selhurst Park . Hutton has made the short but dramatic journey from outcast to first choice for his club. ‘I felt I had a lot to give and I wanted to do it here. I wanted to prove everybody wrong,’ admitted Hutton. ‘If someone told me last season what would happen this season, I would have laughed. To look back from where I was then to now is a total turnaround. ‘I wasn’t playing here yet I was going up to Scotland and Gordon was picking me in not just friendlies but qualifying games also. ‘I owe a massive amount to him. There was no reason for him to pick me but he did. It kept me going. If I had down time here I used to look to the international games and focus. Your head has to be on it.’ Hutton applauds the Scotland fans at the end of the the Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland in October . The right back battles for possession with Burnley's George Boyd during a 1-1 draw last month . Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert was convinced. Two years after telling Hutton there was no room for him at the club, Lambert had to make a dramatic u-turn. ‘The gaffer watched me play for Scotland and, yes, I suppose it surprised me. Everybody wants to be loved. It’s great for people to be saying nice things about you,’ added Hutton, 30, who has since signed a new three-year contract. Sadly from Villa’s perspective, they are in yet another relegation battle although pressure has been eased by the midweek win over Crystal Palace. On Sunday they entertain bottom club Leicester in what has all the hallmarks of a ‘must-win’ game. Hutton added: ‘The League’s so tight that if you go on a run you can shoot up a few places which we did on Tuesday. ‘A home game with Leicester is one where we can say we need to put down a marker.’","Alan Hutton fell out of favour with manager Paul Lambert two years ago .

"Police revealed CCTV had been 'crucial' in the hunt for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross . CCTV has played a 'crucial' role in the hunt for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross who disappeared more than four weeks ago. Scotland Yard said it had scoured footage from hundreds of cameras in a bid to trace the 14-year-old who was last seen crossing a towpath at Grand Union Canal in west London on August 28. Officers are reviewing film from around 300 cameras over a six-mile square area as the search for Alice enters its fifth week. But while CCTV has aided investigations, police said they were also relying on the public to turf up new information. Detective Superintendent Carla Mehta said: 'CCTV is clearly crucial in our investigation, but we still need the public's help and I want to hear from anyone who saw Alice during the afternoon of the Thursday she was last seen. 'Our searches are continuing in the local area today, and there are extra officers involved. I'd like to thank the community who have been so supportive and patient. 'In over 30 years of policing I have never seen such a strong community reaction. This is a community that is totally behind the search to find Alice and bring her home.' She added the case's prime suspect, Latvian murderer Arnis Zalkalns, who was seen cycling on the same towpath 15 minutes after Alice, was just 'one line of inquiry' in the investigation. Zalkalns, who killed his wife in 1997 before entering the UK where he was arrested for assaulting a teenager the same age as Alice in 2007, went missing at the beginning of September. Police continue to search for the missing schoolgirl who disappeared on August 28 in the largest deployment of police resources since the 7/7 bombings . Metropolitan Police today searched a wasteland between river Brent and Elthorne Park near Trumpers Way, Hanwell, where Alice was last seen . Officers are now considering footage from around 300 CCTV cameras as the hunt for missing Alice continues . Two officers search a section of the river Brent as the hunt for 14-year-old  Alice Gross enters its fifth week .

Officers shift greenery in a wasteland in west London after it was revealed no new evidence was found at Elthorne Park in Hanwell yesterday . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said so far the search had involved underwater and confined space experts . Detective Superintendent Carla Mentha said police were still appealing to members of the public for any information about the girl . Yesterday officers revealed a staged reconstruction of the last known movements of the schoolgirl had incited more than 150 phone calls from viewers. The video, which showed a girl of Alice's age and appearance walking across the canal towpath swinging her arms distinctly, was shown on television on Thursday. Investigators however drew a blank yesterday afternoon after finding nothing at Elthorne Park in Hanwell, Ealing, which had been declared an area of interest. Forensic teams combed the leafy park in the morning and even erected a tent in one field after being notified of 'disturbed ground'. Officers are still searching the Grand Union Canal, where a six-inch knife was discovered last week. Metropolitan Police however said they had no reason to believe Alice had come to any harm. Her family released an emotional appeal this week, sharing photographs and video footage of the teenager singing.

"General Motors has admitted that at least 23 people have died and 16 were seriously injured after the ignition switch failed on one of its popular car models. The Detroit car maker has established a compensation scheme after it acknowledged the faulty part in its Chevrolet Cobalt and other small cars. The faulty switch had been identified more than ten years ago but the firm only initiated a recall in February. Attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who is running the compensation scheme for GM said two additional claims were settled over the past week, bringing the total to 23. Trenton Buzard, 7, received an undisclosed compensation payout after he was paralysed when his great grand mother's Chevrolet Cobalt careered out of control when the ignition switch failed . Amy Rademaker, left and Natasha Weigel, right, both died in October 2006 following the crash in Wisconsin . The girls were both passengers in this Chevy Cobalt which went out of control on a rural road in Wisconsin . It is understood GM has received 153 death claims and 714 injury claims following their admission. The switches can slip out of the 'on' position, which causes the cars to stall, knocks out power steering and turns off the air bags. The company has set aside $400 million to cover compensation payments, but Feinberg believes that figure could grow to $600 million. Among the most recent cases settled is that of seven year old Trenton Buzard, from New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was paralysed when the car being driven by his great grandmother Esther Matthews lost control due to the faulty switch and ploughed into another vehicle on April 2, 2009. Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch. Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch. He was paralysed when the car being driven by his great grandmother Esther Matthews lost control due to the faulty switch and ploughed into another vehicle on April 2, 2009 . Amy Rademaker, 15,  and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed with the Chevy Cobalt they were passenger in crashed. A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. The company knew about the fault, which affected more than two million cars before the accident in 2006 but failed to initiate a recall to fix the problem. Ms Rademaker's mother Amy Beskau, pictured, settled her case against GM dropping a high-risk legal action . The girls' family accepted the offer after they dropped a lawsuit against the Detroit car giant which could have hidden behind bankruptcy protection in the event of a court case. Margie Beskau, mother of Ms Rademaker told CNBC: 'No amount of money can bring my daughter back. But I'm ready to be done with this.' Ms Beskau, from Woodville, Wisconsin said she feared the company would have invoked its bankruptcy protection if the case had been brought to court. 'We just felt we'd come out better financially and emotionally if we went ahead and settled. There was no guarantee we would win, so this seemed like the right decision to make.' Ms Beskau's daughter was sitting in the passenger seat of the 2005 Chevy Cobalt when the vehicle lost all power due to the defective ignition switch in October 2006. The car careered off the road smashing into some trees. Due to the fault, many of the car's safety systems failed. GM only initiated a recall of the 2.6 million cars fitted with the faulty switches earlier this year. The company has admitted it knew about the flawed switches for at least a decade before issuing a recall. The switches can unexpectedly slip into the 'accessory' position, shutting off the engine and disabling key features such as power-assisted steering, and the car's air bags. Congress and the Justice Department are investigating GM's handling of the recall. The car's driver, Megan Phillips, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, survived the crash but suffered permanent brain damage. The data recorder in her 2005 Cobalt showed that the ignition switch was in 'accessory' at the time of the crash. A Wisconsin state trooper investigating the crash made the connection between the defective switch and the air bags not deploying. A report commissioned by GM, and a separate report from a Congressional committee on the role of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said both the company and regulators were aware of the trooper's finding but largely ignored it for years. The automaker has set aside $400 million in its compensation fund and may pay out up to $600 million.","GM fitted the faulty switch to more than 2.6 million cars over the past decade .

"A mother of two locked in a £11million divorce battle claims she is facing discrimination because she sacrificed her high-flying career to be a housewife. Julia Hammans, 55, worked as a financial director for a major department store during the early years of her marriage to Nicholas Hammans. When she became pregnant with their first child she agreed to give up her job to care for the family, the High Court heard yesterday. Divorce battle: High-flying Julia Hammans (left), who gave up her career as a financial director to look after her children, is claiming a slice of her ex-husband Nicholas Hammans's (right) fortune . Mr Hammans, 54, went on to carve out a successful career and is now a multi-millionaire partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Last year he earned £800,000. After the couple split up in 2004, Mrs Hammans was awarded the £1.75million six-bedroom Edwardian family home in Middlesex, as part of an interim divorce settlement. But in March this year, Mr Justice Coleridge, sitting in the High Court Family Division, ordered her to sell the home to part-fund her living expenses. She had sought a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, but the judge told Mr Hammans to pay only £400,000. He ruled that she needed £80,000 a year, which she could generate largely herself from interest on her £1million in savings and by moving home. Family home: After a judge divided the family fortune - which Mrs Hammans values at £11million - she says her income is 10 times smaller than that of Mr Hammans, and she is being forced to sell her £1.75million home in Twickenham, Middlesex . Property: Mr Hammans also lives in a £1million-plus house in Twickenham (pictured), as well as enjoying a holiday home in Paris, and the court heard he earned £800,000 last year . At the Court of Appeal yesterday her lawyer, Patrick Chamberlayne QC, argued she should be given an extra £2.2million so she could keep her house. He said: ‘It clearly is discriminatory that wives have to jump through these hurdles in order to qualify for a fair outcome. 1983: Julia Hammans, a finance director for department store Dickens and Jones marries accountant Nicholas Hammans . 1989: Mrs Hammans becomes pregnant and the couple 'agree' she will give up work. 2005: The couple divorce, Mrs Hammans is awarded the £1.75million family home, as part of a larger settlement. March 2014: After Mrs Hammans requests a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, a the family judge at the High Court rules Mr Hammans should pay just £400,000. He says the £400,000 sum, plus money from the sale of the house and interest on her £1million savings, would produce around £2million - giving her the £80,000-a-year he said she needed to live on. October 2014: At the Court of Appeal, Mrs Hammans argues she deserves £2.2million, in addition to the £400,000, and should be free to keep her house. ‘There ought to be an acknowledgement of what she has given up, but there has not been. Lip service is being paid to it, and she has to sell her house. ‘The judge provided no explanation of why he considered it appropriate for the wife to sell the home she received in the 2005 settlement. It was her family home and dear to her and was worth £1.75million. ‘Husband and wife are left in radically different positions by this judgement and that cannot be right. ‘This wife proved she had given up a well-paid lucrative career – that is enough.’ Mr Chamberlayne insisted the house was ‘a perfectly appropriate standard of accommodation for the wife to live in for the rest of her life, given the available assets in the case’. Mrs Hammans was on the board of Dickins and Jones, which now trades as House of Fraser, and was earning a similar salary to her husband soon after they married in 1983. Her barrister said her ex-husband’s career had in part taken off ‘through her investment, her sacrifice’. He added: The husband and wife started their careers at exactly the same time. ‘Both qualified as chartered accountants. She became pregnant in 1989 and, by agreement, gave up work to care for the family. ‘By this time she was a finance director of the Dickins and Jones Group with a seat on the board…earning the same as the husband.’ Court: Mrs Hammans is challenging what she says was an unfair division of marital wealth at the Court of Appeal, and is seeking a further £2.2million . Mr Hammans has re-married and has two young children with his new wife, lives in a £1.5million house in the same part of Middlesex . She believes it is unfair she should be forced to sell the family home simply because her income is ten times smaller than that of her former husband. The ex-couple had two children, who are now both grown up. Mr Hammans, who has re-married and has two young children with his new wife, lives in a £1.5million house in the same part of Middlesex and has a holiday home in Paris. Lord Justice Moore-Bick – sitting with Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Ryder – said: ‘It seems to me the wife is saying “I gave up my career. If I had not, I would have a lot of money in the bank and, post-divorce, would have been able to carry on with my career for the rest of my working life and live on the proceeds”. ‘When deciding what is fair, is it inappropriate to look at the consequences of giving up one’s career?’ Philip Marshall QC, acting for Mr Hammans, insisted his client’s ex-wife ‘has been properly and fairly treated’. He agreed that it was important to ‘avoid discrimination by giving equal value to the contribution of the breadwinner and the homemaker’. But Mr Marshall argued that Mr Justice Coleridge had taken Mrs Hammans’ loss of career earning into account by valuing her needs ‘generously’ at £80,000 a year. He said that Mrs Hammans lived in a home with three reception rooms and six bedrooms by herself. He insisted that a move to a £1.25million four-bedroom house in the same area ‘did not amount to a drop in her standard of living’. The judges will give their ruling at a later date.","Julia Hammans married accountant Nicholas Hammans in 1983 .

"The significant rise in families choosing to home school their children has raised concerns from public and government bodies. In Australia, home schooling is recognised as a legitimate way of providing for the educational needs of children, and increasingly parents are deciding to educate their children through the non-traditional method. Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required to undergo some form of education, and while less than 1% of children in Australia are home schooled, the New South Wales Board of Studies reported a 40% increase in the number of those home schooled from 2009 to 2013. It has been estimated that up to 10,000 children in NSW are being home schooled for reasons including ideological or religious views, bullying in schools, or a belief that the traditional method of formal education is failing a new generation of Australians. Mum-of-five Lindy Hadges has homeschooled all five of her children is an advocate for the method . 'I was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on. I couldn't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing,' Lindy said . This is the case for mum-of-five Lindy Hadges, who chose to home school all of her children. 'From very early on after I had my first child, I heard people talking about what preschool they were going to send their child to,' Lindy said. 'I was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on. I couldn't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing.' 'It's so important for parents to pass on values and that takes time. If their children are gone for 6 to 8 hours of the day that's the best time.' 'It seems unnatural to me that a young baby could walk and talk without needing lessons, and yet it was just accepted that they would need to be handed over to experts to learnt to read and write.' For the state governments, finding the right balance between allowing parents their given right to educate their children in the method they see fit and ensuring that these children all receive a comparable level of education that prepares them for work or further study has proven a difficult task. 'When I first started out 21 years ago, people were so critical. There was a lot of fear and anxiety and but now that I've been out of the box for so long I've developed more strength and balance,' Lindy said. 'In the beginning, you were a criminal if you did it. I would put it on the level of persecution, but it was just a fear-based response. Back then, it was so unknown that people immediately felt threatened.' 'Now, it's much more common. Pretty much everyone talk to knows someone who is homeschooled and it's much more encouraging,' she said. However, the learning structure for the Hadley's is quite different to those in traditional education, and according to Lindy, allows for greater freedom of mind. 'We make sure all our learning happens in positive environments. We sit in a circle in the sunshine, or cuddled up together in bed.' 'What we learn is very directed by what the children are interested in. We get to have long discussions and jump into different aspects of a book, like the history of the setting, or grammar, or the author, or moral questions.' 'I don't like that in school these are all so divided. Learning should be a wholistic experience so that children stay inspired with the joy of learning.' Registration for home schooling is compulsory in many states, including NSW, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland, but as education curriculum and requirements varies depending on the state, understanding the desires and needs of those involved is often barred by red tape and unreliable statistics. Many in the home schooling community have responded to this, with a group of Central Coast home educators forming a petition that protests against what they view as unnecessary paperwork and unreasonable standards which make it more difficult to home school children. The Home Education Association collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue of home schooling, which was lodged in parliament by Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein (above) Terry Harding, general manager of the Christian Education Ministry said that in an era of rapid change for education, home schooling was significantly increasing. 'It is important for governments to recognise such changes and developments, and move to accommodate them on the Australian educational landscape,' Mr Harding said. The Home Education Association collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue, which was lodged in parliament by Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein, reported The Daily Telegraph. Many parents choose to educate their children at home in order to allow what they see as a much more natural development, and to allow them to spend quality time together as a family that can be denied by traditional education. 'These are human beings. They need time to understand how they function and live in the world,' said Lindy. 'I see homeschooling as a wonderful opportunity to train my child carefully. Instead of throwing my child into the deep end of the pool, I can take my child's hand and walk into the shallow end, help him through to the deep end and then let go.' 'We spend so much time together, and I really think that children who are homeschooled are much more emotionally mature because everything is a negotiation.' 'They are much less jaded and have a lot more agency for life.' Lindy said that many parents choose to educate their children at home because of bullying in schools, and in order to remove the competitive element from learning. 'Why should children compete for their education? That is barbarous,' said Lindy. 'The whole system should be overhauled. Traditional education turns off the joy of learning, and teaches them to walk a treadmill.' 'It's a great danger to do that to any mind.' Terry Harding, general manager of the Christian Education Ministry said that in an era of rapid change for education, home schooling was significantly increasing . In response to the growth of home education, and amid concerns regarding child welfare in homeschool environments, a Legislative inquiry was launched in May by the NSW Government, which received submissions until August. Hundreds of submissions were made by parents, lobby groups, teachers’ unions and government departments, many of whom expressed a frustration with the limitations traditional school education placed on their families and with the expectations outlined in the state governments home schooling package which was released in 2013. 'Employees from the home school unit can either be supportive of the method or against it, and you never really know who you're going to get,' Lindy said. 'All of the people on the board have gone through traditional school educations and are completely ignorant. There's a huge spectrum of opinions in the home schooling community, and we'd like to see that reflected on the board.' 'It's a very combative approach, as they're a very critical authority. We are much more open and fluid and operate outside of the system and we'd prefer to be addressed that way than always be in conflict, which is very inflammatory.' The Department of Family and Community Services noted in their submission that there were concerns that home schooling provided the potential for masking child abuse, 'as there are fewer opportunities for those outside the home to note possible concerns and to raise any necessary alarms'. The submission also raised the issue of the lack of peer interaction, noting that 'the quality of interaction between peers in a classroom can enhance the learning experience.' Lindy stressed the point that the lack of socialisation for homeschooled children is a myth. 'The homeschool network is so large and varied, in terms of background and ages, that homeschooled children probably have a wider social network than children who attend school and are in a class with peers who are only their age,' she said. 'There are excursions on all the time, so if you wanted to meet with others you could do so morning and afternoon, five days a week.' 'The younger are lead by the older, and the family unit is kept together, which creates a much stronger bond. It's very positive thing for the community to have families like that.' 'Some might consider it a drawback that they will take longer to fit into the system of work, and that can make waves, but I'd rather have that than have someone who’s mind is turned off.' 'My children have all been raised freethinkers, and I'd much rather have that than a numbing of the brain.' 'They have a stronger sense of who they are and haven’t become detatched by the mindlessness of the traditional school system. If they have to learn to navigate a system I'd rather have them do that at 18 or 21 rather than when they're five.'","Up to 10,000 children are homeschooled in NSW and there has been a 40% increase in the past four years .

"Stephen Turnbull woke up in a hotel room in Bury in December, 2006 and switched on the television. There it was – his picture on BBC World News. ‘I thought I was dreaming. Actually, I thought it was a nightmare,’ he recalls. It wasn’t. Turnbull – on loan at Bury from Hartlepool United – had just helped the Shakers into the third round of the FA Cup following a 3-1 victory over Chester in a second-round replay. Stephen Turnbull pictured celebrating scoring the equaliser for Blyth Spartans against Hartlepool . Turnbull (centre) celebrates alongside fellow goalscorer Jarrett Rivers (right) at the end of the game . The TV relayed the news: Bury have been expelled from the FA Cup after fielding an ineligible player. ‘It was me,’ says Turnbull. ‘There was a mix-up between the secretaries and I wasn’t registered. It was awful. We were in the third round.’ Six years on, Turnbull and seventh tier Blyth Spartans of the Northern League are very much in the third round – and once again it is the midfielder making the headlines. It was against his former club Hartlepool at Victoria Park on Friday night – on a ground where he had never scored – that Turnbull curled home what Alan Shearer described as ‘the best free-kick I’ve ever seen’ to level the scores before he laid on the winning goal in the last minute for Jarrett Rivers. ‘I’d been practising them all week in training and couldn’t hit a barn door,’ laughs the 27-year-old, whose twin brother, Phil, plays for Gatsehead against Warrington in the second round this afternoon. ‘I said to Robbie Dale, “I’m going to hit this”. Never in my dreams did I think I’d catch it like I did. It didn’t just go in the top corner, it curled into the side-netting. ‘Afterwards, our manager, Tom Wade, said that Alan Shearer said it was the best free-kick he’d ever seen. Wow. That’s good enough for me.’ Turnbull’s goal, however, had merely made possible a replay at Croft Park. But the Spartans – one of the competitions most celebrated minnows who made it to the fifth round in 1978 – weren’t done there.

With the clock having ticked into the 90th minute, Turnbull found Rivers, the newsagent. ‘I gave him the ball, it was a good pass, and I just thought, “Go on, run at them”,’ he says. That, he did. Jinking into the area, dropping his shoulder one way and throwing a step-over the other before firing into the back of the net. ‘Unbelievable,’ says Turnbull. ‘It was just incredible.’ It was all a far cry from Turnbull’s existence as an engineer on a P&O cruiseliner, where he spent five months in a boiler room earlier this year. Turnbull's winning goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Blyth's fans as they reached the FA Cup 3rd round . ‘I never thought I’d be scoring goals on the TV and playing in the third round of the FA Cup when I was stuck in that room at sea,’ he says. ‘I can’t wait for Monday’s draw – at least I know we’ll definitely be playing in it this time.’ Turnbull is back in the news, this time for all of the right reasons.","Stephen Turnbull was ineligible in Bury's 2006 FA Cup win over Chester .

"Before finding money and fame as a professional footballer, Alexis Sanchez grew up in the poor mining town of Tocopilla, Chile, where he discovered his talents kicking a ball along the dusty streets as a boy. Speaking in an interview with The Times, the 25-year-old reflected on his fondness for his hometown and how every year the local authorities would dish out Christmas gifts from the back of a pick-up truck - a tradition held in Tocopilla for as long as he can remember. 'It was people from the council on the truck... I said to myself when I was young that one day, if I ever had the chance, I would do the same, but instead of sweets, I would throw footballs.' Alexis Sanchez has scored 14 goals in 22 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal this season . Sanchez has said he is enjoying life in north London and has become a firm fan favourite at the Emirates . Despite a rapid rise to fame for the skillful 25-year-old, Sanchez remains level-headed in his approach . Despite making a fortune in European football, coming from such humble beginnings has kept the Arsenal and Chile star's feet firmly on the ground following his £30million move to the Gunners. 'In my head I do not feel like a famous person. I am just normal, no different to someone in the street. I am just a kid who happens to play football. 'When I play I don't think about how much I cost. I just try to enjoy myself like it's the first match I ever played. Moving away from his home in Chile the forward has had spells with Udinese and Spanish giants Barcelona . 'When I was younger, I played football on the streets, on a scrap of land, wherever I could. I had to apologise to the neighbours a few times for breaking windows, like all kids. Quite a few times actually! 'We did not have a pitch or anything like that. We would put down two rocks and that was the goal. 'It did not bother me no to have proper boots or a good pitch. It was enough to be with my friends and playing. It's no different now... I just love playing.' Sanchez's start to life in the Premier League has seen him net nine times for the Gunners, making him the third top goalscorer in the top flight.

"The International Olympic Committee is set to bring in the biggest shake-up of the Games since 1999 when a raft of new proposals are put to the vote. The IOC session in Monaco is expected to agree to scrap the current limit of 28 sports in the summer Olympics but maintain a maximum number of athletes at 10,500 - a decision which will put pressure on some of the bigger sports such as swimming and athletics to reduce the number of events. There are also proposals to make bidding to host Games more attractive and less costly - something that was brought sharply into focus when it was announced only Beijing and Almaty are bidding for host the 2022 winter Olympics. The proposed changes are part of IOC president Thomas Bach's Olympic Agenda 2020 recommendations . The proposals to be voted on during the session on Monday and Tuesday are contained within the Olympic Agenda 2020 recommendations being put forward by IOC president Thomas Bach. There could be opposition to some measures however - senior IOC members believe there could be calls to reintroduce visits by members to bidding cities. These were banned following the Salt Lake City corruption scandal in 1999, the last time the IOC brought in such significant changes. The decision by Bach to maintain an age limit of 70 for IOC members - with a few limited exceptions permitted - may also provoke opposition. In February, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is also an IOC member, called the limit 'discrimination'. Bach proposed that the number of sports should increase but the number of athletes should remain the same . Blatter, 78, said then: 'Imposing an age limit is an act of discrimination. What needs to be changed can be done by a democratic way. 'Simply do not elect a member not because of age but because they are not able to do the work. It is not normal to impose age limits.' Changes to IOC bidding rules could also make it easier for countries in very hot climates to win the right to host the summer Games, by allowing it to be staged at different times of year to the traditional July/August slot, and with more flexibility in putting on some events in a different city or even different country. If passed, the new rules mean the contest for the 2024 Olympics could feature two cities from the Middle East including Qatar capital Doha. FIFA president and IOC member said the proposed age limits for members was 'discrimination' IOC member Prince Feisal Al Hussein, from Jordan, said last month he expects one or two bids from the Middle East for 2024. Prince Feisal said: 'We have already seen in the 2020 Olympic Games we have an Arab country that looked to be a candidate city to host the Games and for 2024 we expect other Middle East countries that might consider putting themselves forward. 'I would expect that we will find one or two countries will be putting themselves into the bidding process and it is a question of what they have and what it takes to meet the IOC requirements and whether they deserve the opportunity to host the Games.'","International Olympic committee set to announce shake-up of the games .

But the American Persian cat is more to the Spaniard than a fun photography project: he's helped him keep busy and stay positive after being made redundant from his job at a Spanish TV network. Jesus is now on a mission to get the fluffy kitten's face seen all around the world after creating calenders and postcards of Napoleon on crowd funding site, Indiegogo. Jesus said: 'When I first got Napoleon he was only a two months, everything was new for him, every daily detail was a discovery. Jesus says little Napoleon has helped him keep busy and stay positive after being made redundant from his job at a Spanish TV network . The former cameraman sometimes uses sets, such as this nest of wool, for the cute pictures . Jesus now hopes Napoleon will find worldwide fame through calenders and postcards . Jesus says the kitten's natural expressions lend themselves to a variety of odd scenarios . 'Watching him I thought, what if he could experience fantastic or absurd situations, so that was my starting point. 'Since the beginning he always had very expressive reactions, when he's tired he almost looks angry and when he's relaxed his eyebrows make him look sad. 'The images are half real and half digital, at first I draw a basic sketch of the image I want to create and then I make a list of real things I need for the set. Some of the photos see Napoleon re-enact famous film scenes such as the shower scene from Psycho . Little Napoleon looks set to be the next feline hit as Jesus hopes to raise money on crowd funding site, Indiegogo . 'I worked as a cameraman for 12 years, but a year and a half ago, the TV network I was working for fired 900 workers. 'I felt desperate and unfortunately found myself with too much free time so I began taking pictures of Napoleon as a way of filling my free time. 'Napoleon is so curious, that's why I never let him on each set until I am ready to take the photos, his first reactions on set are the most amusing. 'Everybody loves the pictures and they always ask me if Napoleon's expressions are real but believe me, all his gestures are completely real.'","Napoleon's expressive face features in bizarre and adorable situations .

"A Southern California computer science student has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for hacking the computers of a future Miss Teen USA and other young women to try to force them to send nude photographs or undress on camera for him. Twenty-year-old Jared James Abrahams pleaded guilty in November to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access of a computer, after his arrest in September. The Temecula resident was sentenced Monday by a federal judge in Orange County judge. Going to prison: Jared James Abrahams plead guilty to the extortion charges in November and was sentenced in Orange County, California court on Monday . Victim: Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf was one of a dozen women hacked by Abrahams. She went to the same high school as Abrahams . Abrahams was allowed to speak at the sentencing hearing, and took the opportunity to apologize to his victims - including current Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf. Abrahams attended the same high school as Wolf and sent her an anonymous email last spring, claiming to have nude pictures of her and that he could post online if she didn't send him more photos. Tell someone: Before she was crowned Miss Teen USA, Wolf reported the threatening email to police. Above, Wolf attends the 59th Viennese Opera Ball in New York City on February 21 . In court on Monday, Abrahams expressed his 'immense sorrow' for the victims, specifically his former classmate. 'First off, I send out my sympathies to Miss Cassidy, her mother...I understand nothing I saw will take back the fear and pain I brought,' Abrahams said. 'I did what I did and I must live with my actions,' he added. His mother also spoke at the hearing, and went on to describe how his poor decisions were in part influenced by having autism. She says Abrahams was diagnosed with the mental health disorder when he was just 12 years old, and had struggled to make friends most of his life. 'I don't think anyone can understand how lonely he's been for 20 years,' his mother told the judge. Abrahams himself said he was feeling better after enrolling in two therapeutic programs for adults with autism, one at UCLA and the other at Loma Linda University Medical Center. He says therapy has been helpful in teaching him how to make friends. 'Everything I did was to have a feeling of a sense of involvement,' Abrahams said. While prosecutors were pushing for a 21-month sentence, Judge James V Selna decided on a lesser 18 months because of Abrahams age and mental health issues. 'I don't think autism is an excuse for his actions,' Selna said. Wolf's mother agrees. She also had the opportunity to speak at the hearing and confronted her daughter's attacker, calling him a 'sexual predator'. 'There are no words to describe what you did to my daughter,' Wolf's mother said. Turning her attention to the judge, she continued to say that she and her daughter 'lived in terror' because Abrahams threatened to send stalkers to their home and that they 'jumped' every time they heard the doorbell ring when they weren't expecting visitors. 'She was a minor and he was an adult at the time,' she said. 'That's child pornography and I consider Jared Abrahams a sexual predator.' Walked the same halls: Wolf attended the same high school as her attacker . Advocate: Wolf (left) is using her year as Miss Teen USA to teach girls her age about internet safety . Abrahams will have to serve at least 85 per cent of his sentence behind bars, and will be placed under restrictive supervision once released. That supervision will include restrictions on his computer use to be determined by his probation officer. He will also be required to undergo mental health treatment and to stay away from his victims . Abrahams must self-report to prison by June 16. Authorities say Abrahams hacked into the computers of several women and was then able to control their webcams and surreptitiously photograph them. Abrahams directly extorted at least 12 women across the world, but also hacked into an addition 100 to 150 computers. After hacking into his victims computers and taking pictures without their consent, Abrahams would send them emails and threaten to post the pictures if they didn't send him more nude photos, record a nude video or log into Skype to strip for him. Pressured: At least two of Abrahams victims agreed to strip for him on webcam after receiving his scary threats. Above,  Wolf is crowned Miss Teen USA in August . His extortion scheme was successful in that two women stripped for him in Skype and received webcam photos from other women in Southern California, Baltimore and Russia. After being threatened by Abrahams, a victim in Ireland wrote him an email agreeing to get on Skype. 'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' she said according to the court record. Abrahams shot an email back, saying: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals. Also age doesn't mean a thing to me!!!' In an interview with the Today Show, Wolf described the terrifying moment she was threatened by Abrahams in March 2013. Wolf, who was crowned Miss Teen USA last August, says she received the anonymous email that threatened to turn her 'dream of being a model...into (her being) a porn star' if she didn't give him a 'special performance'. Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . 'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out. 'I wasn't aware that somebody was watching me [on my webcam],' she added. 'The light [on the camera] didn't even go on, so I had no idea.' Instead of giving into his demands, Wolf called her mom who reported the incident to police and an investigation was launched. Wolf has been using her year as Miss Teen USA to spread awareness of internet safety to girls her age. 'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.'","Jared James Abrahams pleaded guilty to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access to a computer last November .

"Two convicted murderers were being hunted by police tonight after both went on the run from open prisons with fellow inmates in a bizarre coincidence over the weekend. Daniel Shankly, 30, vanished from HMP Leyhill in south Gloucestershire on Saturday, while the following day 27-year-old Lewis Hoare walked out of Spring Hill Open Prison, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Police were warning members of the public not to approach either of the men, who had both disappeared along with another inmate from their respective prisons. On the run: Daniel Shankly, 30, (left) vanished from HMP Leyhill in south Gloucestershire on Saturday while the following day 27-year-old Lewis Hoare (right) walked out of Spring Hill Open Prison, near Aylesbury . Shankly, who was sentenced to life behind bars in 2001 for the murder of disabled Timothy Young, vanished alongside 29-year-old Daniel Wynne, although police said they may have split up since leaving the prison. Shankly, who has links to Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, is described as white, about 6ft 3ins and of slim build. He has short brown spiky hair, is clean shaven and has a tattoo on his right upper arm with the words 'RIP Nan'. Wynne, who was serving a two-year sentence for assault, has links to the Caerphilly area of South Wales. He is described as white, 5ft 7in and of stocky build. He has a shaved head, speaks with a Welsh accent and has a tattoo on his left arm with the name 'Danny'. Inmates: Shankly vanished alongside 29-year-old Daniel Wynne (left), while Hoare left prison with fellow inmate Kenneth Simmonds, 43 (right) An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'They were last seen at about 12.50pm and failed to appear for the 4.45pm roll call. 'It is believed they absconded together but it is possible they may have split up after they left HMP Leyhill. 'We would like members of the public who spot both or either of the men to contact us via the 999 emergency number. 'We would advise anyone spotting the men not to approach them but call us immediately.' In a separate incident, police launched a manhunt for  Hoare - who was jailed for eight years in 2007 for the brutal murder of a former Royal Navy worker - after he left his low security complex with fellow inmate Kenneth Simmonds. Hoare, 27, was part of a gang who kicked and punched pensioner Brian Kitching, aged 68, to death in a seafront rock garden after one of them falsely accused him of being paedophile. Meanwhile, Simmonds, 43, was said to be in prison for malicious wounding. Police were tonight warning the public not to make contact with the convicts, who walked out of Spring Hill at around 1pm yesterday. Hoare was described slim, with blue eyes, short brown hair, clean shaven, with a mole on his right cheek, protruding ears and a tattoo with the word 'Pompy' across his knuckles. Simmonds is of medium build, with blue eyes, short brown hair, clean shaven, with a small scar under his left eye, a scar above his right eyebrow, a tattoo of a panther on his left forearm and a tattoo of a panther's head on his right arm forearm. Detective Inspector Joe Banfield from Thames Valley Police said: 'Thames Valley Police is working closely with the Prison Service to try and locate Hoare and Simmonds, who walked out of Spring Hill Open Prison at about 1pm yesterday. 'If any member of the public sees either Hoare or Simmonds do not approach them, instead call 999.'","Daniel Shankly vanished from HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire on Saturday .

"From an eerie-looking android to a smartphone-controlled dinosaur, Japanese companies are out in full force to demonstrate their robotic prowess. The technology is being shown by exhibitors at Ceatec 2014 in Japan, which is taking place in Chiba, near Tokyo until October 11. One of the most popular devices is TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid. Scroll down for video . Japan's electronics giant Toshiba unveils the humanoid robot 'Aiko Chihira' which demonstrates sign language at the Ceatec electronics trade show in Chiba, suburban Tokyo . A smartphone application makeS the dinosaur walk or jump, while a shake of the smartphone prompts the TE Saurus to bark. TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app. Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits. One of the most popular devices is TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid . Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot which is capable of playing a relaxed ping pong playmate. It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path . Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’ To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding. Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark. And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return. 'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager. 'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something. 'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.' Toshiba also demonstrated its life-like communications android named Ms Aiko Chihira. Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans. Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.' At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese. But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020. The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people. Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance. 'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

"The bridal shop in Ohio where a nurse shopped right before she came down with Ebola is having a blowout sale to make up for the three weeks they spent sanitizing the space and scaring potential customers. The Coming Attractions Bridal Shop in Akron was open on Tuesday at 11 a.m. after taking all the measures required to ensure that it was Ebola free after nurse Amber Vinson looked for bridesmaids dresses there there right before falling ill. The store's owner Anna Younker told Cleveland.com that Vinson didn't even try on dresses there, only her bridesmaids did. Reopened: The Coming Attractions Bridal Shop was open on Tuesday at 11 a.m. after taking all the measures required to ensure that it was Ebola free after nurse Amber Vinson visited there before falling ill . Didn't try on dresses:  The store's owner Anna Younker said that Vinson didn't even try on dresses there, only her bridesmaids did but people feared shopping there nonetheless . Younker put all of the items in the store on sale so that she could win back customers following widespread panic, she told ABC. 'It was totally blown out of proportion,' Younker said. 'When I talked with the CDC and the health department, they said the fear people had of not knowing what was going on was similar to AIDS.' Younker said that one customer returned a $2,000 dress because she feared her guests at the wedding would be too afraid to hug her if she wore it. Someone even called the store to see if someone had died of Ebola there. 'We'll see if it sticks in people's heads,' Younker said. 'As long as there are people here trying on merchandise and buying it, then they'll support the store.' Ebola free: Workers in hazmat suits cleaned the store to make sure it was Ebola free for future shoppers . All dressed in white: Cleaners in hazmat suits matched the white bridal dresses lined throughout the store . One such Customer was Courtney Jones who says she doesn't fear getting Ebola from shopping at the store. 'I don't think there is anything to be afraid of,' said Jones. Younker is marking down her items by 60 per cent and so far it's worked to lure a steady intake of shoppers . 'I've never had a 60 percent off sale, ' said Younker. The store's website tells potential customers that all their 'dream dresses' are on sale, not just a few. 'We have a beautiful showroom in Akron that sets the standard of service by offering a relaxed atmosphere where our customers can feel confident in choosing the bridal gown of their dreams. We feature bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses as well as a beautiful selection of ball gowns and party dresses for all occasions,' says the site. The Facebook event states that 21 guests attended the store's re-opening. Vinson was declared Ebola free on October 28. 'I am so grateful to be well,' Vinson said at an afternoon news conference where her discharge was announced.","The Coming Attractions Bridal Shop was open on Tuesday at 11 a.m. after taking all the measures required to ensure that it was Ebola free .

"A devout Catholic Australian couple, who have been married for 55 years, stumped the Vatican this week when they gave a speech about the importance of sexual intimacy in marriage. Ron and Mavis Pirola, from Coogee in Sydney's eastern suburbs, addressed more than 182 bishops and the Pope during the synod in which they spoke about the importance of family life and shared their belief that 'sexual intercourse' is the fullest expression of marriage. 'That attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual,' the chair-couple of the Australian Catholic Marriage and Family Council said in their speech. Scroll down for video . Ron and Mavis Pirola, from Coogee in Sydney, addressed 182 bishops and the Pope during the synod . 'The little things we did for each other, the telephone calls and love notes, the way we planned our day around each other and the things we shared were outward expressions of our longing to be intimate with each other. 'Gradually we came to see that the only feature that distinguishes our sacramental relationship from that of any other good Christ-centred relationship is sexual intimacy and that marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse.' The synod, which will be held over a fortnight, will see a total of 13 couples speak about their experiences in an effort to help the Catholic Church approach the subjects of family with their modern day followers. Following the Pirola's speech, British cardinal, Vincent Nichols told the Guardian: 'That's not what we bishops talk about mostly, quite honestly.' They were one of 13 couples invited to speak about their experiences in an effort to help the Church approach the subjects of family with modern day Catholics . 'But to hear that as the opening contribution did, I think, open an area ... and it was a recognition that that is central to the well-being of marriage often.' But an unconcerned Mr Pirola told Daily Mail Australia that there was nothing controversial about his speech. 'There was nothing we said that is not fully in keeping with the church's teaching,' he said. 'In regard to sex it should be fairly obvious – were a married couple why else would you get married? You want to be intimate with each other because you are in love and that leads to children and that's what marriage is all about; loving each other and wanting to spread that love. Following the Pirola's speech at the Vatican (pictured) British cardinal, Vincent Nichols admitted: 'That's not what we bishops talk about mostly, quite honestly' 'That attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual,' the couple said in their speech . 'People seem surprised but it's just common sense. It's just natural and all of the bishops we've spoken to are quite supportive and happy.' Further along in their speech, the Pirolas also told the Vatican of their Christian friends whose 'gay son said he wanted to bring his partner home' to a Christmas gathering. 'They fully believed in the Church's teachings and they knew their grandchildren would see them welcome the son and his partner into the family. Their response could be summed up in three words, ""He is our son"".' 'Gradually we came to see that... marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse,' their speech said . Despite admitting that he and his wife were careful when wording the anecdote, Mr Pirola again insisted that the opinion their voiced was in keeping with the church's teaching. 'The general point we were making was in context of a broader point… The church is trying to promote clear values to society and so it has rules, regulations and doctrines – but the overarching thing about the church is that it must spread love. 'How do you show love to a person and at the same time uphold a different values - this is something parents face all the time with their children. We don't think parents should agree with everything their children want to do, they must uphold certain values but but most of all their children need to feel their love.'","Ron and Mavis Pirola addressed 182 bishops and the Pope during the synod .

"A Sainsbury's poster urging staff to encourage customers to spend more money in the supermarket was accidentally placed on the front window of a store, making it visible to passers-by. The sign - which urged staff to try to make shoppers ‘spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip’ - was spotted by TV freelancer Chris Dodd outside the store in Stratford, east London. He posted a photograph of the sign on Twitter and it has since been retweeted more than 2,500 times, with Sainsbury's confirming that the poster was ‘intended for colleague areas in the store’.

The sign - with pictures of a purse and 50p coin - said: ‘Fifty pence challenge: Let’s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year-end.’ Mr Dodd tweeted Sainsbury's last night, saying: ‘Not sure this is supposed to be in your window’, before an employee replied: ‘Yeah, I don't think so either. Which store was this? I'll give them a call.’ But responding to the worker - who identified himself as ‘Ross’ - Mr Dodd then said: ‘Oh I'm not sure about that, Ross... I kinda (sic) like that they're giving folks a heads up!’ Ross replied: ‘Understood.

"As Benedict Cumberbatch announced his engagement to Sophie Hunter in the marriages section of The Times this morning, thousands of hearts shattered across the western world. Hours after the announcement, the internet was alight with wailing women, especially his group of most diehard fans, who call themselves The Cumberbitches (a group who make the Directioners look like lambs in comparison). The British actor has long been seen as one of the hottest bachelors of the showbiz world, with his accomplished career, good looks and public school charm. Scroll down for video . Sophie Hunter, 36,  is an accomplished theatre director. The Londoner (pictured with Benedict Cumberbatch at the French Open earlier this year) also released music album with Guy Chambers performed in 2004 film Vanity Fair opposite Reese Witherspoon . The announcement in today's Times that the pair are to wed. Benedict Cumberbatch chose to break the news in a more traditional format instead of on social media . As the tweets and Facebook messages started flooding in, they included messages like: 'One of the Cumberbatch is engaged. She is Sophie Hunter. More like Sophie Hunt-her. #cumberbitches.' Another wrote: 'Cumberbatch is engaged. Internet explodes. Girl goes into hiding from swarths of #cumberbitches.' And one of the star's biggest devotees said: 'My family and friends have actually messaged me asking if i'm okay cause benedict cumberbatch is engaged.' So who is the woman who bagged one of the UK’s most eligible men? In dating terms, it seems Benedict has well and truly met his match. The 36-year-old Londoner is a theatre director with several critically acclaimed shows under her belt, despite her young age. Twitter was alight with distraught women this morning after the news of Benedict Cumberbatch's engagement surfaced . Like Benedict, Sophie comes from a distinguished family line – her grandfather is the late General Sir James Michael Gow GCB, Knight Grand Cross, Order of the Bath. He was equerry to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in the 1950’s and became Commander-in-Chief British Army of the Rhine and Commander Northag, the Northern Army Group of Nato. She grew up in Hammersmith, west London as the eldest of five children. Her father Charles was an Insurance Executive who went on to become a professional card player and her mother Katharine worked as an administrator, but the couple sadly divorced. Sophie undertook a spot of modelling when she was younger, but has previously confessed that she does not consider herself in the 'beautiful actress' bracket . After developing a love of languages at school, Sophie went on to study French and Italian at Oxford University and then L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris – an education which means she is now fluent in French. It was at Oxford where she met her first long-term boyfriend – the artist Conrad Shawcross and the couple’s early successes in the arts world led them to being seen as one of London’s IT couples. Conrad was ‘one to watch’ for his work with sculptures and in 2004 he was listed in the Observer’s list of 80 Most Talented Young People. He was also a protégé of the art collector Charles Saatchi, who bought one of his early works for £26,000. Sophie in 2005 with her former boyfriend, the famous sculptor Conrad Shawcross . Sophie's success in the arts world made her in demand on the London social scene. Here she is at a party with Razorlight frontman Johny Borrell that was held in The Orangerie of Kensington Palace in west London. Sophie is sporting a fake baby bump . After a few years of dating, Sophie moved in with Conrad – into a converted warehouse that also served as his studio. Sophie said of the relationship at the time: 'We met at Oxford and we were really good friends there, things went from there and we are very happy together.' She continued: ‘To be perfectly honest, I can't imagine getting married. I've got a lot to do before I have children - they are way off.' Although Sophie and Conrad were the darlings of the art world, they eschewed much of the party scene, preferring to hang out in a close knit circle of friends that chooses nights at the theatre over nightclubs and busy bars. During a photo shoot for an interview with The Evening Standard in 2004, she said: ‘I don't go to launches or hang out with stars. 'Posing for the camera like this isn't my career. It's just a small part of it.' Sophie is well known in theatre circles both here and in the US. Here she is with designer Max Osterweis at the Dior and The Weinstein Company's Opening Of ""Picturing Marilyn"" at Milk Gallery in New York on November 9, 2011 . Sophie's attitude towards work has served her career well. Although she isn’t as well known a face among the general public, her CV matches the Sherlock star point for point. She was awarded the prestigious Samuel Beckett Award in 2007 for writing and directing the play The Terrific Electric at The Barbican Theatre in central London when she was just 29 years old, which received rave reviews. She also co-founded the Lacuna Theatre Company and directed several successful plays and operas across Europe, the Middle East and America, including the 2010 revival of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts at Access Theatre on Broadway in New York. In 2012, she directed the North American tour of 69° S. (The Shackleton Project) – a play about the near-fatal 1914-16 Antarctic expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, where the actors used stilts to give the appearance of marionette puppetry. Sophie and Benedict acting together in the 2009 film Burlesque Fairytales . In the interview with the Evening Standard, she said of her work: 'I was always encouraged to think; (my parents) championed the idea of the independent woman. 'You spend a lot of time studying and you want to do something with that. 'Something that's tangible like creating a show, writing a screenplay, making a difference.' While directing and writing plays appear to be her true life’s work, Sophie also has an extensive acting history in both theatre and film. She and Benedict acted together in the 2009 film Burlesque Fairytales, a thriller set one night in a 1930's London theatre. Her breakout acting performance though, was as Maria Osborne in the 2004 film Vanity Fair, starring Reese Witherspoon, where she was hailed as the new Sienna Miller or Keira Knightley. In the same year, she acted alongside Homeland's Damian Lewis in the television film Friends & Crocodiles. The project, which was written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, told the story entrepreneur Paul Reynolds and relationship with his his assistant Lizzie Thomas. Sophie (top and bottom right) featured alongside Damian Lewis (top centre) and Isabel Brook (top and bottom left) in the 2005 film Friends & Crocodiles . Sophie also recorded a French Language album in 2005 with Guy Chambers – the man who wrote the Robbie Williams hit Angels – which is now rather embarrassingly called the Isis Project. Far from being an ode to the newly-formed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the record was in fact a tribute to Guy’s daughter Isis, who was then four. But although she enjoyed working with Guy,  the project was Sophie's only foray into professional singing and she has previously said that she had no interest in becoming a pop star. Sophie in the music video for Cher Isis, written by Guy Chambers . Sophie's career history so far means that she and Benedict are well-placed to understand the work pressures that both inevitably face in their roles. Her experience of the showbiz world will also help when it comes to dealing with Benedict's interest to the public and his legions of fans. As an extremely talented actor and something of a hunk in Hollywood, he has a strong female following called the Cumberbitches. The ladies even have their own tongue-in-cheek Tumblr site called 'Cumberbitch Problems', where they list a number of problems that come with being a Benedict Cumberbatch fan.

"Warring Liberal Democrat MPs were last night told to stop plotting to bring down Nick Clegg. Lib Dem grandee Lord Razzall claimed MPs were rocked by polls predicting humiliation at the next Election , but urged them to rally round the Deputy PM – or face an even bigger defeat in 2015. Lord Razzall, former Lib Dem campaigns chief, compared the ‘manoeuvrings’ of ambitious Lib Dem MPs to the way former party leader Charles Kennedy was toppled after a long-running whispering campaign. Scroll down for video . Lord Razzall, pictured, has asked party colleagues to support their leader and stop the whispering campaign . ‘It looks like some colleagues are preparing for life after Clegg,’ Lord Razzall told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I call on them not to encourage rumours.’ Lord Razzall, whose memoir Chance Encounters reveals he thinks Kennedy was brought down by a ‘conspiracy’, refused to say which MPs he was referring to.

"Taking the trip to the top of Falcon’s Fury, the new tower ride at Busch Gardens in Tampa, is one of the most scenic experiences in Florida. It is 335ft tall and the outward-facing seats provide a stunning view over the park and its surroundings, all the way to the distant sunshine-laden horizon. But then the Fury kicks in. Riders are tilted forward, 33 storeys above the ground, and you realise the only way down is, well, down – at 60mph. On top of the world: Falcon’s Fury is the first drop tower of its kind in the world and it offers breath-taking views of the Tampa area . That, of course, is the full adrenaline-filled purpose of Busch Gardens’ brand new attraction, which soars into the sky like a multi-coloured colossus and offers those brave enough to try it the most thrilling ride in the Sunshine State. It’s brief, but absolutely exhilarating. Falcon’s Fury is the centrepiece of the park’s revamped Pantopia area. It used to be called Timbuktu but everything has been freshened up, with new buildings, new architecture, landscaping, dining options and a hilarious show, Opening Night Critters, featuring a variety of creatures rescued from local animal shelters. Not everyone will be brave enough to face the Fury, so Pantopia features rides and games for the less adrenaline-inclined. But even if you don’t ride it, Fury offers great entertainment as it’s almost as much fun to watch people’s reactions as it is to plunge face-first on the ultra-smooth scream machine yourself. Taking the plunge is also the signature experience of SeaWorld’s Orlando water-park, Aquatica, which debuted another high-level fright-fest this summer in the shape of Ihu’s Breakaway Falls. Drop zone: Falcon's Fury gives thrill-seekers the chance to fly like a bird with a face-first dive toward the ground at breakneck speed . Falcon’s Fury is the centrepiece of the park’s revamped Pantopia area . Aquatica features all manner of family rides and flumes, but Breakaway Falls is another one for thrill junkies. It consists of a set of three capsules that drop riders vertically into enclosed body-slide water chutes. It is imaginatively set up so all three pods face each other, and there is a 3-2-1 countdown – complete with pounding-heartbeat sound effect before riders take the plunge in random fashion, one after another. You never know who will be first to drop, which adds to the excitement. After the breathtaking initial drop, during which everyone screams hysterically, there is then another 400ft of high-speed slide to enjoy on the way to a final splashdown. Not everyone will be brave enough to face the Fury, so Pantopia features rides and games for the less adrenaline-inclined . This is a ride that’s unique in Florida – and one that is also fun just to watch. This year marks SeaWorld’s 50th anniversary as the most popular marine park in the world. The milestone is being marked with a Sea Of Surprises celebration all year, which includes new live entertainment, special animal encounters (notably with some of their rescued animals) and their own Surprise Squad, handing out prizes and special gifts for different park experiences. The major announcement for the future involves a redevelopment of their killer-whale habitat to create a vast environment – the Blue World Project – that will showcase whales in an engaging new way, and create the world’s largest underwater viewing area. At the same time, SeaWorld is extending its array of marine rescue and conservation programmes with a $10 million fund into killer-whale research that will promote ocean health and eco-awareness.","Busch Gardens Tampa's newest attraction is perfect for adrenaline junkies .

"Accused: Kelsey Smith, 20, (pictured) was charged with assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child . A man forced his three-year-old stepdaughter to smell her dirty diaper then slammed her head against a bedpost before choking her to death, according to her five-year-old brother. Kelsey Smith, 20, was arrested Saturday after three-year-old Jeida Torres was found unconscious and unresponsive in a Brooklyn homeless shelter apartment. Smith forced Jeida to smell the dirty diaper then kicked her, banged her head against a bed frame and choked her in a facility for the homeless in Brooklyn, the toddler's older brother said, according to police. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, determining the girl was killed by blunt impact injuries to her head and body, according to spokeswoman Julie Bolcer. Smith, 20, also beat the five-year-old, causing him to bruise, police said. The boy was at a hospital in Brooklyn in stable condition. Police say Smith was watching the girl and her five-year-old brother while their mother Kimberly Torres was at work. He was arrested Sunday and charged by police with assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child under 17. Charges were expected to be upgraded. It wasn't known if Smith had an attorney. He remained hospitalized Monday in Manhattan after allegedly trying to slit his wrists at his mother's Queens home. Attack: Smith was arrested Saturday after New York City police responded to a Brooklyn homeless shelter apartment where the child, Jeida Torres, (pictured left and right) was found unconscious and unresponsive . His mother called police Saturday after having a conversation with him and becoming worried that he might harm himself, police said. Camille Rivera, deputy commissioner for the Department of Homeless Services, said in a statement that officials are investigating the death. Housing Bridge, a homeless services nonprofit, has a contract with the city to run the Brooklyn facility where the beating occurred, said Harry Fried, the group's chief operating officer. Distraught: Kimberly Torres (pictured with her son and daughter) arrived at the scene 30 minutes after Jeida was rushed to the hospital. Police say Smith was watching the girl and her five-year-old brother while their mother was at work . Jeida's five-year-old brother Andrew (pictured left holding hands with his sister) was left covered in bruises during the brutal beating. He was listed in stable condition at the hospital Saturday . He said he wasn't permitted to comment further. Smith, who police said was married to the children's 24-year-old mother, had lived with the family at the Brooklyn apartment for three months. He has 15 prior arrests, including a 2010 arrest for robbery in which police say he slammed a 14-year-old boy into an iron gate, kicked him on the ground, then put his knee on the boy's throat before stealing his wallet with $10 in it, records show. Kimberly Torres (pictured) posted this picture of Jeida as a newborn on her Facebook after the toddler was killed . Smith was 15 at the time of that arrest. He has also been arrested three times while jailed on Rikers Island, charged last October with assault for shoving a correction officer into a door, splashing two correction officers with an unknown liquid in February and flooding a cell by damaging a sprinkler head, causing his cell to flood last November, according to records. His uncle, Mark Almodovar, told the New York Daily News his nephew wasn't a monster but said 'the way he disciplined them was very wrong.' Smith's cousin, Tina Torres, told reporters he did everything he could to save the child. 'He did call his mother crying, saying he just called 911, that she wasn't breathing,' Torres said. 'He called the cops before he left. I called my aunt (Smith's mother) and she was just trying to find his location. She asked him where he was and he refused and hung up on her. She was so upset.'

"Despite regularly changing their roost, bats will choose to lodge with the same social groups of ‘friends’ following each move, claims research. By tracking movements of bats in Oxfordshire woods, researchers discovered that different social groups roost in separate, though adjacent, parts of woodland. The findings have important implications for conservation as bats may not be able to move to another area if a section of woodland is felled. A study carried out over five years in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire has found that bats like to stick together. This image shows a network analysis of how individual bats interact in social groups. Nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands to make the findings . The research was carried out by scientists from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford. Experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different, but closely-related, species living in the same woodland. Bats are pictured roosting together in Oxford . The study was carried out over a five-year period in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. Nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands, and four bats were tagged with lightweight radio-transmitters. The radio tracking showed the bats changed roost site about once every two days. Each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood. Although the bat species occupied the same area of woodland, the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap, suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas. One species, called Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri) forms mixed-sex social groups, while a second species, the Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii), has largely separate male and female groups. Dr Tom August from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who conducted the study, said: ‘When the first results came through it was a real eureka moment, I hadn’t expected to see so many separate social groups in the woodland.’ The study was carried out over a five-year period in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. Nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands, and four bats were tagged with tiny lightweight radio-transmitters to enable them to be tracked. The radio tracking showed that the bats changed roost site frequently - about once every two days. Each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood. Although the two bat species occupied the same area of woodland, the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap, suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas. The relationships between bats in the same social groups were found to be enduring, in many cases lasting more than a year. Dr Mathews from the University of Exeter who led the research team added: ‘This work has really important practical implications for bat conservation. The research at Wytham Woods (shown on map) was carried out by scientists from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford . Experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different, but closely-related species living in the same woodland. One species, called Natterer’s bat (shown left), forms mixed-sex social groups, while a second species, the Daubenton’s bat (right), has largely separate male and female groups. ‘We now realise that although social groups of woodland bats ‘move house’ every few days, they remain within a very small geographical range. ‘This means that even quite small-scale tree felling may destroy all the roosts potentially available to a group.' The research has highlighted that the social networks of animals are poorly understood, but they are ‘fundamentally important to processes ranging from information transfer to the spread of disease’. Dr Matthews concluded: ‘Just as some types of people are super-connected on Facebook, this work shows that in animal systems, two very closely related species living in the same habitat can have very different kinds of social network.’ The findings are published in the journal Plos One.","Study was carried out over five years in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire .

"A contingent of National Guard troops was dispatched to a Hawaii town on Thursday to provide security to the Big Island community threatened by a river of molten lava that is slowly creeping toward the town's main road, an emergency official said. The lava flow from the Kilauea volcano has been slithering toward the village of Pahoa for weeks and at last watch was advancing at less than five miles an hour, said Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense. On Thursday morning, a contingent of 83 National Guard troops was traveling in a road convoy and expected to arrive later in the day in the community, where some residents have expressed concern about potential looters targeting evacuated homes. Scroll Down for Video . HVO geologists walk over the surface of the flow to track surface breakouts along a portion of the flow margin of the  Kilauea Volcano lava flow that threatens Coastal Village, in Pahoa, Hawaii . This Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2014 photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows an aerial view of the lava flow over Cemetery Road and Apa?a Street near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii. Rain fell Wednesday on a red-hot river of lava as it threatened to consume its first home on its slow advance into a rural Hawaii town. (AP Photo/U.S. Geological Survey) ""These are local troops, people from the community. They'll be here working to take care of their family and friends,"" Oliveira told a news conference. The lava threatens to destroy homes and cut off a road and a highway through Pahoa, but officials have not offered any predictions on when exactly it could bisect the town of about 800 residents at the site of an old sugar plantation. No homes have been destroyed so far, and a finger of lava that threatens one house on the edge of town has not advanced closer to the evacuated structure since Wednesday night, Oliveira said. The lava remained about 100 feet from the home, he said. Meanwhile, the glowing leading edge of the lava flow is now about 160 yards from Pahoa Village Road, the main street through the town of almost 1,000, officials said in a statement. The flow enters private property and approaches an earthen berm, pictured in the lower left corner, that a homeowner built in an attempt to divert the lava . Residents of about 50 dwellings in what civil defense officials called a ""corridor of risk"" have been asked to be ready to leave, and many have been slowly emptying their homes of furniture and treasured possessions. Lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano, one of the earth's most active, has been sliding northeast toward the ocean since an eruption on June 27. Locals say the molten rock is being spread by Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. 'She is so gentle, but so unrelenting. She is just slow and steady,' said Jamila Dandini, a retiree who stopped at a coffee shop down the road from where scientists have forecast the lava will likely cross. Last month, scientists said it was two weeks away from hitting the main road in Pahoa. The lava slowed but has largely remained on course. This aerial shot shows the lava approaching a residential property in Pahoa today, having destroyed trees and greenery in its path . The lava, which has been flowing since the eruption on June 27, has destroyed trees in its path and is heading towards Pahoa . Molten trail: Lava spouting from hot spot from Mt.

Any remaining residents in Pahoa will be cut off from the village's only supermarket when the lava flow cuts the main Pahoa Village Road . A breakout of lava burns fallen trees from the flow's first pass through the forest above Pahoa.  The Kilauea volcano has been active since a fissure eruption in January 1983 . The Kilauea volcano attracts tourists who travel to Hawaii to watch red hot glowing lava flow into the Pacific Ocean . Diversion: Construction crews try divert lava from Mt. Kilauea from a home in Pahoa, where many residents have already fled . 'She is so gentle, but so unrelenting. She is just slow and steady': Many villagers are resigned to the lava flow edging closer to their homes . This dramatic aerial shot shows the unrelenting path of the lava as it destroys vegetation in its path and moves closer towards the town . Hawaii County civil defense officials said it was about 225 yards away from Pahoa Village Road yesterday evening, traveling about five to 10 yards an hour. The slow pace has given residents time to pack their valuables and get out of the way. But it has been agonizing for those wondering whether the lava might change directions and head for them - and stressful for those trying to figure out how they will cope once the lava blocks the only roads in and out of town. Once the lava crosses the road and the bypass road, effectively slicing Pahoa in half, most residents won't be able to get to the area's only supermarket even though it's only a mile from the town center. The rural, mostly agricultural community of Puna, for which Pahoa is its commercial center, will be cut off even more if the lava makes it all the way to the ocean, some six miles away. Some businesses are closing or moving. Some are vowing to stay. Ms Dandini likened the impending isolation to being on 'an island on an island.' She predicted it would be an opportunity for people to work together to solve their problems. Construction crews prepare Pahoa Village Road as lava flow from Mt Kilauea approaches. 'It's like slow torture,' said Paul Utes, who owns a cafe in the town . The lava has been moving at varying speeds for four months. Observations determined it was 510 meters from Pahoa Village Road . Paul Utes, who owns the Black Rock Cafe, said: 'It's like slow torture. It speeds up, it slows down. It speeds up, it slows down. 'It's not like any other event where it comes and goes and it gets over with and you can move on.' Mr Utes' restaurant is not in the predicted path even though it's just a few hundred yards south from where the lava will likely cross the main road. But he worries this could change. Even if the cafe is spared, he doesn't know how traffic will be diverted once lava crosses the road, how his vendors will supply his restaurant and what the public — his customers — will do. The county bus no longer passes through the Pahoa's main street, which is lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber and sugar-plantation town . Lava pushes through a fence marking a property boundary above the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii . After weeks of slow, stop-and-go movement, a river of asphalt-black lava is less than the length of a football field from homes in Pahoa . Residents left behind in the town face an agonizing wait to see if the lava will change direction and head for their homes . Smoke rises from the black lava flow, which has attracted tourists from outside Hawaii who have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock . The slow-moving river of molten lava  crept over residential and farm property on Hawaii's Big Island on Wednesday after incinerating an outbuilding . Construction crews battle to divert the lava, which has already destroyed a building on a residential farm property . The lava has already had a huge effect and once it seeps into town, most residents won't be able to reach the area's only supermarket . For the time being, business is up because more people from around the island and tourists from outside Hawaii have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock. 'The anxiety building up is kind of hard to deal with,' he said. Some changes brought by lava are already starting to have an effect. The county bus no longer passes through the main street lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber and sugar-plantation town. So Ms Dandini has to walk into town from where the bus drops her off on the outskirts. A Hawaiian Volcano Observatory geologist maps the margin of the June 27th lava flow in the open field below Apa'a Street and Cemetery Road this week . A portion of the front of the June 27th lava flow burns through thick vegetation and a fence in Pahoa, Hawaii . Some people, she said, have been discussing pooling their resources for supply runs to Hilo, the nearest city, because it could take hours to get there on alternate routes once Pahoa's main roads are cut off. So far, lava has burned a garden shed, tires and some metal materials. Dozens of homes, business and other structures are in the area of the lava flow. That number could increase as the flow front widens. Erbin Gamurot, 48, a handyman, said Pele just wants to visit her sister, Namakaokahai, the sea goddess. 'She's doing what she gotta do. That's her way, that's her nature. Who can stop her?' he asked. Jamila Dandini, who now has to walk into town, likened the impending isolation due to the lava as like being 'an island on an island' Burning path: As the trail approaches, some businesses have closed or moved, but some are vowing to stay .

"A hit-and-run driver who killed a man when he smashed his $300,000 Ferrari into theirs at 100mph has been arrested more than a year after the crash. Radomin Delgado ploughed his red F430 Scuderia into the rear end of a Hyundai Sonata being driven by Jorge Arrojas, 60, and his partner of 40 years Miguel Larrieu on August 10 last year. The crash flung the couple's car into a vehicle ahead of them and onto the median strip of the Florida highway. Arrested: Radomin Delgado fled the scene after crashing his Ferrari F430 into the couple's car last year . Love: Miguel Larrieu (left) and Jorge Arrojas (right) were childhood friends and partners from the age of 20 . Retired postal worker Mr Arrojas, behind the wheel, was killed and Mr Larrieu severely injured. The Ferrari was found totalled on the side of the road but its driver had fled - either on foot or in another car. Last night, Florida Highway Patrol tracked down race car driver Delgado and charged him with leaving the scene of a death. Officers had named Delgado as a 'person of interest' days after the crash, but the investigation tying him to the scene has taken months. At the scene: This is a shot of the F430 Scuderia hours after the crash on the highway in Florida last August . Totalled: The Ferrari was found written off on the side of the highway but Delgado had already scarpered . Hit: This is the Hyundai Mr Arrojas and Mr Larrieu were driving on their way home from dinner with friends . Devastated: Mr Larrieu (pictured) tried to revive his partner who was slumped on his chest after the crash . Killed: Retired postal worker Mr Arrojas, 60, was pronounced dead at the scene on August 10 last year . He was finally identified as the key suspect this month by a detective team by using cell phone records, DNA evidence, and watching YouTube videos that show Delgado driving his F430 in professional races, according to CBS Miami. The couple had been returning from to Southwest Ranches after a late dinner in Bal Harbour. But as they came on to the highway from a side road, Delgado's Ferrari smashed into the back of their 2012 Hyundai. It was sent tumbling through the air and over the guardrail, end over end, until coming to a rest with Mr Arrojas slumped over, his head on Mr Larrieu’s chest. Mr Larrieu frantically tried to wake his childhood friend, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Charged: Police named Delgado (pictured) as a person of interest last year but could not link him to the case . Racer: This is a clip from a YouTube video of Radomin Delgado warming up for a race in his Ferrari in 2009 . Evidence: Police watched this video, tracked phone records and used DNA evidence to tie him to the case . 'In 10 seconds, my life as it was came to an end,’ he told the Sun-Sentinal days later. 'Jorge had his head on top of my chest and I kept asking him to breathe but it was over because I couldn't see him breathe,' Larrieu told CBS. 'Thank God there were some people who stopped to help and called an ambulance, but the person who did this didn't even worry if we were alive or dead.' Mr Larrieu's lawyer told CBS he settled a civil case against Delgado earlier this year.","Radomin Delgado was driving his F340 Scuderia at 100mph last August .

"The brother of a man accused of kidnapping and killing Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo in 2011 now has been charged with raping her. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday that John Dylan Adams, 26, has been indicted on two counts of raping Ms Bobo, whose partial remains were found last month in Decatur County. Adams had already been charged with tampering with evidence in the case of Bobo, who was reported missing on April 13, 2011. New charges: John Dylan Adams, 26, was charged with two counts of rape after he admitted to sexually assaulting Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo . According to TBI, Adams admitted that he was involved in the forcible rape of the 20-year-old nursing student on his family's property in Holladay, Tennessee, the day she vanished. Police are now looking into allegations that there is a video recording out there showing Holly Bobo tied up after her kidnapping. Dylan Adams' older brother, Zachary Adams (pictured), 30,  has been charged with kidnapping and murder . Adams is being held without bond and has a hearing set for October 22. A cousin of the Admas brothers responded to the new allegations against Dylan Adams by claiming that the 26-year-old has the IQ of a 10-year-old and was likely coerced by investigators into making a confession. 'We are under the impression, in his mental state, he could be coerced to say anything,' Moss Miller told The Jackson Sun. 'I would be reluctant to think that this is true.' The 26-year-old suspect is the younger brother of Zachary Adams, 30, who has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnapping charges in the case. Another man, Jason Autry, faces the same charges as Zachary Adams. Both men have pleaded not guilty. TBI agents believe that on April 13, 2011, John Dylan Adams disposed of items he knew to be of evidentiary value to the case, according to a statement released after his arrest last month. . This past April, Zach Adams was charged with coercion of a witness. The warrant in that incident states that the murder suspect instructed an unnamed inmate: 'Tell my brother he is the one who started this (expletive), and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her.' Zach Adam's criminal history contains charges dating back to 2009 including several . drug violations as well as aggravated burglary and theft. Jason Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. The . case of Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are . considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction. Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . Closure: Holly Bobo's partial remains were found last month near Adams family property . Brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were arrested in May and charged with tampering with evidence and accessory after the fact, after a woman named Sandra King told authorities that Jeffrey had showed her a cellphone video of Bobo tied up and crying. In the wake of Miss Bobo's . disappearance, her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in . camouflage leading her away into the woods. She had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance. The . director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the Bobo case has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history, . and it's not over yet. In September, two . men found a skull not far from property owned by the Adams family. Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He . added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to . solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will . prevail.' 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

"A major speech given by Gerry Adams at the height of the Northern Ireland peace process was written by one of Tony Blair’s senior aides, it has been claimed. Jonathan Powell says he drafted the speech for the Sinn Fein leader, in which he said could ‘envisage a future without an IRA’. Mr Powell was chief of staff in Downing Street throughout the Blair years, and the revelation he wrote a speech for the Republican leader is likely to cause alarm in Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . A major speech by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams at the height of the peace process was drafted by . Mr Powell revealed his role in the speech in a new book, ‘Talking to Terrorists’, in which he details the painstaking process of trying to bring together all sides to end the Troubles in Northern Ireland/ . He played a major role on the British side in negotiating peace, but has now revealed he helped the Republicans behind the scenes after a request from Mr Adams. The claim focusses on a speech given by the Sinn Fein President at the Hillgrove Hotel in Monaghan on Saturday October 26, 2002. The Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998 was in danger of collapse, because the IRA had failed to fulfil promises to decommission weapons. Mr Powell says in his book that delberatly ambigious language used by both sides in the early stages of the peace process was necessary to secure agreement, but was now becoming a block to peace. In extracts of his book published by the Irish Independent today, Mr Powell writes: ‘We felt that we had to address the ambiguity or lose the agreement, so Tony Blair made a speech in Belfast in which he demanded that Sinn Fein choose between the Armalite and the ballot box. ‘We were nervous about the response but Adams called me a few days later and said, to our relief, it was a good speech. To my surprise he asked me if I would draft his response. Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair's chief of staff for a decade in Number 10, and played a key role securing the Good Friday Agreement which led to peace in Northern Ireland . He added: ‘I tried to write in Republican-speak and composed a passage that ended with 'People ask me do I envisage a future without an IRA? The answer is obvious. The answer is yes.' ‘I turned on the television a few days later to see Adams deliver the speech unchanged,’ he adds. In the speech, Mr Adams said: ‘I want to see an end to all of the armed groups on this island. That has to be the aim of every thinking republican. So if you ask me do I envisage a future without the IRA? ‘The answer is obvious. The answer is Yes. And who can influence the IRA most? The British government - the unionists - the Irish government and us as well of course. All of us have to make politics work.’ A spokesman for Sinn Fein said speeches and specific phrases were often shared with the British government during the talks. ‘All of this was as part of ongoing efforts to help the situation. However, Gerry Adams is very clear that 'any remarks I made were entirely my responsibility and not scripted by anyone outside Sinn Fein,'"" they added.","Powell used 'Republican-speak' after being asked for help with speech .

"Set in the idyllic Derbyshire Dales, surrounded by countryside and views of the moor, a cockerel's  call may not seem too unexpected. But for one bird, his early morning wake-up calls have led to an ASBO. The owners of William Welsummer, or Willy, the cockerel have been given a noise abatement notice to stop their bird making such a noise, after a complaint from a neighbour that he was waking him up too early. Willy the cockerel has been waking neighbours up for three months at 4am and has now been given an ASBO . Caroline and Philip Sutcliffe with William Wilsummer -  the offending cockerel - at their Derbyshire home . The noisy cockerel lives on the farm belonging to Philip and Caroline Sutcliffe in Eyam along with the rest of the couple's birds. They say other neighbours have never raised any problems with the bird. Mr Sutcliffe said:  'It's all a bit ridiculous - a bird having an ASBO-type order. We've done everything we can and so far we've managed to reduce the noise, but not put a stop to it. 'Our neighbours have been living with the crows for three years since we moved here - and we consulted with them at the time to check it was okay.' The couple said they keep birds as a hobby. The ASBO was given after Simon Bee, 51, complained to Derbyshire Dales District Council. Willy lives in the Derbyshire Dales in the village of Eyam, which is popular with walkers and visitors to the Dales . Mr and Mrs Sutcliffe have been given the winter to try and soundproof Willie's pen to stop noise complaints . Willy has been the subject of complaints by Simon Bee because of his regular 4am calls at the farm in Eyam . He said: 'This is not a farming community anymore. It's mainly tourism now and most of the people who live here are either retired or commuters. 'And the fact that Mr Sutcliffe has a field at the bottom of his garden does not make it a farm. I would not have moved in next to a farm, but this is a residential area.' Mr Bee said he has been the subject of abuse since he made the complaint and it was made public. He said:  'Firstly, I do not want to kill the cockerel -I want this to be resolved in a way that pleases everybody. The Sutcliffes said they have never had any problems with people complaining about Willy's noise before . 'But for three months I've been woken up every day at 4am and that's with double glazing. I work full-time and cannot cope without a proper nights' sleep.' He claims in online criticism he has been called a 'townie' and is starting to fear for his safety. But Mr Bee said that now the mornings are darker- and the problem is not so pronounced - he is happy to 'put the situation on ice' until spring to give Mr and Mrs Sutcliffe time to sound-proof William's pen. Mr Sutcliffe said he welcomed Simon's compromise and vowed to resolve the issue.","Willy the cockerel, woke up neighbours in the Derbyshire Dales for 3 months .

"Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with the sexual of three male students . A New Jersey high school teacher has been arrested on accusations of sexually assaulting three 15-year-old boys in her car and at the school where she taught. Mother-of-two Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported. Prosecutors in Essex County say that Dufault, who taught language arts at Columbia High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular academic year and summer school between 2013-2014. The encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, authorities charge. Dufault's two minor children have been removed from her custody. 'I don't understand how someone can't pick up the clues for something like that or how any one of those kids would not have said something before now,' parent Jennifer Berkeley told WABC.  'It's really surprising to me.' 'They do background checks on the teachers, so I don’t understand,' another Columbia HS parent told CBS New York. Dufault was arrested at her home on Wedneday. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations. 'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York. 'Not only did she destroy her life and her children, but the boys who are involved as well,' the neighbor added. Dufault is being held at the Essex County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail.

The white pick-up truck again pulled right violently, jumping over the edge of an embankment. The truck ploughs into the ground before rolling onto its side. Luckily for the driver, the bottom of the embankment was quite sandy, reducing the severity of the impact, raising a large plume of dust. The rear wheel of the truck spun for several seconds while the driver attempted to leave the cab. Police soon arrive at the scene and the driver walks up the side of the embankment with his hands raised as nine armed police officers cover him.

"For many tattoos are highly personal decorations, often a remembrance of an event or a person or a rite of passage. Tattoos are usually applied using an electric needle inserting indelible ink into the skin. In Indonesia, however, there is a dying art of tattooing whereby they are applied with a traditional method known as ‘hand-tapping’. In this technique the tattooist uses a short wooden stick fitted with a needle to insert the ink. The needle bounces in and out of the skin as the first stick is rapidly hit with another. This is done with help from another tattoo artist who holds and stretches the area to be tattooed. There are some tattooists determined to prevent the art becoming extinct and one, Ranu Khodir, allowed these photographs to be taken of their work and their subjects to bring them to a wider audience. It is a technique that has vanished in most places but is still in use in Kalimantan and the Mentawai Islands but other tattooing traditions are found in Sulawesi, Maluku, Timor and East Nusa Tenggara. It has Polynesian, Borneo Dayak and American roots. There are a variety of hand-tapping tools including those made by the Dayak Bahau and Dayak Modang peoples of east Kalimantan, sometimes using materials such as ulin, one of the hardest timbers in the world. Traditional tattoos in Indonesia have particular shapes that relate to each tribe's heritage.

"Treasury minister Danny Alexander vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role . Redundancy payouts given to NHS managers are to be clawed back if workers get a new job in the health service. The Treasury vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role. But the move was dismissed as ‘too little, too late’ after 4,000 have already been rehired and it emerged staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post. Under new rules announced by the Treasury, the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay-off. It is expected the measure - which is included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament - will mainly affect NHS and local government administrators. The Treasury said that of the 19,000 NHS administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013, almost 20 per cent rejoined the NHS while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year. In March it emerged that almost 4,000 NHS staff given redundancy pay-offs as part of the coalition’s health shake-up had been rehired. More than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 were back working in the health service. Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to Treasury, said the proposed legislation was only coming after the Coalition had spent four years squandering large sums on the pay-offs despite promising a crackdown. He said: ‘Ministers could have acted on this years ago before they wasted millions of pounds firing and then rehiring staff. ‘In the NHS alone, the government’s reckless reorganisation has seen £1.6 billion spent on redundancies. ‘Over 4,000 NHS managers - some of whom received pay-offs over £200,000 - have been fired and rehired under this government.’ The new regulations will be included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament. Almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures, including the Civil Service, local government and the NHS. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘It’s only fair that highly-paid executives who receive a redundancy pay-out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer. ‘Reforming the public sector so it works for Britain has been a key part of this government’s drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society.” The total cost to the NHS of ‘revolving door’ payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £48,000, it could mean almost £200million has been squandered on pay-offs for returning staff since 2010. Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust . Non-clinical staff have received average pay-offs of £43,000 but 2,300 received six-figure deals. They include a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts. Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March 2013. Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished. By June last year both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director.","Law to be changed to take back redundancy payments if workers return .

"A taxi company which offered white drivers on demand to customers after two of Pakistani origin were jailed for sexual grooming has decided to pull the service after its Asian drivers went on strike. Minicab firm Car 2000, in Heywood in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has reversed its decision to offer white or 'local' drivers on demand after all of its 55 Asian drivers walked out over the 'racist and discriminatory' decision. Company boss Stephen Campbell, 34, said he had now told the firm's operators to no longer offer the 'on request' service and said he would be meeting with those on strike in an attempt to iron out the issues. All of Car 2000's 55 Asian drivers have walked out over the decision to offer white drivers on demand. They held a protest in Heywood town centre last night (pictured) and called the service 'discriminatory and racist' He said he made the decision to pull the service after learning of the taxi drivers' large protest in the town centre last night. He said: 'The drivers were all aware we did this and said they wouldn't want to pick up a customer that didn't want them as a driver. Company boss Stephen Campbell, 34, (pictured) said he had told his minicab firm Car 2000's operators to no longer offer white or 'local' drivers on request . 'But, as soon as they raised this as a problem, I have immediately changed it and have done what they wanted.' In 2011, Mr Campbell's family took over the business, which was formerly called Eagle Taxis and which employed two of the nine men who were jailed a year later for grooming girls. Mr Campbell previously said that, out of 12,000 calls a week, around 60 would request a 'local' driver in the wake of the Rochdale sex abuse scandal. He said: 'Our operators have now been told that no one can do that again.' Mr Campbell said on one occasion  one of his Asian drivers had been to pick up a customer who refused to get in his car, which left the employee upset. He added: 'I don't operate a company that makes people feel bad. I was trying to protect them. But I suppose in protecting them I was contributing to people's racist beliefs.' Mr Campbell, who employs a total of 80 drivers at Car 2000, said all his 55 Asian drivers were on strike today over the row. He is set to meet with some of them this afternoon to iron out the problems in a bid to get them back to work. The on-strike drivers  gathered in the centre of Heywood last night to protest about the firm offering white drivers on demand - blasting the service as 'racist' and 'discriminatory'. They said they were concerned the policy would reinforce negative stereotypes in the town and described how their cars had regularly been attacked following the grooming scandal. One driver, Abdul Hafiz, said: 'There were some bad men who worked as taxi drivers in Heywood and now they are in prison. 'We have done nothing wrong but now we are being treated like paedophiles.' Car 2000 (pictured) started offering white drivers on demand in the wake of the Rochdale sex abuse scandal which saw two taxi drivers of Pakistani origin jailed for sexual grooming and their role in sex trafficking girls .","Rochdale minicab firm Car 2000 had offered white or local drivers on demand .

"A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of masterminding a £1.6million cyber raid on cash machines. The man is being held by detectives in Portsmouth after the seven-figure haul went missing from a string of ATMs. Detectives believe an organised crime gang from eastern Europe inserted a computer virus into cash machines in locations including Brighton, London and Liverpool. Scroll down for video . A 37-year-old man is being questioned in Portsmouth for allegedly being part of an 'organised gang' from eastern Europe that loaded malware in to the cash points (stock image) Devices in Blackpool, Doncaster and Sheffield were also targeted, City of London Police said. An address in Edmonton, north London, is also being searched as part of the operation. It is not known exactly how the operation worked, but it is thought the criminals cut holes in order to plug in USB drives that installed their code onto the ATMs. Detective Inspector Dave Strange said: 'An extensive, intelligence-led investigation has uncovered what we believe is an organised crime gang systematically infecting and then clearing cash machines across the UK using specially created malware. 'Cyber-enabled crime presents a major threat to our public and private sectors and to an increasing number of citizens. 'The only way to tackle this is by law enforcement and counter fraud agencies working in alliance, which is exactly what the London Regional Fraud Team and National Crime Agency (NCA) have done over several months culminating in today's arrest.' Police believe the cash machines were broken in to and infected with a virus - the gang made £1.6m from the cyber raid as they targeted machines across Britain . Police allege the cash machines were physically broken into and infected with a virus before large amounts of cash were withdrawn. It is thought 51 machines were hit over the May Bank Holiday by criminals gaining access to the computer inside the devices and uploading a virus. Once the malware was activated the machine could be told to dispense large amounts of cash, in some cases until it was drained of money. Detectives believe the malware subsequently deleted itself, making it difficult to identify the cause of the attacks. Customer data was not compromised, police said.

"Recreational marijuana sellers are reaching out to novice cannabis users with a raft of edible products that impart a milder buzz and make it easy for inexperienced customers to find a dose they won't regret taking. In many ways, the marketing shift is the pot-industry equivalent of selling beer and wine alongside higher-alcohol options such as whiskey and vodka. 'No one buys a handle of Jim Beam and thinks they should drink all of that in one sitting,' said Tim Cullen, owner of two Denver-area marijuana dispensaries. 'But people do want to eat an entire cookie, an entire piece of chocolate. So these products allow you to do that and not have a miserable experience.' Scroll down for video . Rookie Cookie: The Rookie Cookie has 10mg of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. State regulators recommend a 10mg dose as a single serving of the drug . Nine months into Colorado's recreational pot experiment, retailers have good reason to court new users. A market study released in July suggested 40 percent of customers in Denver-area recreational marijuana shops are tourists. That figure spikes to 90 percent in ski towns such as Aspen or Breckenridge. Tourists cannot shop in medical-marijuana dispensaries, so many of those customers may be buying legal weed for the first time. New on the shelves in Colorado's recreational pot shops is the 'Rookie Cookie,' a marijuana-infused confection that contains 10 milligrams of marijuana's psychoactive ingredient. That's a low enough dose that most adults wouldn't be too impaired to drive a car. Then there's a new marijuana-infused soda that's 15 times weaker than the company's best-known soda. The Dixie One watermelon cream soda contains 5 milligrams of THC — half of what the state considers a serving size — and is billed as 'great for those who are new to THC or don't like to share.' The wave of lighter choices comes as the new industry tries to pivot away from products aimed at frequent, heavy pot users to newer customers who weren't interested in the drug when it was illegal. 'For a long time, the medical market was a race to the strongest edibles. Now it's a new market, and people want something that won't get them so inebriated they're not functional,' said Holden Sproul of the Growing Kitchen, which makes the 'Rookie Cookie' and is phasing out some of its stronger offerings. This pot-infused soda, Dixie One Watermelon Cream, has 5mg of THC - 15 times less than regular-strength counterparts . There's no publicly available data on which products are selling. But interviews with dispensary owners and marijuana producers suggest the lighter products are booming. 'We still get people walking in here saying, 'What's the strongest thing?' But more and more they're asking about flavor, the experience, the whole nine yards,' Cullen said. In Washington state, where sales of edibles are just beginning in recreational pot shops, some of the first licensed edible-makers are taking a similar approach. The entire product line at Db3 Inc. in Seattle is based around the idea that consumers can control the effect they want — an idea based in part on market research that suggested people often had bad experiences because they over-consumed marijuana edibles. Among the products Db3 hopes to get on retail shelves in the coming weeks are liquid drops that can be added to beverages in precise amounts. 'We recognize there are going to be a lot of nontraditional users coming into the market, or people who have used in the past a long time ago and who are just getting back into it,' said Patrick Devlin, one of the company's founders. There's more than market share at stake. Marijuana-legalization activists want to tamp down stories about pot users who got sick after eating potent medical-grade cannabis, an experience so common it seems everyone in Denver knows someone who endured it. Most serious was the March death of a college student who had never tried pot before visiting Denver for spring break. The man ate a single cookie that contained 65 milligrams of THC, then jumped to his death from a hotel balcony after his friends said he started acting erratically. And New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd famously wrote in June of trying a marijuana-infused candy bar, after which she 'lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours.' Colorado dispensaries have launched a 'First Time 5' campaign of posters to encourage new users to take a 5 milligram half-dose of marijuana to make sure they don't overdo it. A marijuana advocacy group has taken out billboards and magazine ads with the tagline 'Start Low, Go Slow.' At least one marketing expert warned that pot producers need to be careful not to claim their products won't cause intoxication. 'Is it too early in the industry to go claiming what's a low dose and what's a medium dose?' asked Claire Kaufmann of Portland, Oregon, who consults for manufacturers and runs a 'Rebranding Cannabis' blog. 'We want to create a place for new consumers in our industry. We just need to be aware that we don't get ahead of the science.'","Pot activists fear stories of marijuana tourists taking too much THCcould hurt the industry .

"Police in Calais have staged a protest at insufficient funds needed to cope with the estimated 2,000 British-bound migrants massed in their town. Up to 500 officers blocked a road near the port, triggering long delays for cars and lorries trying to board ferries to Britain. The police union is complaining they do not have the manpower to handle the frequent outbursts of violence between rival gangs of refugees in the northern French port. Scroll down for video . Police in Calais have staged a protest at insufficient funds needed to cope with the estimated 2,000 British-bound migrants massed in their town . Up to 500 officers blocked a road near the port, triggering long delays for cars and lorries trying to board ferries to Britain . The police union is complaining they do not have the manpower to handle the frequent outbursts of violence between rival gangs of refugees in the northern French port . The police were joined by farmers and landlords also angered at their property being occupied by migrants waiting to sneak aboard lorries and ferries to the UK . They were joined by farmers and landlords also angered at their property being occupied by migrants waiting to sneak aboard lorries and ferries to the UK. A statement from the police union Syndicat General de la Police said: 'In the space of a few months, the migrant numbers have quadrupled in Calais. 'The police have had no choice but to abandon their public service mission, as a result of the lack of resources and above all staff. 'The continued flow of migrants traps the local economy in an unprecedented crisis, and businesses are threatened.' French authorities estimate that there are around 2,000 illegal migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, waiting in Calais to seek asylum in Britain. Tensions have been mounting in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood into the town. Mass brawls between rival gangs have left more than 70 people injured during July and August. Two weeks ago, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel. Scores of migrants were turned back after storming a P&O ferry to Britain earlier this year . Migrants have been known to make breaks for ferries and lorries in attempts to make it across the Channel, but are usually unsuccesful . French truckers have also threatened to blockade the port of Calais in protest at steep fines imposed for migrants found hiding in their lorries. Haulage firms are fined £2,000 for each illegal immigrant they bring across the Channel from France. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart also recently threatened to block the ferry port to all traffic unless Britain did more to help her town tackle the crisis. Ms Bouchart wants the UK border to be moved from Calais to Britain, and for British Prime Minister David Cameron to visit her town. She recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for refugees for the squalid migrant camps in her town. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're not here to do their job.' Police union chief Gilles Debove said of yesterday's police protest on RMC radio today: 'Our message is clear, it's a pacifist and republican demonstration, because the situation is changing. 'The number of migrants is increasing, but we are still working with the same number of staff. 'We have on average 20 or 22 police on duty. But at certain times, such as Saturday and Sunday mornings, there are only four, and four is not enough.' One unnamed officer phoned the station to add: 'These are not the conditions in which we can best provide security for the town. 'When I am called to intervene, sometimes I'm scared because there are 200 people in front of us, and we're only four or five - what can we do?'","Police officers in Calais block road in protest over refugee crisis in town .

"A series of billboards in Florida erected to warn motorists entering the city of Waldo, for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in America, are set to end after the 'corrupt' police force was dissolved. Until recently, Waldo - described as the 'most corrupt town in America' - had covered half of its $1 million budget by handing out an unusually high number of speeding ticket fines. The situation was so bad that in 2003, the American Automobile Association had taken the unprecedented step of erecting billboards along Route 310 to warn motorists of the speed traps. A series of billboards erected by the AAA in Florida  to warn motorists entering the city of Waldo, for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in America, are set to end after the 'corrupt' police force was dissolved earlier this month . The nation's leading advocate for traffic safety has said it is now reconsidering that need for the billboards after the city council voted earlier this month to dissolve the police force. In August, five officers came forward with allegations that Police Chief Mike Szabo enforced a 'strict ticket quota' of 12 tickets for every 12-hour shift. 'Looks like you have some work to do when you come in,' Szabo wrote in an email after an officer recorded only four tickets one day, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Szabo was suspended shortly after by City Manager Kim Worley after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into another alleged violation of police procedure. Until recently, Waldo - described as the 'most corrupt town in America' - had covered half of its $1 million budget by handing out an unusually high number of speeding ticket fines . Investigated: Police Chief Mike Szabo sent emails telling officers to follow an illegal quota for speeding tickets . His replacement, Cpl Kenneth Smith, stepped in, only to be hit with a FDLE investigation and suspension of his own. Both Smith and Szabo resigned following their suspensions. Patrols in the area are currently being handled by the Alachua County sheriff's office and the AAA has said that it is watching the traffic situation in Waldo closely. If traffic tickets are written to enhance safety rather than to meet a quota, the AAA has said it will consider ending its lease on the billboards. 'Assuming the disbanding results in the end of traffic enforcement taking place for the purpose of revenue generation, then we would strongly consider not renewing our billboards there,' Karen Morgan, a public policy manager for the AAA, told AOL Autos. As a percentage of its city budget, no other municipality in Florida has relied on traffic citations as heavily as Waldo. The tiny town of about 1,000 residents that lies along Route 310 between Gainesville and Jacksonville has derived as much as 73 percent of its overall budget from traffic fines. Florida Department of Law Enforcement documents say the ideal ratio of police to citizens is 2.5 officers for every 1,000 citizens. Prior to the resignation, Waldo had eight. One of the other key factors for AAA is whether the town has mandatory ticket quotas for its officers. 'AAA condemns traffic enforcement practices that are designed to raise revenue rather than prevent crashes,' said Morgan. 'AAA condemns all practices whereby a law enforcement agency rates the efficiency of its officers based upon the number of arrests made or citations issued.' Waldo had been one of two towns designated by the AAA as a 'traffic trap,' meaning that it considered law enforcement practices to be more focused on generating revenue than enforcing safe driving behavior. The only other town in the country where the organization has taken the step of buying billboards that warn drivers of a trap ahead is in Lawtey, Florida, about 19 miles north of Waldo along Route 310.","The American Automobile Association has paid for billboards outside Waldo, Florida, since 2003 to warn motorists about the city's notorious speed traps .

"Murderer Clifton Jeter, 37, has been sentenced to an extra 13 years in prison for trying to kill two prison officers at HMP Manchester . A New York gangster who is serving life in a British prison for murder has had an extra 13 years tacked onto his sentence for trying to kill two prison guards with a razor blade. Clifton Jeter, 37, shouted: 'I'm going to christen this unit in blood' before attacking Alistair Cadell and Liam Keates as they were escorting him back to his cell at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways. Jeter - who is in a specialist unit for violent inmates at the prison - left Mr Keates with a five inch gash to the back of his neck and another deep wound across the knee. He also tried to sever an artery in Mr Cadell's throat with the blade - which he had managed to hide by melting into a plastic knife. The court heard how the gangster carried out the furious attack because he felt 'restricted' and 'disrespected' by the unit's tough regime and wanted a transfer to another jail. British-born Jeter had already been sentenced in 2008 to a 27-year life term for murdering a father-of-seven in a bungled 'honey trap' robbery. Today, Jeter - who was nicknamed 'Yankee' - was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of a further two charges of attempted murder. He was jailed for 34 years which will run alongside his original sentence, of which he has 21 years left to serve. Jeter will only become eligible for parole in 2048 when he will be aged 71. Passing sentence, Mr Justice David Maddison told Jeter he was 'devious and dishonest'. He said: 'Prison officers work on a daily basis in close physical proximity to prisoners and in my view it is important that the sentences send a clear and deterrent message to any other prisoners who might attack officers. 'It is clear to me on any fair view that on your current or past offences at this stage of your life you are a very dangerous man.' Jeter had been taken to the US as a child but was deported back to the UK after becoming involved with some of New York's toughest street gangs. Bizarrely, after being jailed for murder, he set up an online profile on a prisoners' dating website asking to meet new friends. The latest attack came two years after Jeter was accused of punching one guard and grappling with another at Frankland jail in Durham, also while being escorted to his cell. The court heard that, in the run up to the razor blade attack, Jeter had hid the weapon under his shirt and greased his arms with baby oil or shower gel to make restraint difficult. The gangster attacked two prison guards with a razor blade, slashing one across the back of the neck, pictured . On the morning of the attack he told a psychologist that he wanted to 'get off' the unit but he knew an assault on a prison officer may lead to a transfer. After being abusive in a gym saying: 'I want off this unit. It's game on. I'll f*** you all up,' he was served lunch by officers who were dressed in riot gear. He later appeared to have calmed down and was allowed to take a shower. But although staff searched Jeter when he about to go back to his cell, they forgot to check the back of his prison shirt. Jeter waited until one of the guards unlocked his door and then 'struck quickly and repeatedly', trying to slit Mr Cadell's throat. After being jailed for a murder in Hendon, UK, in 2008, Jeter set up a profile to try and make friends with fellow inmates . He then cut deeply into Mr Keates' neck along almost its entire width. He then slashed his leg during a struggle on the floor, the court was told. CCTV footage showed officers running to help before Jeter was carried to a secure cell. The victims' colleague Mark Carr said: 'When the door closed Jeter jumped up almost immediately and shouted, ""Did you like that? His tone was high-pitched and mocking"".' Another prison officer, David Massey, added: 'He was quite elated. He was looking to incite us, to say, ""Look what I have done, I have wounded two of your officers"".' A later search of the shower area revealed a 'void in the wall' behind a loose sheet of plastic where the weapon could have been hidden. Both Mr Cadell and Mr Keates were off work for six weeks and have been diagnosed with anxiety and each are in fear of being attacked again. The attack took place at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, while the two guards were escorting Jeter back to his cell . Both men were later treated in hospital with Mr Keates requiring stitches for his wounds. Jeter later claimed a 'culture of racism' existed at the jail and claimed he had joined a prison gang named 'The Piranhas' which targeted Muslim inmates. He said staff had wanted him to take part in a plot to attack a convicted Islamic terrorist and carried out a 'pre-emptive' strike against the guards when he refused. In 2002, Jeter was jailed for seven years in the UK for aggravated burglary after raiding a hotel room and holding a man at gunpoint. It was in 2007 that he was arrested for murder. The gangster's girlfriend - known as Candy - had unexpectedly turned up at the victim's home in Hendon for a sexual liaison. Sentencing, Justice David Maddison told Jeter: 'It is important that the sentences send a clear and deterrent message to any other prisoners who might attack officers' (file pic) Chauffeur Ghiass Tarabin was then stabbed to death after Jeter burst in, demanding cash and valuables. In the struggle that followed Tarabin, 49, was stabbed once in the chest and collapsed in his garden. He died minutes later from massive blood loss. Jeter was convicted of murder in May 2008 at the Old Bailey and jailed for life but was moved around various jails due to his violent behaviour. After being jailed, he tried to reach out to others through his online profile, explaining: 'Prison can be a lonely place. It's also hard to make friends in here. 'I miss being able to socialize and mingle. I'm a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations.'","Clifton Jeter shouted 'I'm going to christen this unit in blood' before attack .

"A bird with a broken wing has a hero in Tennessee who designed a prosthetic one to help her maintain her balance after a botched wing amputation. Freya the American kestrel came to the Chattanooga Nature Center a year ago from another center in Nashville. Taylor Berry of the Nature center saw the movie Dolphin Tale about a bottlenose dolphin who was given prosthesis to replace a tail lost in a carb trap, reports The Times Free Press. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New wing: Freya the bird got a new prosthetic limb to help her balance after a botched amputation wounded her . Concern: 'The amputation was poorly done,' said Tish Gailmard (pictured) , the nature center's director of wildlife' who helped find someone to make a stump guard for Freya . The film inspired Berry and he wondered whether or not a prosthetic could be made for Freya who had trouble balancing due to her injury. 'We were talking about how she was kind of off-balance because of her wing,' he said. None of the caretakers at the wildlife center know the history of the amputation but they are able to recognize how terribly done it is. 'The amputation was poorly done,' said Tish Gailmard, the nature center's director of wildlife. Gailmard's husband knows someone at Fillauer Orthotics and Prosthetics Inc. a Chattanooga company that makes prosthesis for humans. When Gailmard inquired as to whether they'd be interested in making a prosthetic they were flying with excitement at the opportunity. 'They were all over it,' Gailmard said. 'They put her in a patient room and treated her like a regular patient.' Where a wing once extended was just bone jutting out that sometime bled. Fillauer engineer Steve Edwards changed all that when he attached a prosthesis made from thermoformable composite.

Its lightweight material that has the strength of carbon fiber but is malleable when heated up. It took Edwards just two tried to make. 'Just trying to help out, and it's rewarding, too,' he said. 'I like the challenge of these things.' Filhauer said this isn't his first time making an animal prosthetic. He once made a hoof for a little girl's pet donkey. Gailmard is so appreciative for his work on Freya's stump guard. 'It probably weighs a tenth of an ounce. It's protecting her stump, and it's also restoring her balance,' she said. 'I'm so incredibly appreciative to Fillauer. They have just gone way above and beyond.'","Freya the American kestrel came to the Chattanooga Nature Center a year ago from another center in Nashville with an amputated wing .

A report issued on the incident in September blamed Lockett's flawed lethal injection on poor placement of intravenous lines, as the medical team could not find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet. Botched death: The execution of Clayton Lockett was plagued with problems as a viable vein could not be found. Eventually, a line was inserted into his groin. Ultimately, it was decided to insert the line into his groin. The execution was halted when prison officials noted the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered properly, with the doctor inside the death chamber reporting a single IV in Lockett's groin had became dislodged, and the lethal drugs were going into his tissue and leaking out of his body. This new device will make it easier for those administering injections to find viable veins. New protocols require more training for the execution team and backup procedures in case a lethal injection goes awry. Prison workers will begin training on the new protocols this week, and the agency will be prepared for the November 13 execution of Charles Warner, who was convicted of raping and killing his roommate's 11-month-old daughter in Oklahoma City in 1997, said prisons spokeswoman Terri Watkins. 'We will be ready,' Watkins said. Lockett had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999. She and a friend had walked in on the men robbing a home. Based on the recommendations in the report, prison officials renovated the space to give the execution team in an adjacent 'chemical room' more space to operate. They also installed new lighting and new audio and video equipment so the condemned inmate can be more closely monitored. The renovations mean that only five media witnesses will now be able to witness an execution — down from 12 — prompting criticism from open government advocates. 'They took a process already corrupted by secrecy that had already led to at least one botched execution, and managed somehow to make it even more difficult for the people of Oklahoma and their representatives in the media to know anything about that process,' said Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. ACLU Oklahoma, which opposes the death penalty, has sued prison officials who prevented witnesses from watching Lockett die by lowering the blinds during his execution. The gurney in the newly renovated death chamber is seen from the witness room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma on Thursday October 9, 2014 . Prison officials declined to discuss changes in the drug combinations used to execute inmates, citing pending litigation. Twenty-one death row inmates are suing Oklahoma seeking to block their executions, arguing that by tinkering with lethal injection chemicals, the state is experimenting on them and violating the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The federal judge in that case expressed serious concerns earlier this month that the state would be ready to carry out three executions this fall.","The Oklahoma Department of Corrections unveiled the $71,000 reconstruction of their death chamber on Thursday .

"A nasty car crash involving three cars in Pennsylvania was captured on video by a cellphone after a man noticed the erratic driving of a woman in front of him. The offending driver, who was behind the wheel of a white SUV, was swerving all over the road on Route 21 in Uniontown, Fayette County, on Monday. The man who filmed the incident, Kaecieo Bass, was returning from a delivery for their rental company with a colleague when he noticed the suspicious driving happening up ahead. 'I don’t know if she’s drunk or what’s going on,' Bass can be heard saying in the video, which was obtained by WPXI News. Scroll down for video . Erratic: Video taken of the incident in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, first shows the car veering to the wrong side of the road, narrowly avoiding a crash .

Crash: The truck and the third car hit head-on, however there were no serious injuries . 'They need to get their mind right. 'I hope nothing happens to them.' At one ominous point, Bass asks his colleague to keep a good distance between them and the woman because he 'doesn't want to have an accident'. However seconds later, the woman makes an improper left-hand turn. As the two men start yelling, knowing what is to come, she is t-boned another car, which then collides head-on with the men. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured. However the female driver was transported to hospital. Police have confirmed they are investigating the crash, which occurred between 7.30am and 8am. According to WPXI, some have questioned why Bass didn't just call 911 when he saw the woman start swerving, rather than start filming. 'I was trying to get her license plate because we were going to call 911 right then and there, but we couldn't get close enough to see,' he said.","Accident occurred about 8am Monday in Uniontown, Pennsylvania .

"Global internet companies have become ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists, claims the new head of Britain’s electronic spying agency. GCHQ director Robert Hannigan insisted some were ‘in denial’ about the way fanatics misuse their services. He cited how Islamic State (IS) has exploited social media for recruitment and propaganda – using the likes of Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube to promote beheadings. The terror group and its followers have also sent up to 40,000 tweets a day. An aerial view of Government Communications Headquarters in Benhall, in the suburbs of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire: The agency's new chief says internet firms need to open up even more to state spies . Mr Hannigan called on the likes of Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft to give greater co-operation to GCHQ and sister agencies MI5 and MI6. He also said there was ‘no doubt’ young foreign fighters had benefited from the treasure trove of intelligence secrets leaked by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden. ‘GCHQ and its sister agencies… cannot tackle these challenges without greater support from the private sector, including the largest US technology companies which dominate the web,’ he said. ‘I understand why they have an uneasy relationship with governments. They aspire to be neutral conduits of data and to sit outside or above politics. ‘But increasingly their services not only host the material of violent extremism or child exploitation, but are the routes for the facilitation of crime and terrorism. ‘However much they may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals, who find their services as transformational as the rest of us.’ Officials say the job of spy agencies has become ‘much harder’ over the past 18 months as US firms become less willing to hand over data. Whitehall sources say the companies have changed how they behave in response to the Snowden revelations. His exposure of how GCHQ and America’s National Security Agency were able to tap into online data has made companies nervous about protecting their own reputations, they said. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Hannigan said mobile technology and smartphones have increased the options available to terrorists ‘exponentially’. GCHQ director Robert Hannigan (left) said internet firms needed to allow the state to police on-line traffic. NSA leaker Ed Snowden (right), revealed intensive collaboration between spy agencies and internet companies . What they know... A National Security Agency slide leaked by Snowden reveals the scale of the access that state spies have to internet users' personal communications and information . He said: ‘Techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous, which were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation states, now come as standard. These are supplemented by freely available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of them proudly advertising that they are “Snowden approved”. ‘There is no doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the leaks of the past two years. The challenge to governments and their intelligence agencies is huge and it can only be met with greater co-operation from technology companies. Terrorists have long made use of the internet. But IS’s approach is different in two important areas. ‘Where Al Qaeda and its affiliates saw the internet as a place to disseminate material anonymously, IS has embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself, intimidate people, and radicalise new recruits.’ Intelligence sources have previously warned how Snowden’s revelations – mainly published by the Guardian in the UK – have made it harder to track the movements and tactics of IS because they have become better at knowing how to avoid detection. Mr Hannigan went on: ‘For our part, intelligence agencies such as GCHQ need to enter the public debate about privacy. ‘We need to show how we are accountable for the data we use to protect people, just as the private sector is increasingly under pressure to show how it filters and sells its customers’ data. ‘GCHQ is happy to be part of a mature debate on privacy in the digital age. But privacy has never been an absolute right and the debate about this should not become a reason for postponing urgent and difficult decisions. To those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of human behaviour on the internet, it can seem some technology companies are in denial about its misuse. ‘I suspect most ordinary users of the internet are ahead of them: they have strong views on the ethics of companies, whether on taxation, child protection or privacy; they do not want the media platforms they use with their friends and families to facilitate murder or child abuse. ‘They know the internet grew out of the values of Western democracy, not vice versa. I think those customers would be comfortable with a better, more sustainable relationship between the agencies and the technology companies.’ Hazel Blears, an ex-Home Office minister who sits on Westminster’s Intelligence and Security Committee, recently said IS militants would be ‘very much aware’ of what Snowden had made public. She said: ‘As an organisation that appears to be very tech savvy and certainly social media savvy, it is inevitably going to adjust its behaviour in relation to what it knows the security agencies can do.’","Privacy campaigners slam the claims and demands by Robert Hannigan .

"A 9-year-old boy who disappeared from Seattle with his father in early September was found safe Wednesday on a remote island in the South Pacific nearly 5,500 miles away from home. Billy Ginger Hanson was supposed to return to his mother in Pennsylvania September 4 after spending the summer with his father, but he never boarded the plane to go home. The child was last seen at Shilshole Bay Marine in Ballard, where he presumably boarded his father's sailboat, Draco. Found: Jeffrey Ford Hanson, left, and his son, Billy Ginger Hanson, right, have been located on the island of Niue in the South Pacific, nearly 5,500 miles from Seattle, Washington . Tropical hideaway: The tiny island nation with a population of 1,611 is located in the Pacific some 1,490 miles northeast of New Zealand . Long way from home: The father and son sailed 5,450 miles from Seattle to Niue . Following an intense two-month search, on Wednesday police and FBI investigators located Billy and his father, 46-year-old Jeffrey Hanson, on the island of Niue, reported SeattlePI.com. The tiny island nation with a population of 1,611 is located in the Pacific some 1,490 miles northeast of New Zealand - and a whopping 5,450 miles southwest of Seattle, Washington. Mr Hanson has been charged with international parental kidnapping and will remain in Niue pending extradition to the U.S. Billy's mother, Joanna Hanson, has been given the good news and federal officials are now working on reuniting her with her son. It took the efforts of the FBI; the US Attorney’s Office; the Seattle Police Department’s Major Crimes Task Force; the Port of Seattle Police Department; the US Coast Guard, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to track down the missing boy. It's not known exactly when Hanson set sail from Seattle with Billy. They were last seen by authorities August 28. Billy was supposed to fly back to his mother in Pennsylvania on September 4 - though the FBI says he never boarded the flight. Hanson is accused of abducting Billy from Shilshole Bay Marina. Billy was last seen wearing black knee-length surf shorts, with no shirt or shoes.

FBI agents in Honolulu made an appeal to Hawaii's sailing community earlier this month to look out for Hanson's 1976 White Cooper sailboat named 'Draco.' A federal arrest warrant was issued for Hanson September 12. 'When I talked to Jeff he told me they were going to Blake Island,' Billy's mother Joanna Hanson told KIRO in September. 'I love my son, and I want him back.' The Star Advertiser described Hanson as 'a known drug abuser with a volatile personality.' 'Our focus is on helping the agents at the Seattle FBI recover Billy safely, so he can go back to his mom where he belongs,' said Tom Simon, a FBI spokesman in Honolulu. 'Hawaii and the islands of the Pacific have a vibrant sailing and nautical community, and we are appealing to that community to be on the lookout for this sailboat and contact authorities with leads.'

"Democrats in Washington are either indestructible or in denial, with high-profile left-wingers insisting they won't lose control of the U.S. Senate to Republicans on Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden said Monday that he is sure it isn't going to happen. 'I predict we're gonna – we're gonna keep the Senate,'  he told a CNN interviewer. 'I've been in 66, 67 races all told, and I don't get the feeling that the oddsmakers are getting.' Prognosticators everywhere from right-wing websites to the left-leaning Washington Post – which puts the odds of a Republican takeover at a whopping 96 per cent – say he's not merely suffering a Cassandra complex, doomed to be ever-correct but never believed. His boss, Barack Obama, is on his side. Scroll down for video . TEAM PLAYER: Vice President Joe Biden (left) predicts the Democrats will hold on to control of the US Senate despite polls showing their chances are slim to none . GROUND GAME: DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (in purple) insists that her party won't give up the Senate gavel to the GOP – 'We're going to hold the Senate,' she says . Asked if the president shares Biden's optimism, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that 'he does.' Obama, he said, believes voters will remain focused on the need to 'be supportive of a candidate who is fighting for policies that benefit middle-class families.' Earnest went further, predicting that Democrats would do the better job getting voters to the polls, 'backed by a tried-and-true ground campaign strategy that, in the context of a very close race, could provide the two- or three-vote margin that could eventually make up the difference.' Last week he insisted that the White House remained 'confident,' saying that the president's progressive policy vision is 'in the best interest of the country.' 'Many Democratic candidates have been able to apply the lessons learned from the success of the Obama campaign in 2012 to benefit their own campaigns,' he cautioned, refusing to give ground on the question of Tuesday's results. He also referred reporters to the Democratic National Committee for a 'more granular' analysis. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC's chairwoman, has fired rhetorical salvos in recent days that make the Obama administration's predictions sound weak and tentative. 'We're going to hold the Senate,' she said Sunday on the ABC News program 'This Week.' Slamming her GOP counterpart Reince Priebus for his get-out-the-vote effort, she said Democrats 'have a ground game that I know [he] would take over theirs any day of the week."" Priebus disagreed. 'Our ground game is whipping their ground game,' he retorted. 'We're going to have a great night.' Claiming that polling margins were too narrow to call many crucial states one way or another, Wasserman Schultz stood firm. 'When we keep races this close,' she said, 'Democrats win.' WOUNDED: Obama's 41 per cent approval rating is lower than the 44 per cent he had four years ago – when Democrats lost big in the last midterm election . TROUBLE AT 1600: Josh Earnest, the White House's chief spokesman, acknowledged the Democrats' uphill climb but claimed they would beat back Republicans in enough statewide races to hold on to power . On the even of the 2010 midterm election that Obama later acknowledged was a 'shellacking' for his party, his job approval rating stood at 44 per cent. Monday morning's final poll from Gallup put that number at a more dismal 41 per cent. The GOP needs to pick up just six Senate seats on Tuesday to control both the House and Senate for the first time in a decade. It's possible but unlikely that potential run-off elections in Georgia and Louisiana could muddy the waters until as late as January 6. Earnest tacitly acknowledged at the White House that Obama might have to tweak his approach to governing if Republicans manage their hoped-for Senate takeover. 'Every time you have a midterm or presidential election, the consequences are significant,' he conceded. But 'I do think,' he said, 'the Democrats will retain the majority.' Regardless of a shift in its tactical toolbox, he assured reporters that the administration would keep the same policy focus 'regardless of who is in the majority in the Senate.' 'I continue to think it's gonna be Democrats, but we'll see,' Earnest said.","Joe Biden predicts 'we're gonna – we're gonna keep the Senate'

"Gregory Hippy, 26, used his garage as a cannabis factory, in which police found 28 plants (pictured) A man whose surname is Hippy has been told he faces prison after police found £8,000 worth of cannabis growing in his garage. Gregory Hippy, 36, converted the garage of his home in Lincoln into an extensive cannabis factory. When police raided the house in May this year, they discovered 28 cannabis plants, which had a street value of £8,000. Magistrates heard Hippy had converted the garage for the sole purpose of cannabis growth. The court heard bricks had been removed from the garage wall and ventilation pipes had been installed. There were also white plastic sheets on the walls, the court was told. Prosecutor Shirley Wilson said: 'The drug experts said there was a strong commercial element to this grow.' The court was told how Hippy found the drug growing equipment in the property when he moved in. Tony Freitas, defending, said: 'He says he bought the seeds on the internet. To his shock, they kept on seeding so he kept on going with it. 'He says all the equipment was at the address from the previous tenant. 'He says he was simply doing it because it was cheaper than buying it.' Hippy admitted producing a class B drug when he appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, but he denied selling it for profit. He was granted unconditional bail until his sentencing, due to be held at a later date. Magistrates heard Hippy converted the garage (pictured) for the sole purpose of cannabis growth.

"Parents of ill children are outraged after being told to buy a blow up bed from Argos if they wanted to stay in hospital with their child. The frustrated parents are calling on hospital bosses to offer more beds for parents with sick children. The bed settees provided by Doncaster Royal Infirmary in South Yorkshire are only built for one person, so hospital staff said if more than one person wanted to stay, parents should make their own arrangements. Debi Gregory said staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary told her she could bring in a blow up bed so her sister could stay with her. The bed settees provided by the hospital are only built for one person . But Governors at the Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospital trust raised concerns over parents sleeping on the floor at the hospital's children's observation unit. At a recent governors meeting it was revealed staff at the hospital had advised parents to buy a blow-up bed from Argos because of the issue. Hospital chiefs said they didn't have the money to fund more than one bed for relatives staying on wards. Some parents have suggested setting up a 'Friends of Doncaster Children's Hospital' group to raise funds. Speaking on Facebook, parent Debi Gregory said: 'I was there last week with my baby son and we were told we could bring a blow up bed in. 'My sister stayed with me while my husband was home with our other two children and she slept on two waiting room chairs pushed together.' Parent Briar Rose said: 'Parents should be given a proper bed. 'They need to be well rested to cope with the stress and worry over their sick child and to have the stamina that this takes.' Richard Parker, the trust's director of nursing, midwifery and quality, said: 'We always aim to provide the best environment for patients to receive treatment and care, and on the children's ward this means helping parents to stay with their child overnight, if they so wish. 'Space on the ward is prioritised for the care of the children. However, we do we offer a range of accommodation to parents, for example reclining chairs and beds on other wards. Hospital bosses at Doncaster Royal Infirmary said there is not the provision to provide more than one camp bed for each child. Partner Governer Adele Mumby said: 'A lot of hospitals wouldn't even be able to allow parents to sleep on the ward - at least we have been able to provide something' 'We are also happy for parents to make their own arrangements should they choose, providing staff can easily access the child to provide treatment in the case of an emergency.' Hospital Governor Adele Mumby said Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospitals provide an 'excellent service' and that staff try to do what they can to accommodate parents with an unwell youngster. 'I believe we've got an excellent facility overall, but unfortunately there isn't the provision to provide more than one camp bed for each child.' She added: 'I completely sympathise with families if they have found it difficult, but at least we have been able to provide something.' 'A lot of hospitals wouldn't even be able to allow parents to sleep on the ward.'","Parents calling on NHS bosses to offer more beds for parents .

"Mohammed Malik, 30, has been jailed for 11 years after he posed as a taxi driver to kidnap and sexually assault a drunk 20-year-old woman . A man who posed as a taxi driver to kidnap and sexually assault a drunk 20-year-old woman has been jailed for 11 years. Mohammed Malik, 30, parked his black estate car next to a taxi rank and waited for a young woman to climb in before driving her to a secluded spot in the West End of Newcastle. He dragged her into the back seat by her arms and legs and subjected her to a sexual assault despite her screams of 'No', Newcastle Crown Court heard. 'I felt scared, ashamed and embarrassed at what happened,' the victim said in a statement. 'I often lock myself in my room and put my headphones on and dance round to try to forget. 'At night I can't bear getting in a taxi again in case this happens again so I have to rely on my family. 'The trial has been the most difficult and scary time of my life and being in the same building as him was sickening. 'At times I felt as if I was to blame for it and like I was the one on trial.' She said she has lost her relationship with her boyfriend due to the stress and trauma of the assault. 'I'm no longer able to trust men and couldn't be close to my boyfriend,' she said. The woman had been out celebrating a birthday with friends in March when she started looking for a taxi at around 4am. She got into Malik's black VW Golf estate near popular complex The Gate, on Newgate Street, and asked to be taken the short distance to the place she was staying with friends. CCTV footage shows Malik's black VW Golf estate which he used to kidnap the victim and driver her to a secluded area in the West End of Newcastle . As she was a stranger to Newcastle, she didn't realise she was only 200 yards from where she needed to go. Prosecutor Julian Smith said: 'Unfortunately for her, the car she got into, believing it to be a taxi, is nothing of the sort. 'She found herself in the defendant's car, who drove her to a secluded area to the west of the city, away from the city centre. He would not let her leave the car or take her to her friends or the place where she was staying. 'He took her away under false pretences, he would not let her leave and he then took the opportunity to seriously sexually assault her.' The 30-year-old, who runs a takeaway, is seen on CCTV footage in a Newcastle shop after the assault . He was also seen buying wine, these images helped the identify him after the assault on the 20-year-old . CCTV shows Malik's car driving down the road away from the Haymarket and it stops in the lay-by taxi rank outside Debenham's. Three men saw the woman getting into the car, which they noticed was not a taxi. They made a note of the registration number and text it to police. This would ultimately help nail Malik but could not stop the attack. When the woman was examined they found bruising to her arms and legs. Malik was arrested later the same day as a result of his number plate having been sent to the police. His DNA was also recovered from the victim's clothing. Malik, 30,  denied kidnap and sexual assault but was convicted after a trial last month. Judge John Milford QC, who said he could not be sure the attack was pre-planned, told Malik he must sign the sex offender register for life and jailed him for 11 years. The judge said: 'This was a case of abduction and there was prolonged detention and it was a sustained incident. '(The woman) was particularly vulnerable due to the fact she was inebriated.' Malik's barrister said he had lost an 'awful lot' as a result of the offence, including his fish and chip shop and other properties he managed.","Mohammed Malik, 30, posed as a taxi driver to sexually assault a woman .

"Our human ancestors did come from Africa but left the continent to spread across the world via a different route than first thought, scientists have revealed. A six-year study mapping genetic patterns found that people who ended up in Europe, Asia and Oceania got there by crossing the sea to Arabia around 70,000 years ago. Scientists had thought that humankind left for other continents in a northern direction through Egypt's Sinai region but now it seems they wandered further south, probably via Yemen. Evidence shows sea levels were probably low enough for the first people to cross from the horn of Africa into Arabia via the Red Sea's Bab-el-Mandeb straits. From there it seems that southern Asian countries like India were key stopping points from where humans spread across the rest of the world. Settlers followed a coastal route down into east Asia and Oceania while others burst upwards into Iran, Russia, Europe and China. Researchers have found that the Indian populations had more genetic diversity, showing they have a greater age than Europeans or east Asians, which they say proves their theory. Base: The rich variety of people in India has led scientists to believe it is from there that many humans spread across the world after leaving Africa . Change: It has long been thought that humans travelled through the Sinai Desert in Egypt, pictured, but this has now been discounted . 'Evolutionary history shows that human populations likely originated in Africa, and the Genographic Project, the most extensive survey of human population genetic data to date, suggests where they went next: Modern humans migrated out of Africa via a southern route through Arabia, rather than a northern route by way of Egypt,' a spokesman for IBM said, who were involved in the research. Studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from Africa roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago . Scientists used a new complicated research technique to study the path of the humans. Called recombination, they broke up DNA molecules and recombined them to form new pairs. By doing this they can see the relationships with humans today and 70,000 years ago. Genographic Project director Dr Spencer Wells said their techniques could provide 'greater insights into the migratory history of our species.' Nearly 500,000 indigenous and members of the general public have taken part and given DNA samples. 'Over the past six years, we’ve had the opportunity to gather and analyse genetic data around the world at a scale and level of detail that has never been done before,' said report co-author Ajay Royyuru, senior manager at IBM's Computational Biology Centre . 'When we started, our goal was to bring science expeditions into the modern era to further a deeper understanding of human roots and diversity. 'With evidence that the genetic diversity in southern India is closer to Africa than that of Europe, this suggests that other fields of research such as archaeology and anthropology should look for additional evidence on the migration route of early humans to further explore this theory.'","Our ancestors headed into India via Yemen before wandering further east and north .

Dr Julie Wray, of Salford University, interviewed women . two to three weeks, three months and six to seven months after they had . given birth to gain a unique insight into postnatal recovery. She concluded that it takes a year to recover from childbirth. Her study also revealed significant dissatisfaction amongst new mothers with postnatal services. Still recovering: A University of Salford study has found that it takes a year - not six weeks - to get over childbirth (file image) The new mothers Dr Wray spoke to said that the six week recovery time was a 'fantasy'. Many were disappointed by the six week check, which all mothers receive from either their midwife or their GP. Some did not receive a physical examination, and others were not told whether or not their bodies had recovered yet. The psychological effects can also take much longer to recover from. Dr Wray's study found that hospital wards can have a negative impact on women’s ability to recoup and celebrate the birth of their child because of the constant stream of visitors and the unfamiliar rules and regulations. Helping new mothers adapt to having a baby in the home has also changed a lot over the years. In the past women were shown how to perform tasks such as baby bathing and were only discharged from hospital when they were ready. Now women can go home as soon as six hours after childbirth and many  feel they are just 'left to get on with it'. Additional pressure: Amanda Holden went back to week just two weeks after she almost died during childbirth . Dr Wray said: 'The research shows that more realistic and woman-friendly postnatal services are needed. 'Women feel that it takes much longer than six weeks to recover and they should be supported beyond the current six to eight weeks after birth. 'However, government funding cuts and a national shortage of midwives means that postnatal services will only face further challenges. The midwifery profession must raise the status of postnatal care as any further erosion can only be bad for women and their children.' The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the research. Sue MacDonald, Head of Education and Research at the RCM told MailOnline: 'We are very aware that the postnatal period has always been a bit of a fairy tale. 'We are often not able to see women as much as we would like to. Community midwives may be able to help at home but not always, and mothers do not stay in hospital for very long after childbirth any more. 'Women do suffer ill-health, which involves back ache and feeling tired. They could be seen as minor problems, but they are not minor for new mums.' The physical recovery is, of course, just one side of the story. Women also need to make the psychological transition to being a mother - which is even tougher for those who were working before giving birth. Many feel the pressure to get back on their feet soon after childbirth. And seeing celebrities like Amanda Holden looking fantastic just weeks after almost dying during childbirth must be 'very, very frustrating', MacDonald said. She added that recent studies have shown that women will put up with a lot of discomfort after childbirth because they think that it is normal. The Royal College of Widwives is conducting its own studies to see how they can make sure that discomfort is not the norm.","Official view is that new mothers should be back to 'normal' in six weeks .

"Ed Miliband's favourite Savile Row tailor has gone bust – costing a string of celebrity investors hundreds of thousands of pounds. Spencer Hart, the design label which made the suit Mr Miliband wore to address the Labour conference last week, has gone into liquidation after racking up debts of more than £1.25 million. TV stars James Corden, Ant and Dec and Dermot O’Leary as well as singer Robbie Williams are among those left out of pocket by the collapse. Scroll down for video . Star backing: Robbie Williams, left, who ploughed £250,000 into Spencer Hart retail, set up by Nick Hart, right . Suits from Spencer Hart Retail Ltd featured in Sherlock Holmes, starring Benedict Cumberbatch . Companies House records show that Williams invested the most, ploughing £250,000 into Spencer Hart Retail Ltd, while Corden put in £73,500. X Factor host Dermot O’Leary contributed £49,000 and Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly handed over £90,000 each. The firm was set up by designer Nick Hart in 2002, and named after his son. It quickly became a favourite among celebrities, counting Daniel Craig and David Bowie as customers; while Benedict Cumberbatch modelled the brand in a Spencer Hart catwalk show in 2012. Mr Miliband also wore Spencer Hart for his keynote speech at last year’s party conference. The company’s financial woes came to light last year when it was forced to enter into a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows insolvent or debt-ridden firms to keep trading to settle their bills. Benedict Cumberbatch is often seen wearing one of Spencer Hart's trademark suits . Chic: Benedict Cumberbatch with a model showcasing the brand on the Spencer Hart catwalk in 2012 . Last night Mr Rubin told The Mail on Sunday that creditors were ‘concerned’ by the liquidation. Spencer Hart agreed to repay creditors at a rate of just under £2,000 a week over a five-year period. But documents reveal that, after Mr Hart failed to raise extra funds to rescue the business, he was forced to appoint a team of accountants to wind it up in June. This means celebrity backers have little chance of getting back their investments. Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey, pictured with wife Camila Alves, dressed in a Spencer Hart suit for the 65th Cannes Film Festival post-screening party of 'The Paperboy' James Corden, left, invested £73,500 in the company while X Factor host Dermot O’Leary, right, contributed £49,000. They are both pictured in a Spencer Hart suit . Accountancy firm David Rubin and Partners is currently investigating how the company managed to fall into so much debt and has begun contacting the high-profile investors to explain the situation. If the report finds Mr Hart had been paying himself too much from the business, then the investors could sue him. It is believed that the company’s flagship store – which opened opposite Claridge’s in Mayfair in 2011 – has been a hefty drain on resources. The tailor became popular in celebrities circle, including among Daniel Radcliffe, left, and Sean Combs, right, the rapper also known as Diddy and Puff Daddy . British model David Gandy pictured left wearing Spencer Hart at a charity ball in London, while Alex Turner, frontman of the Arctic Monkeys, is pictured at the launch of the designer's flagship store in 2011 . The company also has a second store in Savile Row. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, the company made pre-tax losses of £811,337. A second company run by Nick Hart – Hart Savile Row Ltd – also filed a CVA with Companies House in February this year as it faced debts exceeding £250,000. Robbie Williams invested after Hart provided the suits for his Swing When You’re Winning tour in 2002. The former Take That singer – worth about £120 million – once said: ‘From the day I met Nick, I have worn little else but Spencer Hart on a smart day. You can spot his style a mile off, and I love it.’","Spencer Hart has gone into liquidation after racking up £1.25m in debts .

"Michael Brown, was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August . Police committed human rights abuses during protests that erupted after an officer killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Amnesty International has claimed. In a report released today, the international human rights organisation said the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and heavy military equipment and restrictions placed on peaceful protesters violated international standards. The report said police officers should be investigated by authorities for the abuses, which occurred amid weeks of racially-charged protests after the 18-year-old was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. The group said it had sent a delegation to Ferguson from August 14 to 22 to monitor the situation. Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, which helped oversee law enforcement operations in Ferguson, said police 'had one mission, and that was the preservation of life.' The report also criticizes a Missouri law that the group said may be unconstitutional because it allows police to use deadly force against someone even if there is no imminent threat of harm. Rachel Ward, director of research at Amnesty International called on state lawmakers to make Missouri law comply with international standards making lethal force by police a last resort. 'Lethal force is only to be used to protect life when there is an immediate threat,' she said. 'The Missouri statute goes far beyond that. It is of grave concern.' Scroll down for video . Michael Brown's death was followed by several days of civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. Pictured, police face off with demonstrators on October 22 . A protest this week in Ferguson was scheduled to coincide with a day of action to take place nationwide to draw attention to police brutality . Amnesty cited a Missouri statute that says a police officer may use deadly force 'in effecting an arrest or in preventing an escape from custody' when that officer 'reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested ... has committed or attempted to commit a felony.' A grand jury in St. Louis County is weighing whether or not Wilson should be charged in Brown's death. Wilson has not spoken publicly about the incident. The Justice Department is investigating Brown's killing and the Ferguson Police Department. Witnesses and law enforcement officials have said Brown and Wilson got into an altercation after Wilson told Brown to stop walking down the middle of a street. Wilson then shot Brown six times. Some witnesses have said Brown had his hands up in surrender when the last shots were fired. 'Michael Brown was unarmed and thus unlikely to have presented a serious threat to the life of the police officer,' the report said.

"My hair has been curled, my eyelids weighed down with enormous false . lashes and my skin buffed with bronzing shimmer. I have squeezed myself . with some difficulty into a skin-tight, yellow diamante-encrusted gown . and satin high heels. A 6ft 3in muscle-bound beefcake has me in his . manly embrace - which I’m rather embarrassed about, as there’s sweat . running between my shoulder blades and I suspect I’m probably not a very . fragrant armful. It’s certainly a far cry from my usual weekly . exercise class, which sees me flinging on an ancient tracksuit and . heading to an all-female Pilates studio. This, however, is keep fit . Strictly-style. Scroll down for video . Best foot forward: Professional dancer Ian Waite shows Lydia the elegant workout . The dance show has proved to be one of the world’s most effective (and exclusive) weight-loss bootcamps. This . year, portly actor Mark Benton shed a full 3st before he sambaed off . the floor for the last time, an astonishing result - especially as he . never seemed to move much. 'If you want to get fit, go and dance,' he . declared. He seems to have a point. During each 13-week series, fans . watch from the comfort of their sofas as the show’s stars shrink before . their eyes. Soap star Lisa Riley dropped three dress sizes on last . year's Strictly, while astrologer Russell Grant, star of the 2011 show, . boasted of having to have his trousers taken in by 7.5 inches. Last . month, the already-svelte broadcaster Susanna Reid announced she'd lost . 7lb - and each week since, she's flashed her enviable pins in another . skimpy frock, looking slimmer and fitter than ever, while I tuck into a . mince pie or three on the sofa. With a round of Christmas parties . beckoning, it is clear that my fitness regime needs a jump-start - but . could a dance class really be enough to get me into my little black . dress? Strictly Come Dancing stars Ian Waite and Natalie Lowe . certainly think so. The pair have launched a nationwide Strictly-themed . fitness class, FitSteps (tagline: 'Fitness that's Strictly fun!') with . former swimming gold medallist Mark Foster, who was a contestant in . 2008. The classes are based on Strictly's traditional ballroom and . classic Latin steps. Having a partner isn't necessary because classes . are run line-dance style. Nor, sadly, do you need a beautiful dress . like the one I've borrowed from DSI, the dance clothing company which . supplies Strictly, although pull-on floaty skirts are planned to help . get participants in the mood. And it doesn't even matter if you have . two left feet like me and former contestant John Sergeant - the . routines are so simple even children can follow them. Or so I'm told. However, . it doesn't feel like that as I watch Natalie and Ian charlestoning . enthusiastically in front of me in a London studio, jazz-hands a-flutter . as they call out the moves. I don’t think I'll ever be able to keep up, . but their enviable physiques are enough to make me try. Put through her paces: Natalie Lowe and Ian show Lydia the FitSteps moves . We start . with what they term a 'gentle warm-up'. This turns out to be a brisk . gallop through the tango, paso doble, cha-cha, samba, rumba, jive and . waltz. After five minutes, I'm breathing hard, and technically we . haven’t started the class yet. Our first routine is based on the . cha-cha, the swaying Latin dance. I've never taken dance lessons, but . figure that all those hours watching Strictly should have stood me in . good stead. All the dancers on TV do a good deal of bottom-wiggling, . so I try to do the same. But that isn't enough for Ian and Natalie. I . must dance from side-to-side following the complicated 'one, two, . cha-cha-cha' beat, then fling my arms out while pointing my toe and . slowly sliding it across the floor. As I run to and fro, trying to . keep up with the toes twinkling in front of me, I fear my efforts are . definitely more ha-ha than cha-cha. I'm just glad Craig Revel Horwood . isn't there to deliver his verdict. At the end of the four-minute dance, . my stomach achesis aching and I’m positively gasping for breath. Fortunately, . we’re moving on to a waltz, a step I (vaguely) know how to do. And - . hurray! - it's a slowie. Except that the FitSteps version involves doing . numerous sets of forward lunges, then dancing round in a square while . pretending to clasp a partner in a ballroom hold. After a few . minutes of this, my biceps and shoulders are aching and I long to kick . off my dancing shoes and slink back to the sofa. Still, according to . Natalie, this will tone my upper arms, bottom and thighs, and it’s . definitely more fun than Pilates. Strictly fit: Dancing burns calories and tones muscles . From there, we change to a jive . for a cardio-vascular workout which has me doing charleston kicks, . throwing my arms in the air, and jumping round in little circles. And . finally, there's a quickstep for all-over body-toning. To my . untrained eye, the celebrities on Strictly look as though they are just . running across the floor during the quickstep, but having learned the . fiendishly difficult dance moves, I have new respect for their abilities . -— and I have aches where I didn’t know I had muscles. This, of . course, is the point of FitSteps. The exercise is the brainchild of . swimmer Mark Foster, who was a contestant on Strictly in 2008, straight . after competing in the Beijing Olympics. 'I was the fittest I'd ever . been,' he tells me. 'But when I went on Strictly, I lost another half . stone and became fitter and more toned just from dancing. 'I also . became aware of my posture in a way I never was when I was swimming. Then, all I thought about was how to get to the other end of the pool as . fast as possible - I never worried about what I looked like. But . dancing is all about posture and core strength.' Mark then danced . with Natalie on the Strictly arena tour last year, and suggested they . team up to create a ballroom dance-based fitness programme. She brought . in her dance partner, Ian, who had been making similar plans. ‘I had . thought, I know the ballroom and classic Latin steps do such a good job . for the body, why can’t there be a class using them all?’ says Ian. FitSteps . launched in June, and Strictly fever means the class has already taken . off. There are over 1,200 licensed instructors across the country, all . of whom have been trained in the Strictly Fit workout, and more than . 1,400 classes available every week, catering for everyone from . under-tens to over-70s. 'People want to get fitter and healthier, . and the best way is by doing something you love,' says Mark. 'Lots of . people don’t like going to the gym or running, but they choose to go . dancing on a Saturday night. So it makes sense.' Better than boot camp: Actor Mark Benton lost weight on this year's Strictly . According to . FitSteps Programme Director, Damian Lo Cascio, a woman of average weight . and height will burn around 750 calories in one 45-minute class - . compared with around 450 calories for the same time spent swimming. 'As . soon as you stand up and take a ballroom hold, you engage all of your . upper body muscles, all your back muscles, your arm muscles, your . laterals and all of your abdominals,' he says. 'That's the main . difference between doing this and something like Zumba or aerobics, . where your legs move but your arms are quite floppy. It increases the . calorie burn massively.' IT trainer Ingrid Foan, 55, has been attending Ian's Berkshire class every week since it launched. 'It's . the most inspirational class I've ever been to,' she raves. 'We do this . American Smooth, and you feel like you're in the show.' Apparently some attendees dropped a dress size in three weeks. I . can certainly see how. I've managed just 25 minutes, and my leg muscles . are shaking. I've probably burned 300 calories. Best of all, I haven't . really noticed the pain, because I've been concentrating far too hard on . learning the steps. And while I may not exactly be Strictly siren Abbey Clancy, it turns out I've got more dance potential than Ann Widdecombe. 'If . I had you as my partner on Strictly, I'd be delighted,' says Natalie, . kindly. That's me sold. I'll be signing up to a regular class, just to . ensure my basic moves are up to scratch in case Strictly comes calling.

"'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' Frankel wrote in the Instagram post . She caused quite a stir among her online followers when she posted a picture of herself wearing her daughter's tiny Hello Kitty pajamas on Instagram a couple of months ago. And now reality star Bethenny Frankel has felt the wrath of a Manhattan judge, who warned the mother that it's time to stop playing dress up as a four-year-old. 'No more pajamas!' Justice Ellen Gesmer warned Frankel's attorney, Allan Mayefsky in court. The judge yesterday said Frankel had used poor judgment by posting the photograph online in July, adding that the episode was 'ridiculous', Page Six reports. Frankel, 43, and estranged husband Jason Hoppy were at the Manhattan courthouse as part of their lengthy divorce proceedings. The Real Housewives star had tried to gain sole custody of her daughter  but then settled after an embarrassing trial where she called Hoppy 'white trash'. Frankel's A-list lawyer Mr Mayefsky tried to explain his client's behavior by saying it was a joke, but Justice Gesmer responded: 'It's not a joke. Her child is not a joke'. The judge also said she was concerned the image would be on the internet well into the years when Frankel's daughter can read and see the post and responses for herself. The now-notorious photo showed Frankel wearing daughter Bryn's Hello Kitty pajamas with a ruffled pink top, shorts and matching slippers. 'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' she wrote in the post. The photo provoked outrage, with many of her followers claiming that Frankel, who is the author of a book called Naturally Thin, was setting a bad example for her young daughter. One message read: 'Really don't think your sending your daughter a good message. She probably thinks wow my mom's a lot older than me and can fit my clothes, so I must be really big for my age.' ‘Starting a complex early for your daughter,’ another commenter added of the pic. Another message read: ‘I would just caution doing this as she gets more impressionable. She needs to develop a healthy self-image because she may not have all of your genes…and it won't be obvious to you, but it will look as though you are competing with her.’ Frankel defended herself on Twitter claiming that she was just joking and trying to please her daughter. Bethenny Frankel was spotted carrying her  daughter, Bryn, to a ballet class in New York yesterday. Neither Frankel nor her estranged husband were in the courtroom for the discussion later in the day . Neither Frankel nor her estranged husband were in the courtroom for the discussion. Later, Frankel declined to comment. The mom rose to fame via reality TV, first as a contestant on The Apprentice: Martha Stewart and then on The Real Housewives of New York City. On the back of her celebrity she has written several books, including Naturally Thin: Unleash Your SkinnyGirl and The SkinnyGirl Dish: Easy Recipes for Your Naturally Thin Life. She also created the Skinnygirl cocktail company which she then sold for an estimated $100 million. Frankel has admitted to an unhealthy relationship with food in the past. In 2010, she told Redbook magazine that she 'used to get drunk and binge on everything in the deli, and then do a juice fast or starve, then do it all over again'.

"Five healthy lifestyle traits can protect  against bowel cancer, according to new research. A fifth of cases in men and over a tenth in women could be prevented if they kept slim, banished the stomach bulge and exercised more, a study found. People should also avoid smoking, drink alcohol moderately and switch to a diet packed with fibres, fruits, vegetables, fish, yoghurt, nuts and seeds with little red and processed meats. The risk is lowered for each 'good' behaviour trait adopted, and the impact is stronger in men than women. A fifth of cases of bowel cancer in men and more than a tenth in women could be prevented if they kept slim, took regular exercise, ate a healthy diet, avoided smoking and drank alcohol in moderation. File picture . The risk is lowered with every 'good' behaviour trait the person adopts, researchers found . People who practised a combination of two, three, four and all five of the healthy behaviours had a 13 per cent, 21 per cent, 34 per cent and 37 per cent lower risk of developing bowel cancer respectively. Lead author Dr Krasimira Aleksandrova, from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke said: 'Our data confirmed that with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle behaviors the risk that a person will have of developing bowel cancer decreases. 'Estimates based on our study populations suggest that up to 22 per cent of the cases in men and 11 per cent of the cases in women would have been prevented if all five of the healthy lifestyle behaviours had been followed. 'Our results particularly demonstrate the potential for prevention in men who are at a higher risk of bowel cancer than women. She added: 'These data provide additional incentive to individuals, medical professionals and public health authorities to invest in healthy lifestyle initiatives. 'Each person can contribute a lot to avoid cancer, the more healthy lifestyle changes, the better.' Around 40,000 new cases are diagnosed every year in the UK and the NHS estimates one in every 20 people will develop bowel cancer during their lifetime. Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer. However, between seven and eight in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis and more than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years. Lead author Dr Krasimira Aleksandrova, from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke said: 'Our data confirmed that with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle behaviors the risk that a person will have of developing bowel cancer decreases.

The study analysed the data of 347,237 men and women from 10 countries from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study using a healthy lifestyle index. Over the 12-year study period, 3,759 cases of bowel cancer were recorded. Researchers looked at the five key healthy behaviours associated with a reduction in the risk of developing bowel cancer. Previous research had identified links between rates of cancer and western lifestyles and focused on isolated lifestyle behaviours with little known about the combined impact of lifestyle choices. For each of the five behaviors, participants were assigned one point for having the healthy factor and zero for not having the healthy factor. These points were then summed to generate a cumulative score for each participant. The more healthy lifestyle factors the cohort adopted, the lower their risk of bowel cancer. The study was published in the journal BMC Medicine.","Healthy lifestyle could prevent a fifth of cases in men and  a tenth in women .

"A grieving mother whose fiancé was killed in a road crash has started dating his doppelganger - after they met on an online dating site. Naz Faruk, from Wokingham, Berkshire, was pregnant when her partner Mark Ashdown, died in a motorbike accident last July. The devastated 28-year-old gave birth to their daughter, Sia, in February, but just months later met a man who looked strikingly similar to her late fiancé. Naz Faruk, pictured holding a picture of her late fiancé Mark Ashdown, is now dating his doppelganger Michael Miller, pictured right holding Ms Faruk and Mr Ashdown's baby Sia . Ms Faruk could not believe the similarities between Michael Miller and her late fiancé Mark Ashdown. Mr Miller is pictured holding up a photograph of Mr Ashdown . After Mr Ashdown's death, Ms Faruk doubted she would meet the man of her dreams again. But just weeks after giving birth, she started talking to 23-year-old Michael Miller on an online dating site - and could not believe the similarities. She said: 'It was so crazy, I felt as thought I was talking to Mark but it was Michael. 'Nothing will ever replace Mark but it was surreal to meet another person so like him. 'It took two months of talking online before me and Michael met but we hit it off straight away. 'Mark was caring and was emotional and I found that Michael was exactly the same. 'Michael is over 6ft tall with long golden brown hair and blue eyes - just like Mark. Mark also enjoyed playing the guitar as does Michael, the list is endless. Mark Ashdown (pictured left) died in a motorbike accident in July last year. His grieving partner Naz Faruk later gave birth to their baby, Sia (pictured right with Michael Miller, who Ms Faruk is now dating) Mr Ashdown (pictured with his fiancée Naz Faruk) died when he was involved in a motorbike accident at a crossroads. His parents had to deliver the devastating news to Ms Faruk after she rang his mobile. 'People are always making comparisons to Michael and Mark. I just feel so lucky to have found someone who understands me like my fiancé did. I never thought I'd fall in love again.' Mr Ashdown died  when he was involved in a motorbike accident at a crossroads. His parents had to deliver the devastating news to Ms Faruk after she rang his mobile. She said: 'I called Mark as I wondered why I hadn't heard from him all afternoon. 'I fell to my knees when they told me he had died, I couldn't take it all in. 'He was too young to die, we had our whole lives to look forward too, it was so cruel. 'Apparently he had misjudged some changing traffic lights when he hit into another car. 'It was the biggest shock, I had never gone through everything like this in my life. I thought we would grow old together. 'I was petrified I would lose the baby too - the only piece of Mark left with me.' Ms Faruk (pictured right with baby Sia) described her late fiancé Mark Ashdown (left) as 'caring and emotional' and found that Michael Miller was 'exactly the same' Thankfully, Ms Faruk had a smooth pregnancy and baby Sia has helped her through the trauma of losing her fiancé.

"Police say Jill Roy, 33, was stopped in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts last month. They then found $350 worth of heroin and 13 oxycodon pills beneath her plastic butt enhancer (FILE) A Massachusetts woman was arrested last month after police say some pills fell from her pant leg during a traffic stop, but police soon discovered she had more to hide beneath her hard posterior. Jill Roy, 33, was stopped in Buzzard's Bay on September 16 when the drugs allegedly tumbled to the ground near a squad car. When she was searched at the station, police say they found Roy was wearing stiff plastic underwear. Underneath those, they say, was a $350 bag of heroin and 13 oxycodone pills. Before police found the hidden drugs, they say they first asked Roy what the plastic derriere was all about. 'I don’t have a butt so I wear these and another pair of underwear under it,' the mother of three explained, according to a police report obtained by the Smoking Gun. Underneath, police spotted a 'large bulge,' which they say turned out to be the opiates. Roy, who police described as 'skinny,' has an extensive criminal record according to the Smoking Gun. Previous arrests have seen Roy charged with 'possession and distribution of illegal narcotics.' Police most recently charged Roy with felony and misdemeanor drug possession. She was held in lieu of $5,000 bail.","Police in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts say Jill Roy, 33, was arrested after a bag of pills fell out of her pants during a September 16 traffic stop .

"Mystified. It’s the only word for it. Why would someone with a face as pretty and as interesting as actress Renee Zellweger voluntarily do that to herself? Or, as a friend of mine said last night as we were discussing it (there really was no other topic of conversation), at what point do you sit down with your plastic surgeon, point to the ‘poor man’s Christie Brinkley’ page and say ‘I’ll have THAT one’? It’s not so much that she doesn’t look attractive. It’s more that she doesn’t look like Renee Zellweger. In fact, she doesn’t look like anyone in particular. Her face, once so instantly recognisable, is now about as memorable as a shop dummy’s. This person, the strange-looking person who used to be the film star Zellweger, has one of the worst cases of FGW (Face Gone Weird syndrome) I have ever seen. Scroll down for video . Mystified. It’s the only word for it. Why would someone with a face as pretty and as interesting as actress Renee Zellweger voluntarily do that to herself? asks Sarah Vine . All the elements of attractiveness are there: blonde hair, blue eyes, plump lips, smooth skin. But a human face is much more than the sum of its parts. And that’s how you end up with FGW. All those treatments, those fillers, or those jabs, or those little nips and tucks, are fine in theory. In practice, however, it’s quite another story. What’s more, it appears to be catching. A couple of weeks ago, Liz Hurley appeared in public with the unmistakable early warning signs of FGW. A waxy sheen to her complexion; patches of eerily smooth skin; and an almost total absence of shadows on the face, lending it a strange, one-dimensional quality. It doesn’t only affect the older generation, either. At just 28, Lindsay Lohan appears to be suffering from early onset FGW — although with her it’s often hard to tell whether that slight puffiness is due to fillers or the fact that her liver’s having to work double shifts. Even more worrying is Tulisa Contostavlos, 26, whose minxy charm seems to be giving way to a sub-Kim Kardashian glassiness. Cher is well known for her changed appearance over the years, a sufferer of 'FGW' syndrome says Sarah . Other famous sufferers include Cher (who many experts agree might well qualify as patient zero in this worldwide epidemic), Madonna, Meg Ryan and Melanie Griffith. All women who in their perfectly understandable quest to slow down the signs of ageing have instead succeeded in turning themselves into someone else. This someone else is no one you’ve ever seen before. She looks like everyone and no one. And you don’t just see her in the pages of the magazines or in the movies, either. She is everywhere, in swanky West End restaurants, laughing into her champagne at parties, walking her dog in the better postcodes of London. I come across her often in my line of work. She’s common at political fundraisers, dripping in diamonds on the arm of some corpulent industrialist with a bulge in his back pocket and a yen for a peerage. There she is again, at a charity concert, or picking up the kids in her white Range Rover before speeding off to the Cotswolds for the weekend. You’ll see her turning left on a half-term flight to Barbados, or exercising with grim purpose at a gym in Knightsbridge. Melanie Griffith is a victim of 'face gone weird' syndrome says Sarah. She thinks that by trying to slow down the ageing process women have succeeded in turning themselves into someone else. Her friends worry about her. They wonder, should they intervene? But how can you? How can you say to a woman who looks at herself in the mirror each morning and sees a reflection of her ‘happy, healthy lifestyle’ (as Bridget Jones star Zellweger attributed her new face to yesterday) that she just looks weird. That the fillers and Botox and little lifts here and there have erased many of the signs of ageing, but in doing so they’ve also removed much of the character that made her, as an individual, special? The problem with FGW is that while the outward signs may be physical, the root cause is a complex tangle of psychological factors. A young Kylie Minogue (left) and now (right). Sarah says she comes across women who have had work done on their faces all the time. It’s not as simple as wanting to look younger. It’s to do with a whole variety of pressures, emanating from many different sources. For FGW, you see, is the ultimate expression of the hyper-critical self-loathing that many women, rich, poor, successful or otherwise, feel when they look in the mirror. It is — and I truly believe this — a form of self-harm, every bit as distressing and as damaging as bulimia or anorexia. It used to be the case that when things weren’t going her way, a woman would repair to the hairdressers for a new cut, or treat herself to a new shade of lipstick. She might go blonde, or lose weight — anything, really, to lift the spirits, to take back control and get back on top. Madonna is credited for her hard work keeping fit and defying her age but her face has also defied gravity . Now she books herself in for some Botox. And while she’s at it, maybe a few fillers. And is it really true that there’s a jaw-lift that doesn’t involve surgery? Can I really have the fat under my chin dissolved by a simple injection? A tweak here, a tweak there. Always close to the desired result, but never quite. Perhaps one more chemical peel, doctor, do you think that will do it? None of these things on their own are necessarily an issue. I, for example, have Botox two or three times a year in the vertical frown lines between my brows. It doesn’t make them disappear, it just softens them very slightly. I’m always being offered other treatments — peels, lasers and the rest. Nicole Kidman maintains that her face is 100 per cent natural and she has not used botox or fillers . But I say no. At 47, I’m OK with the way I look. Granted, I’m not as dewy as I once was, and my jowls are definitely more on the wobbly side than I would like; but the only thing that really depresses me is that wretched frown line, and so that’s as far as I go. Anything else would be a slippery slope. Because it’s the layering of treatments that does it, the slow, silent creep. In the same way that you never notice you’re getting fat because the process happens in a series of small increments over a long period of time, it’s hard to recognise FGW in yourself. It’s not until, say, you step out at an awards ceremony having been out of the public eye for a few years and the whole world goes ‘Woah, there lady, what have you done with our Renee?’ that maybe you realise you might have gone a smidge too far. But then I have one big advantage over all these women. I am not a film star. I don’t have to appear ten times magnified in glorious Technicolor on a big screen, or be photographed on the red carpet and my pictures beamed around the world. I don’t have newspapers and magazines scrutinising my every look. All those treatments, those fillers, or those jabs, or those little nips and tucks, are fine in theory. In practice, however, it’s quite another story, says Sarah. Lulu has drastically changed in appearance since her younger days . And because I’m too old to be a fully paid-up member of the selfie generation, I’m not endlessly taking photos of myself on my smartphone and posting them on Facebook either, a fact that goes some way to providing me with a certain immunity to FGW. The same, sadly, cannot be said of my daughter’s generation. Already, aged 11, they all have their special ‘photo-faces’, certain practised expressions and angles they have learned to adopt in order to look their best. I have yet to acquire mine: if someone points a lens at me I just grin like a baboon, all chins and piggy eyes. Hashtag fail, as young people say these days. Question is, will FGW spread beyond the rich and famous to ordinary girls and women? Now we have the means — salons offering an array of so-called non surgical procedures up and down the country — will all women gradually morph into broadly the same person? Sad to say, I’d put money on it.","Why would someone as pretty  Renee Zellweger change her face?

On the second-last day of the annual event, fillies rolled around the floor with friends, discarded their stiletto heels and enjoyed the sunshine. With their Smirnoff Ice cans or plastic champagne flutes in hand, they frolicked on the grass in all their finery. Some opted to wear black outfits for the occasion. But there were also flashes of bright yellows, deep blues and eye-popping fuschias. By the time the Oaks, the biggest race was underway at 5pm, there were embraces and affectionate hugs aplenty. The Oaks was won by Set Square, with the owners collecting a $1 million prize.

As the day went on, some opted to ditch the heels and go bare foot, while others ripped off their ties and ended up taking a snooze to sleep off a hard day. Victorian police were relatively pleased with behaviour, praising Melbourne Cup crowds, with only two people arrested and ten evicted for boozy bad behaviour.

"It is a stunning example of how beautiful space can be. European Space Agency bosses have revealed this amazing image of the so-called 'butterfly nebula. It shows the death throes of a star, when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space. NGC 6302, captured here in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, is  known as the Bug or Butterfly Nebula. Known perhaps more appropriately as the Bug or Butterfly Nebula, this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light-years away from us within the Milky Way. It was formed when a star around five times the mass of our Sun became a red giant, ejected its outer layers, and became intensely hot. Its distinctive shape classifies it as a bipolar nebula, where fast-moving gas can escape more easily from the poles of the dying star than from around its equator. This creates a lobed structure reminiscent of an hourglass or, as in this case, a giant cosmic butterfly. The image shows planetary nebula NGC 6302, captured from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. 'Known perhaps more appropriately as the Bug or Butterfly Nebula, this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light-years away from us within the Milky Way, the agency said.

This creates a lobed structure reminiscent of an hourglass or, as in this case, a giant cosmic butterfly. While this image is beautiful in its own right, the mix of colours actually tells us a lot about physical conditions within the nebula. The red edges of the butterfly wings represent areas that emit light from the element nitrogen, due to the relatively low temperatures there. Conversely the white splashes closer to the nebula's centre pinpoint light emitted by the element sulphur, marking regions of higher temperature and colliding gases closer to the central star. This hot gas was expelled from the star and collided with slower-moving gas in its path, creating rippling shock waves through the nebula. Another example of interstellar art: This image of the center of the Milky Way, an area known an Namibia, was captured in 2011 . An example of such a shock wave can be seen in the well-defined white blob towards the top right of the image. Other colours identify emission from oxygen, helium and hydrogen gases. The observations making up this composite image were taken in optical and ultraviolet light on 27 July 2009, using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3.","Butterfly Nebula lies 3800 light-years away from us within the Milky Way .

"In his first sermon since testifying about his father's sexual abuse, Hillsong's senior pastor Brian Houston defended his lack of action upon finding out his father was a paedophile. Mr Houston told the congregation of thousands at Baulkham Hills in New South Wales on Sunday that he did not approach police because Frank Houston's victim, named AHA, did not want to prompt an investigation into the abuse. 'You had a situation where this was the first time I had ever heard about my father's abuses,' Mr Houston said to the huge crowd, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'There was a victim, a survivor, who was adamant he did not want a police investigation and he didn't want a church investigation. Scroll down for video . Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston (left), used his sermon on Sunday to defend his decision not to go to police after hearing of sexual abuse allegations against his pastor father Frank Houston (right) who died in 2004 . Mr Houston also publicly defended both his and the Church's roles in the private $10,000 payment to the victim during his sermon at the Hillsong church in Baulkham Hills (pictured) The Hillsong leader also suggested that no other church leaders advised him to approach police about the abuse allegations, despite also being informed of the claims. 'So, I genuinely believed at the time, by the way no one gave me any advice to counter this, that if he wanted to go to police, he was 36, he could,' Mr Houston said. 'Obviously if it was someone who was still a child we would have had no choice but to report it. It seems I was wrong and that will form part of the findings.' During the sermon, Mr Houston also defended both his and the Church's roles in privately paying the victim $10,000 in compensation for the abuse, saying it was between only his father and AHA. 'There have been reports of money being paid to the victim. Again for clarification, this was between my father and the victim,' he said to the following, 'It had nothing to do with me or Hillsong Church.' 'You never forget the moment you find out your father is a paedophile': Brian Houston said at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse in Sydney last week . Mr Houston first heard the allegations levelled by AHA in late October 1999 during his weekly meeting with general manager George Aghajanian. He originally told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse that he did not immediately report the incident to the police as he did not want to 'pre-empt' the victim. 'It hit me in a ten second period, in a wave,' he told the commission, 'you never forget' the moment you find out your father is a paedophile. He told the hearing he first he had to get his head around his father being a homosexual, before he realised Mr Aghanajanian was talking about paedophilia. Mr Houston then cried and went home. 'I was devastated, to be honest with you,' he said. 'Totally devastated.' The witness AHA alleged to the hearing on Tuesday that when he was 7, that Mr Houston's father Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him . Last Tuesday, AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s. AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, the alleged victim told the commission. 'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' AHA said. He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression. Mr Houston told the hearing that if AHA was under 18 - he was in his mid-30s at the time of the complaint - then he was 'absolutely certain' they would have gone to the police. 'Rightly or wrongly, I thought I would be preempting the victim if I were to have called the police at that point,' Mr Houston said. Controversy: Brian Houston's Hillsong church is immensely popular . Mr Houston is the senior pastor at the Hillsong Church, located in Sydney's north-western suburbs . Rules were set aside by the executive of the Pentecostal movement when it came to dealing with allegations against Frank Houston the national inquiry was told last week. Keith Ainge, former national secretary of the Assemblies of God, an umbrella body for the Pentecostal churches, said that Brian Houston was the only conduit for information to the executive about allegations against his father. The church elder told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that the first the national executive heard of allegations against Frank Houston was when his son Brian Houston called a special meeting of the executive on December 22, 1999. Brian Houston was national president of the AoG. He had already suspended his father when he called the meeting. Pastor Ainge on Thursday said that under AoG rules Frank Houston should have had his credentials withdrawn for abusing a child. Brian Houston, pictured leaving the Royal Commission last week. The hearing continues . Instead the meeting on December 22 suspended them for two years and recommended that Frank Houston enter a restorative program. In reply to questions from counsel assisting the commission Simeon Beckett, Pastor Ainge said he truthfully could not answer why the policy was not followed 'except to say that it was a new policy and not fully understood and the fact there was no formal complaint and the complainant did not give his name'. Mr Beckett: 'according to Brian Houston?' When asked about Brian Houston's conflict of interest and the executive's dependence on him to investigate his father and take action Pastor Ainge: 'Yes, we agree it was a difficult situation from that perspective ...' Mr Beckett: You were relying on what Brian Houston said about the complainant not wanting it to go to the police; is that correct? Pastor Ainge: 'Correct'. Mr Beckett: And you had not had an independent person deal with the complainant? Pastor Ainge: That's correct. The hearing continues.

"A six-day-old boy who was wounded by a hunter's stray bullet is expected to survive but will be blind. Mother Stefanie Iverson said that her son Shayne's life was spared when the bullet exited through the orbital area - or eye socket - of his skull rather than hitting his brain during the tragic accident in Pennsylvania. The boy's father, Jeremie, was holding the baby on September 25 when the bullet came through a window of the family's home near Saltsburg, about 35 miles east of Pittsburgh, and struck the baby's skull. Shayne Iverson was hit by a hunter's stray bullet when he was just six days old and in his father's arms at his home in Pennsylvania. He survived but has been left blind . The Iverson family have set up a GoFundMe page where they released a picture of baby Shayne with his big brother Caden, nine, and two-year-old sister Gabi when he was a day old . Indiana County District Attorney Pat Dougherty said the hunter had an agricultural deer control permit when he fired the shot that wounded the boy about 7pm that day. The shooting was likely accidental, but questions remain about whether the hunter followed state regulations. The Iversons have two older children, nine-year-old son Caden and Gabi, aged two. On a GoFundMe page set up by his aunt Kayln Ivey, she wrote: 'He's been such a strong little fighter, fighting for his new life he had just begun, in the ICU sedated. 'This fundraiser is to help with all the medical expenses as the family fight through this tragedy.' Almost $6,000 dollars has already been donated by well-wishers towards the baby's medical costs. The family are consulting with multiple surgeons while they wait for Shayne's brain swelling to go down. Mother Stefanie Iverson (pictured with her newborn son) said that her son Shayne's life was spared when the bullet exited through his eye socket . The boy's father met with the state police and game commissioner on Tuesday, he wrote on Facebook, adding that his wife refused to leave Shayne's side in the ICU. According to TribLive, it won't be decided if the hunter will face any charges until forensics are completed in several weeks. The hunter was 300 yards from the home and using a .308 hunting rifle on private farm opposite the Iversons' home, the news site reported.

"Former Tory minister Lord Tebbit has said he can never forgive the IRA bomber who planted the Brighton bomb which left his wife paralysed. Today marks 30 years since five people were killed and 34 seriously injured at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in an intended terrorist attack on Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet. The then trade and industry secretary, Lord Tebbit was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care. Scroll down for video . Lord Tebbit and his wife Margaret who was left paralysed after the Brighton bomb attack in October 1986 . Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis narrowly escaped injury in the attack during the Conservative Party Conference on October 12, 1984. Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb, was handed eight life sentences in 1986 but was released 13 years later under the Good Friday Agreement. Lord Tebbit, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, said: ‘I am often asked if I can find it in my heart to forgive the creature, Patrick Magee. That is not possible, for Magee has never repented.’ Speaking to BBC News today he added: 'One can hope that there’s a particularly hot corner of Hell reserved for him and they can repent in his own time there.' Lord Tebbit being carried on a stretcher from the wreckage of the Grand hotel by members of the fire brigade . The couple, whose lives changed 'abruptly' that night, pictured left after the attack in 1995 and right in 2004 . He continued: ‘Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it. ‘He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.’ But for the 83-year-old former RAF pilot, the anniversary is ‘just another day’ as he and his wife live with the injuries they sustained in the attack. Lord Tebbit has said he will never be able to forgive the 'creature' Patrick Magee for the bombing . ‘I think about it every day in the sense that I look at my wife who was sentenced to life imprisonment in a wheelchair,’ he said. ‘There is nothing really to celebrate, or mark, it just goes on.’ He adds that age has brought its own problems exacerbating the injuries he and his wife suffered. He said: ‘There are only two alternatives. You either live with it or you die with it, and that's the way it is.’ Recalling the moment the bomb went off at 2.53am, he writes about the ‘indescribable pain’ and being buried in the rubble, reaching out for each other’s hand. ‘The chandelier swung wildly, the floor collapsed, and we were tipped out of bed into a pitchblack void. ‘I was able to call out for Margaret. We talked about our family as we drifted in and out of consciousness.’ He said that the attempted murder brought an ‘abrupt change’ in the couple’s lives after his wife’s spine was crushed and she was left paralysed. The following day, the IRA claimed responsibility for the attack and released a statement, which said: 'Mrs. Thatcher will now realise that Britain cannot occupy our country and torture our prisoners and shoot our people in their own streets and get away with it. 'Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no more war.' Then and now: Patrick Magee, pictured left in the 1980s and right, in 2001, was given eight life sentences in 1986 but was released just 13 years later . Margaret Thatcher and Lord Tebbit speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton before bombing . In a statement, David Cameron said the anniversary was a timely reminder of Mrs Thatcher’s words at the time that ‘Britain will never be cowed by terrorists’. Patrick Magee stayed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the weekend of September 14 to 17, 1984 under the pseudonym Roy Walsh. He planted the bath in his room - number 629. The device had been fitted with a long-delay timer made from components and a safety device. It detonated at 2.54am on October 12 when the midsection of the hotel collapsed into the basement. Margaret Thatcher was still awake at the time working on her conference speech for the next day. Her bedroom and sitting room were not damaged and the Prime Minister and her husband escaped without injury. They were driven to Brighton police station and she gave an impromptu interview to the BBC where she said the conference would still go ahead. Five were killed including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry, North-West area chairman Eric Taylor, Lady Shattock (wife of the western area chairman), Lady Maclean (wife of Sir Donald Maclean) and Roberta Wakeham (wife of the Parliamentary Treasury Secretary). The IRA claimed responsibility the next day and said it would try again. On 24 June 1985 following investigations into who had stayed in the room, Patrick Magee was arrested in Glasgow. Four members of an IRA unit were also imprisoned for involvement in the plot. He said: ‘It is a message we repeat today as we face down the threat from violent extremism, whether in the skies over Iraq or on the streets of our towns and cities. ‘As we remember today those killed and injured in Brighton, we must renew our vow that terrorism must never win.’ Bomber, Patrick Magee, will be in Brighton and Hove tonight to take part in a panel discussion following a screening of documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market. The programme follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee. The Conservative politician’s daughter has admitted she is friends with her father’s killer and now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Magee. 'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.' Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago. A solemn minute’s silence was held in Brighton today to mark the anniversary. The flag flew at half mast over the hotel as staff and members of the public gathered in the lobby for a minute’s silence to remember the injured and the dead. The brief ceremony took place in front of a plaque marking the bomb’s 25th anniversary, which was unveiled by former Tory minister Lord Tebbit. The Grand’s general manager, Andrew Mosely, said: 'The 60 staff who are on duty today gathered around the plaque that was unveiled by Lord Tebbit.

'Then we stood for the minute’s silence, which was conducted solemnly and correctly. Hotel guests joined us as well as members of the public, one of whom had bought a bunch of flowers to lay at the base of the plaque. 'It was the right thing to do, the bomb blast happened here and we should remember it and the reasons why it happened. 'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.'

The daughter of a Conservative politician who was murdered in the Brighton bombing 30 years ago has said she is friends with her father's killer. Sir Anthony Berry MP was one of five people who died when the IRA explosion ripped through the Grand Hotel on October 12, 1984. His daughter Jo now travels the world promoting peace and reconciliation with Patrick Magee - the republican bomber who planted the deadly device. 'I would say he is a friend,' she said. 'It is an unusual friendship but I care about him.' Although reluctant to say she has forgiven Magee for causing her father's death, Ms Berry claimed she understood why he turned to violence three decades ago. She added: 'I don't like to use the word (forgiveness). For me it is more about empathy and understanding. And the empathy is about understanding from his perspective why he did it. 'I am always going to be against any violence but if I understand why he, and others, chose to use violence then that can help me to look at how we can make the world a place where people are less likely to use violence. 'Forgiveness is such a difficult word. But he is my friend now. We spend a lot of time together.'","Today marks 30 years since Brighton bombing which killed five people .

"Police are hunting for a suspect who senselessly punched a deaf man and an autistic teenager in a horrific bus attack while travelling through Melbourne's south-east. The alleged male offender got on a bus at Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre in the suburb of Mulgrave on September 7 along with the two victims. They were travelling in a 813 bus heading to Keysborough which was run by Ventura Bus Lines. Later during the bus trip about 3pm, the offender moved towards a deaf man, 32, and quizzed him on where he was directing his gaze. Police are looking for this man who alleged punched a 32-year-old deaf man and a 14-year-old boy in the face on a bus in Melbourne's south-east . When the 32-year-old did not answer him, the attacker proceeded to punch the man in the face before returning to his seat, the Dandenong Leader reported. But the attacks continued, with the suspect targeting a second victim on the bus - a 14-year-old boy with autism - who had been so alarmed by the first incident that he had removed himself to be closer to the driver of the bus. The offender - described to be between the ages of 15 and 25 - was not deterred and followed the teenager before punching him in the face a number of times. Dandenong Sergeant Cassandra Stone said the 14-year-old suffered a bloody nose and cuts to the inside and outside of his mouth. The incident took place on September 7 and happened about 3pm on a bus going to Keysborough . A Victoria Ambulance spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the paramedics were called to the corner of Kingsclere Avenue and Turramurra Drive in Keysborough on September 7 at 3.15pm. She said they treated a 'high school-aged' boy with facial injuries before transporting him to Dandenong Hospital in a stable condition. The spokeswoman also confirmed nobody else was treated at the scene. Sgt Stone said  nobody on the bus - not even the driver who saw both incidents unfold - intervened during the 'unprovoked' attacks. The man and the victims were travelling on a 813 bus  run by Ventura Bus Lines . She told the Dandenong Leader the attacks were 'frightening' and the witnesses were 'just dumbstruck at someone being so blatantly aggressive for no reason'. 'It's pretty appalling, considering he's picked on vulnerable, disabled people... it was definitely unprovoked,' Sgt Stone said. 'The 14-year-old kid said he was shocked, scared and it caused him to fall off his seat to the ground and cry.' Police said the attacker was described as being about 175cm tall, having short black hair with an olive complexion, and had a grey T-shirt and dark-coloured shorts on. He disembarked the bus around the Kingsclere Avenue area in Keysborough. Anyone who has information in relation to these incidents are urged to call the Dandenong Police Station on 9767 7444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","Two attacks happened on a bus travelling through Melbourne's south-east .

"Championship and Premier League clubs are talking to Brazilian striker Tulio after he rejected the chance to join Charlton Athletic. The 29-year-old free agent had a successful trial at Charlton but opted against the move after they changed the terms of their initial offer. Charlton are understood to have originally discussed a two-year deal but instead made Tulio a six-month offer with an option of another year on £11,000 a week.

"A Seattle high school teacher who admitted to having sex with a 17-year-old student was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Tuesday. 'I was selfish,' the 33-year-old told the judge. Allen pleaded guilty in August to charges of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor and violation of a no-contact order, reports Komo. Guilty: Former high school biology teacher Michael Allen, 33, was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Tuesday . Court documents reveal that Allen had sex numerous times with a 17-year-old student and despite being arrested and charged he continued to contact the victim. 'What I did was inappropriate and wrong,' he added. The News Tribune reports that Allen got no argument from Judge Frank Cuthbertson. 'You hurt a lot of people,' said Judge Cuthbertson. Allen is married and has two young children, both of whom are utterly confused about the situation. 'You hurt your children. You obviously hurt your wife and her family, and you did great harm to the victim in this case. Her life was completely disrupted. Her family was completely disrupted,' said the judge. The initial contact with the victim began in January 2014. The two exchanged text messages and formed a relationship that escalated sexual intercourse. School administrators learned of the inappropriate contact on January 17 and they placed Allen on administrative leave and he was ordered not to contact the victim. Father and husband: Michael Allen didn't only damage the victim, he hurt his wife and children by chasing a 17-year-old student in an inappropriate relationship . Administrators launched an internal investigation and found thousands of messages between Allen and the victim even after he was told not to reach her. The school reported the incident to the police on February 11 and the victim told detectives she had sex with Allen three times after he was placed on leave. Allen was given a court order not to contact the victim and was placed on $25,000 bail. On February 24 the victim confessed that Allen contacted her via Twitter through a friend and that he gave her a pre-paid cell phone so that they could continue to talk. Allen was then charged with violating a court order and a new bail was set at $125,000. After Allen finishes his prison sentence he will have to undergo a psychosexual evaluation, treatment, and register as a sex offender. Perhaps even more challenging, he will need to suffer the consequences of hurting his wife and children. His wife wrote a letter to the judge detailing how Allen’s actions tore their family apart. Deputy prosecutor Sabrina Ahrens read the letter that brought Allen to tears. 'We used to be a happy family,' the letter stated. It also spoke of Allen's children's confusion about their father's absence. Allen's wife is filing for divorce and Allen has become an outcast among his loved ones. 'I’ve made some horrible decisions, your honor, and I’m ashamed of them,' Allen said. ‘There are no excuses for my actions. That time period, I don’t know who I was.' 'You’re right about one thing,' the judge told Allen. 'It was selfish.' Outraged: Michael Allen is no longer a teacher at Curtis High School where he met his 17-year-old victim .","'I was selfish,' the 33-year-old former Curtis High School teacher Michael Allen told the judge after his sentencing on Tuesday .

"Leeds United are one of nine clubs expected to be sanctioned in the next few weeks with transfer bans or fines for over-spending in the Championship - with Leeds having posted losses of £22.9m last season. Queens Park Rangers and Leicester are expected to be hit with massive fines, of around £30m and up to £20m respectively, under Football League financial fair play (FFP) rules, for racking up huge losses in the 2013-14 campaign as they won promotion. Blackburn, Nottingham Forest, Bolton, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Middlesborough as well as Leeds can expect bans of transfer activity in the January window and in some cases beyond if they do not address their financial issues. Massimo Cellino has been deemed unfit to stay in charge of Leeds by the Football League . Under the League’s FFP rules, clubs who overspend and succeed by doing so by reaching the lucrative Premier League are hit with fines - hence QPR and Leicester being hit in the pocket. Leeds’ punishment could be the last of their worries because their 2013-14 accounts, which have not yet been made public, paint an alarming picture of fiscal chaos and uncertainty. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Leeds’s income fell to £25.3m from £28.6m the previous season as gate money, TV money, commercial income and merchandise sales all fell. They made a loss of £20.4m, and a post-tax loss of £22.9m. The accounts contain some alarming numbers, notably that minority shareholders Gulf Finance House, who have a 25 per cent stake, are owed £20.9m by Leeds, and that majority owner Massimo Cellino - currently challenging a League ruling he is unfit to run the club - is owed £12.2m he has injected in 2014 either personally or via companies in London and Italy. Leeds United recorded losses of 22.9m last season and are facing a transfer ban . Cellino, a convicted fraudster, announced last week that he is about to provide £15m in extra funding and that GFH is to put in £5m. But it is understood that GFH won’t actually pay any more money but instead write off a £5m payment Cellino himself is due to make to them on 14 December relating to his buyout. When asked how GFH could be owed more than £20m by Leeds, a GFH spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: ‘As a result of the poor financial situation which they inherited at the club, GFH extended funding of around £20m of cash between July 2012 to November 2013 to keep the club solvent, acquire new players, give new contracts to existing players, pay down existing debt and meet other day to day liabilities as they fell due when the club's revenues were insufficient to do this.’ It is not clear how and when this money was put into the club because the accounts don’t show such an injection. Cellino announced last week that he is going to provide £15m in extra funding to Leeds . One source has suggested if Cellino is forced to relinquish control of Leeds until a tax evasion conviction is spent in March, GFH may temporarily take charge and then hand back the reins. Another source says casino firm Gentings are considering an offer for the club. Both scenarios are ‘speculative, so far’ say club insiders. Another puzzling detail in the accounts is Leeds’s wage bill rising to £22.4m from £20m despite total staff numbers falling from 206 employees to 182, and a decreased playing staff. GFH and related parties also took money from the club in 2013-14 in the form of £2m in interest on loans. They also billed Leeds for £3.4m for unspecified services in the year, although the accounts note those invoices are in dispute. Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September . A rise in Leeds’s ‘cost of sales’ (expenses) at a time of falling revenue, as well as almost £2m spent on ‘legal and professional fees’ and ‘management charges’ also show extraordinarily high levels of undetailed spending for what is, in business terms, such a small company. Leeds are unlikely to contest their transfer ban but QPR will almost certainly launch a legal challenge to their fine, expected to be around £30m, calculated via a complex tariff based on losses expected to be around £40m. Monies accrued from the ‘Fair Play Tax’ will go to charity. If QPR refuse to pay and are then relegated, the Football League have already said they will not be re-admitted to their three divisions and would face having to pay up or banishment to the non-league.","Several clubs are facing sanctions for breaking Football League FFP rules .

"Manchester City would be boasting Gary Cahill in their ranks for Tuesday's last chance saloon against Bayern Munich had the club not pulled the plug on a deal three years ago. Cahill, then at Bolton, was subject of a £17.5million offer from the Premier League champions, with Dedryck Boyata going in the opposite direction. But according to his former boss Owen Coyle, City opted against spending that much on the central defender, who Chelsea then went on to sign for half the price. Gary Cahill was very close to signing for Manchester City for around £17.5million three years ago . Former Bolton manager Owen Coyle asserts that City pulled the plug on any deal for the defender . It now appears a galling oversight given the defensive problems taking hold at the Etihad Stadium and Cahill's rise to prominence. Neither Martin Demichelis or Eliaquim Mangala look to be capable of performing dependably at the very top, while captain Vincent Kompany hasn't been exempt from criticism this season. Cahill, Coyle asserts, would have been a perfect fit in Manchester. 'He has everything,' he told Sky Sports News. 'In terms of skills as a footballer, he has pace, power, he has two great feet. And with being a top class defender, he weighs in goals as well.' Cahill has become a mainstay alongside John Terry for the Blues and is England's most consistent centre-half under Roy Hodgson. The 28-year-old, however, was ready to seal a move to Roberto Mancini's side until the late change of heart. England international Cahill is now a rock alongside John Terry in Chelsea's settled back four . It isn't the first time Coyle has decided to pinpoint City's missed opportunity. 'The summer before he moved to Chelsea, Manchester City came in and offered £17 million and a player. That was going to be a huge deal. Obviously, something happened, so he stayed on at Bolton and it never materialised,' he said in March. 'Come the following January in 2012, when it was Chelsea who came in, it was the right thing for him, no doubt. 'They got absolutely got a bargain at £7million. We were at the wrong end of the table and caught up in a battle but I'd always said we would do right by him and give him his chance.'","Manchester City could have signed Gary Cahill for £17.5million .

"Risk: Colorado governor John Hickenlooper said voters were 'reckless' to legalize marijuana in 2012 . Colorado governor John Hickenlooper had admitted state voters were 'reckless' when they legalized recreational marijuana two years ago. The democrat, who is seeking re-election for a second term, was asked what his advise to other states about the issue would be during a debate yesterday against  Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez. Mr Hickenlooper recommended that states should think long and hard before legalizing pot because it can increase youth access to the drug. He said Colorado's vote was reckless - but added that the state's job now was to properly regulate marijuana. He said: 'I would view it as reckless before we see what the consequences are. 'I think for us to do that without having all the data, there is not enough data, and to a certain extent you could say it was reckless. 'I'm not saying it was reckless because I'll get quoted everywhere, but if it was up to me I wouldn't have done it right? I opposed it from the very beginning. 'In matter of fact, all right what the hell, I'll say it was reckless.' Mr Hickenlooper, who once ran a successful brewpub, had opposed the decision to legalize the drug at the time of the November 2012 ballot. His opponent Mr Beauprez said he agrees with Hickenlooper about marijuana. The debate in Denver was hosted by business groups and mostly concerned the economy. Marijuana has been legalized in two states - Washington and Colorado both passed the laws in 2012 - while a further 21 states have regulated so it can be used medicinally. Since January 1, 2014, more than 200 licensed marijuana ‘dispensaries’ in Denver, Colorado’s biggest city — along with 100 more in other parts of the state — have been allowed to sell the drug to anyone aged 21 and over for purely ‘recreational’ rather than medicinal use. A number of other states, including Oregon and Alaska, will vote this year on whether to take the same step, and polls from the Pew Research Center and Gallup have shown a majority of Americans support legalizing the drug. Scroll down for video . Freely available: A marijuana dispensary in Denver. Around 300 such establishments have sprung up across Colorado since January this year . Use in the U.S. has been on the rise since 2007, possibly due in part to a perception of diminishing risks. In 2008, research found that 42 per cent of people surveyed in the U.S. had tried marijuana at least once. Hickenlooper is currently facing the toughest re-election fight of a charmed political career. The two-time Denver mayor, former geologist and successful brewpub owner sailed into the governor's office four years ago over a divided Republican party that had nominated an unknown tea party favorite. With a self-deprecating sense of humor and an emphasis on bipartisanship, Hickenlooper got begrudging praise from some Republican state lawmakers for his first two years in office. But a controversial death-penalty decision, a package of gun-control bills, and mishaps explaining his choices have put a dent in Hickenlooper's aura of invincibility. Cheers: Governor John Hickenlooper, who once ran a successful brew pub, enjoys a pint of beer with Barack Obama . Now, several polls suggest he's in a close race against Republican Bob Beauprez, a former member of the U.S. House. 'I'm going to win. I'm going to work hard enough,' Hickenlooper said. 'I mean, I spent 16 years in the restaurant business ... he's not going to outwork me. So, I am going to win, and this campaign is going to allow us to talk about the economy, and how are we going to create more jobs.' Much of the firepower for Republicans has come from Hickenlooper's decision to grant an indefinite stay of execution last year to Nathan Dunlap, who was convicted for the 1993 slayings of four people at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Aurora, a suburb just east of Denver. Hickenlooper's opponent Bob Beauprez said he agreed with his rival about marijuana . Hickenlooper's reprieve was not clemency, so he left the door open for a subsequent governor to execute Dunlap, leaving his fate unresolved. 'Since that moment ... he has to some extent been trying to play defense and recover,' said Floyd Ciruli, an independent Colorado pollster. Despite the criticism, Hickenlooper said he believes his decision was correct. 'I don't think government should be taking people's lives. I just don't,' he said. While Hickenlooper's popularity has waned, his Republican challenger has experienced a resurgence. Once seen as a political laughingstock for losing the governor's race by 17 points in 2006, Beauprez has emerged as a solid contender for a Republican to win the state's top office for the first time since 2002. 'I don't want to sound overly casual about it, but the kind of geeky, aw shucks, nice guy veneer that the governor had, transitioned to (voters saying), 'What the heck is up with that?'' Beauprez said. The buffalo rancher and former banker mostly disappeared from politics after his 2006 defeat. But he stayed on the radar enough through radio programs, a book he published and other writings. The work has provided ammunition for Democrats seeking to describe him as an ultra-conservative candidate who opposes abortion even in cases of rape, and who would threaten immigrant rights. so close, that in the next two months, I think there's great potential for one of them, in my opinion, to shoot themselves in the foot,' Hill said. 'And then I will know, 'Yep, I'm going with this one, or I'm going with that one.'","John Hickenlooper said states should 'think long and hard' before legalizing .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez is seeking a January reunion with Scotland's Euro 2016 hero Shaun Maloney. Martinez travelled to Glasgow to see Maloney score an outstanding winning goal against the Republic of Ireland during the international break and is keen to bring the 31-year-old midfielder to Goodison before his contract runs out in the summer. Maloney was signed by Martinez at Wigan in 2011 from Celtic and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. Shaun Maloney (pictured celebrating scoring for Wigan on Saturday) is the subject of interest from Everton . Roberto Martinez was Maloney's manager while the pair were at Wigan Athletic in the Premier League . Martinez travelled to Glasgow to see Maloney score an outstanding winning goal against the Republic of Ireland . With Wigan aware that Maloney is unlikely to sell a new deal, they will have to sell him in January or face losing him for nothing at the end of the season. He would be expected to fetch around £500,000. Although Martinez's relationship Maloney would make Everton firm favourites to seal a deal, the player would be likely to attract several offers from home and abroad if Wigan agreed to let him go in January. MLS Club Chicago Fire have reportedly shown an interest while other Premier League clubs are monitoring the situation.

United chief executive Ed Woodward was very clear in his message this week that United are not hunting short term fixes in the January window. That may yet change if injuries fail to subside but the intention is to make a play for 25-year-old Hummels in the summer. Should Dortmund show any willingness to deal, even then United will face competition from Europe's elite clubs particularly as quality centre-backs are in such short supply. United have been scouting defenders recently to keep on top of the market. They have watched Aleksandar Dragovic of Dynamo Kiev, Fabian Schar of Basle and Ezequiel Garay of Zenit while Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar remains a possibility as his contract runs out in the summer. United may be forced to try and sign a player from that group should their injury crisis fail to subside.

"Lionel Messi has opened the door to a dramatic departure from Barcelona one day by telling Argentine newspaper Ole that he wants to stay at the Nou Camp but that players don’t always get what they want. 'I live for the here and now and all I’m thinking about is having a good season and winning the trophies that we want to win at Barcelona,' he said. 'After that we will see. Things change very quickly in football. 'I have said many times that if it was up to me I would stay here [at Barcelona] forever. But you don’t always get everything you want, and even more so in football, where so many different things happen and so much can change. It is complicated and even more so with all that things that are happening at Barcelona.' Lionel Messi, who has been at Barcelona his entire career has hinted he may not end his career there . Messi has a contract at the Nou Camp until 2018 and a buy-out clause of £200million but there is instability at the club with many supporters wanting elections, due in 2016, to be brought forward to next summer. The club has been banned from making signings after breaking rules over the signing of underage players, and Messi and his father Jorge are being taken to court by the Spanish Inland Revenue for unpaid taxes. His imminent departure remains out of the question but his latest comments reaffirm the idea that a move to another European club before he returns to Argentina to play out the last days of his career at his first club Newell’s Old Boys is no longer out of the question. Both Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain would want the 27-year-old, though meeting his clause without destroying their financial fair play credentials would remain an obstacle. Argentina captain Lionel Messi will hope to show on Tuesday that he is still on a level with Cristiano Ronaldo . Their remain two schools of thought among the power-breakers at the Nou Camp. One group see Messi as a sacred institution at the club who should never be sold. Another more pragmatic group believe Neymar is the club’s commercial cash cow going forward, and that if a buyer can be found for Messi any offer over £120m should be seriously considered. Messi was also asked about his World Cup in the interview. He said: 'I would like to have played better in the semi-final and final but that is the way tournaments go sometimes. 'If I had scored that goal in the final everyone would have said what a great tournament I had and how I had played well in every game. 'I didn’t score it so I get criticised.

West Ham scouts were among the crowd that watched Dragovic play for Austria in their 1-0 win over Russia on Saturday. They were joined by representatives from Manchester United who are weighing up various potential centre-back signings and the 23-year-old turned in a steady performance. Austria international Aleksandar Dragovic is the subject of a £12milllion bid from Spartak Moscow . Dragovic is keen to leave Ukraine and has his mind set on a move to the Premier League but Spartak's bold move will make it difficult as English clubs value him closer to £8million. Spartak are also prepared to offer a lucrative wage package of around £90,000 a week to attract the former Basle defender although he would be prepared to take less to come to England. West Ham are looking at defenders in case they are forced to cash in on Winston Reid in January.

"Southampton will ask Tottenham Hotspur to include Andros Townsend or Harry Kane in any deal for Jay Rodriguez. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign Rodriguez in January as he looks to bolster his misfiring strike force. The Saints want to keep hold of the England international - who hasn’t played since April due to a serious knee injury - and have offered the former Burnley forward an improved five-year deal to stay. Southampton want either Andros Townsend (left) or Harry Kane if Tottenham Hotspur sign Jay Rodriguez . Rodriguez could move to White Hart Lane in January but Southampton do not want to sell him . But Rodriguez is yet to put pen to paper, casting doubt on his future at St Mary’s . He has just 18 months left on his deal and, despite wanting to keep the 25-year-old, the Saints are aware of the fact that he could agree a free transfer away from the club in a little more than 12 months time. Spurs will test Southampton’s resolve to keep Rodriguez when the transfer window re-opens in January. But manager Ronald Koeman wants the White Hart Lane club to include Townsend or Kane in any deal which would see Rodriguez move to London. Mauricio Pochettino is reluctant to let Kane (centre) go but could allow Townsend (right) to leave the club . Kane scored twice for the England Under 21 side during their 3-2 defeat against France on Monday . Rodriguez is currently out with an injury but Pochettino is keen to be reunited with his former striker . Koeman was interested in Townsend in the summer, and has been impressed by Kane’s performances so far this season. Townsend is among the players Pochettino is willing to part with in January, but the Argentine is unlikely to listen to offers for Kane given his lack of options in attack. Kane is the club’s top scorer in all competitions this season with nine goals, though his lack of game time in the Premier League has raised question marks over his role in Pochettino’s plans. Southampton will take a similar approach should Spurs revive their interest in midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin; insisting on Townsend or Kane be part of any deal.

"A scathing letter directed at 7th Heaven's Stephen Collins and his attorney charges that the shamed actor's estranged wife is being taunted with baseless accusations 'to create a smokescreen to shift focus away from the actor's despicable behavior.' In the letter obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant's attorney  Martin Singer, dubbed 'the guard dog to the stars,' by The New York Times, lashes out at Collins and  Mark Vincent Kaplan, for 'false and fabricated statements about Faye Grant to try to justify Collins' conduct.' Last week Kaplan pointed the finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, claiming that she had been threatening to leak the taped confession for years. Martin Singer, the lawyer for Faye Grant has lashed out at 'pedophile' Stephen Collins and his attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan, for 'false and fabricated statements about Faye Grant to try to justify Collins' conduct' Accusations: Faye Grant has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million . 'Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,' he told TMZ. Singer's letter, sent Friday, tells Kaplan that 'it is outrageous that you would stoop so low as to communicate false and fabricated statements about my client to justify your client Stephen Collins' conduct. 'It is malicious and outrageous,' the letter continues, 'that you would choose to spread defamatory lies accusing my client of supposedly engaging in extortion. 'My client is not seeking a dime from your client beyond that to which she is entitled pursuant to California Law, and you very well know it.' Grant has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million, including more than $5 million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex. Continues Singer, 'You are well aware of the fact that my client never used the tape at all in the dissolution proceedings.To the contrary, after your client refused to obtain treatment within a few months of the taping, my client gave the tapes to the NYPD and the LAPD. 'It is offensive that you are disseminating false and misleading statements defaming a victim like my client.' Singer ends the letter asking for an immediate retraction from Kaplan and warning that Grant will 'exercise all her remedies against you, by which you will be exposed to significant liability for defamation and false light invasion of privacy.' Fallen angel: Collins starred as a minister and Jessica Biel as his daughter in the long-running TV hit Seventh Heaven . You're no Jack Kennedy: But Collins played the president along with Roma Downey in 'A Woman Named Jackie' Too young:  In The Babysitter's seduction, Collins played a widower obsessed with his teenage babysitter, played by Keri Russell . Grant's divorce attorney, Larry Ginsberg, had also railed against Kaplan's accusations against Grant in a TMZ report last week. The legal letter comes on the heels of new revelations that Collins could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007,  according to the latest allegations made by Grant.. Collins famously starred as the Reverend Eric Camden in the TV series 7th Heaven and according to Grant, her husband used the celebrity that came with that role to gain the trust of two parents so he could sexually abuse their child. The hit show ran from 1996 until 2007, which means that Collins may have molested children well after the crimes he has allegedly confessed to. An audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls emerged last week. According to Collins, none of those incidents had occurred after 1984. The latest allegations are included in an email that Grant sent her husband last year which has been obtained by TMZ. New York City police announced last week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s. The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972. An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed. Legal eagle: Martin Singer (right) charges Mark Vincent Kaplan with spreading lies about his client Faye Grant . Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative. She reported the abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations . 'Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,' Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November. The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed for divorce. Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in a therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation. Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old. She has also claimed that he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant. She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused. 'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because 'you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth' was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ. 'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.'","Faye Grant's attorney has accused Stephen Collins' lawyer of making 'false and fabricated statements' about his client .

Hoqwever, they don't work for mobile devices - a growing source of Internet traffic. Atlas solves that problem by tracking people based on their Facebook log-in information. Advertisers using the platform can then request that their ads be targeted to a specific subset of users - for example, young people in the suburbs using mobile devices. 'We are bringing all of the people-based marketing functions that marketers are used to doing on Facebook and allowing them to do that across the web,' David Jakubowski, Facebook's head of advertising technology, said in an interview with the New York Times. For instance, Atlas advertiser Pepsi could use Atlas to advertise one of its products on a sports site or a game app that is not affiliated with Facebook. Atlas head Erik Johnson said the platform offers an advantage for marketers over most current ad-serving systems, which rely on cookies. Cookies are used to track browsing on desktop computers, but they don't work for mobile devices - a growing source of Internet traffic. 'Cookies don't work on mobile, are becoming less accurate in demographic targeting and can't easily or accurately measure the customer purchase funnel across browsers and devices or into the offline world,' he wrote. Atlas solves that problem by tracking people based on their Facebook log-in information. Advertisers using the platform can then request that their ads be targeted to a specific subset of users - for example, young people in the suburbs using mobile devices. The firm has already signed up its first customers. 'We're excited to announce that Omnicom is the first holding company to sign an agency-wide ad serving and measurement partnership with Atlas,' it announced today. 'Together, Omnicom – powered by Neustar technology– and Atlas will jointly develop integrations to enable more automated capabilities for Omnicom's clients, including Pepsi and Intel – who are among the first testing the new platform.'

Atlas is a former Microsoft property that Facebook bought last year for around $100 million that Facebook says it has now rebuilt from the ground up. It is distinct from Audience Network, a mobile ad network Facebook introduced in April that was aimed at app developers. In contrast, Atlas is an alternative to Google's AdWords, which will let advertisers follow users across the web and mobile devices. The blog presents Atlas as the solution since it uses 'people-based marketing.' While the move might discomfit some users who are suspicious about how Facebook employs their personal data, it presents a new option for advertisers and an alternative to Google.","System designed to take on Google's AdWords .

Since Seattle, Washington, is the birthplace of Starbucks and known for its coffee culture, one would assume that it would score high on the list.

The top three spots are in fact all located in the Northeast: Portland, Maine; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Burlington, Vermont, respectively. In order to reach these findings, the study considered the percentage of households that own coffeemakers and buy coffee, the average amount of money spent on coffee per household, the number of cafes per capita and the percentage of residents who drink five-plus cups a day. No thanks: Judging by the maps, none of the Southern states have taken a liking to coffee - in fact, a number of cities in the South are on the list of places that are least obsessed with the drink .

'They'd ripped the boiler which was on top of the safe off the wall which flooded the place - it was a total mess. 'They must have used some of our lifting equipment to shift the safe because that was missing too - they took everything they possible could. 'Then they had the cheek to leave that note behind after all of the damage they caused.' The men also got away with a Theoben Evolution.177 calibre air rifle which had a walnut stock and a Simmons Whitetail telescopic sight. Mr Moran said: 'I only live around the corner and to come to the pub in the morning and see this sort of damage is horrific. Captured: Two of the thieves, dressed in boiler suits with material concealing their face, are seen on CCTV . Brazen: The men stole the safe, bottles of spirits, packets of cigars and gadgets that were scattered around the pub . 'It makes you wonder what the burglars were thinking. They clearly targeted us because they got away with so much stuff. 'It's just a real shame because this pub is right at the heart of the local community - it's a very popular place. 'I just hope these people are caught and brought to justice.' Officers have launched an appeal for anyone with information on the burglary, on October 24, to contact police. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: 'We can confirm an investigation is underway following a burglary at the Scotch Piper Inn in Lydiate in the early hours of Friday, October 24. 'Officers were called to the pub on Southport Road at about 9.20am following a report a number of people had forced entry to the property between midnight and 9am that morning and attempted to take the safe. Historic: It is one of the oldest pubs in the UK dating back to 1320 . 'It is believed during the incident that damage was caused to the boiler causing water damage to the property. 'The offenders made off with a quantity of money and stock from the property. An investigation into the full circumstances of the incident is underway. 'Officers are checking CCTV from the property and surrounding areas in a bid to identify the people responsible.' The pair took over the pub, which is a well-known meeting point for bikers, on March 31 this year. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair sampled a pint of Burtonwood Bitter at the pub in 1999.","Three crooks ripped boiler off the wall to get to the safe - flooding the pub .

"She's famous for her colourful love life and penchant for plastic surgery but according to Jodie Marsh, 35, those days are long gone. Instead, the bodybuilder turned investigative journalist says that she's single, happy and putting her career first - even if that does mean putting her love life on hold. 'It's not that I don't want to meet someone,' she admits. 'But for now, career comes first. If I don't meet someone, I need to know that my mortgage will be paid and my future is secure. No one else is going to do that for me.' Scroll down for video . New series: Jodie Marsh returns to TV screens tonight with a documentary that takes a look at plastic surgery . Right now, getting her mortgage paid means focusing on her fledgling career as a documentary maker, which has so far included films on steroids, prostitution, bullying and plastic surgery shockers. The latter is something she returns to on her latest TLC series, Jodie Marsh On... which along with plastic surgery, sees her take on mail order brides, 'lying, cheating men' and virgins. 'Whenever we decide to do a new show, it's either something I can relate to or that I find fascinating,' she explains. 'I've always been fascinated by the idea of mail order brides for instance. Do people really just order them? 'With the surgery one, I've had surgery and it went wrong. I'm very open about it. I was very willing and open to show that because people should know the dangers of surgery.' This is at the heart of Marsh's new drive for TV ratings. Chatting at nineteen to the dozen down the phone from her home in Essex, she's clearly passionate about supplanting Kemp and co and bringing issues that she sees as deeply important to a wider audience. Investigative: The last series of Jodie Marsh On... saw her meet bodybuilder and steroid abuser Candace . New career: Jodie's current work is a world away from the glamour modelling and reality TV of a decade ago . Ask her about surgery and she's refreshingly frank, telling you how a botched boob job left her life 'destroyed' for the best part of a year - an experience that she describes as 'horrendous'. 'It did destroy my life for the best part of a year,' she admits. 'I couldn't work. I couldn't show my body to anyone. I had such a tough year. 'But,' she adds, 'when I did start talking about what happened to me, it turned out that it wasn't that rare. I realised that lots of people have complications with their boob jobs. 'They rush out to have a boob job because everyone is having one and they don't realise there are risks involved. People should know. 'I didn't think that there was any risk. My downfall was not researching my surgeon enough. That's the biggest mistake I made. Too many people probably do do that. You should do proper research. At the very least, get someone who's worked in the NHS before.' Now healed and happy, Marsh says she has no plans to change anything else in the near future, although says she would quite like to have a reduction at some point. Familiar: Tonight's episode is about plastic surgery, which Jodie says hasn't always gone well for her . Fascinating: Jodie has long been fascinated by the concept of mail order brides and has delved into their world . 'There's nothing I want done,' she cackles, chuckling madly. 'Boob wise, I might have a reduction in future because they are enormous and I don't think I want 32G when I'm 50. 'Otheriwse, I'm happy with my body and face.' One part of her life that she's less happy with is her love live and that, conveniently enough, provided the inspiration for the third documentary in the four-show run - lying, cheating men. 'That's a personal mission of mine, it's almost like a vendetta,' shivers Marsh, whose own experience includes a failed engagement to Brentwood DJ, David Doyle, and a brief fling with TOWIE's Kirk Norcross, as well as a lesbian relationship with a hairdresser named Nina. 'It's a bit like closing a chapter. I've been lied to so many times by men. One of the reasons I've been single and celibate so long is because I've had such bad experiences.' It's certainly true that love hasn't always been kind to Marsh, although as she admits, her continual questioning of her boyfriends (and girlfriends) words probably hasn't helped. 'I truly think if you're clever, you can catch somebody out for lying,' she explains. 'The majority of people lie and you can either turn a blind eye or go digging for the truth. Big plans: Jodie says she is focusing on her career at the moment but would love to meet someone one day . 'There have been so many boyfriends in the past who have lied to me but I would rather know the truth and be hurt than go on living a lie. 'I am very cynical about relationships, just because I've seen so much cheating and lying.' She tells of being particularly shocked while visiting the Miami headquarters of a married dating service and found the idea of someone paying to cheat on their spouse nothing short of mortifying. Nevertheless, despite being a self-confessed cynic, she admits that she would like to find someone special - 'my mum and dad have been together for 40 years', she chirps, longingly - whether man or woman. 'I don't think you can ever decide who you're going to be with,' says Marsh. 'I also believe you can fall in love with someone either sex because its not so much about sexuality, it's about love. 'I don't believe in being gay, straight or bi-sexual, I just believe in loving humans.' For now, a self-confessed happy singleton, her eyes are focused on her career - and on her one-woman mission to supplant Ross Kemp and Louis Theroux from their perch. 'I love Ross Kemp but I think there's room for me as well,' she smiles. Marsh, who can point to being briefly held hostage in a Ukrainian brothel as well as being threatened with a machete by an irate Jamaican while filming, certainly isn't short of the cojones needed to pull it off. Free love: Jodie says she doesn't believe in being gay, straight or bi-sexual - just falling in love . The final show in the series, Virgins, saw her live in a Cambodian slum for a week, while pursuing stories about FGM and sex-trafficking with her crew. She's also working on another two documentaries, one of which is apparently so dangerous (she won't say exactly what it's about), she's had to increase her life insurance premium. Despite the risks, however, Marsh says she's got designs on Kemp's investigative crown - and has pulled in a film crew who spend most of their time producing current affairs programmes Dispatches and Panorama to help her do it. 'The show is like Louis Theroux and Ross Kemp in the sense that it's investigative but in this case, I'm going on the journey as well,' she explains. 'My aim was always to educate, inform and entertain and if you watch it, you will laugh, cry and definitely scream. 'Plus,' she says excitedly, 'you get my innermost thoughts as well. There's no weird editing, no fake set up stuff. It is literally me going to meet real people who have incredible stories to tell.' And the presence of a Panorama film crew has only made her happier. 'To have the crew I have is beyond an honour,' she says, almost exploding with excitement. 'I am so grateful to be working with this crew doing a Jodie Marsh show on a hardcore topic. This is it for me, this is where I want to be. This is all my dreams come true.'","The bodybuilder and presenter, 35, says she plans to have a reduction .

"It's not often that you see hardened criminals applying lashings of make-up or enjoying a spot of group meditation while lying on the floor. But a program taking place at Californian prisons is encouraging inmates to do just that. Prisoners at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco took part in the acting workshop 'Commedia Dell'Arte', designed to aid their rehabilitation. The Actors' Gang Prison Project program, which runs the 8-week workshops, believes that through acting convicted criminals can learn develop empathy and start expressing themselves in a positive manner.

At least three times a year, the theater company - led by actor and activist Tim Robbins - brings classes directly into prisons to foster 'tolerance and nonviolent expression while significantly reducing recidivism rates' Robbins told Variety magazine that he immediately realized the idea had the potential to change lives. 'My first thought was that it was exactly the kind of work we should be doing,' he said. 'I've worked for years with many different causes … but to actually be on the ground and doing the work is really fulfilling.' The project brings together inmates from different races - and even different gangs - through classes that combine open discussion, theater education and performance. Workshop organizers believe that, ultimately, the workshops can reduce re-offending rates and help ease the pressure of overcrowding on the California prison system .

It aims to create a setting where inmates feel safe to explore and express emotions rarely seen in prison. 'It creates a bond that is quite profound and lasting,' Robbins added. 'And it cuts deeper than previous lines that have been drawn.' This year, the Prison Project was awarded state funding by the California Arts Council, which will help Robbins and his team expand their work. 'Our hope is that within five years we'll be able to train different groups throughout the state in this method,' he told Variety, 'And hopefully empower other organizations, too, to go in and do this work.'

"Police say Australian bikie gangs are expanding into South East Asia to bolster their underworld operations. The gangs are establishing in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia, where local chapters of the clubs are recruiting new members and working with their Australian counterparts. The overseas expansion of local gangs is one of the key factors addressed by the National Anti-Gang Squad, based on the Gold Coast. The group leads investigations into the activities of Australian-based gangs overseas and their links to crime in Australia. Thai members of the Rebels Club, the largest Australian bikie club. Police believe Australian bikie gangs are are expanding aggressivelyinto south-east Asia . It is believed the gangs are being formed in locations that lack anti-gang resources as Australia . The social media accounts of the overseas offshoots of the Australian bikie clubs feature pictures of firearms . In June, the Gang Squad hosted a South East Asia conference in Bangkok to tackle the mounting threat of outlaw motorcycle gangs. It was attended by 75 State and territory police officers from Australia, as well as officers from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia Vietnam Singapore and America. The Commander of the Gangs Squad in NSW Detective Superintendant Deb Wallace told Daily Mail: 'We keep a very close eye on outlaw motorcycle gangs and, in recent years, have observed a number of gang members moving overseas.' 'In particular, the Rebels have made a concerted effort to expand their international footprint', he said. 'The rationale behind this expansion is driven largely by organised crime objectives. Chapters have been established to tap into underworld business opportunities in overseas markets, particularly in locations where law enforcement agencies don't have the same level of anti-gang resources or expertise as we do here in NSW.' The Rebels MC have made the largest expansion into south-east Asia. They club has 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country . The Minister for Justice Michael Keenan said the National Anti Gang Squad Australia is 'leading the fight against Outlaw Motorcycle Gang criminal highways through South East Asia.' 'The activities of organised crime groups and outlaw motorcycle gangs are an ongoing threat to Australia. 'They are violent predators who profit from the misery of drug trafficking, drug manufacturing, extortion, prostitution and firearms trafficking.' The Rebels MC have 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country. The Rebels, who were founded in Brisbane in the late 1960's, have successfully expanded into Malta and New Zealand. They have now established chapters in Thailand, Indonesia Malaysia and Cambodia. The social media accounts of the Indonesian Rebels club features images of firearms. In July, the head of the rebels Alex Vella had his Visa cancelled while on holiday in his home country of Malta, where he has since been stranded. The news of overseas expansion comes amid harsh national crackdowns on the clubs, particularly in Queensland, where the Campbell Newman Government introduced the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act  to combat the gangs in 2013.

"A charity which received £50,000 in donations to fund specialist brain tumour treatment for a five-year-old boy has refused to hand over the cash because the NHS agreed to pay for the therapy. Kids n Cancer collected donations of around £50,000 from people supporting the plight of Ashya King, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. His parents sparked an international manhunt and were eventually arrested in Spain after they took him out of hospital and fled the country earlier this year in search of better treatment which was not funded by the NHS. The charity says the money was donated for the specialist treatment, proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague, to treat Ashya's tumour. However it said as the NHS had now decided to fund the therapy, the cash will be spent on other children who need treatment. Ashya's older brother Naveed Kids n Cancer have labelled his family 'greedy' and said the charity had never given them money and was refusing to help. Scroll down for video . Naveed King (right) claims Kids n Cancer have accused his family of being greedy by asking for the £50k raised for his younger brother Ashya's (left) treatment. The charity refused the request because it will be funded by the NHS . The family said they believe as the money was donated to Ashya's cause they should now receive it to help cover their extensive legal costs. These were incurred when they were arrested and held in Spain for fleeing with their son. 'We have asked Kids n Cancer to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in Prague,' Naveed, 20, wrote on Facebook. 'Kids n Cancer came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us, they said we are greedy asking for help... Kids N Cancer have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now.' Brett and Naghemeh King fled Southampton General Hospital with their son Ashya in September because they were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the UK. They researched alternatives and found proton beam therapy, available in Prague. Brett and Naghemeh King with their son Ashya, 5, at the Motole University Hospital as he waits to have proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague . The NHS said it would not fund the therapy and the Kings fled to Spain, where they planned to sell a house to raise the money to have Ashya treated in Prague. When it was noticed they had fled, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain. Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him. The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before a international outcry- including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led judges to order they should be released. Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26. He has since started treatment at the clinic in Prague. Ashya's family took him out of Southampton General Hospital in a bid to raise money to fund proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague to treat his brain tumour . Proton beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy which causes less damage to surrounding tissue. Instead of firing high energy beams of radiation at tumours, protons (sub-atomic particles) are used and stop when they reach cancer cells. The makeup of protons mean they are less likely to disperse widely and affect surrounding tissue. This treatment is not routinely funded by the NHS. Kids n Cancer said while it had been prepared to meet the £100,000 cost of the treatment in Prague, because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need. Brett King (left) and his wife Naghemeh (right) fled Southampton General Hospital with their son Ashya because they wanted him to have proton beam therapy for his brain tumour . The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims. It said Kids n Cancer exists to fund proton beam therapy to help children and their families, and no where did it state that legal costs would or could be covered by donations. Mike Hyman, chief executive officer of Kids n Cancer, said: 'There are many, many families who do not get the sort of donations that the Kings have had. 'The Just Giving Page was set up by Sanjay Gunatra, who specified that now the treatment has been paid for that the donations will go towards helping other sick children and their families.' He added: 'There has obviously been a significant amount of money raised and I reiterate that Kids n Cancer were prepared to underwrite £100,000 to pay for Ashya King’s treatment.' Ashya was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of July and after several operations was to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. But his parents were concerned that this would leave him in a semi-vegetative state. Mrs King has previously said her son was left scarred by the experience, and now fears every time his parents leave the room that they will be leaving him again.","Ashya King's parents took him abroad to get specialist treatment for tumour .

"Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre has admitted players' use of social media 'is a problem' in the wake of the controversy surrounding Reds striker Mario Balotelli. The Italian was charged by the Football Association on Friday following allegedly racist and anti-Semitic comments on social media. Balotelli reposted an image of computer game character Super Mario on Instagram earlier this week, which included the words 'jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew'. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been charged by the FA for a controversial image posted to Instagram . Italian striker Balotelli has been charged under FA rule E3 which concerns controversial comments . Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre admits social media is something his club and others could do without . He apologised for any offence caused, but is now set to face a ban, and Ayre told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme that it is something his club could do without. 'Given the choice we'd love to keep all our players away from social media because it really is a problem,' he said. 'I can honestly say there isn't any more we could do as a club to try to educate our players around this, but it still rears its head at least once a season - probably at every club in some form or another.' Balotelli apologised for any offence caused by the post but is now set to face a ban after being charged . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) and Ayre pose in the Reds changing room . Balotelli has been sidelined by a groin injury recently and Ayre added: 'One of the problems that all footballers have had for many a year is that they have too much time to kill. 'In that downtime they seem to put these crazy sort of messages up. It is definitely an issue. 'I don't think we have got to the point where we would stop people doing it, but we certainly have a very stringent policy that all of our players sign. If they step out of line then we punish them.' Sportsmail takes a look at some more of Balotelli's on and off-field incidents  in English football. CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli is found to be carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police ask why, he reportedly replies: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scores his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement is marred when he is sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini says Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award. DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011) Balotelli again hits trouble after it emerges he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escapes punishment. SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologises to his team-mates after he is sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli is immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against the Los Angeles Galaxy. FIREWORKS AT HOME (October 2011) Ten firefighters used breathing apparatus as they put out a blaze at Balotelli's  £7,500-a-month house in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, after fireworks were set off in a bathroom. The Italian was left with a repair bill of £400,000. THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrives in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli breaks a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracts negative headlines after pictures emerge of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli is charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashes the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli is sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. Also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song. CLASH WITH MANCINI (January 2013) Balotelli clashes with Mancini during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches.","Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre slams players' use of social media .

"A former stockbroker nicknamed 'Britain's Schindler' after saving hundreds of Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Prague was today awarded the Czech Republic's highest honour at the age of 105. Sir Nicholas Winton rescued more than 650 refugee children from certain death in concentration camps by transporting them to the UK on trains and finding them foster families. He received the Order of the White Lion from Czech president Milos Zeman, who had previously described him as 'an example of humanity, selflessness, personal courage and modesty'. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Sir Nicholas Winton receives the Czech Republic's highest honour during a ceremony at Prague Castle after saving hundreds of Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Prague on the eve of World War Two . Honoured: Sir Nicholas received the Order of the White Lion from Czech president Milos Zeman (centre), who previously described him as 'an example of humanity, selflessness, personal courage and modesty' In a speech in front of some of the people he saved, Sir Nicholas said: 'Thank you all for this enormous expression of thanks for something which happened to me nearly 100 years ago - and 100 years is a heck of a long time. 'I am delighted that so many of the children are still here to thank me.' He went on to praise the families who gave the children homes after they arrived in Britain. 'I thank the British people for making room for them to accept them,' he said. 'And of course the enormous help given by so many of the Czechs who were at that time doing what they could to fight the Germans and get the children out.' His son Nick, granddaughter Holly, grandson Laurence, daughter Barbara and her husband Steve were also in attendance. Sir Nicholas Winton receives applause from the audience which included his family and some of the 650 children he rescued from certain death in concentration camps by transporting them to the UK on trains and finding them foster families in 1939 . Sir Nicholas defied the wishes of his family by flying to the ceremony in a special plane provided by the Czech Defence Ministry after they expressed fears for his health. His friend Matej Minac, the director of several programmes and a film about Sir Nicholas, said: 'He has done what he wanted all his life so it's no surprise he defied his worried family to come. 'He loved travelling and he would like to travel although he is 105. His family prohibits him to travel because of his age and health. 'Sir Nicholas says it is better if he died in Prague where he could enjoy himself and have some fun than to live in England and be bored to death. 'I think that the invitation to Prague may extend his life. He loves adventures and this is an adventure for him.' Speaking ahead of the award ceremony at Prague Castle, Sir Nicholas said he felt proud to have 'made a difference to a lot of people'. 'I knew better than most, and certainly better than the politicians, what was going on in Germany,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. 'The first thing to know is that if something is not impossible there must be a way of doing it.' Saviour: Former stockbroker Sir Nicholas Winton with one of the children he rescued from Czechoslovakia . Honouring a hero: A headboard (left) worn by the train which carried the children on the final leg of their journey from Harwich to Liverpool Street station. Right, is a statue of Sir Nicholas unveiled in 2009 at Prague Main railway station to mark the 70th anniversary of his his remarkable rescue . It was late in December 1938 when Sir Nicholas from Hampstead, then a stockbroker, cancelled a holiday and instead went to Prague to see for himself the plight of child refugees. Horrified by the treatment of the Jews under the Nazi occupation, he set about organising eight evacuations of the threatened children on the Czech 'Kindertransport' train. He advertised in newspapers for foster homes, organised residency permits from the immigration office in the UK, and persuaded the Germans to let the children go. He said: 'Once we got the machinery in place, it was purely up to me to get in touch with all kinds of organisations throughout the country whether they would take a child. 'That was not an unusual thing to do because it was at the time when the people here ourselves were moving people from the South and the North because of safety'. He did not tell anyone about his remarkable achievements for some 50 years, until his wife found a scrapbook. The story came to the public's attention when, in 1988, he was invited to appear in the audience of BBC programme That's Life. During the episode the audience was asked if Sir Nicholas had helped anyone, at which point two dozen people stood up and applauded him. He said yesterday there was 'no personal fear involved' despite dealing with the Nazis and believes the world is a far more dangerous place today. Asked about conflicts around the world today, he said: 'We've made a mess of it' 'I don't think we ever learn from the mistakes from the past. The world today is a more dangerous situation than it has ever been. 'So as long as you've got the weapons of mass destruction which can finish off any conflict, nothing is safe any more.' In his debt: World War Two survivors walk along the train platform at London's Liverpool Street Station where Jewish children from former Czechoslovakia arrived on The Winton Train, so named after Sir Nicholas, to mark the 70th anniversary of their rescue . Royal recognition: Sir Nicholas meets the Queen at Devlin Castle Hotel during a tour of Slovakia in 2008 . Taking into the account the children of those he saved, there are estimated to be around 6,000 people in the world today who owe him their lives. He was knighted by the Queen in 2003. To this day, they call themselves 'Nicky's children'. Sir Nicholas celebrated his 105th birthday earlier this year at the Czech embassy in London where most of the guests were the offspring of the children rescued by him. At his birthday party, he said: 'I am always surprised every time I come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello. 'As far as I am concerned, it is only Anno Domini that I am fighting - I am not ill, I am just old and doddery.' Sir Nicholas still lives in his own home in Berkshire, with only a day carer.","Sir Nicholas Winton rescued 650 refugees on Czech 'Kindertransport' trains .

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila admits he is reluctant to make too many changes for the midweek Europa League clash against Dinamo Zagreb after scraping a narrow 1-0 win at Motherwell. The Hoops have already qualified for the last 32 of the competition, meaning Thursday's match in Croatia is effectively a dead rubber. Deila has also expressed concerns about a hectic schedule having a detrimental effect on his players. Ronny Deila is reluctant to make too many changes for his side's match against Dinamo Zagreb . Celtic striker Anthony Stokes scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his side . But, despite fears that fatigue could set in, the Celtic boss will resist the urge to make too many alterations from the side who secured their seventh league win in a row on Saturday. He said: 'Some of them will get a chance but it's important also that we keep the consistency in the team as well. 'If we change too much, it's not good for the players who are playing.' Deila will be seeking an improvement on the display at Fir Park, where an early Anthony Stokes goal was all that separated them from struggling Motherwell. He added: 'I was a little bit angry because we had 20 very good minutes and then we started to be a little bit lazy and didn't work enough. 'Suddenly, Motherwell are a good team. We need to do the job for each other for 90 minutes.' Deila was named SPFL Manager of the Month for November after guiding his side to four straight league wins . However, Celtic's recent form overall has seen Deila rewarded with the SPFL Premiership manager of the month award for November. He said: 'Of course it means a lot to me, that we have done well. 'Football is team work and my staff and I are working very close. 'I am a leader of the team and this is a reward for the whole team. We work very good together. 'We have worked really hard to get the results and this is a sign that we have done something right which is why I am very happy for everyone at Lennoxtown. 'I won manager of the year in Norway which I got last year when we won the league.' Kenny Black is in the running to become the next manager of Motherwell on a permanent basis . Motherwell could name their new manager ahead of Saturday's clash with bottom side Ross County, with caretaker boss Kenny Black and former midfielder Rob Maaskant reported to be on the six-man shortlist to replace Stuart McCall. Regardless of whether the new boss is in place or not, Black admits a win is crucial to start moving away from the Premiership danger zone. He said: 'I think Ross County will bring their own game to the table. They showed a bit of spirit against Dundee United on Friday night. 'The four games I've had in charge were difficult games but, with the situation we're in just now, we'll have to battle and scrap for the remainder of the season like we did against Celtic. 'I think there's enough there with the players we have. We've got to do our talking on the park now and start getting some points and climbing the table.'","Celtic have already qualified for the next stage of the Europa League .

"CLICK HERE to read Joe Bernstein's full match report from the Etihad Stadium . Manchester City midfielder James Milner is confident Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic can fill the void created by injury to star striker Sergio Aguero. City look like being without the prolific Aguero for a spell after the Argentinian suffered a knee ligament injury in Saturday's laboured but vital win over Everton. Aguero, who has scored 19 goals this season, left the field in tears after falling awkwardly following a challenge from Muhamed Besic in the second minute at the Etihad Stadium. Sergio Aguero was left in tears after suffering ligament damage in City's win against Everton . England international James Milner (left) fires a shot during the Premier League clash . Edin Dzeko (left) and Stevan Jovetic (right) will be asked to fill the void left by Aguero's injury . City are still to learn the extent of the damage, and the 26-year-old will be assessed in the coming days, but he is highly unlikely to feature in Wednesday's crucial Champions League clash at Roma. That leaves Dzeko and Jovetic, both of whom have also had fitness issues recently, as the chief men to spearhead the attack. Dzeko only returned to action after four games out with a calf injury as a second-half substitute against Everton while Jovetic missed the game as a precaution because of a hamstring problem. Milner said: 'Sergio has been absolutely outstanding, so he is going to be a massive miss for us. Hopefully he is back soon. 'But it is good timing that Edin is coming back. He is fantastic goalscorer and hopefully Stevan will be available for midweek as well, so we have got plenty of players. 'They are not easy shoes to fill, Sergio Aguero's, but with the ability the other players have, I'm sure they'll fill his shoes no problem.' The Manchester City talisman fell awkwardly after a challenge from Muhamed Besic (right) Team-mates surround Aguero as the extent of his injury becomes clear at the Etihad Stadium . Aguero leaves the field and is not expected to be available for the Champions League clash with Roma . Aside from the Roma clash - which will determine whether City progress to the Champions League last 16 or not - the upcoming fixtures do not look too daunting. Leicester, Crystal Palace, West Brom and Burnley, the remaining opponents in December, are all at the bottom end of the Barclays Premier League. The victory over Everton, which came courtesy of a dubiously-awarded Yaya Toure penalty in the 24th minute, maintained City's recent momentum and cut Chelsea's lead at the top to three points. City have now won five in succession in all competitions, a marked return to form after a sticky run in October and November. Milner said: 'It has been pleasing, the momentum we have built since the last international break. Hopefully we can keep that going for the Champions League and take that momentum into the Christmas period coming up. 'We probably didn't play as well on Saturday but it was a different kind of performance. We ground it out and you need to do that to be successful. 'Obviously after the (Chelsea) result, we knew we wanted to get in touching distance and get them looking over their shoulder.' Yaya Toure strokes home the winning goal from the penalty spot in the 1-0 victory . City face Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday after drawing 1-1 with the Italians in the first game . The injury to Aguero dampened the atmosphere and the game never really sparked into life. City went ahead after Phil Jagielka was harshly judged to have fouled Milner in the box but the goal did not improve the spectacle. Aguero's replacement Jose Pozo, a highly-rated Spanish teenager, almost added a second after fine work from Milner but Tim Howard somehow saved his goalbound shot with his feet. City generally had the better of the few other chances created but it needed a fine save from Joe Hart late on to keep out a well-struck volley from Romelu Lukaku. Milner, 28, said: 'We have played better but you need to win those sort of games if you are going to win the title and we managed to scrap it out. 'It was all about the win. It was massively important to keep the momentum going, especially before Roma.' Youngster Jose Pozo (left) impressed after coming on to replace Aguero at the weekend . Momentum is something Everton do not have after just one win from their last six Premier League games. Defender Sylvain Distin told Everton TV: 'I think we gave them a tough game but for me it was a soft penalty. 'I think if the referee hadn't given that penalty it would have been a different game, but you never know. 'It is part of football, you have to accept it, but it is difficult to get over it.'","Sergio Aguero suffered ligament damage during 1-0 victory over Everton .

"Honduras have named Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto, who steered Costa Rica to their best ever World Cup placing in the Brazil 2014 quarter-finals, as their coach until the 2018 tournament in Russia. Pinto, the third Colombian to take charge of the 'Ticos' after Reinaldo Rueda and Luis Fernando Suarez, replaces Hernan Medford who was sacked on Tuesday after four months in charge following poor results -- including a 6-0 defeat by Japan last month. 'I am pleased to inform the football family and fans that Jorge Luis Pinto is the new H (Honduras) coach until Russia 2018!!' Honduran Football Federation president Rafael Callejas announced on his Twitter account. Former Costa Rica boss Jorge Luis Pinto has been appointed the new manager of Honduras . Pinto, pictured with the Costa Rica squad, guided his side to victories against Uruguay and Italy in Brazil . Pinto's first competitive challenge will be a playoff against Guyana in March for a ticket to the CONCACAF Gold Cup to be held in the United States from July 7-26. Honduras, who first played at the World Cup finals in Spain in 1982, reached the 2010 tournament in South Africa with Rueda in charge and this year's tournament in Brazil under Suarez. Pinto's Costa Rica side were unbeaten in five matches at the 2014 finals including shock wins over Uruguay and Italy in their first two group matches. They drew with England in their final group match and also with Greece, whom they beat on penalties, in the last 16. They went out on penalties to Holland in the quarter-finals. The 61-year-old has coached Colombia and a host of club sides, winning league title with Peru's Alianza Lima, Alajuelense of Costa Rica and Cucuta in his home country.

"They spend their days travelling along England's country lanes and their nights in traditional gypsy wagons, moving from campsite to grassy verge as the mood takes them. But these are not the gypsies of the sort made famous by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. Instead, these are the UK's New Age Travellers, a peaceful hippyish community devoted to the principles of New Age belief, which include spiritual healing and a holistic view of the cosmos. Often hard to find, thanks in no small part to their constant travels, the people of the New Age Traveller community are the subject of a spectacular series of photographs by British snapper, Iain McKell, who spent months living with a community based in the West Country. Low key: New Age Travellers live a quiet life, roaming the roads of Britain in their elaborately decorated horse-drawn wagons . Travels: The majority of New Age Travellers are to be found in the West Country, in particular Devon and Somerset . Back to nature: New Age Travellers live a simple life, producing their own food and living hand-in-glove with nature . McKell, who has since produced a book on his experiences with the Travellers, has captured a snapshot of their simple life, which sees them spend the majority of their time either on the road or setting up camp in some of the loveliest parts of the English countryside. Unrelated to the Roma or Irish Travellers, the New Age Traveller movement began in 1986 when a group of post-punk anti-Thatcher protesters headed out of London into the English countryside. Over the years, the movement has evolved into what McKell describes as 'a hybrid tribe of new gypsies' and 'present-day rural anarchists', who, along with flitting about the countryside, regularly appear at festivals, among them Glastonbury. Indeed, the earliest years of the 'Horsedrawn', as they're also known, were characterised by mass attendance at festivals such as WOMAD and the Stonehenge Free Festivals, although another, the Castlemorton Common Festival, proved considerably more controversial. No relation: New Age Travellers like those featured in McKell's book are no relation to either Roma gypsies or Irish Travellers . Community: The New Age Traveller movement began in 1986 when a group of anti-Thatcher post-punk protesters moved to the country . Freedom: The movement grew out of festivals such as the Stonehenge Free Festivals of the 1970s and many still attend Glastonbury . Simple: The majority of New Age Travellers eschew modern creature comforts, although that didn't stop Kate Moss from visiting . Held in 1992 in Somerset, the week-long unlicensed festival attracted an estimated 40,000 ravers but led to the Government taking action on 'illegal' festivals after the event made headlines across the UK. Despite the banning of unlicensed festivals, life for New Age Travellers remains largely unchanged, with McKell's 'new gypsies' sharing a desire for sustainability, a love of self-reliance, and a disdain for the trappings of contemporary life. Although the New Age Travellers aren't immune from the lures of the modern world - among McKell's photos is a snap of Kate Moss enjoying a dose of gypsy life - for most, an existence that eschews traditional creature comforts for the simplicity of life on the road remains the ultimate goal. Free spirit: McKell describes the travellers variously as 'a hybrid tribe of new gypsies' and 'present-day rural anarchists' Romantic: A New Age Traveller wagon sits alone in a Somerset field in one of McKell's striking photographs . Homely: The New Age Traveller wagons are usually elaborately decorated and also house the family pets, whether dog or duck .","New Age Travellers first appeared in 1986 when a group of post-punk anti-Thatcher activists left London .

"Five people have been killed in a horror crash in southeast Washington leaving ten children without a mother, in an accident described as one of the worst in 40 years. According to eyewitness William Key, the wreck occurred when a speeding Mercedes blew through a red light before smashing into the back of an Acura making a right turn on a red light on Friday. 'It was indescribable,' said the Oxon Hill, Maryland native. 'It was too hard. My wife heard it at home two blocks away.' Family has identified four of the fatally injured victims as (clockwise from top left) sister Tameika Curtis and Typhani Wilkerson, one-year-old Hassan Boykin, and Haddah Ba, age 13 .

The special performance of the Canadian national anthem was to show solidarity with the people of Ottawa following the tragic events that unfolded in Canada's capital city earlier in the day. Since the game in Pittsburgh did not involve a Canadian team, there was no requirement for the Penguins to do this, but it was still a touching and heartfelt gesture on their part.

Chairman Tony Platten said: ‘Unlike a few years ago, you cannot just say, ""Okay, we've got a great draw against x, y or z so let's shift it to St James' Park”. ‘You cannot do that. Whoever we draw and it's at home, whether it's Manchester United of Chelsea, the game will definitely be staged at Croft Park, We have the appropriate safety certificate.’ Stephen Turnbull pictured celebrating scoring the equaliser for Blyth Spartans against Hartlepool .

"Make or break time has arrived. In the next 13 days, Liverpool face a run of four highly-charged games which could define the club’s season. For Brendan Rodgers, the spell offers a chance to turn the season round. No matter what has gone before, Liverpool’s manager knows positive results against Manchester United and Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League, and at Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup, would bring a different hue to the campaign. But he is also aware that the events of tomorrow evening hold the key. If Liverpool beat Basle and qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, the atmosphere around the club will be transformed. VIDEO Scroll down to see Brendan Rodgers post-match reaction following Sunderland draw . Steven Gerrard (left) replaced Adam Lallana to take his place in the centre of midfield for Liverpool . At 34, Gerrard has found himself on the substitutes bench on a number of occasions so far this season . But that is a big ‘if’. The pressure on Liverpool to reach the last 16 is intense. So how will the squad cope with the expectancy of a baying Anfield crowd? ‘That’s what we will see,’ said Rodgers. ‘You look forward to these games. Our aim is to make sure we get through the qualification stage and we have a chance to do that. We only need one goal. That’s it. Then we have big games against United, Bournemouth and Arsenal. ‘It (beating Basle) would give you confidence. You could then put it (the Champions League) to bed for a couple of months. We have to stay calm and we have shown in these last four games we have the ability to do that. Gus Poyet believes that Gerrard (left) still has a world-class talent that can change matches . Liverpool captain Gerrard (left) battles with Liam Bridcutt for the ball in his side's game against Sunderland . ‘We are harder to beat. Hopefully we can get a little bit more luck in the final third to get the goals.’ That last point shows why Rodgers cannot be entirely sure of what will happen. In corresponding games last season, Liverpool scored three unanswered goals at Old Trafford, blitzed Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield and had a comfortable 2-0 win at Bournemouth in the FA Cup. The draw helped Liverpool reach a small landmark. It was their 1500th point of the Premier League era. They are the fourth club to reach that figure . ‘We are still a little fragile,’ Kolo Toure admitted. ‘Last season we were amazing going forward and we are not at that level yet. But we are catching up slowly, we are becoming stronger.’ This, though, is a very different Liverpool team. Circumstances mean Rodgers is trying to find another way of winning but in a charmless 0-0 draw with Sunderland his side only began to look a threat once Steven Gerrard appeared from the bench. In the 211 minutes in which Gerrard has not been on the pitch this season, Liverpool have failed to score a single goal. Only Raheem Sterling, with his dancing feet and dazzling runs, looks capable of easing the burden on his captain. Kolo Toure (right) admits Liverpool are still a little fragile, but they are catching up slowly . Brendan Rodgers (left) knows Liverpool have a chance to resurrect their season in the next four matches . It is 10 years ago today since Gerrard dragged Liverpool into the Champions League knockout stages with an extraordinary goal against Olympiacos. Once again the responsibility will be placed on his 34-year-old shoulders to lead the way. Rodgers wants to rest his captain but, as his team laboured against Sunderland, he had to turn to him in the hope of pilfering three points. ‘He has real quality, the kind that lifted the game,’ said Rodgers. ‘He has a world-class talent. The legs may go a bit as you get older but you never lose the talent. His passing and his view of the game was phenomenal.’ Sunderland manager Gus Poyet had spent time before the game showing his players videos of what impact Gerrard has on Liverpool. The sight of a teamsheet missing the midfielder’s name provided an unexpected bonus. ‘It shows how difficult it is for us (managers) to make decisions,’ said Poyet, whose side defended with diligence and deserved their share of the spoils. ‘It would be very easy for Brendan to play Gerrard 90 minutes every game but then lose him for a month with an injury. It is tough. ‘When you see he isn’t playing? Phew. It is good news. But when he came on, it wasn’t just the players who were affected. The crowd, the atmosphere, everything changed. ‘That is when we suffered. Liverpool were coming at us from everywhere. He is special. He is a player who, with his presence on a pitch, makes the whole place better.’","Liverpool face Basle on Tuesday with a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League .

"The Australia team will be battling their emotions and ‘inner demons’ when they play the first Test since the death of Phillip Hughes. The Aussies take on India in a rescheduled first Test at Hughes’s adopted home ground, the Adelaide Oval, in what is sure to be an emotional atmosphere. Players will wear Hughes’s Baggy Green No 408 on their shirts, as well as black armbands. They will line up on the outfield before the first day’s play, in front of a giant 408 painted on the grass, to watch a video tribute to their former team-mate, which will be followed by 63 seconds of applause — the score on which Hughes was unbeaten when he was fatally injured by a bouncer during a domestic Sheffield Shield match just under two weeks ago. Shane Watson said preparing for it has been 'the most challenging couple of days' of his career . All-rounder Shane Watson is one of four members of the Test squad who were on the outfield at the Sydney Cricket Ground at the time Hughes was struck while playing for South Australia. He is confident all squad members will be physically and emotionally ready to play but he spoke honestly and openly about the impact Hughes’s death has had on him since returning to training two days after the 25-year-old’s funeral. He said: ‘Mentally, it’s been the most challenging couple of days I’ve had to go through in my career, after seeing what happened over the past week, trying to process everything that happened, especially being there at the SCG. ‘The first couple of sessions were tough, especially the first one. A few things flooded into my head as soon as I went out to bat… I thought I’d processed quite well over the previous week. Watson said it would be difficult facing aggressive bowling after what happened to Phillip Hughes . ‘This has been as important a four days’ lead up to a Test match that I have ever been involved in because there are a lot of inner demons that we’ve had to find our way through.’ For Watson, one of those demons involves facing up to top quality, aggressive, fast bowling — something he has done without a second thought for 52 Tests and 178 ODIs since his international debut in 2002. Suddenly, having witnessed close up what happened to Hughes, he has been struggling to put thoughts of the risks to one side when it comes to his own batting. ‘It’s been a big challenge to try to put the memories that are very much in the front of my mind — very recent — to move them back a bit in my mind and trust what I do as a batsman. I know everyone’s going to be in the same boat. ‘Bowling is a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in.’ Australian players will wear No 408 on their shirts in the first Test against India in tribute to Hughes . Watson admitted to feeling apprehensive about facing bouncers in the nets over the past couple of days, but said it got easier the more he batted — hence why he stayed in the nets half an hour longer than anyone else on Sunday. ‘There was initially (some apprehension), no doubt. But I’ve got more comfortable with just reacting to what I see and trusting my skill. He added: ‘You know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky and it hits you in the wrong spot it can cause some serious damage. ‘I knew I had to confront it from day one when I went in, and every day that I’ve gone in I’ve felt more comfortable.’ Captain Michael Clarke looks set to lead Australia after coming through a fitness test over the weekend. He batted with purpose in the nets on Sunday, having been struggling with a recurrence of his hamstring injury. The Australian team continue their preparations for the four-Test series against India . His inclusion will give added poignancy to the opening day of the Test match after being such a figure of support for the Hughes family and delivering the most heartfelt and tearful of tributes. Given the emotional burden Clarke has shouldered, he has been excused from the captain’s traditional eve-of-Test press conference. That job has gone to Mitchell Johnson, Australia’s chief aggressor with the ball, who roughed up the England batsmen during the last Ashes series. There has been an international debate over the use of the bouncer in the wake of Hughes’s death but Watson is in no doubt that the Aussies will go hard at India. ‘We’ve played our best cricket when we are aggressive. Aggressive with bat and ball but especially with the ball, as we were during the last Ashes series. That’s not going to change because that’s when we are at our absolute best.’ Adelaide  will host the first of four Tests between Australia and India before Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney . Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said he hoped the Test will be an opportunity for supporters to pay tribute to Hughes. ‘Soon after arriving in Adelaide Phillip became a crowd favourite,’ he said. ‘This is an opportunity for those who embraced him so fondly to say their goodbye.’ When the 63 seconds of applause bursts out at the Adelaide Oval it will be hard to avoid the thought that his score that day at the SCG would surely have seen him recalled to the Test squad for the start of this series. Perhaps, instead, this Test will signify the start of a healing process for those players who were closest to Hughes. As silent mourning is replaced by ringing applause, a group of men will begin the hardest game of cricket they are likely to play in their lives.

"Steve Bruce has paid tribute to goalkeeper Allan McGregor for saving his Hull side from another defeat — but acknowledges the club’s fans are justified in being frustrated. The point Hull gained from their dire draw with West Brom was insufficient to stop them falling into the relegation zone. The ‘highlights’ amounted to McGregor saving a poorly-taken early penalty from Graham Dorrans, and later making a brilliant stop from a Craig Gardner free-kick. Allan McGregor was in inspired form as Hull City earned a point against West Brom on Saturday . Graham Dorrans was denied from the penalty spot following a great save from visiting keeper McGregor . The 32-year-old Scottish goalkeeper was hospitalised with kidney damage in March after a collision at West Ham and has suffered injuries for much of the time since. But he is back as first-choice goalkeeper now. Hull and West Brom have three wins between them in their last 20 games. ‘He won us a point,’ Bruce said. ‘He got injured badly at West Ham. Perhaps it wasn’t life-threatening but it was one of those awful ones. He could have lost a kidney and it might have ended his career. ‘We had to be patient with him and he’s worked extremely hard. The save from the free-kick was the save of the season as far as I’m concerned.’ Dorrans looks on frustrated after McGregor denies him giving the Baggies a crucial lead . Steve Bruce contests a decision from the sideline during his Hull side's 0-0 draw against West Brom . The home crowd were restless at yet another display without a win. ‘It’s the first time in my two-and-a-half years that I can detect the crowd are upset at the end,’ Bruce said. ‘To be fair, I can understand. However, I am sure something will turn for us. 'We’ve had a really difficult start with injuries and late goals and suspensions but when I look at the squad and what we’ve got, I’m convinced we’ll be OK.'","Hull dropped into the relegation zone after 0-0 draw against West Brom .

"Supporters are keen to see Scottish football's booze ban lifted – and they have gained political backing in a bid to be put on the same footing as fans across Europe. Despite Police Scotland still opposing even a trial scheme to allow punters a pint at the match, one senior officer has admitted that they are open to discussion – if the debate is widened 'beyond the football community'. Supporters Direct Scotland threw their weight behind a concerted effort by football to have the ban – imposed as part of the Criminal Justice Scotland 1980 Act after an Old Firm Cup Final riot that year – lifted on a limited basis for a short trial period. Supporters are keen to see Scottish football's booze ban lifted  and be put the same as others across Europe . The ban was imposed as part of the Criminal Justice Scotland 1980 Act after an Old Firm  riot that same year . Supporters threw their weight behind an effort  to have the ban lifted on a limited basis for a short trial period . Following on from SFA chief executive Stewart Regan's confirmation that they'd been in discussions with the police, the fans' umbrella group revealed that a survey of supporters earlier this year had shown 62 per cent in an immediate scrapping of the regulations, while 72 per cent supported the idea of a small-scale trial. Although Andrew Jenkin, Head of Supporters Direct Scotland, urged caution and pointed out that certain demographics – female supporters and the over-60s – were resistant to lifting the ban, a statement on behalf of the group said: 'Scottish football has made impressive strides in improving its image over the last 35 years, with several clubs taking greater responsibility for the health and well-being of their supporters. 'We encourage those involved in these discussions to consider all relevant factors in any decision made regarding a change to the current restriction on alcohol in Scottish football.' Police Scotland initially responded by sticking to the same firm line they've held since 1980 – but with one small suggestion of wiggle room, as long as the public are consulted. Assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins said: 'Police Scotland believes we should maintain the position of a no alcohol at football policy. SFA chief executive Stewart Regan (pictured) confirmed that they'd been in discussions with the police . Supporters are keen to see Scottish football's booze ban lifted – and they have gained political backing . 'That said, in recognition that this decision was made following events in the 1980s, I have had some very informal discussions with the Football Authorities. 'At that time, I made it very clear that before we entered into formal discussions, a wide ranging public consultation should be undertaken. I was keen that this should be extended beyond the footballing community as any change to our policy would have far reaching and wide social impact. To my knowledge this has not been done as yet.' Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has spoken out on this issue before, said: 'I'm pleased to see Police Scotland are prepared to engage with a wide-ranging consultation on drinking at the football. 'It's a discussion that needs to happen. We are not in the same situation we were when alcohol was banned from the stadium. Grounds are safer and the atmosphere much more family friendly in general. 'It's also unfair that, if you pay £100 for a hospitality ticket you can enjoy a drink, but ordinary fans in the stands are denied this. 'More and more stadia have alcohol licences because they host other events like concerts, but at 3pm on a Saturday the taps have to be switched off. 'Let's have a proper discussion of the issues and a pilot scheme, instead of insisting that football fans in practically every other country in Europe are responsible enough to drink at the ground, but in Scotland they are not.'

"Pakistan comprehensively overcame New Zealand by seven wickets in their first T20 international in Dubai. The Black Caps' 135 for seven at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium proved a relatively straightforward chase for Pakistan, with victory wrapped up with five balls to spare. Opener Sarfraz Ahmed was the star of the show with an unbeaten 76 off 64 balls - the highest T20 score by a Pakistani wicketkeeper. Umar Akmal plays a cut during Pakistan's comfortable Twenty20 victory against New Zealand in Dubai . The teams go again in Sharjah on Friday to complete the two-match series, when New Zealand will be hoping for a much better start. Just three overs in, the score was 15 for three after captain Kane Williamson and Anton Devcich were both trapped lbw by Anwar Ali and Sohail Tanvir respectively, with Ross Taylor following soon after when he was caught by Umar Akmal off Mohammad Irfan . Martin Guptill (32) and Corey Anderson (48) tried to launch a fightback, with Luke Ronchi (33) joining the latter to rack up a half-century partnership off 32 balls. However, when the in-form Anderson, having struck four sixes and a four, was caught off the bowling of Raza Hasan just short of his half-century, Pakistan were able to limit their opponents to just 135. Sarfraz Ahmed smashes to the leg side as New Zealand wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi watches on . It was a figure Shahid Afridi's men made light work of, thanks in no small part to Sarfraz's impressive display. Having previously batted just once in four previous T20 internationals, he shone at the top of the order with eight fours and two sixes. He put on 51 for the first wicket with Awais Zia before losing his opener partner to a run out, while Mohammad Hafeez departed in similar fashion soon after having contributed just two to the total. However, New Zealand could only make one more breakthrough - Haris Sohail going for 11 - and Akmal (27no) joined forces with Sarfraz to take Pakistan home, the latter hitting the winning runs with a six off Jimmy Neesham's first ball of the game.","The Black Caps made 135 for seven from their 20 overs .

"Eoin Morgan has promised to ‘do it my way’ as he takes charge of England in Sunday’s fourth one-day international against Sri Lanka. With Alastair Cook suspended after presiding over a slow over-rate during Wednesday’s win in Hambantota, Morgan has the chance to lead his adopted country to an unlikely series-levelling victory. And Morgan, who is without a half-century in his last 15 one-day innings, backed himself to end a slump that has prompted Kevin Pietersen to blame what he views as the relentless coaching of Peter Moores — or, as KP referred to him in a recent tweet, the ‘woodpecker’. Eoin Morgan prepares to catch the ball during an England nets session in Colombo . The man who will captain England against Sri Lanka on Sunday takes a rest during training . Morgan prefers to put his mediocre form down to two factors: a loss of focus on his own game during the first half of the summer against the Sri Lankans and the excellence of India’s one-day bowling. He said: ‘With the turnaround in all the backroom staff at the start of the summer, and guys having different inputs, as a senior player you want to be involved as much as you can. I probably neglected my side of the game. I’d spent a lot of energy off the field.’ Now, he is hoping the captaincy will act as a catalyst, as Moores put it on Thursday. England opener Alex Hales talks to some fans outside the R Premadasa Stadium . Joe Root, who helped see England home on Wednesday, walks to the nets . Moeen Ali gets ready to take a catch . Morgan, pointing out that it wasn’t in his nature to fret, added: ‘In the fashion that I play, I don’t think I can, simply because I have to play an aggressive type of game. ‘It’s the way I’ve played since I was a kid and it works for me. ‘So there’s no use going into my shell or not playing any more shots. I’m a gambler and I’d say I’m due to get a score. I’ve got to stay true to myself.’ The good news for England is that he has an impressive record with the bat while leading the side. In seven one-dayers as captain he has scored 365 runs at 73 — roughly twice his career average. ‘I’ve always enjoyed captaining,’ he said. ‘Having not been a bowler since I was about 17, it gives you another string to your bow. ‘It also takes a bit of attention away from your batting so maybe it will contribute to me getting some runs.’ Before Wednesday’s five-wicket win, any talk of England winning the series would have been greeted with incredulity. But Morgan said: ‘You can see the belief in the guys’ eyes. They gained a lot of confidence from the other night.’ The slot in the line-up opened up by Cook’s absence could go to Nottinghamshire’s middle-order batsman James Taylor, the only member of the 15-man squad yet to get a game here. Off-spinner James Tredwell is likely to return after being left out at Hambantota. Ben Stokes, who has looked out of sorts, could make way. There is genuine excitement at the prospect of Moeen Ali — the star of the tour so far — opening the batting with Alex Hales. Morgan’s one-game ascent to the captaincy may not have come at the worst time. Teams for the fourth one-day international between England and Sri Lanka at the Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, on Sunday, starting at 4.30am: .

"People on the tiny British territory of Bermuda rushed Thursday to batten down for Hurricane Gonzalo, which was roaring toward them as a major Category 4 storm that threatens to do the same deadly and extensive damage as Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Fabian was the last major hurricane to strike Bermuda and made landfall as Category 3 storm that wound up killing four people. Kimberley Zuill, Bermuda Weather Service director, said at a news conference that the storm would affect the island for 27 hours. 'The path is similar to Fabian, the duration is similar to Fabian,' she said. 'If your property was exposed and received damage during Fabian, you will want to prepare for that again.' The capital of Hamilton appeared almost deserted by noon as stores boarded up windows. The businesses that remained open reported a steady stream of customers grabbing up essentials at the last minute. Repeat of 2003? Fabian hit Bermuda (seen in a satellite view at left) with gusts of up to 120mph, ripped the roofs off countless buildings and homes, ripped down power lines and did extreme damage to coastlines. Experts have warned that Hurricane Gonzalo (right) could be just as bad . 'Some people seem to have left it until the end to get things,' said Melissa Trott, an employee at Phoenix Store. 'We sold out of batteries, and our warehouse has none left.' Gas stations also reported brisk business. 'I was here for Hurricane Fabian in 2003, so I'm not taking any chances this time,' said Susan Black, a retiree who was filling up her car and several gas cans. 'I've been busy since 6:30 this morning getting things ready.' Fabian hit Bermuda with gusts of up to 120mph, ripped the roofs off countless buildings and homes, ripped down power lines and  did extreme damage to coastlines. What's to come? The dining room area is littered with debris at the Sonesta Beach Hotel in Hamilton, Bermuda, September 6, 2003 after Hurricane Fabian ravaged the island nation the day before . Will history repeat itself? A beachfront home lay in ruins in Bermuda September 7, 2003 after Fabian blew through with wind gusts that hit 120MPH . Many people moved boats to safer areas. While some can bring them out of the water, others relied on storm moorings and hoped for the best. Forecasters said destructive waves could cause significant flooding on the island, which is about one-third the size of Washington, D.C. Some 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain was predicted. The Bermuda Weather Service said seas would reach 35 feet (11 meters) on Friday. The Turks and Caicos Islands government announced Thursday that it would send a 436-foot (133-meter) frigate of Britain's Royal Navy to help with post-storm recovery efforts if needed. The storm is moving toward the north at 9 mph toward Bermuda, where a hurricane warning is in effect as the territory rushes to batten down. The hurricane center says the eye of Gonzalo is expected to pass near Bermuda sometime Friday, and a dangerous storm surge is expected along with heavy rainfall. Forecasters say Hurricane Gonzalo has strengthened overnight and is once again a dangerous Category 4 storm as it barrels toward the small British island territory of Bermuda . Hurricane Gonzalo has top sustained winds near 125 mph and was centered about 555 miles south south-west of Bermuda in the early hours of Thursday morning . Florida looked set to avoid the severe weather, reported the Sun Sentinel, although it could generate large swells and an increased risk of rip currents later in the week. After smashing into Bermuda, Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada by late Saturday. Gonzalo is the Atlantic's first Category 4 hurricane since October 2011 when Hurricane Ophelia's winds reached 140 mph, according to Jeff Masters, a hurricane expert with private forecaster Weather Underground.

Route: A National Hurricane Center map shows the predicted route of the storm over the next couple of days . Devastating: This graphic shows how the storm will weaken as it pushes northeast and brushes eastern Canada on Sunday . Hurricane Gonzalo briefly reached Category 4 status on Wednesday but dropped back to a Category 3 by the evening as it continued to move away from the northern Caribbean, forecasters said. It is expected to see slow weakening on Thursday night, with steadier weakening starting by late Friday. Gonzalo is the sixth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic season, which runs through to the end of November. Forecasters in August predicted lower-than-usual activity for the season, with seven to 12 named storms and no more than two reaching major hurricane status. A major hurricane is considered to be Category 3 or above with winds hitting at least 111 mph. Gonzalo has already swept by the eastern Caribbean earlier this week. It has uprooted trees, downed power lines and damaged scores of boats in the Caribbean islands of Antigua, St Maarten, and Martinique, according to local authorities and media reports. An 87-year-old sailor in St Maarten died after his boat sank in a marina where 37 vessels were damaged, the Daily Herald reported. Two people are missing, one in St. Martin and the other in St. Barts. After smashing into Bermuda, Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada by late Saturday, although by then it will have been downgraded to a Category 1 storm .

Shaken: A woman walks past damaged trees in Orient Bay on the French Caribbean island of Saint Martin on Tuesday. Three people are missing at sea after the hurricane Gonzalo swept through the French Caribbean islands of  Saint Barthelemy and Saint-Martin . Bermuda's residents are already having to cope with the aftermath of Sunday's Tropical Storm Fay. More than 1,000 homes remain without power and homeowners are working to repair damaged roofs. The government called out 200 soldiers of the Bermuda Regiment to help with cleanup efforts on the island of roughly 70,000 people. On Wednesday, people stripped the island's hardware stores of generators, batteries, candles and other items and picked up free tarpaulins distributed by the government. Supermarkets and gas stations are braced for more crowds on Thursday. 'We sold out of generators [Tuesday], and items like batteries, tarp and ropes have been flying off the shelf,' Mark Stearns, a hardware store general manager, said. 'Everything that is on the hurricane list has been going fast and furious. People are definitely nervous about this storm.' Flights out of Bermuda are fully booked for the rest of the week and hardware stores were inundated with shoppers, the Royal Gazette reported. Bermuda, which is 850 miles east of the U.S. state of South Carolina, has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world and its strict building codes make structures particularly capable of withstanding storms.

"Former England cricketer Graeme Swann talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. Who is your sporting hero? Peter Beardsley. I’m a Newcastle fan and he was always my favourite player — and he loves cricket. The first time I met him was at Durham. He was throwing his ball to his little lad but I went and shamelessly got his autograph. What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? Probably a fighter pilot, astronaut or a rock star. You’ve got to aim high. Graeme Swann (left) and Alastair Cook celebrate winning the Ashes series in 2009 in the dressing room . Swann's sporting hero is former Newcastle and England player Peter Beardsley . Career highlight? The first time I won the Ashes, at the Oval in 2009. The next two were brilliant and everyone says the victory in Australia was better but for me the first time was amazing. Walking around the ground with Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem playing out, a 150ft St George’s Cross... I get goosebumps thinking about it. ...and the worst moment? We lost 3-0 to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, that was pretty low. Obviously the Ashes last year was not great. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? As long as the family is safe I’d get my cats — Max and Paddy. They’re brother and sister (Maxine is the sister…). Swann celebrates taking the wicket of Michael Hussey in the fifth Test of the 2009 Ashes series . What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given? Don’t listen to what anyone else thinks about you. I can’t remember who told me that. I probably wasn’t listening. Three most-listened to songs on your ipod? Some Might Say by Oasis, Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit and Let it Go from the Frozen soundtrack. It gets played in my car constantly for the kids. Last film you saw? Ghostbusters. They did a 30th anniversary re-release. I bought a ticket for my wife but she looked at me like I was an idiot, so I took my mates. Swann celebrates with Cook during the third Ashes Test in the 2013 series . Last book you read? I really like books about World War Two but I’m a big Tom Clancy fan so probably one of his. Without Remorse is his best. Which three people would you invite for dinner? George Lucas so I could ask him what he was doing with those three Star Wars prequels. Julius Caesar to see if he realised he would be seen as one of the greatest people to walk the planet. And Carmen Electra. I’ve fancied her since I was 15. Favourite pre-match meal? I was very superstitious so if we had a good day in a Test I’d have the same meal I had the night before. In India, Jimmy Anderson, Alastair Cook and I had the same order — two ham and pineapple pizzas, a buttered chicken, three portions of fries, two sticky toffee puddings and a chocolate cake. We were fat as houses but we won the Test. Star Wars director George Lucas is on the list of three people Swann would invite for dinner . In a film of your life, who would you like to play you? Hugh Grant. He’s a good-looking guy. I reckon he’d be handy at cricket too. Tell us a secret... I’m not sure if it’s much of a secret but I’m the singer in a band — Dr Comfort and the Lurid Revelations. We’re not bad!

"India's stand-in test captain Virat Kohli scored 66 and Murali Vijay added 60 as the tourists played out a draw in the two-day match against a Cricket Australia Chairman's XI that concluded on Friday. The match was organized on short notice to give the Indian players some much-needed match practice ahead of the first test against Australia which begins Tuesday at the Adelaide Oval. The four-test series had initially been due to begin in Brisbane this week but had been rescheduled following the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.

"McLaren racing director Eric Boullier declared himself satisfied despite a difficult opening day on Honda's official return to Formula One. After 20 years being powered by Mercedes, the Woking-based marque are now reunited with Honda, rekindling memories of their glory days together in the late 1980s. On the first day of the new partnership at a two-day post-season test in Abu Dhabi, Honda naturally encountered teething problems with their version of the 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units that were used over the past season by rivals Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault. VIDEO Scroll down to watch McLaren-Honda's MP4-29H/1X1 makes its track debut . Stoffel Vandoorne was the first to drive the new Honda powered McLaren at the Abu Dhabi test . McLaren have reunited with Honda but teething problems meant Vandoorne could only complete three laps . Problems with fuel/data exchange meant Honda's first run only lasted three laps before grinding to a halt out on the circuit which brought out a red flag and required the car to be brought back to the pits . 1988: Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna (WC)  199 points, 1st in constructors' championship . 1989: Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost (WC)  141 points, 1st in constructors' championship . 1990: Ayrton Senna (WC) and Gerhard Berger  121 points, 1st in constructors' championship . 1991: Ayrton Senna (WC) and Gerhard Berger  138 points, 1st in constructors' championship . 1992: Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger          99 points, 2nd in constructors' championship . (WC) = world champion . An electronics issue meant the car spent the morning in the garage, and although it broke cover after lunch it managed only three laps in the afternoon. On two occasions there were issues with the fuel/data exchange, the second of which brought out a red flag leaving driver Stoffel Vandoorne stranded on the circuit. But with the two days designed to iron out problems ahead of the first pre-season test of next year in early February in Jerez, Boullier was happy enough. 'Running a modern Formula One car is a very complicated procedure,' said Boullier. 'This week's test is all about how the departments at Sakura, Milton Keynes (Honda's bases in Japan and the UK) and Woking learn to work with the operational hub at the circuit. McLaren and Honda hope to bring back the glory days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when drivers such as Ayrton Senna helped the duo dominate Formula One as a team . McLaren have ended a 20-year partnership with Mercedes which included highlights such as Lewis Hamilton's first championship win in 2008 . 'This test is an opportunity for us to build up that operational strength, to get McLaren and Honda working together under the same roof. 'We encountered a number of issues, including a lengthy check of electrical installations this morning. 'But it's satisfying to see we got the engine fired up, the car out of the garage and some laps on the board in the afternoon. 'We're not chasing laptimes this week, it's about gradually expanding our knowledge. 'Tomorrow will hopefully be all about conducting longer runs as we learn about different parts of the engine, and run through each separate system.'","Honda back in Formula One for first time since 2008 .

Shaun Marsh has been called into Australia's squad for the first Test against India as cover for injured captain Michael Clarke as the team landed in Adelaide. Marsh will join the 12-man squad ahead of the rescheduled first Test, which begins on Tuesday, as captain Clarke remains a doubt through injury. The team attended the funeral of Phillip Hughes in Macksville on Wednesday, and coach Darren Lehmann says there will be no pressure placed on his players to take to the pitch following the tragic death of the 25 year old.

Hughes and Marsh had been the leading candidates to replace Clarke when the captain suffered the latest recurrence of his chronic back and hamstring problem, ruling him out of the first Test as originally scheduled. The delayed start to the series due to Hughes' death had bought Clarke extra time to overcome the injury, but he remains in doubt. Clarke did not fly to Adelaide on Thursday with the rest of the team from Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, near where Hughes' funeral was held. He was also not immediately scheduled to give any media conferences in Adelaide, adding to speculation that he may not play the opening Test. Australian coach Darren Lehmann said there was no pressure on the players to take to the field . Opening batsmen Chris Rogers (left) was with the team as they arrived in Adelaide for the first Test . Some of the Australian players may also withdraw from the Adelaide Test as they continue to recover emotionally from Hughes' death, and Lehmann stressed Thursday that they wouldn't be forced to play. 'We hope the boys can find the inner strength to play the game in the way Phillip would have wanted in Adelaide next week and that they can honor what he had done,' Lehmann wrote in The Australian. 'We want to hold his values close to our heart and that means playing cricket the way he did, with a love of the game and a smile. It's going to be hard and if somebody is struggling Michael and I understand. There is no pressure on them. We will look after them and we will help them get back to the place where they can play.'","Shaun Marsh called up as cover for Michael Clarke .

"Former Texas Rep. and perennial presidential candidate Ron Paul may have let his son's campaign cat out of the bag on Friday, telling longtime TV host Larry King that his son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, is running for the White House in 2016. 'Yes, I think it's great he's doing it,' the elder Paul said on King's show 'PoliticKing,' produced by ORA.tv and broadcast on the RT (Russia Today) network. 'He has a good message and he understand free-market economics and I just think that its doing a world of good. But I also know the power and strength of the establishment and its a tough row to hoe.' But a Rand Paul campaign insider familiar with the politician's decision-making told MailOnline hours later that his father got ahead of himself, saying that 'Senator Paul has not made a decision yet.' Former Texas Congressman Ron Paul (right) told television host Larry King that his son, Senator Rand Paul, has decided to run for president . Ron Paul (right) and his son Rand (left) have captured the imagination of a small but growing segment of the Republican Party that leans toward libertarian values . The father-and-son team, both physicians, aren't the first to both make a bid for the U.S. presidency. George H.W. Bush and his son, George W. Bush, both occupied the White House in the late 20th Century. John Adams and John Quincy Adams were America's second and sixth chief executives. Ron Paul has run for the job three times, in 1988, 2008 and 2012. Two years ago he was the last Republican also-ran standing when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney claimed the nomination to oppose President Barack Obama, claiming delegates in four states. But on Friday his focus was on his son. 'I would never have discouraged him from doing it,' he said. 'Just like I didn't say ""Rand, I really want to see you go to med school and be a doctor."" But I never discourage and was delighted when he did go to med school and become an ophthalmologist.' The younger Dr. Paul has made the political rounds in crucial early primary states, currying favor with members of state nominating committees and pressing the flesh with voters. He is part of a presumed GOP field that includes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Baton pass: Rand Paul supported his father during the hotly contested Iowa caucuses in 2011, but their roles may be reversed in the coming two years .","Ron Paul has run for president three times and says he hasn't pushed his son to take the plunge .

"Former Formula One driver Mark Webber is relieved with just a 'stinking headache' and feeling 'pretty bruised' following his spectacular crash in an endurance race on Sunday. The former Red Bull driver spent the night in a local hospital after his Porsche car collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni on the 14th corner at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo before his car slammed into the safety wall and burst into flames . Remarkably Webber gave fans and track-side medics the thumbs up but remains under observation in a Brazilian hospital after sustaining concussion from the impact. Webber was all smiles on Monday when he had a visit from former F1 driver Rubens Barrichello . The Australian posted on Twitter on Monday night his reaction to the crash after spending the night in hospital .

'The race ended under the safety car after a serious accident between the Porsche of Mark Webber and the AF Corse Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni,' said the FIA statement. 'Both drivers were taken to the circuit's medical centre and, after initial examination, to the local Hospital Bandeirantes for further checks, their condition has been reported as satisfactory.'

"A week after their big fallout in London, Stan Wawrinka teamed up with Roger Federer to help put him within sight of fulfilling his Davis Cup dream. The two of them reformed their irregular doubles partnership to defeat France’s Richard Gasquet and Julien Benneteau 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 and give Switzerland what should prove a decisive 2-1 lead in the final. Federer will  be the first match off against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the reverse singles on Sunday, and if he can win he would seal a first Davis Cup trophy both for his country and himself, placing his name on the one piece of tennis silverware that lacks it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wawrinka and Federer win Davis Cup doubles match . Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka put their recent troubles behind them to see of the French pair on Saturday . The world No 2 teamed up with his countryman just days after their very public fall-out at the O2 Arena . Federer will seal his first Davis Cup trophy if he beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first rubber on Sunday . Six of the last seven finals that have stood 1-1 at the end of the first day have been won by the side that goes on to claim the pivotal doubles point, so recent history is very much on his side. The two Swiss, involved in an unseemly spat at the 02 Arena in the Barclays ATP World Finals after Wawrinka rowed with his compatriot’s wife Mirka, have managed to unite in common cause this week. Federer was named for the doubles an hour before the match, having had no adverse reaction in his back to his heavy beating by Gael Monfils on Friday, his worst ever in this competition. Having looked somewhat immobile at times in that match, he settled comfortably into the less demanding doubles environment and brought his unique set of skills to bear. He and Wawrinka had lost their last four Davis Cup doubles rubbers, belying the fact they won the Olympic gold medal together in 2008. However, the Swiss had little choice but to pair them with little strength in depth. The Swiss pair of Federer and Wawrinka teamed up to devastating effect securing a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory . There was a fantastic atmosphere in Lille for the the third match of the Davis Cup tie . Julien Benneteau and Richard Gasquet were no match for Federer and Wawrinka on Saturday . The French have more options, but Tsonga was reported to have asked to sit the match out, so they went with experienced doubles specialist  Benneteau and the talented but sometimes brittle Gasquet. With Mirka again absent the Swiss broke Benneteau in an otherwise tight first set before another feverish crowd in excess of 27,000 inside the Stade Pierre Mauroy. It was hard to believe its usual football audience provides the same noise levels. In the second set the French forced five break points but Gasquet, returning from the advantage court, could not convert any of them. They paid for it when Federer broke for 6-5 with a glorious backhand return. Federer and Wawrinka in perfect symmetry during the third rubber of the Davis Cup showdown in Lille . With Gasquet, a sporadic doubles player at best, looking increasingly wobbly the superior big match experience of the Swiss was proving a major factor. It was Federer who broke decisively at 2-2 when, with the French crowd now becalmed, he fired a forehand winner right down the middle of the court. Wawrinka intervened decisively at the net as Federer served out the match with a minimum of drama. The world No 2 will be desperate to finish the job himself, and providing his back continues to improve, Tsonga did little against Wawrinka to suggest he will be able to stop him.","Federer and Wawrinka teamed up just one week after O2 Arena spat .

"Stan Wawrinka survived a second-set wobble to beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 and give Switzerland a 1-0 lead over hosts France in the Davis Cup final on Friday. World No 4 Wawrinka was more consistent than French number one Tsonga in front of a record 27,432 crowd at the Pierre Mauroy stadium. It was the first match that Wawrinka had played since his much-publicised spat with Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour Finals after the latter's wife 'heckled' him during last week's semi-final. Stan Wawrinka defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to give Switzerland a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup . Wawrinka beat Tsonga in four sets 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 to give his country victory . France No 1 Tsonga proved more inconsistent throughout the match against Wawrinka . Tsonga is looking to help France win their 10th Davis Cup title and first since 2001 . World No 2 Federer, who missed training early this week due to a back injury, takes on Gael Monfils in the second singles later on Friday. The doubles will be played on Saturday and the reverse singles on Sunday. France, who last triumphed in 2001, are looking to win the Davis Cup for the 10th time while Switzerland are seeking their maiden title. Wawrinka breezed through the opening set, relying on his accurate one-handed backhand to unsettle Tsonga, who had trouble finding his range with his usually booming forehand. The Swiss bagged eight points on his way to a double break, sealing the set when Tsonga sent a forehand long. The match was Wawrinka's first since his much-publicised spat with Roger Federer at ATP World Tour Finals . Wawrinka is hoping to create history for Switzerland this weekend by helping them win their maiden Davis Cup . The France Davis Cup team watches on as Tsonga struggled against Wawrinka . The Frenchman faced a break point in the opening game of the second set but saved it with a smash. Wawrinka then lost his sharpness and served a double fault to hand his opponent a 3-1 lead. Tsonga held serve throughout and clinched the set with a service winner. But he lost the momentum, conceding a break for 4-2 by spraying another forehand wide and Wawrinka sealed the set on his second opportunity with a crosscourt backhand winner. Wawrinka piled on the pressure and a backhand volley earned him a break in the first game of the fourth set, which he firmed up with another break for 5-2 with a backhand winner. The Australian Open champion, who hit 61 winners to Tsonga's 39, wrapped it up on his first match point with a routine volley following yet another charge to the net.

"Stan Wawrinka beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 on opening day of Davis Cup final between Switzerland and France . Roger Federer will decide if he can put his ailing body through one last test this year to try to salvage his Davis Cup dream. The world No 2 was hampered by stiffness in his back while being trounced by a highly charged Gael Monfils as France levelled their final against Switzerland. Yet Federer remained upbeat as he contemplated whether he could play in today’s pivotal doubles rubber alongside Stan Wawrinka, very much his foe in London last week but now his key ally. VIDEO Scroll down to see highlights of Federer's defeat to Monfils . Roger Federer was trounced in straight sets by Gael Monfils on the opening day of the Davis Cup final . Monfils' jumps for joy during a win which levelled the Davis Cup final between Switzerland and France at 1-1 . The Davis Cup is the one blank on Federer's formidable CV, but he was powerless to stop an inspired Monfils . ‘I started to feel better as the match wore on, I’ll make myself available if I can play proper tennis, which I was able to do at the end of the match,’ he said. ‘It just takes a while for it to leave your mind. It’s like a ghost.’ It could require him to play three matches in as many days if he is to win the one prize in tennis that has eluded him. It really was a case of changing places from that fretful night a week ago at the 02 Arena, where Federer edged out his compatriot Wawrinka amid the controversies of the heckling from his wife Mirka, who was nowhere to be seen. French cult hero Monfils produced a stunning performance against Federer in Lille . There was a world record crowd of 27,432 at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, home of Ligue 1 side Lille . Federer look dejected during the match and was unable to stop the unpredictable Frenchman . The defeat comes less than a week after the controversy surrounding Federer and team-mate Stan Wawrinka . Monfils celebrates wildly during the match after winning a point against Federer . Monfils gives a thumbs-up to the crowd in Lille after his surprise straight-sets victory . With his slightly awkward movement to the backhand side Federer looked like he was still paying a price for all the exertion in London, and that only added to the resolve that the unpredictable Monfils drew upon. Playing to a gallery of 27,432 fans, Monfils was gloriously assertive from the start and continually pushed back a subdued Federer, who looked as though he would rather have been anywhere else. Faced with such animalistic aggression and struggling to adapt to the indoor clay court, Federer was unrecognisable from the man who rolled over Andy Murray barely a week ago. Wawrinka defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to give Switzerland a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup . Wawrinka is hoping to create history for Switzerland by helping them win their maiden Davis Cup . France No 1 Tsonga proved more inconsistent throughout the match against Wawrinka . Wawrinka, by contrast, had produced the best response possible to a week when he suffered bitter disappointment and had his fortitude questioned into the bargain. Cry baby? Not on this evidence, as he beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 24 minutes. Thousands of Swiss fans have swollen the head count to the highest in history for an official tennis match and Wawrinka seemed galvanised by the experience. The one period when he slipped was in the second set and, while it may have been coincidence, he dropped three straight games after someone called out ‘Cry baby, cry!’ between his first and second serves in the third game. Tsonga is looking to help France win their 10th Davis Cup title and first since 2001 . The match was Wawrinka's first since his much-publicised spat with Roger Federer at ATP World Tour Finals .","Roger Federer was beaten in straight sets by Gael Monfils 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 .

"Two-time Heineken Cup champions Wasps kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout phase of the European Champions Cup as they beat Top 14 basement side Castres Olympique 32-17. The sides, occupying Pool Two's bottom two slots coming into the game, shared four tries in the first half. Rob Miller and Nathan Hughes crossed for Wasps, while Mathieu Bonello and Remi Lamerat dotted down for the hosts in reply. After the break it was a tense affair, but the Aviva Premiership side pulled away in the final 10 minutes with a penalty try and a Sailosi Tagicakibau touch down after Sitiveni Sivivatu was sent to the sin bin. Tom Varndell skips away from Sitiveni Sivivatu as Wasps pulled off a vital away win at Top 14 side Castres . The win leaves Wasps in third place in Pool 2, but they will now be within striking of distance of whoever loses when Harlequins and Leinster go head to head. Wasps full back Miller opened the scoring after five minutes, finishing off a move started when fly-half Andy Goode intercepted an ill-judged pass. Six minutes later, Castres answered back. Hooker Bonello barged his way over, following a break from the club's summer marquee signing Sivivatu. Two minutes later, Wasps' number eight Hughes brushed aside the last despairing line of Castres' overstretched defence to dive over. Castres' Rory Kockott's penalty from near halfway hit the crossbar in the 17th minute, and his radar was off again five minutes later, as he fired a second effort wide of the uprights. Sailosi Tagicakibau needs help from two team-mates as he brings down Thomas Combezou . Goode, however, made no mistake with a penalty to take the score to 15-7 with 14 minutes of the opening period remaining. But still the first-half scoring was not over. Castres' centre Lamerat thumped the ball down following a catch-and-drive after 33 minutes. Kockott converted to make it 15-14 at the interval. The second period started slowly by comparison. It took 10 minutes for either side to cross the line - and when the hosts did Thomas Combezou's try was ruled out for offside. Three minutes later Kockott had the chance to fire Castres into the lead for the first time - but he mishit his kick and it fell a long way short of the posts. In the early part of the second period neither side could find a way through shored-up defences, as the game turned into a middle-of-the-field battle - though it was Castres who looked the most dangerous and who were enjoying the lion's share of the possession. Sivivatu, who was sin-binned late on for a high tackle, cannot escape the Wasps defence . With another Castres' attack going nowhere, Dan Kirkpatrick was forced into a drop goal attempt but his effort slipped wide. Full back Julien Dumora took over kicking duties for the hosts when Cedric Garcia replaced Kockott in the 64th minute. His first job - three minutes later - was to fire Castres into the lead for the first time from the touchline. He made no mistake. But their lead would last just two minutes. Goode supplied the perfect Wasps' riposte with a penalty  after Castres were penalised at the breakdown. Andy Goode kicked 13 points as Wasps kept their hopes of qualification from Pool Two alive in France . Wasps thought Tom Varndell had finished off a simple yet effective move in the corner with 10 minutes left on the clock, but video replays showed Sivivatu had, somehow, at the last, held up the ball. But the Fijian was then sent to the sin bin for a high tackle - and referee George Clancy awarded a penalty try. There was still time for Tagicakibau to barge his way over for Wasps' fourth try six minutes from time to seal the match.","London Wasps score four tries to beat Top 14's bottom side .

"A parka that Kohl's described as having 'faux fur' trim was found to have real fur from raccoon dogs. The Humane Society issued a consumer warning Tuesday after purchasing the men's R&O Hooded Parka on the retailer's website and conducting a test. 'Kohl’s department store has been telling customers it has its act together when it comes to distinguishing between real and fake fur, but, according to our latest investigation, it’s violating a federal law by selling real raccoon dog fur advertised as “faux,""' Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle wrote in a blog post on the organization's website. False advertising: A parka that Kohl's described as having 'faux fur' trim was found to have real fur from raccoon dogs . PJ Smith, the Humane Society's Corporate Outreach Manager, told USA Today that the coat was sent to a lab that determined with 'a great degree of certainty that it was this particular species.' 'Raccoon dog fur is the species we'd consider the most misrepresented,' Mr Smith added. He noted that the animal, which is indigenous to Asia, is in the same family as the domestic dog, fox and wolf. Kohl's subsequently issued an apology and removed the parka from its website. 'Kohl’s standard vendor terms require that all merchandise must be free of any real animal fur unless expressly authorized in writing by Kohl’s. No such authorization was given here,' the store said in a statement. Origin story: The raccoon dog, indigenous to East Asia, is in the same family as the domestic dog, fox and wolf . 'Once aware that the product was made with real fur, Kohl’s immediately removed the product from our website.The parkas in question were sold online only and were not exclusive to Kohl’s. Kohl’s has never held these items in our inventories, as they are directly shipped from the vendor to customers. Fewer than 100 of these parkas have been purchased through Kohl’s.' Kohl's also said that it would allow returns for customers who bought the parka under the impression that it was made using fake fur. 'We apologize to our customers who would not have otherwise purchased these parkas. Kohl’s will honor returns, no questions asked, for any customers who no longer wish to keep them.' According to the Humane Society's website, raccoon dogs are animals 'who in the wild seem to enjoy having a mate or friend close by.' 'These social animals live in pairs or small groups, and the males are helpful fathers, bringing food to their pregnant mate and helping to raise the young. Raccoon dogs suffer and die for their fur in intensive confinement operations in China and Finland, and their fur has been widely misrepresented as fake fur or as a different species.' This isn't the first time the Humane Society has accused Kohl's of misrepresenting real fur as fake. In December 2013, the organization warned customers that accessories described as having faux fur lining were made with rabbit fur. In a statement to MailOnline, PETA said: 'Companies like Kohl’s have a responsibility to ensure that they are not misleading customers who don’t want to support animals being bludgeoned, electrocuted, or skinned alive for their fur. PETA’s advice is that if there’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux, it’s best just to avoid it altogether.'","The Humane Society sent the coat to a lab that determined with 'a great degree of certainty that it was this particular species'

"Danny Care cried on the phone to his mum the last time his World Cup dream was taken away from him by a freak foot injury sustained in a warm-up match against Wales a week before the 2011 tournament. The tears flowed again the following year when Stuart Lancaster omitted the scrum-half from his first Six Nations squad after a string of alcohol-related offences led to a 16-month driving ban, £10,000 fine and one too many lurid headlines. Danny Care hopes to win an England recall under Stuart Lancaster . For very different reasons, the 27-year-old starts Harlequins European Cup clash with Leinster on Sunday once again on the outside of Lancaster’s match-day squad, after being dropped for England’s final two QBE series matches as the result of indifferent displays against New Zealand and South Africa. But with less than 10 months until the start of England’s World Cup campaign, the 50-cap Quin has no intention of staying out in the cold for long again and facing another tearful call home. ‘I was devastated when I missed out on the last World Cup,’ he said. ‘I’d been in the squad for three years previously with the main goal of wanting to play in a World Cup. Then to have that taken away a week before we were due to leave was incredibly hard to take. Scrum-half Care has no intention of staying out in the cold for long again . ‘I’d got mum and dad their plane tickets as a present. I rang my mum on the Monday after I’d had the scan and said, “I think you’ll be the only ones going”. There were some tears. I was pretty devastated.’ If he thought that phone call was tough, the one he had to make the following season — after two drunken nights that landed him in hot water with Lancaster and the police — was even tougher. ‘The hardest thing was calling my mum and saying, “Sorry mum, I’ve messed up here”,’ he said. ‘My mum and dad were dead upset. It wasn’t just that people were writing stuff about me but it involved my whole family. For my grandad to be picking up the paper and having to read that about his grandson wasn’t nice. ‘I don’t think I had a drink problem but my problem was that, on nights out, I’d just get too excited. I loved being with the lads. Typical rugby lads just going out and having too much of a good time. My mum always said from the day I could walk I was always the one near the trouble. I knew I had to change something. When it started affecting people apart from me, that’s when it really hit home.’ Care was dropped after indifferent displays against New Zealand and South Africa . Three years later, Care is a dad to eight-week old son Blake and an altogether calmer figure, despite suddenly finding himself third in England’s pecking order behind Ben Youngs and Richard Wigglesworth. It was a decision that prompted indignation at Quins, with Nick Evans claiming his half-back partner had been made a ‘scapegoat’ for England’s failings while director of rugby Conor O’Shea was only slightly less vociferous in making clear what he thought of Care’s omission. ‘It’s not a nice feeling to be high as a kite one week, going from playing against the best teams in the world, winning your 50th cap at Twickenham, to being on the bench against Sale at home a week later,’ said Care. ‘It’s hard to take but that is what any professional sportsman has to go through. It’s how you react in adversity and the bad times that makes the good times even better. Care hopes to impress with Harlequins in European clashes . ‘It’s up to me to get that shirt back. I’ve been in this position before and it just fuels the fire. As a professional sportsman you learn to deal with it. You just have to get back on the horse and show people what you can do. ‘A home World Cup is going to be massive and I’m unbelievably determined not to miss out on another big tournament.’ For some of Quins’ England contingent, back-to-back European clashes against Ireland’s strongest province may not appear the perfect antedote to what was a gruelling autumn international series. For Care, the timing could not be better. ‘Stuart said before I left camp that he’d pick whoever was playing the best ahead of the next Six Nations game against Wales in February,’ he said. ‘That’s perfect for me and the other lads. I have two high-profile games to show what I can do and prove people wrong.’ Danny Care is being fitted and measured for a bespoke suit by Savile Row tailor, Stowers of London, for more information visit stowers.london .","Danny Care aims to force his way back into England squad for World Cup .

"Cardiff Blues made it three wins from three in the European Challenge Cup after inflicting a first defeat on London Irish in the battle for Pool One supremacy. Geoff Cross dotted down early on to give Irish the lead but the home side battled back with tries from Richard Smith, Lloyd Williams and Kristian Dacey to claim a 24-14 win at Cardiff Arms Park. Fly-half Gareth Anscombe converted all three scores and also added a penalty as the 2010 champions moved on to 14 points. Cardiff Blues fly half Gareth Anscombe fires over a penalty during his side's 24-14 win over London Irish . London Irish winger Topsy Ojo (left) is tackled by Cardiff Blues prop Adam Jones . Irish, who were awarded a late penalty try during a late charge, remain on 10 points ahead of next weekend's return clash between the two teams at the Madejski Stadium. Cardiff's win came after Welsh rivals Newport Gwent Dragons had earlier brushed aside the challenge of Bucharest Wolves 37-10 in snowy Romania following a second-half onslaught. Bucharest actually led 10-0 after 16 minutes thanks to Sean Morrell's try and five points from Florin Vlaicu's boot, but the Dragons roared back to go into the break 13-10 ahead, before running away with things in the final 40 minutes as they scored 24 unanswered points. Cardiff flanker Josh Turnbull (centre) collides with London Irish lock Sean Cox . Andrew Coombs collected a brace of tries for the Dragons, while James Thomas, Rhys Thomas and Ashley Smith also went over the whitewash, with Rhys Jones kicking 11 points and Jason Tovey adding a penalty. The bonus-point victory leaves Newport second in Pool Three on 11 points, three behind leaders Newcastle.","Cardiff claimed a 24-14 win over London Irish at Cardiff Arms Park .

"Chris Ashton may not be known for his close-quarter work at the breakdown but it was the England wing’s late intervention which kept Saracens’ European hopes alive while simultaneously sinking Sale’s. With the Sharks’ pack battering the visitors’ line following a succession of penalties, Saracens’ season hung in the balance. But with seconds on the clock, and the ball centimetres short of the line, Ashton did his finest impression of Richie McCaw to force his hands over the ball — possibly illegally — and persuade Welsh referee Leighton Hodges to penalise Sale for holding on. Saracens and England winger Chris Ashton (right) is tackled by Sale's Mark Cueto . Saracens' Owen Farrell (centre) was on form for his return to the Saracens line up with a win over Sale Sharks . Jamie George tries to build up some momentum but is stopped in his tracks by Sale's Andrei Ostrikov (left) ‘I thought our defence in our 22 in the last five minutes was pretty heroic,’ said relieved Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘There were a lot of the characteristics I associate with this team which were present all the way through. Our performance wasn’t perfect but we showed a lot of energy. ‘Chris Ashton had a lot of good interventions today. There were several occasions when we had numbers down in defence and he came off his line and timed tackles magnificently. ‘His turnover at the end was pretty special but he had a great game. He doesn’t often get the credit for those kind of things.’ Sharks' Danny Cipriani evades Owen Farrell's clutches but is clipped by a scrambling Maka Vunipola . McCall’s opposite number Steve Diamond, who berated Hodges and his fellow officials after the final whistle, said: ‘We were hammering their line, penalty after penalty. Probably in the Premiership we’d have got a yellow card. ‘Fair play to them. Good defence in the last five minutes won them the game. They’re a good side and they pushed the boundaries of offside quite a lot. There was probably a bit of inexperience from that referee coming out of the Celtic League and not being used to streetwise sides like Saracens.’ The match was billed as a battle of the fly-halves as Sale’s Danny Cipriani took on Owen Farrell, even though the latter lined up at inside-centre, with former Sale stand-off Charlie Hodgson at 10 for Sarries. None of the three will look back on the match with any great fondness, although Farrell scored a try and kicked an important 65th-minute drop goal to pull Saracens four points clear after the hulking Andrei Ostrikov had rumbled over from 15 metres to give Sale hope. Jacques Burger holds onto the ankle of Andrei Ostrikov as his side hold onto a victory at the AJ Bell Stadium . Farrell’s try following a superb Hodgson break — aided by some woeful Sale defence — came after the impressive Magnus Lund had scored the first try of the match before the Saracens No 10 was forced from the field with a shoulder injury six minutes before the break. Cipriani, meanwhile, will be frustrated by some sloppy kicking from hand and occasionally flaky defence. Despite some neat touches from promising young full-back Mike Haley and some thunderous tackling from centre Sam Tuitupou, it was left to Sale’s forwards, with the Russian Ostrikov and Lund to the fore, to take the game to a Saracens side struggling for any rhythm in Europe or domestically. Saracens back row Billy Vunipola tries to hold on to the ball as he collides at speed with Sam Tuitupou . Jamie George keeps up the pressure as he fends off challenges from Cipriani (left) and Mark Jennings . Returning England lock George Kruis enjoyed another impressive afternoon’s work for Saracens, who must now beat Clermont Auvergne away and Munster at home to be confident of qualifying from the competition’s toughest Pool but they will need a much improved performance to stand a chance of progressing. They face Sale, whose interest in the tournament is now over, at Allianz Park next week, when they will again be without centre Brad Barriitt, who is expected to be out of action for four weeks after injuring his calf playing for England against Australia last week. McCall said: ‘Brad pulled his calf in the last game for England. It’s hugely disappointing for us to lose him for four weeks when he comes back with a pretty significant injury like that. But that’s life. We just roll on.’ Mark East is shown no love as he is dragged down by Jacques Burger and Owen Farrell (left)","Saracens winger Chris Ashton won a crucial late penalty for Saracens .
